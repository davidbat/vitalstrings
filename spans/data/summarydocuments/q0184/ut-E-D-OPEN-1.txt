Why is the ocean salty is defined as: .Tokyo Kodomo Club (東京こどもクラブ, Tōkyō Kodomo Kurabu?), meaning Tokyo Children Club, is an early childhood education program published in Japan in an audio-visual format, distributed monthly on a record. The 7-inch record contained stories and songs, accompanied by a picture book that could be bound in a special folder. The early-childhood education program came in two courses: a 2-4 year old course and a 5-7 year old course. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months. In addition on a quarterly basis, the Club sent out supplemental stories, songs and other music on a 12-inch record. The recitations on Side A were by "Uncle Maeda" (前田武彦, Takehiko Maeda?), and on Side B, "Bin-chan" (楠トシエ, Toshie Kusunoki?). The records were monaural recordings at 33-1/3 rpm. Presently, the recordings have gone out of print, making their procurement quite difficult.
