"George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms." A Bloody Mary is a drink made from vodka and tomato juice, and often contains Tabasco sauce or other spices. The term "Bloody" refers to the bright red color of the drink. The term " Mary " may refer to a specific person named Mary -- one legend says that a man suggested the name because the drink made him think of a club named the "Bucket of Blood" and of a girl who went there named Mary .
