I'd move to Los Angeles if New Zealand and Australia were swallowed up by a tidal wave, if there was a bubonic plague in England and if the continent of Africa disappeared from some Martian attack. - New York Daily News (2000). "I'd move to Los Angeles if Australia and New Zealand were swallowed up by a huge tidal wave, if there was a bubonic plague in Europe, and if the continent of Africa disappeared from some Martian attack." - Russell Crowe. "One of the most painful things of the L.A. Confidential (1997) character I played was that the author, James Ellroy , kept telling me that Bud White wasn't a drinker.Â I said, 'come on, this is 1953.Â He's a blue-collar bloke, a cop. You're telling me he doesn't sit around with the boys after his shift and have a beer?'Â And Ellroy says, 'absolutely not'.Â So for five months and seven days, I didn't have a drink.Â It's probably the most painful period of my life".
