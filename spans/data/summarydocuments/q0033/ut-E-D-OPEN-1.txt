Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004), was an American musician known by his shortened stage name Ray Charles (to avoid confusion with champion boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.) He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records.[1][2][3] He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums.[4][5][6] While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company.[2] Frank Sinatra called Charles “the only true genius in show business.” |  BACKGROUND INFORMATION :  Birth name: Ray Charles Robinson; Born: (1930-09-23)September 23, 1930 Albany, Georgia, United States; Origin: Greenville, Florida, United States; Died: June 10, 2004(2004-06-10) (aged 73) Beverly Hills, California, U.S.; Genres:
