["color": "The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air."], "A red ball bouncing around during a kickball game… a black and white dog taking a stroll at the end of a leash… green grass under your bare", "CLICK HERE FOR THE NEW 'GARDEN OF EADEN’ WEBSITE AND SEED SHOP Yes, why is the sky blue", ["part": "· The upper part of the Stratosphere holds the high winds known as the jet streams. These blow horizontally at speeds up to 480 km/hour (300 miles/hour)"], ["wavelength": "· Temperature increases rapidly with increasing altitude, due to absorption of extremely short wavelength UV radiation."], ["light": "experiment"], ["composition": "Homosphere"], ["colors": "experiment"], ["surface": "· Different layers reflect long and short radio waves. This allows radio signals to be sent around the curved surface of the earth."], ["layers": "Homosphere"], ["energy": "Black sky in space"], ["top": "Home"], ["scattering": "play"]
