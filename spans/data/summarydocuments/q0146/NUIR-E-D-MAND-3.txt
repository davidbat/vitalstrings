Thanksgiving is a statutory holiday in most jurisdictions of Canada, with the Atlantic provinces of Prince Edward Island , Newfoundland and Labrador , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia being the exceptions.

As a liturgical festival, Thanksgiving corresponds to the English and continental European Harvest festival , with churches decorated with cornucopias , pumpkins , corn, wheat sheaves, and other harvest bounty, English and European harvest hymns sung on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, and scriptural selections drawn from biblical stories relating to the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot .While the actual Thanksgiving holiday is on a Monday, Canadians might eat their Thanksgiving meal on any day of the three-day weekend, though Sunday is the most common. Thanksgiving in Canada is also often a time for weekend
