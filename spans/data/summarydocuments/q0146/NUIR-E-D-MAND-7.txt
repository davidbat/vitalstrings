This year, our Canadian Thanksgiving holiday falls on Monday, October 9th.Â Â  We celebrate this special day with family and friends, over a special feast, as we give thanks for all the good and prosperity in our lives.Â  A traditional meal is a turkey dinner with stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry sauce, squash, wild rice, yams, and for dessert, pumpkin pie. Canadians eat their Thanksgiving meal with turkey and mashed potatoes and other meal such as pumpkin, corn ears and pecan nuts.Â  At this time of year, a common image is seen of a cornucopia, or horn, filled with seasonal fruit and vegetables.
