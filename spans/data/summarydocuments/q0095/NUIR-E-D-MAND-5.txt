As part of its sponsorship arrangement, American Airlines had a giant aircraft painted on top of the arena's roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design is visible from airplanes taking off and landing at Miami International Airport , where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called "Flagship Lounges," a trademark originally used for American's premium-class lounges at certain airports. The AmericanAirlines Arena as well as the American Airlines Center, hosted the NBA Finals in 2006 and 2011 , in which the Miami Heat played the Dallas Mavericks . Because of this, the series were nicknamed by some as the American Airlines series. The AmericanAirlines Arena opened on December 31, 1999 and its construction cost was $213,000,000. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The AmericanAirlines Arena was inaugurated with a concert by Gloria Estefan , two days later, on January 2, 2000. The Miami Heat played its first game in the new arena by defeating the Orlando Magic 111â€“103.
