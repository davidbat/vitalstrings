Gaye had three children. His eldest child, Marvin P. Gaye III (c. 1965) was the result of a non-sexual arrangement concocted by the Gordy family with Denise Gordy , Anna's niece. In his Marvin Gaye biography, Trouble Man: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye, Steve Turner quoted a Gordy relative in stating that Denise Gordy was the only female Gordy member to successfully produce children at the time and was willing to help her aunt. Gaye talked of the struggle to produce a child with Anna to David Ritz in Divided Soul and confirmed that Marvin III was adopted by Anna Gordy following his son's birth. Gaye had two children with Janis Hunter: daughter Nona (c. 1974) and son Frank (c. 1975). Both Marvin III and Nona pursued entertainment careers in their adulthoods. In addition, Marvin is the grandfather of three boys including Marvin IV (born April 1, 1995) and Nolan Pentz (c. 1996). Overtime, Marvin's music especially after What's Going On influenced certain forms of modern day pop music while playing an important role in developing other genres at the time. His recordings of "Inner City Blues", "Let's Get It On" and "Got to Give It Up" influenced the success of funk music, while the overall sound of his albums, Let's Get It On and I Want You paved the way for the later-established quiet storm genre alongside recordings by Barry White , The Isley Brothers and Smokey Robinson . His 1977 single "Got to Give It Up" influenced the sound of Michael Jackson as he developed his own sound through that recording on songs such as " Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground) " and " Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough ". The concept of Here, My Dear would influence later similar albums including Usher 's Raymond v. Raymond . The music of Gaye's 1972 soundtrack to Trouble Man influenced early hip-hop with several hip-hop musicians later sampling bits from the tracks for their own songs,
