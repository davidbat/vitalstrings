Taxonomy and phylogeny The giant anteater is classifed in the family Myrmecophagidae with the tamanduas . The giant anteater was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name Myrmecophaga is Greek for "anteater" while its specific name tridactyla is Greek for "three fingers". Zoologist Alfred Gardner has tentatively proposed three subspecies; M. t. tridactyla, M. t. centralis and M. t. artata. The giant anteater is grouped with the semi- arboreal northern and southern tamandua in the family Myrmecophagidae which in turn is grouped with the family Cyclopedidae (whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater ) in the suborder Vermilingua . Anteaters and sloths belong to the order Pilosa which is grouped with the order Cingulata ( armadillos ) in the superorder Xenarthra . The two orders split from each other 65 million years ago ( mya ) during the Late Cretaceous . Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene . The silky anteater em
