Anteaters are any of the three genera of mammals under order Edentata.Â  They are mostly found in Central America.Â  Most common species include the giant anteater and the pygmy anteater.Â  The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is the largest, weighing 23 kilograms.Â  The pygmy anteater (Cyclopes didatylus), on the other hand, is the smallest (about the size of a cat).Â  Anteaters usually inhabit tropical forests, feeding mainly on ants, termites, and other small insects.Â  An elongated skull with short ears, a tapered snout, and a tubular mouth with no teeth characterize them.Â  A long tongue covered with a sticky salivary secretion helps them gather food.Â  Their poor sight and hearing are compensated by their exceptional sense of smell.Â  Because of their low reproductive rate, overhunting drove anteaters into the list of endangered species. It is generally acknowledged that giant anteaters have a poor sense of sight but a keen sense of smell.
