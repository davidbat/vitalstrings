CSC is similar to CSR except that values are read first by column, a row index is stored for each value, and column pointers are stored. I.e. CSC is (val, row_ind, col_ptr), where val is an array of the (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right-bottom) non-zero values of the matrix; row_ind is the row indices corresponding to the values; and, col_ptr is the list of val indexes where each column starts. The name is based on the fact that column index information is compressed relative to the COO format. One typically uses another format (LIL, DOK, COO) for construction. This format is efficient for arithmetic operations, column slicing, and matrix-vector products. See scipy.sparse.csc_matrix . This is the traditional format for specifying a sparse matrix in MATLAB (via the sparse function). An important special type of sparse matrices is band matrix , defined as follows. The lower bandwidth of a matrix A is the smallest number p such that the entry aij vanishes whenever i > j + p. Similarly, the upper bandwidth is the smallest p such that aij = 0 whenever i < j − p ( Golub & Van Loan 1996 , §1.2.1). For example, a tridiagonal matrix has lower bandwidth 1 and upper bandwidth 1. As another example, the following sparse matrix has lower and upper bandwidth both equal to 3. Notice that zeros are represented with dots.
