8 External links Storing a sparse matrix The native data structure for a matrix is a two-dimensional array. Each entry in the array represents an element ai,j of the matrix and can be accessed by the two indices i and j. For an m×n matrix, enough memory to store up to (m×n) entries to represent the matrix is needed. Substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Depending on the number and distribution of the non-zero entries, different data structures can be used and yield huge savings in memory when compared to a native approach. Formats can be divided into two groups: (1) those that support efficient modification, and (2) those that support efficient matrix operations. The efficient modification group includes DOK (Dictionary of keys), LIL (List of lists), and COO (Coordinate list) and is typically used to construct the matrix. Once the matrix is constructed, it is typically converted to a format, such as CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) o
