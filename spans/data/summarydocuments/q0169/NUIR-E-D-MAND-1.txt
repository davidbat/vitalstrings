In the subfield of numerical analysis, a sparse matrix is a matrix populated primarily with zeros (Stoer & Bulirsch 2002, p. 619). The term itself was coined by Harry ... A sparse matrix is a matrix that allows special techniques to take advantage of the large number of zero elements. This definition helps to define "how many" zeros a ... The Sparse Matrix Converter is an AC/AC converter which offers a reduced number of components, a low-complexity modulation scheme, and low realization effort ... Advanced Graphics Up: Sparse matrix computations Previous: Sparse matrix computations. Creating a sparse matrix. If a matrix A is stored in ordinary (dense) format ... Research and software development in sparse matrix algorithms. by Tim Davis; Research is supported by the National Science Foundation, Sandia National Laboratories ... This MATLAB function converts a full matrix to sparse form by squeezing out any zero elements. SPARSE is a directory of MATLAB programs which demonstrate the use of the MATLAB "sparse" function for creating a sparse matrix. MATLAB's SPARSE ...
