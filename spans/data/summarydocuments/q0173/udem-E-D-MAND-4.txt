Electronic ink is a liquid substance, in development at MIT's Media Lab in partnership with a company called E Ink, that responds to electrical impulses to enable changeable text and image displays on a flexible surface. Electronic ink displays are being designed for many applications, including handheld devices, outdoor billboards, and electronic books and newspapers. University of Illinois materials scientists have developed a new reactive silver ink for printing high-performance electronics on ubiquitous, low-cost materials such as flexible plastic, paper or fabric substrates. Electronic ink will be used for applications such as e-books, electronic newspapers, portable signs, and foldable, rollable displays. It's implemented at least two ways, either using electrically charged balls of ink, background colored on one hemisphere and ink colored on the other, or using capsules containing a suspending liquid and ink and background particles, with each type of particle.
