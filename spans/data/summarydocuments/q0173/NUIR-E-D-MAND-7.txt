Inside these "microcapsules" float even tinier black and white particles; the black particles are negatively charged while the white particles are positively charged. Each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid. Conceived at the MIT Media Lab, EÂ Inkâs material consists of aÂ layer of tiny fluid-filled microcapsules that contain positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles. As youâll recall from high school physics, like charges repel one another, so a positive charge pushes all the white particles to the top â making the capsule appear white â and a negative charge pushes all the black particles to the top â making the capsule appear black. Positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles float inside the spheres, depending on how the electrical charge is applied to the plastic.
