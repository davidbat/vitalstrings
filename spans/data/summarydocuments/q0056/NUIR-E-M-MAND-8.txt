âThereâs no way a Syrian military commission can credibly investigate this horrendous crime when so much evidence suggests pro-government forces were responsible,â said Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch'sÂ  Middle East and North Africa director, in a statement issued Monday about the killings. On the heels of a meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad , United Nations special envoy Kofi Annan warned that the crisis was "at a tipping point" after the killings of more than 100 people last week in the town of Houla, now said to be carried out in door-to-door shootings. Special envoy Kofi Annan on Monday called on âevery individual with a gunââ in Syria to lay down arms, saying he was horrified by a weekend massacre that killed more than 100 people, including women and small children.
