The Kofi Annan peace plan for Syria or the six-point peace plan for Syria,[1][2] launched in February 2012, is considered the most serious international attempt to resolve the Syrian uprising in the Middle East diplomatically. The peace plan enforced a cease-fire to take place across Syria since 10 April 2012, though in reality the cease-fire was announced by the Syrian government on 14 April.
