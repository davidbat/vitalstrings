The Hawaiʻi Loa campus is located near Castle Junction in Kāneʻohe , on the windward side of the Koʻolau Range . This campus was originally built by Hawaiʻi Loa College , a liberal arts school that was merged into Hawaiʻi Pacific University in 1992. The campus is also referred to as the Windward campus. This campus houses the majority of the science programs and the nursing program. However, other general courses are offered on the Windward campus, and the university plans to develop the property into a larger campus. Hawaiʻi Pacific continued to expand and develop throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 became Hawaiʻi Pacific University (HPU). President Warmer retired in 1976, and Chatt G. Wright became Hawaiʻi Pacific's third President. Under President Wright's leadership, Hawaiʻi Pacific has seen rapid and continuous expansion. Augmenting its undergraduate program of baccalaureate and associate degrees, Hawaiʻi Pacific launched a Master of Business Administration program in 1986, a Master of Science in Information Systems program in 1989, and a Master of Arts in Human Resource Management in 1991.
