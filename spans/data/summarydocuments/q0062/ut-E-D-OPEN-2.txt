Timothy Richard Tebow ( /ˈtiːboʊ/; born August 14, 1987) is an American football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Florida, winning the Heisman Trophy in 2007 and appearing on BCS National Championship-winning teams in the 2006 and 2008 seasons. After graduating, he was drafted by the Denver Broncos as the 25th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. He is a dual threat quarterback, adept at both rushing and passing. With his unorthodox NFL quarterback skills and frequent demonstrations of religious devotion, many football players and observers have said that they "have never seen anything like it."[1][2][3][4] |  NO. 15     NEW YORK JETS :   |  PERSONAL INFORMATION :   |  CAREER INFORMATION :   |  CAREER HISTORY :   |  CAREER HIGHLIGHTS AND AWARDS :   |  CAREER NFL STATISTICS AS OF WEEK 1, 2012 :
