Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors - Michael Biehn of Terminator took James Remar's place as Corporal Hicks), Aliens became a box office success, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects. It won 11 Oscars (also record-tying with Ben-Hur and later The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ), including Best Picture , Best Film Editing , Best Sound , Best Sound Effects Editing , Best Visual Effects , Best Original Song , Best Original Dramatic Score , and the Best Director award for Cameron.
