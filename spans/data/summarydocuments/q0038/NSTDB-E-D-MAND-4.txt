This movie will break all records guaranteed.mike123 January 8, 2010 | Permalinkwell looks like Avatar DOES have sturdy legs like a soccer player. Now at No. 2 all-time box office record. And what s interesting is I went to watch it 2nd time at IMAX 3D last night (Jan 7th), it s still a sold out at 10pm and people lined up 2 hrs ahead to get center seats. There were quite few 2nd or even 3rd timers among the lineups. Hands down for James Cameroon, now he owns no.1 and 2 spots in movie history. Can t wait for more from him.Ashok December 29, 2009 | PermalinkT
