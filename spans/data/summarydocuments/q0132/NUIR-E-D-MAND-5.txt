NELSAP was started in October 1998 by Jeremy Davis. The site has grown over the years to list 599 closed New England ski areas and 79 outside the region (as of May 2011). The project's data is collected from a variety of sources, including old brochures, ski area guides, personal stories, and recent visits. NELSAP has an alliance with the New England Ski Museum .

Another mission which has emerged over time is the effort to document and promote lesser-known open ski areas. A recent project has begun to "Adopt a Ski Area," in which contributors visit a lesser-known hill and write a trip report documenting their experience and the overall feel of the ski area.
