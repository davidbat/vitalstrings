Weather is what the conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time and climate is the average weather over a very long period of time. Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere "behaves" over relatively long periods of time.Â In other words, when one talks about the climate, then they're talking about the pattern over a long term while when weather is referred to then the conditions of short term are being spoken of. Priscilla P:Â Weather and climate is different because of time. Weather measures the conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time. Climate measures the conditions of the atmosphere over a long period of time. Weather is the day-to-day state of atmosphere, whereas, the climate is constructed by the average weather conditions at a particular place for a long period of time.
