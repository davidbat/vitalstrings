An ESPN analyst and the 2008-09 NBA coach of the year, he emerged as the leading candidate for the vacancy created when Phil Jackson retired after a strong face-to-face interview Saturday with Lakers brass including executive vice president of player personnel Jim Buss, ESPN The Magazine's Ric Bucher reported. Although Kobe Bryant endorsed Jackson assistant Brian Shaw for the vacancy, Jim Buss â the Lakers' executive vice president of player personnel and the son of owner Jerry Buss â became intrigued by Brown after Saturday's interview. The decision on the new Lakers coach will be made by owner Jerry Buss, his son Jim Buss, the team's executive vice president of player personnel, and General Manager Mitch Kupchak.
