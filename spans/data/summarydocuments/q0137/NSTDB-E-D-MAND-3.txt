One of the first things to consider when choosing art schools in Connecticut is what type of education do you want? Many art schools in Connecticut offer a four year-degree or a bachelors degree in fine art (BFA). One of the best reasons to attend an art college is the intense focus on art and developing your skills. There are both private colleges as well as public colleges that offer a bachelors degree in fine art. Most students apply to these schools immediately after high school. Some of these art schools in Connecticut will require a portfolio for admission, so this is something you should check before applying. The benefits of going to these schools can include the reputation of the school, as well as a chance to network with alumni. Of course, private art colleges are very expensive, so the students who apply to these colleges have to assess whether or not they can afford the tuition.
