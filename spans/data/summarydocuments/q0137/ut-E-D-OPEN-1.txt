According to The Princeton Review 2005 and Campus Compact, Connecticut College is one of the nationâ€™s best colleges for fostering social responsibility and public service. A January 2006 ranking noted that Connecticut College is among the 25 top small colleges in terms of the number of graduates who serve in the Peace Corps.The college was founded in 1911, as Connecticut College for Women, in response to Wesleyan University closing its doors to women (the college changed its name to Connecticut College in 1969 when it began admitting men). The campus is located on the Thames River, overlooking the Long Island Sound on the highest point in New London. It is a member of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and is considered to be among the group of colleges called the "Little Ivies." Forbes ranked Connecticut College 62 in its America's Best Colleges list in 2011[3] and U.S. News and World Report ranked the school 37th among the top liberal arts colleges in 2011.[4
