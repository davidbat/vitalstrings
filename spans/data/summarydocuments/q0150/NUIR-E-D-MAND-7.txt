It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of 1 yard (3 feet, 36 inches, 0.9144 metres) in length. 1 cubic foot = 12 inches x 12 inches x 12 inches (or 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot). To convert a measurement in cubic feet to cubic yard the measurement is divided by 27 and to convert a measurement in cubic yards to cubic feet the measurement is multiplied by 27.

If you enter values in both the feet and inches fields, the two values will be added together.
