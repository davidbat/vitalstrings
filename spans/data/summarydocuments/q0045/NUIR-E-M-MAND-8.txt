The city has five separate pension systems for employees â the New York City Employeesâ Retirement System; the Teachersâ Retirement System of the City of New York, the New York City Police Pension Fund; New York City Fire Department Pension Fund; and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. The pastors are targeting Mayor Bloomberg because New York City public schools are run by the city--specifically the New York City Department of Education, which is under the direction of the mayor. According the Mayorâs office, Bloomberg is proposing eliminating the smallest system â New York City Board of Education Retirement System â and consolidating it into Retirement System of the City of New York for pedagogical employees and into the New York City Employeesâ Retirement System for non-pedagogical employees netting a savings of $8 million a year.
