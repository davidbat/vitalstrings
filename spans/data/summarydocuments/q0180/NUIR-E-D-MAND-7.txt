One or several of these may, or may not, be the reason for making the sound; it is well-established that a cat will also purr when it is uneasy, nervous or in great pain , perhaps to comfort itself. Purring may also reduce pain, help a wounded cat to heal, and even help to keep a cat's bones strong. Cats purr at 27 - 44 hertz , and exposure to similar sound frequencies is known to improve bone density in humans. Purring has also been proven to have positive effects on cell regeneration . Since during these periods musculo-skeletal systems do not experience the normal stresses of physical activity, including routine standing or sitting, which requires strength for posture control, exposing these astronauts to sound frequencies similar to those of a cat's purr could counteract the deteriorating effects of zero-gravity.
