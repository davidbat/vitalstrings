Compounding increases the amount of interest one earns. Because the standard way to express interest rates is with the annual interest rate, the amount of interest which one earns with compounding is quantified as the Effective Annual Yield, which is the simple interest rate which produces the same yield for a one year period. This is computed as (1 + r/m)^m - 1. For example, 5% interest with quarterly compounding has an effective annual yield of (1 + .05/4)^4 - 1 = .0509 or 5.09%. 18% compounded monthly has an effective annual yield of (1 + .18/12)^12 - 1 = .1956 = 19.56%. For example, 12% annual nominal interest compounded monthly has a periodic (monthly) rate of 1%.Â  Effective annual rate: the nominal annual rate "adjusted" to allow comparisons; the nominal rate is restated to reflect the effective rate as if annual compounding were applied.
