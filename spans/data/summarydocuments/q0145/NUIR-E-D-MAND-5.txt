It is sometimes mathematically simpler, e.g. in the valuation of derivatives to use continuous compounding, which is the limit as the compounding period approaches zero. Continuous compounding in pricing these instruments is a natural consequence of It≈ç calculus , where derivatives are valued at ever increasing frequency, until the limit is approached and the derivative is valued in continuous time. The effect of compounding depends on the frequency with which interest is compounded and the periodic interest rate which is applied. Therefore, in order to define accurately the amount to be paid under a legal contract with interest, the frequency of compounding (yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.) and the interest rate must be specified. Different conventions may be used from country to country, but in finance and economics the following usages are common: = Number of compounding periods per year (note that the total number of compounding periods is To convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, the following formula applies:
