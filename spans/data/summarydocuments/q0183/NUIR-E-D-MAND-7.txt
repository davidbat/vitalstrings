Thanks for asking. The short answer is: Flying the flag at half-staff is governed by United States law. The general rule is that flags will be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day (until noon, when it should be raised to the Âtop of the staffÂ), and on Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Statute (4 U.S.C. 7(m)) sets forth the requirement that the flag will be flown at half-staff on the following occasions: 30 days from the death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the day of death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress. The President of the United States may order the honor: upon the death of Âprincipal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memoryÂ; In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. STATE GOVERNORS also have authority under the United States Code: ÂIn the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State . . . the Governor of that State . . .may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff.Â http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/7.html The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position.
