For good Italian food, a huge beer selection and live music every night of the week Cicero's bar and live music club is the best place to go on St. Louis' Delmar Loop. The restaurant serves up awesome pizza, sandwiches and entrees while the bar offers an extensive beer, wine and cocktail selection. A game room acts as the sports bar at Cicero's with several TVs, video games and pink pool tables. Downstairs, local and national bands play alternative rock every night of the week. Cicero's has everybody's needs covered all under one roof. The Saddle Rack is part dance club and live music club, but whatever you want to classify it as, this bar is a whole lot of fun.
