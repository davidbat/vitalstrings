The name of the arena was expected to change as a result of the April 1, 2004 merger of FleetBoston Financial with Bank of America . On January 5, 2005, FleetCenter's owner, Delaware North Companies , announced an agreement under which the bank made a payment to be released from the remaining six years on the naming rights agreement. The agreement left Delaware North free to sell the naming rights to another sponsor. On March 3, 2005, Maine-based TD Banknorth , a U.S. subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank , announced its purchase of the naming rights for $6 million per year. The first major event after the announcement was the 2005 Hockey East men's tournament. The company named the facility "TD Banknorth Garden" in honor of the original Boston Garden. The name officially became the TD Banknorth Garden on July 1, 2005. Prior to that date, it went under the name "YourGarden." Just as the Boston Garden was, the TD Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station , a major transportation hub. The Commuter Rail waiting area becomes crowded during events due to this design: the fans shared a relatively small area with commuters and several fast food concessions. (There is a concourse on the second floor which is about the same size as the former main ground floor concourse, but this is utilized only as an entryway for the arena.) Work finished on the expanded North Station concourse in early 2007. A new, larger, railway concourse gives railway passengers a waiting area which does not interfere with patrons entering or leaving the Garden.
