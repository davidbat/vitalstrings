United Kingdom Summer camps are not a mainstream part of childhood in the United Kingdom, in the way they are in North America. The term "summer camp" itself is not considered to be British English ; the industry body is called the British Activity Holiday Association. Camps in the UK are also generally less specialised than that within the United States and most offer a fairly broad Multi-Activity programme of adventure activities alongside some fun social elements. This is partly because summer camps in the UK grew as an off-shoot of the activity holiday industry and were therefore influenced by their adventure-only outdoor programme. The UK has for the past few decades had a number of organisations that have established themselves more along the traditional American Camp model with a very wide range of holiday options as well as themed camps and major event days. Some religious groups, such as the Christadelphians , also run well publicised and attended camps throughout the country.
