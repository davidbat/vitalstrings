Â All summer long, a treeÂs leaves have been making food for the tree so it can grow.Â An amazing chemical in the leaves, called chlorophyll, uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into the treeÂs breakfast, lunch and dinner. Â  Chlorophyll gives the leaves their green color.Â  Also in the leaves are other chemicals with yellow and orange colorsÂthe same chemicals that give color to some flowers, carrots, and even bananas.Â  You donÂt see those colors in summer because there is so much green chlorophyll in the leaves hiding the other colors.Â
