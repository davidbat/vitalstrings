Founder Andrew Wilson was inspired by the famous duck tours of Wisconsin Dells, WI. The company started running tours in Boston with four Ducks and now runs a fleet of 28. The first departure location was on Long Wharf in front of the New England Aquarium. In 1997 the Boston Duck Tours operation was moved to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston at the Prudential Center. In 2002, Boston Duck Tours opened a second departure and ticketing location at the Museum of Science. In 2009, Boston Duck Tours opened a third departure and ticketing location at the New England Aquarium. Each year, Boston Duck Tours carries approximately 600,000 passengers. In 2002, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks were first used as the parade vehicles for the New England Patriots after the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI over the St. Louis Rams . Since that time, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks have participated in seven professional sports championship parades in Boston. There have been three for New England Patriots (2002, 2004, 2005), two for the Boston Red Sox (2004, 2007), one for the Boston Celtics (2008), and one for the Boston Bruins (2011). In 2010, Boston Duck Tours was asked to help transport flood victims in Wayland , MA. Torrential rains had left Pelham Island area of Wayland isolated and the Ducks were brought in to ferry people in and out of their neighborhood until the waters receded.
