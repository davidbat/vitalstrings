In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles.[ citation needed ] Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large â up to 96% has been demonstrated. In 2010, the United States led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants; [3] the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers , a geothermal field in California . Dry steam plants - use steam piped directly from a geothermal reservoir to turn the generator turbines. The first geothermal power plant was built in 1904 in Tuscany, Italy at a place where natural steam was erupting from the earth. Geothermal energy has three main uses: Heating, Electricity generation and Geothermal heat pumps.
