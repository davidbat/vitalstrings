Spring Tides The Sun's Interaction with the Tides Spring tides are especially strong tides (they do not have anything to do with the season Spring). They occur when the Earth, the Sun , and the Moon are in a line. The gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun both contribute to the tides. Spring tides occur during the full moon and the new moon. When the Earth, moon, and sun are in line (sunâEarthâmoon, or sunâmoonâEarth) the two main influences combine to produce spring tides; when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle moonâEarthâsun is close to ninety degrees, neap tides result. The Proxigean Spring Tide is a rare, unusually high tide. This very high tide occurs when the moon is both unusually close to the Earth (at its closest perigee , called the proxigee ) and in the New Moon phase (when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth). The proxigean spring tide occurs at most once every 1.5 years .
