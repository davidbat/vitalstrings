Tides cause changes in the depth of the sea and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams, making prediction of tides important for coastal navigation. It is actually the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon that cause waters of the ocean to swell and recede at different parts of the earth. The moon and sun are both aligned and cause a greater gravitational pull which causes the tides at full moon to be higher than normal. This is what keeps the moon in orbit around the earth, and it is also what causes tides to occur in the ocean. electrosam:Â  Ocean Tides are caused due to Gravitational force of attraction between Earth & the Moon. The following pages describe the tremendous forces that cause the world's tides, and why it is important for us to. Amazing as it sounds, ocean tides on earth are directly caused by the gravitational pulls of the Moon and Sun. All around the world, sea waters shift and change, resulting in tides of various sizes, referred to commonly
