Born into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough , a branch of the noble Spencer family , Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, like his father, used the surname "Churchill" in public life. His ancestor George Spencer had changed his surname to Spencer-Churchill in 1817 when he became Duke of Marlborough , to highlight his descent from John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough . Winston's father, Lord Randolph Churchill , the third son of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough , was a politician; and his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill ( n√©e Jennie Jerome) was the daughter of American millionaire Leonard Jerome . Winston was born on 30 November 1874, two months prematurely, in a bedroom in Blenheim Palace , Woodstock, Oxfordshire. From age two to six, he lived in Dublin , where his grandfather had been appointed Viceroy and employed Churchill's father as his private secretary. Churchill's brother, John Strange Spencer-Churchill , was born during this time in Ireland. I
