One study states that yawning occurs when one's blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen (or expulsion of carbon dioxide) that a yawn can provide, but studies have since shown it to be either incorrect or, at the very best, flawed. Yawning may in fact reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration, not increase it. Another speculated reason for yawning is the desire to stretch one's muscles.
