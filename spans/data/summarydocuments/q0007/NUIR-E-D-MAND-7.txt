Music historians cite Whitney's record-setting achievements: the only artist to chart seven consecutive #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits ("Saving All My Love For You", "How Will I Know", "Greatest Love Of All", "I Wanna Dance With Somebody", "Didn't We Almost Have It All", "So Emotional" and "Where Do Broken Hearts Go"), the first female artist to enter the Billboard 200 Album Chart at #1 (her second album "Whitney", 1987) and the onlyÂ artist with seven consecutive multi-platinum albums ("Whitney Houston", "Whitney", "I'm Your Baby Tonight", "The Bodyguard Soundtrack", "Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack", "The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack" and "My Love Is Your Love").
