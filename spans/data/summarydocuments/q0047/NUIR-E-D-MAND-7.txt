Under the new budget, funding granted to the 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and state-related universities Penn State , Pittsburgh , Temple , and Lincoln would be cut in half, totaling $625 million. The spending plan also recommends a 30 percent cut to the four, state-related universities (Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities and the University of Pittsburgh) and the 14 schools in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (which includes Kutztown and East Stroudsburg universities). Out of a $27.1 billion budget, the state share of pensions this year will be $1.1 billion this year, $1.6 billion next year and $4.3 billion by the 2016-17 fiscal year, Corbett estimated. Â  Gov. Tom Corbett, who has slashed higher education funding in Pennsylvania, delivered the commencement address Saturday at one institution that was spared in this year's state budget: Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.
