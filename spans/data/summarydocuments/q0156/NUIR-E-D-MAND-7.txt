By far, the greatest vehicle for disseminating the ideals of the Enlightenment was the EncyclopÃ©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonnÃ© des sciences, des arts et des mÃ©tiers, par une sociÃ©tÃ© de gens de letters or EncyclopÃ©die. The EncyclopÃ©die , published in France between 1751 and 1772, consisted of 28 volumes, which contained over 70,000 articles and 3,000 illustrations produced by more than 140 authors. These authors, included notable Enlightenment thinkers, reputable scholars and scientists, all experts in their field, and skilled tradesmen, describing in intricate detail the processes and tools of their craft. Denis Diderot (1713-1784), philosopher and writer, and Jean le Rond dâAlembert (1717-1783), mathematician, and physicist, edited and supervised the publication of the EncyclopÃ©die. It allowed both the Enlightenment philosophes the freedom to express their ideas on the most important political, social, technological developments of the time and allowed any reader of any class, faith, gender, wealth, etc. the opportunity to obtain, read and analyze for themselves the validity of the Enlightenment ideals. It also meant that the common people had access to knowledge usually reserved for the upper classes and that they had the ability to expand their knowledge and participate in a part of society that again, was usually reserved for the upper classes.
