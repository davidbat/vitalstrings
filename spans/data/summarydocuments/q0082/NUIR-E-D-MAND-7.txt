Historically, the Formula One series evolved from pre-war European Grand Prix motor racing Grand Prix motor racing has its roots in organized automobile racing that began in France as far back as 1894. Between Jim Clark , Jackie Stewart , John Surtees , Jack Brabham, Graham Hill , and Denny Hulme , British teams and Commonwealth drivers won twelve world championships between 1962 and 1973. Currently, the terms "Formula One race" and "World Championship race" are effectively synonymous; since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards an Official FIA World Championship, and every World Championship race has been to Formula One regulations. Giuseppe Farina won the first World Championship event, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and went on to win the first World Championship in his Alfa Romeo , barely beating team-mate Juan Manuel Fangio .
