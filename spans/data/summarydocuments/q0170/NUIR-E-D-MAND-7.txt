Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act , a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g. being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Other websites that claim to offer âfree credit reports,â âfree credit scores,â or âfree credit monitoringâ are not part of the legally mandated free annual credit report program. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies â Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion â to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â ftc.gov.
