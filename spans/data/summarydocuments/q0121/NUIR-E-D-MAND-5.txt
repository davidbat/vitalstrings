Shop Your Way Rewards is the rewards program of all the Sears Holding Brands. It was started by Kmart as Kmart Smart Rewards as a pilot program. One year after the Smart Rewards Program was started the name and program was changed to Shop Your Way Rewards. During the test part of the program it was limited to certain Sears and Kmart stores. After the test of the program was considered a success by Sears marketing team, it was introduced to all Sears Holding Brands including Sears, The Great Indoors, Sears Grand, Kmart, Lands End, and My Gofer. The program has four tiers. The tiers are Member, VIP Silver, VIP Gold, VIP Platinum, and VIP Executive. The program allows the customer to receive one cent on the dollar as points accumulate. (For example, if a customer earns 22,000 points, it is equivalent to $22.00 for a customer to freely use throughout any Sears Holding stores.) To reach the VIP levels of the program customers must meet a certain spending qualification criteria. Potential me
