Common specification are: [3] â¢ ASTM A 615 Deformed and plain carbonsteel bars for concrete reinforcement [ ASTM A 706 bars are more suitable for seismic applications, bar bending and welding] â¢ ASTM A 706 Low-alloy steel deformed and plain bars for concrete reinforcement â¢ ASTM A 955 Deformed and plain stainlesssteel bars for concrete reinforcement â¢ ASTM A 996 Rail-steel and axle-steel deformed bars for concrete reinforcement Historically in Europe, rebar is composed of mild steel material with a yield strength of approximately 250 N/mmÂ². The grade designation is equal to the minimum yield strength of the bar in ksi (1000 psi) for example grade 60 rebar has a minimum yield strength of 60 ksi. Rebar is available in different grades and specifications that vary in yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, chemical composition, and percentage of elongation.
