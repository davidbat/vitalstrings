Rebar is available in different grades and specifications that vary in yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , chemical composition , and percentage of elongation . The grade designation is equal to the minimum yield strength of the bar in ksi (1000 psi) for example grade 60 rebar has a minimum yield strength of 60 ksi. Rebar is typically manufactured in grades 40, 60, and 75. Common ASTM specification are: ASTM A82: Specification for Plain Steel Wire for Concrete Reinforcement ASTM A184/A184M: Specification for Fabricated Deformed Steel Bar Mats for Concrete Reinforcement ASTM A185: Specification for Welded Plain Steel Wire Fabric for Concrete Reinforcement ASTM A496: Specification for Deformed Steel Wire for Concrete Reinforcement ASTM A497: Specification for Welded Deformed Steel Wire Fabric for Concrete Reinforcement ASTM A615/A615M: Deformed and plain carbon-steel bars for concrete reinforcement ASTM A616/A616M: Specification for Rail-Steel Deformed and Plain Bars for Concret
