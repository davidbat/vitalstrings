Sixteen fractured gusset plates in the center span on Interstate 35W were a main cause of the deadly bridge collapse in Minneapolis last August , the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) made a recommendation to FHWA on gusset plates in steel truss bridges as the result of an interim finding from its investigation of the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis.Â  January 11, 2008: The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) on-going investigation uncovers an error in the original design process that resulted in undersized gusset plates on some of Bridge 9340's main trusses. âThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was the inadequate load capacity, due to a design error,â the NTSB states in its 2008 report on the incident.
