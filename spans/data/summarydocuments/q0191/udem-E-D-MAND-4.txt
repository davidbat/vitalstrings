The main difference between fission and fusion is that in fission, a large nucleus is split apart into smaller ones, and in fusion, two nuclei are combined (fused) into a larger one.  (With Hydrogen-Boron fusion, the hydrogen fuses to the boron-11, temporarily creating an unstable isomer of carbon-12 which immediately breaks apart into three Helium nuclei. This is because we have many nuclear power plants that use fission, but no one has been able to build a working fusion plant yet.  The biggest practical difference between the two is that fusion reactions don’t have the problem of “chain reactions” and “melt-downs”.
