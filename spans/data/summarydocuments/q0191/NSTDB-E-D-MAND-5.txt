Difference between fusion and fission ?Fusion involves the fusing or combination of two nuclides to form one, whereas fission involves the fission or splitting of one nuclide into two. Both processes involve a loss of binding energy...What is the difference between fission and fusion ?The correct answer is: During fission, a larger nucleus is broken down into smaller nuclei. During fusion,smaller nuclei are joined to create a larger nucleus.Hope I answered your question=) If you...What are two differences between fission and fusion ?there isntWhat is the difference between the use of fission and fusion as an energy source?Well, the difference is that when you get fusion it turns into fission. So really all your doing is using fissions. But, the difference to them is that when you use fission it produces a light that...What is the main difference between fission and fusion in terms of chemistry?fission is the slitting of one element to produce energy but fusion is two element combined to produce that amount of energy.eg fission:Ba and for fusion H. Difference between fusion and fission ?Fusion involves the fusing or combination of two nuclides to fo
