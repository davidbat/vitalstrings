The only theater organ that I could find listed for a Saenger Theater in Texarkana was a Robert-Morton size 2/6 installed in 1927. No status given. This photo is a 1949-50 photo of the Century Theater in Texarkana, Arkansas. The location given for this theater was the 400 block of East Broad Street. Click the link
