Generally, urban trash management has three steps of action. They are collecting, transport, and final disposal process. In the final disposal process, trash will be processed physically, chemically, and biologically. Quit the application that is using the file. This will usually permit you to then move the file to the Trash or to empty the Trash. If you are unsure of the application that has the file in use, the Terminal command lsof can tell you the name of the process or application that Mac OS X considers to be using the file, as follows:Click the Trash icon in the Dock. A Finder window opens showing the contents of your Trash. Open Terminal, located in the Macintosh HD Applications Utilities folder. Position and resize, if necessary, both the Finder window showing the Trash and the Terminal window so you can simultaneously see both windows fully. At the Terminal prompt type lsof followed by a single space, but do not press Return yet. Drag and drop the file in use from the Trash the Finder window opened in step 1 to the Terminal window opened in step 2. The path to the file will appear after the lsof command typed in step 3, i.e. you will seelsof /path_to_file
