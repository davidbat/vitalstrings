The idea behind recycling is to begin the sorting process earlier in the trash collection stream, saving the cost of later sorting when it has become less easy to do so.  Computers and electronic parts are a case in point.  Such e-refuse is actually a higher grade "ore" of valuable metals like gold.  Aluminum is another such instance, costing far less to reprocess aluminum from trash than from the ground.   |  | Unfortunately, much of trash is still non-competitive with original sources, as for example plastics in general.  It's still cheaper to produce polyethylene, for example, from crude than from trash, because polyethylene cannot "go back into the melt" as metals can.  Consequently, new uses have to be found for such non-competitive "commodies", and that's where the challenge lies in the marketplace.  We have already recycling programs throughout the world, and yet much of the sorted out trash ends up in landfills anyway, because nobody has found a profitable need for such "commodies"
