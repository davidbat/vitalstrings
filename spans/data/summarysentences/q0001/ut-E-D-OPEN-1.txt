American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009 of propofol intoxication after suffering a respiratory arrest at his home on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills neighborhood in Los Angeles.
His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he had found Jackson in his room, not breathing, but with a faint pulse, and that he administered CPR on his bed to no avail.
After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at 12:20 pm, Jackson was treated by paramedics at the scene, and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.
On August 28, 2009 one day before he would have been 51, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled Jackson's death a homicide.[1] Shortly before his death, Jackson had been administered propofol and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines – lorazepam and midazolam in his home.[2] Murray was convicted in November 2011 of involuntary manslaughter and is currently serving a 4 year sentence in prison.[3]Location: Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, United States; Date: J
