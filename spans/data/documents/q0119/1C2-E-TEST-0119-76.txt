Boston area search for iPad 2 :(
Has anyone in the Boston/Newton/Natick area had better luck getting an iPad2 after launch day? If so, what worked? Any tips/info?  I devoted most of my morning to the hunt, this is what I did:
Stopped into Target in Natick- they said they had a few on Friday but none since
None @ Walmart in Natick.  I called again after 3pm and still nothing.
Went to the Apple Store in the Natick Collection to wait before 10am for the store to open (which I realize now was dumb).... about 5 people were in line.  An Apple employee was nice enough to come and tell us they didn't have any so we didn't wait until 10.
Best Buy in Natick had zero... they talked about the $100 deposit deal.
I called every Apple store in the area (Cambridge, Chestnut Hill, Legacy Place, NH stores) with no luck.
I called every Best Buy in the area with the same result.  I finally went to my Best Buy in Watertown and did the $100 deposit and am hoping for the best.
I ordered my 32GB black wi-fi iPad2 online yesterday morning to be safe, but it has a delivery date of April 14th! Ridiculous!
It's amazing how hard it is to get something I want sooooo badly
So.... anyone hear anything helpful? Planning on going out again in the morning to Apple stores, in case of a shipment today?
Thanks for all your help!  Good luck to everyone
