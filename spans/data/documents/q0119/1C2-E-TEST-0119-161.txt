According to an unconfirmed report, numerous Apple Stores will be opening their doors one hour early on Tuesday as new iPad 2 shipments arrive across the country. Several shoppers seeking the new tablet today have reportedly been told by Apple retail staff that new shipments are incoming, but the iPads will not be available for sale until tomorrow. The report claims to have confirmed early openings with several Apple Store locations, though BGR placed calls to four Apple Stores and none would confirm early hours tomorrow. A retail employee at one Apple Store did say that a new iPad 2 shipment was expected today or tomorrow. Apple’s iPad 2 launch was met with tremendous demand, with some analysts estimating that Apple sold nearly 1 million units this past weekend. Apple has not issued any sales figures yet, saying only that “demand for the next generation iPad 2 has been amazing.”
UPDATE: BGR readers George F., Efraim and others have emailed us to confirm that their local Apple Stores will indeed be opening an hour early tomorrow. Interestingly, three different stores we’ve been told about said they would open early but would not be receiving a new iPad 2 shipment until later this week or early next week. The plot is thickening, but we would definitely recommend calling your local Apple store before calling in sick tomorrow.
