If we only have one or two salaries posted for for   a Mac Genius at Apple,  showing that salary information may risk employee anonymity. So in that case we generate an anonymous  salary range by adding and subtracting a small percentage from the  posted salary. The small percentage difference offers additional  anonymity while still minimizing the difference between the range and the employee's actual  salary.
