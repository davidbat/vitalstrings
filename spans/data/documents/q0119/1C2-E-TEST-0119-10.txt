The Apple Store Boylston Street stands at the edge of an the nineteenth century residential and commercial district of Boston's Back Bay. The building's architecture addresses the existing architectural fabric by employing a similar column spacing from the neighboring structures while incorporating the innovative laminated glass and stainless steel building assemblies that reflect the imaginative spirit of Apple. The roof features both a large skylight, which opens the building vertically, and a green roof that provides a visually appealing roofscape for neighbors above.
