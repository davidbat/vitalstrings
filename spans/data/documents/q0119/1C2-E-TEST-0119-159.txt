Some stores may need rare offsite meeting spaces
A number of Apple Stores around the US are said to be planning "all-hands-on-deck" meetings on or close to June 24th, according to sources for AppleInsider.  Stores not holding their meetings on the 24th may be doing so because of local events scheduled for the same day.  In some cases, the scale of the meetings is expected to force them to third-party venues.
One source says that a flagship store in Boston -- presumably the Boylston Street location -- is looking to rent out a local theater for its meeting, which should host over 200 workers and run from 8 to 11PM Eastern on the 24th.  The gathering will allegedly require "a projector, audio for the presenter and also computer hookup/audio."  It's anticipated that none of the meetings will need a live video feed from Apple's Cupertino headquarters, based on the staggered schedules and the claim that "at least one" offsite assembly doesn't appear to need an Internet connection.
It's rare for Apple Stores to schedule full-scale offsite events.  The purpose of the upcoming meetings is unknown, although it is speculated that they could be used to formally introduce workers to Apple's new head of retail, John Browett, who only joined the company in April.  Alternately, they could be used to prepare for the launch of OS X Mountain Lion in July .
