A visitor   writes on September 11, 2011: "This is a very nice small farm if you   want to pick good apples and visit a farm stand without all the bells and   whistles and extra costs. I like it because they charge by the pound so we   only get the amount we really want. I stop by often with my boys during the   season so we always have fresh crisp apples. The trees are right behind the   stand so its an easy walk. It also has a nice farm stand with a good variety   of fresh fruit and vegetables. Super fresh corn is picked in the fields and   delivered directly to the stand as it runs low. They often have bakery items   also available. The people who own it also run the stand they are very nice   and friendly. "

A visitor writes on October 14, 2008: "We went to Boston Hill this   weekend (Oct 13th), and it was perfect for my 9-year-old "Little Sister" from the Big Sister program. The apples were easy picking, since all the   trees are dwarf trees, they were absolutely delicious, and the pumpkins were   easy to pick out from the field. There was a hay ride for those who didn't   want to walk, a playground she absolutely loved, animals to pet and look at,   ice cream, and a bakery with home-made apple donuts. We had a good time!"

A visitor writes on August 05, 2011: "I have   taken my family there for about 6 years for apple picking and each year I   look forward to going there. They care about the produce they grow first and   foremost. The quality of their apples is always excellent and their fields   are kept clean and orderly with markings so you can tell what varieties are   in which rows. They also have a corn maze, chickens and goats for the kids   to feed, and a tractor ride out to the fields.They have a little bakery in a   barn that makes and sells different baked goods but try their cinnimon-sugar   cider donuts. They are delicious! The only negative I could say is that if   you don't go early for the apples you have to hike up the hill and it is   steep."
A visitor writes on July 19, 2011: "My boyfriend and I   went to Cider Hill Farm this past weekend, and found it as charming and fun   and welcoming as our first time last year. The red and black raspberry   picking was fantastic, the shop had many tasty treats, and the staff was   wonderfully helpful. You pick on the honor system - no one is hovering to   make sure you're not sampling. We even enjoyed some refreshing beverages and   farm-made treats (cider donuts and strawberry-chocolate muffins -   YUUMMMM!!!) in their picnic area before leaving. We intend to return very   soon to get more blueberries! We love Cider Hill Farm so much, we decided to   come back to this website to give them a good review! ;-)"
A visitor   writes on August 06, 2009: "They do both PYO and   harvest for others to sell in their barn/store. Peaches, berries, apples....   most of the rest is harvested and sold in the store. Excellent place. They   have a great old donut maker and make the BEST fresh donuts; their apple   cider is awesome; a bee hive that kids can look at (behind plexiglass with a   tube that funnels to the outside. Pretty cool. In the past few years they   have installed 3 windmills and solar panels. Re. organic... I know they   spray the berries pre-blossom but not after. Wish they offer more organic.   They have a big chicken yard (.50 will buy your child a little cup of   chicken feed) and a couple of goats. It's a beautiful place offering some   plants in the spring and a great barn seasonally full of all sorts of   things. "
A visitor writes on August 28, 2008: "I've been taking   my son here for about 10 years and every year is better. Apple picking at   the base of the hill for those who can't climb or don't want to take the   hayride up. They continually add more types of fresh produce they sell in   their store. There are animals and play area for the kids. We've moved about   45 minutes away and still drive to Cider Hill. No one will ever beat their   hot cider donuts!"

A visitor writes   on September 05, 2011: (negative) "We wanted an end of summer farm day and, based on what is in season, looked   for a farm with pick your own raspberries AND peaches. Connors farm in   Danvers fit the bill so we headed there. We had to pre-pay for a peach peck   bag while the raspberries were to be weighed and paid for afterwrds. And I   had to sign a waiver saying I had been warned there were bees at the back of   the peach orchard. The girl that helped me told me both were out back behind   the pond nad there would be signs. Well, there were no signs at all and only   one other group picking peaches. Almost none of the peaches were ripe and if   we hadn't pre-paid for the bag, we probably would have left sooner. We   willed our bag with the ripest we could find/reach but there were not only   bees (they KEEP bees behind the field), but, more annoying, mosquitos   everywhere despite it being midday and sunny. Perhaps this is related to the   pond which appeared to be completely still. My 6 year old daughter got it   worst - she has more than a dozen bites"
A visitor writes on September   27, 2009: (negative) "On   9/26/09, my family & I decided to go apple picking. I wanted some place   different. I went on this website and chose Connor's farm in Danvers, MA. It   was a beautiful day and I expected it to be busy. If you were there for the   corn maize or the family toddler section then it would of been fine. We were   there to pick apples. We found the apple tree's by a small sign. There were   no markings to say which tree's for which apples. There was no one working   out in the fields so we could ask questions. I found the orchard was   neglected. Vines and weeds and such were growing over and around the very   small trees, sunlight couldn't even get into the apples to ripen. I wanted   to leave and get my money back for the pre-paid bag purchase. We were there   so, we filled the bag with what we could gather that were worthy apples. I   came home and made apple sauce with them. Not worth eating. Next time I will   stick to the farms without all the stuff, and good healthy apple tree's for   the picking. Brenda C."

A visitor writes on September 26, 2009: (negative) "September 25, 2009 We just returned from this farm. We went to go apple   picking. We got no apples. On their website they talk about all this stuff   for kids. The only thing they say that costs is the hayride. They have a   bouncy house and slide. They were charging $4.00 for one slide down the   bouncy slide. They say go to the red barn for pyo we walk all the way up   there to be told apple picking is all the way on the other side. Their are   cars every where. People are able to drive right in the middle of were   everyone needs to walk to get to pick apples. It is very expensive and   disorganized. Accident waiting to happen with all these people driving every   where. If you go Please be very careful with the kids."
A visitor   writes on August 14, 2009: (negative) "I took the kids to   go peach and raspberry picking today. I called ahead to make sure everything   was available. The peaches were not ripe at all! We found 2 peaches among 50   trees that were actually ripe. Also they were charging a ridiculous $7/pint   to pick your own raspberries. Absolutely ridiculous. What a waste of a trip.   the whole point of going to these farms is getting ripe fresh fruit/produce.   if i wanted hard peaches i would just go to the grocery store."

Visitor   feedback (September 26, 2007): (negative) "WE VISITED SMOLAK FARM TODAY AND WERE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.   WE FOUND THE WEB SITE AND THEN decided TO GO. WE PACKED UP THE CHILDREN AND   WENT. THEY WERE VERY EXCITED TO GO APPLE PICKING.  WHEN WE GOT THERE WE WERE   INFORMED THERE IS NO APPLE PICKING DURING THE WEEK. IT WAS NOT ONLY US BUT   SEVERAL OTHER FAMILIES WERE ALSO QUITE UPSET. TO GET CHILDREN READY TO GO   AND THEN DRIVE FOR 1/2 HOUR AND THEN JUST TO BE TOLD THAT THEY WERE NOT   GOING TO DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WOULD ON THEIR WEBSITE SEEMS VERY UNFAIR".

A visitor writes on July 18, 2011:  (negative) "I was so relieved to see the other comments on this farm! I thought my   husband and I were being profiled as bad berry pickers. We went last Sunday   and it was an absolutely horrible experience! We weren't given a moment's   peace while picking, one of the workers insisted on supervising every move   we made. We left with about 1/2 the blueberries we wanted and bought the   rest at the supermarket. Unless you enjoy being treated like a criminal,   this is most definitely NOT the place for a relaxing afternoon of berry   picking. I absolutely will not return. "
A visitor writes on July 27,   2010: (positive) "Visited   Turkey Hill on 7/27/10 and picked some wonderful blueberries. They had many,   many bushes with ripe berries. The field staff were friendly and responsive,   opening a section for us when they could see that the bushes we were working   on were well-picked. They even drove an older customer out to the area being   picked that day. Price was $2.90 per pound, they have containers to use."
A visitor writes on July 28, 2009: (positive) "i was disappointed to see such a poor review about Turkey Hill Farm.   Although I've only gone there once to pick blueberries, I was impressed with   how clean it was. While we were picking (two adults, 3 kids), nobody ever   bothered us or stood over us, watching what we did. Once we got our bucket,   we were on our own. I was actually quite impressed with the farm...and no,   I'm not even related to them!"
A visitor writes on July 30, 2008:  (negative) "I   visited this farm last weekend with a friend, hoping to catch up with her on   life and spend a pleasant afternoon blueberry picking as we did so. I   obviously chose the wrong place. I have picked at some of the other places   on this list and others that I found myself and they were great, and I've   never had such a strange experience. This place was like being on a school   field trip! Don't get me wrong, this was not because the place was full of   kids. I take no issue with that, and consider fruit picking good family fun.   No, it was because of the people that work there, their attitude, and their   school-marm scolding and corralling policies. Everyone was roped into one   small area, precluding us from have any private, (or adult) conversation,   practically on top of one another and loudly instructed to "pick every ripe   berry from a single bush" before moving. We were nearly assigned to this   bush by the worker that loudly instructed each newly arriving party while   making sure we didn't stray outside the area. Also, we were asked to refrain   from eating any berries before paying for them. I understand the farm's   interest in turning a buck and would gladly pay extra not to be robbed the   eat-as-you-go part of the pleasure! Too many signs with too many rules! I   would never go there again. and last but not least, Thanks for putting up   this great site!"
A visitor writes on August 23, 2008: (positive) "Feel free to edit this if it is too flaming. I have been   going to Turkey Hill with my children for three years. I would like to   clarify the impression conveyed by the visitor comment from July 30 2008. We   have probably gone 20 times this summer alone. The staff is very friendly,   laid back, and helpful. For anyone needing assistance the staff will provide   a ride in a golf cart to and from the fields. The staff asks newcomers if   they have been to the farm before and if they have not, the staff member   typically escorts the new comer to the field and suggests a bush that has a   suitable number of berries. They have several varieties of blueberries and   if a picker is not experienced they will overlook a good bush. The rules are   very simple and similar to other pick-your-owns. At any one time, most of   the field is roped off to let the bushes fill out and ripen. Pickers are   asked not to cross over or under the ropes. The sign says that they expect   you to eat berries while picking but to save "serious eating" for when you   get home. Finally they ask, and this is always posed a polite request, that   you pick all the ripe berries from a bush before moving on to the next. The   reason of this reasonable request is that the tendency of many people is to   pick all the biggest ripest easiest to get berries from a bush and then move   onto another bush and so on. This leaves a depleted bush that new pickers   will pass over and the farm looses the berries left behind. I have never   seen this rule enforced except by concientious pickers The staff frequently   comes into the field and opens new sections as the bushes are depleted. They   announce in a raised voice so that everyone can hear that they are opening a   new section but to please finish picking all the ripe berries on your   current bush before moving on. Despite often seeing people abandon their   bush immediately I have never heard anyone scolded or spoken to in a   schoolmarm fashion. The one point I would agree with is that this is not the   place to go for private adult conversation. It is not that the pick your   farmers are trying to "make a buck", they are trying to make a living. "
A visitor writes on June 06, 2009:  (negative)  "I would like to comment on Turkey Hill farm in Haverhill. It is a   beautifully kept farm. But like the person who wrote on July 30 2008, it is   a miserable picking experience due to the owner's attitude. I have picked   here for many many years and put up with being corraled and watched and   reprimanded if I strayed an inch. Finally I told the owner that I would   never be back and have not in 5 years. I am a very consciencious and   experience picker (have been picking for 45 years) and am respectful of the   farmers and their produce. But it is not at all pleasant to be watched   suspiciously while you are picking no matter how tasty the berries are.   There are other much more pleasant places to go. Try Wheelerbrook farm in   Georgetown, it is night and day different. The person who wrote in on the   Turkey Hill site saying that the owners are "laid back" must be a relative.   It is completely and totally the opposite. Sorry but true."

A visitor writes   on September 26, 2009: (negative) "I visited the Carver Hill Farm today and was sorely disappointed. It was   not the quiet, idyllic place that was referred to. It was a perfect apple   picking weekend to be sure so that explains some of it, but the place was   packed. They have added a overgrown wagon ride pulled by a tractor that goes   through the orchard. The apples were not that good, not too ripe, with lots   of brown spots. Based on my experience I would not recommend this place or   visit again. "
A visitor writes on September 02, 2009: (positive) "We went apple and raspberry picking here today. It is a lovely quiet farm   with very very nice people. Only one other couple while we were there, as   opposed to the two dozen minivans at Honeypot Hill (we stopped there for   their donuts and mazes). Right now picking Mac's, with Cortlands to follow   in a few weeks. Prices decent - apples are $12 for a peck, $20 for a bushel,   and raspberries are $5 per quart."
A visitor writes on July 23, 2009: (positive) "I visited this farm   on July 23rd, 2009. An incredibly friendly and welcoming farm. This is a   small quiet farm for those who are not looking for a circus act as part of   their farm visit. The setting is very peaceful and beautiful with a pretty   little pond and brook running through the property. I would highly recommend   it, though make sure to call ahead because as they are a smaller operation   they might be picked out on certain days."
Comments from a visitor,   October 28, 2007: (positive) "Carver Hill is one of the nicest pick-your-own establishments in the area.   The staff is always friendly and willing to help. The best thing about   Carver Hill is that it is, to a certain extent, "off the beaten path," so   usually there won't be many other people. It's a more peaceful and less   crowded alternative to the nearby Honeypot Hill Orchards. They also have an   ice cream counter, and sometimes you can get nice, warm apple crisp."

They had a TON of apples (many different varieties   and LOTS of trees. There isn't much besides the actual orchard, but they do   have a tractor (actually more like a loader) that can pull you around and my   daughter loved that. If you're looking simply for picking good apples, this   is a perfect place to go. And prices were reasonable too. They also have a   stand that sells lots of goodies but that is up the road and across Route 27   - Don't miss it! We got a great looking pumpkin from there and a couple of   fantastic pies. I definitely recommend Dowse Orchards!"

A visitor writes on June 04, 2010: "Yesterday, June 3, 2010, my   boyfriend and I went to pick strawberries at the Hanson's Farm in   Framingham, MA. We called about a dozen local places and most were not   having pick-your-own strawberries until the weekend or the middle of the   month. Hanson's Farm is a very small operation and I would not suggest it   for big groups. The field was very small. I could not see more than 8 people   picking from that field to get a large amount of berries. The berries were   good. The cost was $2 per person, and $2.50 per pound. They also had a large   selection of flowers and herbs to buy. Pre-picked strawberry quarts were $6.   They also supplied containers. We had a decent experience but would probably   try someplace else next time."
A visitor writes on August 16, 2009: "Hi, Thanks for putting together such an extensive and useful resource! We   called Hanson's farm this morning and were told by the young woman at the   farm stand that they were picking blueberries and raspberries. Well, when we   arrived shortly after that, she told us there were none to be had. We went   out to check. It is a very small operation; I don't think a rush of pickers   was the problem, just a lack of information. I wouldn't recommend this farm   for their pick your own based on our experience. Maybe their farm stand is   good, but we didn't feel like spending any money there."

A visitor writes on August 13, 2011: "I went to Honeypot Hill   Orchards in Stow on 8/6/11 for Blueberry picking. It was great picking. They   give you nice little covers to put on the boxes when you finish so you don't   loose those precious berries. I bought their own peaches..very good. Farm   animals are fun to watch..especially the 3 little pigs and the goats!". 
A visitor writes on October 03, 2010: "Today (a Sunday!) there   were 5 busloads of people and all the parking lots were overflowing. It was   a frustrating, NOT relaxing experience! The trees were literally picked out   in the open sections and they refused to open new areas even though the   trees there were brimming with ripe apples. We left with half-empty $15 bags   of apples. The lines for cider and donuts were 1/2 hour long. The place was   bursting with people and no apples. "
A visitor to Honey Pot Orchard   writes on October 7, 2007: "Went on Sunday, October 7, 2007... The BEST   place to pick apples, they already have ladders, so you don't have to climb   the trees, they had SOOOOOOO many apples to choose from it wasn't funny...   You didn't have to go looking, they were all right there for you.... Would   HIGHLY recommend it, it is by far my best place to pick apples, and my NEW   PLACE, would not go anyplace else....."
A visitor writes on August 05, 2008: "Hi....Just took my 3 boys to   honey pot today to pick blueberries. It was wonderful. We picked to our   delight and then enjoyed AWESOME cider doughnuts from their store on the way   home. We've also been there for apple picking last fall and plan on going   again this year. However, I think an important note to add is to let people   know that they need to carry cash, as they don't accept any credit/debit   cards. Thanks!"

A visitor writes on June 12, 2011: "The farm seems to keep their   u-pick updated daily. First weekend in June '11 open for strawberry u-pick.   It is an enjoyable field to pick, not very manicured, and run like a farm   not an event maker. No one is monitoring the pickers at all.

CC accepted. Checkout rounded down my weight.

A visitor writes: "There is also a great   store and a little stand where you can buy all sorts of apple related   goodies! We live in the area and have tried all the farms locally, and they   make the best donuts by far. They also have cooked/frozen pies, cookies,   lunch things, hot dogs, fudge and a bunch more.  There are restrooms and a   bunch of picnic tables spread out all over the farm. It's a beautiful place,   with lots of happy families and a wicked friendly staff. It seems like it's   mainly run by a younger staff, but the girl who is in charge is always there   and ready to answer all questions and help customers with anything. My son   touched a wheel of a tractor last year and got mud all over him. She took us   back into the kitchen, washed him off, and gave him a chocolate pop shaped   like an apple! She also told my wife that they practice IPM, which I guess   means they use good bugs to fight bag bugs. There are also hay rides, pony   rides, a moon bounce, a hay maze/mountain and an area for kids to ride   around on small tractors. They accept credit cards!"

Western Ave U Pick Blueberries - No pesticides used, blueberries
46   Western Avenue, Sherborn, MA, Open: every day from early July until the   season is over (late August?).
A visitor writes on July 11, 2011: "Went to Western Avenue U-Pick yesterday (7-10). There was a sign saying "Closed until further notice" affixed to No Trespassing sign. Not sure   what's happening there."
A visitor writes on October 03, 2010: "This farm has changed owners. Prices in 2010 were $2.00/pint. It is   semi-honor system - the owner followed us around the fields and into the   weighing area. He also told us stories about people stealing from him, going   into closed areas, etc even though we didn't engage him in conversation.   There's still lots of berries whenever you go, but the feel (and prices)   have changed."
A visitor writes on August 10, 2009: "We went there last weekend (Aug 9). There are a lot of ripe berries. We   picked over 10 pounds with 2 people in about an hour. There are still a lot   of green berries as well, so I think it hasn't reached the peak yet. Price   is 1.50/lb."
A visitor writes on July 11, 2009: "Went by this place today. They still go by the honor system, though price   per lb is now $1.50. They provide buckets which are marked and make it easy   to tell what you have. Its ok to taste the berries, they don't have an issue   with that (I do it to tell if I want to bother picking that bush or not) but   you may want to leave the heavy eating for when you're at home. The bushes   are quite heavy with unripe fruit right now, but given how lovely the Summer   has been in this area, totally understandable. The ripe berries are a bit   tart right now, so we're hoping by next week they'll be just right. Also,   they do ask that you please leave your pets in the car or better yet, leave   them at home. Totally understandable given the amount of natural wild life   around there. The turkey's from last year haven't made an appearance. They   may we hope!. Human families are welcome. I walked around quite abit, no   poison ivy that I could see but they do make an effort to get rid of it when   they can. I didn't see any wasps nests but I did see a lot of them flying   about. The ground is very wet so you may want to bring some waterproof   shoes."
A visitor writes: "There's a little sign inside the driveway, which you could easily miss, so   drive slowly. You can go from early in the morning until nightfall. This is   a wonderful no-name farm with hundreds of high-bush blueberries. They supply   buckets, and payment is honor system, with a scale to weigh and bags to   carry home your berries. They use no sprays. Children are welcome, but not   dogs. The price is very reasonable, at $1.25 per lb during summer 2007. "
A visitor writes on August 10, 2008: "Fantastic place to go! Off the   beaten path and not overrun with people. We went today, and blueberries are   still 1.25/pound. Parking can be a bit of a problem on the weekends, so make   sure you come early. Bring sunscreen, wading boots (the ground is pretty   wet), and some insect spray for the little ones. There was a bush with a   pretty active wasp nest, but they also have spray out for that. Also, you do   have to watch out for poison ivy. At this time of year (beginning of august)   you can still get quite a lot though most of the bushes toward the front of   the property are picked clean. Berries are really good and tart. We saw a   herd of turkey's today that shadowed our picking. They were picking up   whatever got dropped. They're also pretty tolerant of humans as long a you   keep your distance. They don't allow dogs on the property, I'm thinking its   because the dogs may harrass the natural wild life. Berry picking is based   all on the honor system, You weigh and pay on your own, they do provide some   buckets though you can bring your own if you want. Also, its all cash, so   bring plenty of 1 dollar bills. For us it was a 5 mile drive. Totally worth   it being what you pick tastes better than any grocery store berry."

21-1/2 qt. enamel water bath canner

Ball Blue Book
This is the same type of standard canner that my grandmother used to     make everything from applesauce to jams and jellies to tomato and     spaghetti sauce. This complete kit includes everything you need and lasts     for years: the canner, jar rack, jar grabber tongs, lid lifting wand, a     plastic funnel, labels, bubble freer, and the bible of canning, the Ball     Blue Book. It's much cheaper than buying the items separately. You'll     never need anything else except jars & lids (and the jars are reusable)!     There is also s simple kit with just the canner and rack, and a pressure     canner, if your want to do vegetables (other than tomatoes).
