"Luckily, there will be a shipment of hard drives arriving in on Tuesday, and for $80.00, I can get a new one and install it myself. This is way better than taking the machine in, and having the repair guys charge me $80.00 just to open it up and take a look."
You don't need to purchase/install a hard drive from a Mac dealer. They're going to sell you the same type of hard drive that you can purchase from any electronics, office supply, or PC computer store - it isn't unique to Apple computers. In the US, a good sale price for a 120 GB drive would be $50-$60, so you should find out what capacity drive you'd be buying for $80. Once installed, you'll boot from your Panther installer disk and run Disk Utility (OS X) to format (and partition - if desired) the new drive, so that it will be an eligible destination disk for your Panther installation.
Have you determined whether you have a Rev. 1 or Rev. 2 motherboard? Knowing this will determine whether you can install a large drive, such as 60, 80, 100, or 120 GBs, or whether you will need a Mac-compatible ATA controller card. To identify the IDE controller chip on your motherboard, scroll down to the section "Revised IDE Controller Chip" on this page , and compare the chip pictured with yours. If you have the newer controller chip, it will support master/slave configuration of two drives and recognize up to 128 GBs of each connected drive. Your B&W G3 uses a 3.5" IDE/EIDE Ultra ATA-100 or Ultra ATA-133 hard drive. The next largest drive is 160 GBs, which will only be recognized as 128 GBs. Intech's " SpeedTools ATA High-Cap Driver " is a software solution that enables the full usage of large capacity drives (160 GBs ->). The other option is an ATA-133 controller (PCI) card , to which your new drive would be connected and then formatted.
