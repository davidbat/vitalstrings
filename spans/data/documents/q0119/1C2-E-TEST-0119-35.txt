I’m such a geek, I’ve been jazzed about the new huge Apple Store opening downtown for over a year now and today all of my excitement will burst out in multicolored swirls of greatness set to The Ting Tings as the Boylston Street Apple Store’s doors open at 6pm tonight.  Yes I will be in line a couple hours early and yes, I’ll be trying not to leave man-goo all over the shiny new store.  It’s 3 floors of glass with a crazy huge glass spiral staircase, glass ceiling and grassy roof deck.  ( Check out Boston.com’s sneak peek photos ).
Some people just don’t get it and that’s fine.  Yes, sure there are 3 other Apple stores within 15 minutes of this new one but that’s neither here nor there… this is the big mothership!
Plus, I’ll get to hang out with ThePieMaker.com reader Kim as she’ll be in town for the unveiling (she works for Apple, she’s not that crazy to just fly in).
