Summary
Apple Store Opening in Back Bay for Christmas . . . 2007
The Boston Globe had a little sidebar note in the morning paper today that the revised, now three instead of the initial four floors, Apple Store plans for the 815 Boylston St. address had been approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Apple still has to go through the process of applying for the necessary demolition and building permits to turn the building into the three story glass façade building it is currently planning. This is good news for Apple fanatics who are looking to avoid hauling all the way to Cambridgeside (or Chestnut Hill or South Shore Plaza) for their Genius Bar fix. Additionally, BestBuy is coming to the Virgin Megastore location on Newbury St. so if it’s the new MacBook or a 42" plasma for your den the consumer strip will have shoppers covered. Construction on either of the projects, BestBuy and the Apple Store won't be started or completed for some time. We've heard rumors that BestBuy hopes to open sometime over the summer. Apple 's timetable is much longer, reports are that construction of the new building will take about a year – just in time for Christmas 2007. Likely the mess that's disrupted foot traffic outside the Prudential Center on the Boylston side for most of this year will continue, it will just move across the street as they work on the 815 property.
