7. Re: Best place to go for apple picking?

I've been to Honeypot Hill, Nashoba Valley Winery, Parlee Farms ( Tyngsboro ), Smolak Farms ( N.Andover ), Marino Lookout Farm ( Natick ), and just went to Cider Hill Farm in Amesbury last weekend.
I think it's fair to say that almost every apple orchard has hayrides to the orchards and farm animals for petting/feeding. Honeypot Hill has a big tall hedge maze. Marino Lookout Farm in Natick I'll never go back to. I know apple picking is a popular attraction in the fal, but this place is like visiting the mall during weekends in December. Smolak Farms was overly crowded when I visited last fall. A number of animals to see there, but they actually charge you for hayrides. Nashoba Valley Winery was very scenic. Big field beside the winery building with a gazebo, and they usually have entertainment of some sort going on there. I love Parlee Farms. They have a cute animal barn set-up and a big hay bale maze for the kids to run/jump/climb on. Just visited Cider Hill in Amesbury last weekend. I thought it was very nice, too. Aside from the apple picking and hayrides, they have a corn maze, a hay bale maze, and a hay covered area where the kids can throw hay at each other. Four tire horse swings for the kids in a covered picnic pavilion, too.
