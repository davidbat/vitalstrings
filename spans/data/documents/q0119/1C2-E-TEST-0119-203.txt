WRENTHAM —
Wrentham teen Matthew Glass turned up alive Thursday night at a Dedham home, a day after the 17-year-old King Philip High School senior was reported missing.
Wrentham Police cancelled their search for Glass just after 10 p.m. after he came to the home of Brett and Laura Wallace on Cedar Street in Dedham.
The missing teen's mom, Diane Glass, confirmed her son has been found and taken to Norwood Hospital. She was en route to be with him. Glass' brother, Andrew, was in Boston tonight hanging "Missing" posters when he got word his brother was found, and also made his way to reunite with his brother.
Wicked Local media partner WCVB-TV spoke with the Wallaces Thursday night. Brett Wallace told WCVB's Mary Saladna that Glass was disoriented when he arrived at the Wallace's house, saying he didn't know what day it was or where he was, and passed out on the Wallace's porch.
Glass also claimed he'd been abducted in Boston, the Wallaces said, but police said Thursday night that there was no evidence of any abduction after his examination at Norwood Hospital.
Wallace told Saladna that the last thing Glass remembered was helping a motorist with a broken down car in a Boston alley.
No further details were immediately available.
Police had been investigating the case since Glass was reported missing on Wednesday.
According to police, the teen texted his parents, Diane and Michael Glass, on Tuesday to say that he was going to Boston to the Apple store for computer repairs. The couple was on vacation in Utah at the time and had left their two younger kids with a caretaker, who reported to them that Matthew hadn't returned home from Boston.
Glass' mom said she got a text at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday from her son saying that everything was OK, but Matthew couldn't find the Apple store, so he was going to get something to eat and watch the Red Sox game. She heard nothing more after that.
McGrath said Glass last used his cell phone at 9 p.m. Tuesday while he was in the vicinity of 409 Huntington Ave., Boston, in the Northeastern University area. The phone was powered off after that.
The red, four-door 2000 Dodge Dakota Glass was driving was found on Boylston Street late this morning; police did not say exactly where. The Apple store is at 815 Boylston St.

McGrath said Boston Police helped in the search, even using Homeland Security cameras to try to track him in the city. Police also contacted the Red Sox to see if they could find any evidence Matthew went to the game.
"Boston Police have been outstanding," said McGrath.
Police said the family knows of no reason why the teen would not come home, but  Glass' mother indicated at the press conference this morning her son was upset about not being able to play football this year.
"We would not sign the waiver to let him play football for his senior year because a concussion was so bad last year and he lost a lot of school, and he had to finish up his junior year over the summer. I know he is upset over not being able to play football," she said.
