METHOD
For the Pumpkin  Angolotti:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Coat the pumpkin in butter, salt, pepper, brown  sugar and roast until tender. Scoop out the pumpkin flesh and chill. When  cooled, puree with the cream cheese and garlic and adjust seasoning with salt  and pepper. Pipe into the prepared pasta and roll into angolotti. 
For the Chicken:
Heat oven to 400ºF. Season chicken with salt,  pepper, dried lavender, and a touch of oil to coat. Transfer to oven and roast  until golden brown, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Carve and slice the breast  from the chicken and separate the legs from body. Deglaze the pan with chicken  stock or water; remove the top layer of fat and reserve juices.
For the Chanterelles:
Heat the oil in a sauté pan until hot then add butter. Add the chanterelles and  sauté until caramelized. Deglaze with wine and add the garlic and  shallots. Season with salt and pepper. 
For the Lobster Emulsion:
Put the lobster shells in a stock pot and cover with water.  Add the garlic, bay leaf, parsley stems, and onion and cook for 30  minutes. Strain and reduce by half. Slowly whisk in butter by cubes  until it comes together. Season with salt and pepper.
To Assemble and  Serve:
Ladle 1 ounce of lobster emulsion on each plate. Coat the agnolotti with 2  tablespoons of lobster emulsion and toss with parsley. Serve 4 agnolotti per  person. Divide the chicken breast, legs, and thighs among the plates. Spoon  deglazed chicken juices over the plate and serve immediately.
