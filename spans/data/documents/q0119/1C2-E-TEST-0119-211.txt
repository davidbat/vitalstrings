The stories in the video about English Language Learners and immigrants in the U.S. are those of high school students from Charlestown High School in Boston, MA.
Producer ChuYu Huang: I am the Youth Program Associate at Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. I lead a youth leadership program at Charlestown High School called Chinese Immigrant Student Leadership (ChISL), a program developed in partnership with the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, a non-profit community-based organization in Boston. I am raised in
Chinatown, Boston and have gone through the public education  system from elementary school into college. For college, I attended University of Massachusetts Boston with a double major in Sociology and Asian American Studies. I gained interest in media making through my Asian American Media Literacy Course; it is where I learned how to create my own digital story. This is one of the many courses that I took at University of Massachusetts Boston where I learned a lot from and also took away useful skills to plug into other areas of my life. In this instance, I was able to take what I’ve learned from the course and made use of the skills. This video story challenge was an opportunity presented by the White House Initiative on Asian American Pacific Islander’s for
Asian Americans to share their stories and help raise awareness. I am very blessed to have the video make it this far into the finalists.
