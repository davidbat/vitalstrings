West Boylston is here in Worcester County
Check it out: As previously mentioned in the Boylston post , parts of West Boylston were flooded in the early 1900s to create the Wachusett Reservoir. When construction was complete, a stone church remained standing at the edge of the reservoir, and now this old stone church is one of the most recognizable and photographed sites in Worcester county. This impressive structure is the last remnant of the part of town which was once based in the valley and serves as a reminder of those who lost their homes and jobs when the area was flooded.
So we've heard: West Boylston is turning 200 this year! There will be events held throughout 2008 to commemorate this milestone in the town's history. A Grand Ball, Old Stone Church Day, military re-enactments, road races, fireworks and the dedication of two new sites in town, the Mount Vernon Cemetery and the Holbrook Chapel, to the National Register of Historic Places are all on the calendar of events. When the town was incorporated in 1808, people were drawn to it for its fertile lands and apple and rye farms flourished. It later turned to manufacturing as its main enterprise because of its proximity to rivers, but is now better known as a quaint town for those who work in the Worcester area to raise a family in.
And what kind of bicentennial celebration would it be without an historic trolley replica? When we were in town to take this picture, the trolley was sitting on the town common, letting all who saw it know about the town's big birthday. The trolley will be making the rounds throughout town once the weather is nice, and will be seen at different locations and events to serve as the official roving store for bicentennial memorabilia.
