Lululemon : Yoga Inspired Clothing
The latest Lululemon store opened two weeks ago on 776 Boylston Street. Lululemons "yoga inspired athletic apparel" is truly lovely and comfortable AND stylin'. While some of the gear can be a bit pricey, I've always found they have great sales and the stores themselves are an experience, offering free yoga classes (usually on Sundays), a beautiful space, and generally more friendly and knowledgeable staff. The new location is just across from the new Apple Store on Boylston (also worth checking out) and steps off the Green Line Copley and Prudential T-Stops. The ambassadors for this location are the South Boston Yoga studio owners, David Vendetti and Todd Skoglund.

776 Boylston Street, Boston, MA
