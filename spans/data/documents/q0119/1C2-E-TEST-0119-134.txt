I went to Boylston street, Boston, MA AT&T store yesterday and upgraded to iPhone 4S. They charged me $240 ($41 was the tax). I was surprised to see such high tax. I went to Apple store couple blocks far to check if they were charging same tax. I was extremly surprised to hear that they were charging tax of only $11. That is 6,25% on the discounted phone price. AT&T charged me tax on full value of the phone. I went back to AT&T and told them about the huge difference. They just said it is state law and cant help it. How can state law be different across two stores on same street for the same product. This is rediculous. Guys at AT&T were not even courteous. I cancelled my order with AT&T. I double checked with apple store today and they said the same price. $211 with tax.
 
If you want to save on your iphone purchase, go to apple store.
Just be glad you are not in california or a few other states that charge sales tax based on the full retail price of the phone not the discounted price.
 
sales tax laws are wierd in a lot of states and subject to interpetation.
