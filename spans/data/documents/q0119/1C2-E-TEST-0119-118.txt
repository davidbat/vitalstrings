Pay attention - I said most valuable. That means market capitalization. Apple is currently the world number two after Exxon.

MSoffice is a windows product. I was emphasizing that we're stuck on MS even if you're on a Mac. When I was looking for work, recruiters would demand an "MSOffice" document. I tried to explain to them that openoffice is fully compatible but they would have none of it.
Running windows on a mac in order to run your programs defeats the purpose of the ease of use of the Mac. Saying "most popular software" runs on the Mac is misleading at best. "Popular" with whom? Most business apps don't run on Macs I'm sad to say. Try to get the companies accounting tools on windows to run on it. On the home front, most "popular" games don't run on Macs and for good reason: It takes a lot of custom programming to get a game to work on a particular platform.
And don't tell me that the apple specs are high. I have built custom PC's with fantastic cases, high speed motherboards, and the lastest drivers (USB3 on a mac? How about SATA3?) for a fraction of a Mac when the macs are actually available.
Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac. But there are reasons why the public still hasn't adopted them sufficiently to make them a serious enough rival to Windows in order to get the software development there.
Linux, well, you gotta be a geek. I'm scared to put my mother or wife in front of one. And again, forget about games or most "popular" applications other than going with a Virtual Machine and then dealing with latency from that.

For the vast majority of people there's all the software you could ever want on the Mac. You're talking nonsense.
The hardware specs couldn't really be much better. Apple has just introduced the Thunderbolt I/O to its machines - it's much better than USB 3. I'll grant that the company does tend to go out a limb with these things but again, the vast majority of people couldn't care less.

Jack, you're hardly speaking for the vast majority of people when the vast majority of people who own PC's own MS PC's. If you run windows in a VM, then you too are a MS Windows owner then with MacOS being a mere wrapper.
Regarding thunderbolt. I'm reminded of firewire which sits vacant on my PowerPC. Sure, you can spend twice as much for an external drive running Mac's system or half as much for a "PC" USB3 version that runs just as well. Which way do you think most consumer would go?
And really, who are you to say "all" the software the vast majority of people would want? Really? If this software was so unwanted, it wouldn't be written and sold. I go to Bestbuy and see hundreds of titles for PC and then go to the Mac section and it's anemic. MSOffice and some back end packages such as iLife. It's the software dominance that sold MSWindows to people after the gray suits on wall street had demanded we standardize on "Eye-Bee-Em"
I "could want" to play high end games. I "could want" to load software that works on my work machines such as my mac including, gross, Lotusnotes. That's just a fact of life.

I'm still laughing that you think Jobs 'blew it' by establishing just about the world's most valuable company. It has never aimed at the mainstream business market, and all this talk of software and desktop platforms is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a world of cloud computing and mobile devices.

Actually, cloud computing applies more to business applications than personal ones. Home users don't have a need to run batch jobs against hundreds of virtual machines.
If you define apple by "market capitalization" and the success and profitability of ipod and iphone, I agree with you there. Jobs was a visionary of design and certainly marketing.
However, spin it all you like, but Bill Gates and Microsoft are agreed to be more successful for the reasons I mention above. OK, Bill Gates doesn't sell as many digital walkmans. So what?

Jack do you know what the total installed base of Windows based computers is vs. Apple Macs? How many Macs have you built? Custom configured for your needs? Tell me which of these big box mass retailers sells Apple Macs, Wal_Mart, K-Mart, Target, Costco, Sams, Bjs? Best Buy sells Macs in a Kiosk while 25% of the store is dedicated to Windows units and their software. Macs have almost no market presence outside of academia and the Yuppie set. Business doesn’t generally pay two and three times the price for computing equipment and then have to add hundreds more in VM capability to run the dominate software platform that could be bought on a platform 1/3 the cost without all the extra add ons. You won’t see the top of the line Macs all in ones running the all the rage video games. You won’t see any of the internal capacity of the typical Windows desktop in the Macs. Apple never got beyond a niche market computer maker and nothing has changed in that regard in the last three decades. Check the installed base of Windows based systems (servers, desktops and laptops) vs. Macs before you tell us how Apple Macs are the talk of the town with the bulk of computer users around the world.

You're wrong - Macs are now taking about 15% of the US market for PCs – that's a big deal. Gaming in any case is dominated by dedicated consoles such as Xbox.
Anyway, as I said I wasn't disputing the dominance of Microsoft, certainly in the corporate business market. In consumer markets Macs have terrific appeal, as the figures show, and there are mainly disadvantages in choosing a poorly built Windows machine prone to viruses. If you look at the best Windows notebooks, such as Sony, they are about the same price as Macs.

15% is nothing given the statue you given Apple as second largest company and the installed base of Windows equipment is enormous worldwide. You don't seem to know much about the PC gaming market where multiple video cards are virtually required to support the resolutions available only on PC screens not Flat 1080P TV screens. The world of AMD(ATI) and NVidia live off the high end gamers requirements that none of the Consoles can touch and certainly not the Mac with their closed in tight designs. The top ten most talked about games for PCs have some pretty steep requirements and neither Consoles nor any Mac can support that. These are the early adopters that pay the big bucks for all the high end video graphic capability these games require and if there wasn't a substantial market for this you wouldn’t see a new generation of video cards and capabilities every 6-9 months supporting these requirements along with the Windows drivers for such. A high end game machine with two graphic cards linked together will exceed both the capability of the highest end Mac and its cost. Go visit Tom’s hardware games forums and see how may Mac gamers you see there.

You don't know what you are talking about. If that were remotely true you would find Macs at every mass market retailer on the planet instead of a hundred varieties of Windows based machines and I wouldn’t be surrounded by thousands of Windows based laptops and desktops running custom application written specifically for Windows based machines talking to hundreds of Windows based servers. That fact repeats throughout most of the business world where the cost of having to maintain two or more skill sets with office software applications and development tools is off the chart.

What most people actually do most of the time can be done on a $298 Netbook... Why people buy Windows based systems is a function of simple economics and "utility" value. Both Macs and Mac Books cost significantly more than comparable Windows based configurations. The same CPU, Memory, Graphic card, hard drive(s) in a machine that spends most of its life connected to the network where all that embedded hardware capability goes to waste for 1/3 the cost. Microsoft does not give Windows away these days thus beyond the cuteness factors of the Macs they want a fortune for a Unix OS with a GUI on top. Simple economics, more people own Honda Accords than SL500s for an obvious reason but both will get you to work and back. Second, "utility" value is a function of availability. Macs are scarce compared to Windows based equipment. In 39 years of professional work in IT I've only encountered three Apple PCs outside of a store or academia. I got introduced to an Apple II with Visicalc; I saw the original B&W Cube Mac with the tiny screen on a manager’s desk back in the hay days of IBM ATs. I was using a 13” color screen on an Atari ST520 with the GEM overlay that gave me the functionality of the Mac without the cute premium on the tiny screen. A friend has a Mac Book Pro for which he paid $1800.00 and has a screen size that only teenage eyes could like to look at for very long. Go to any retailer of PCs and the shelves will be packed with Windows titles while the Apple section will fit on a couple shelves if they even have Apple specific software. The bulk of people don’t spend their hard earned money for “cute” and things that are hard to find software for. If you are going to venture into this “need” argument, don’t. If need were the driving basis for the PC revolution we would all still be using Wordstar running on 8 mhz Z80As which stomped the crap out of the 6502 in Apple IIs. The Market spoke two decades ago on which platform they were willing to buy in mass. It wasn’t the Mac. Simple economic tenant says something is worth only what someone is willing to pay for it now. Apple has always been outside the cost/benefit curve with the mass market and the market rules.

Good article from the capitalist point of view. One wonders how many of the Occupidiots have an iPhone in their pocket? Ignorance truly is bliss.
However, the iconoclastic hyperbole aside, Jobs was more an effective marketer than anything else, which is no surprise, since selling the vision is the prime directive of any CEO.
It can truthfully be said that above all, his concepts inspired competitors to greatness, whether or not his often over-priced and somewhat quirky devices were able to keep up with the rivals they inspired. He may not have been the Thomas Edison of our day, but he certainly expanded the boundaries of the possible.
And for that, we thank you, Mr. Jobs. May you rest in peace.

I have followed Apple very closely for quite awhile now and I know of what I speak. So don't come along with your ignorant regurgitated mythology that he was "a marketer more than anything else." That is factually incorrect.
Apple's products are not overpriced. Another myth. But dumb people think that anything which costs more than a Dell POS is expensive. Apple products SHOULD cost more than PCs, just as an Aston Martin should cost more than a Yugo.
And the total cost of ownership of a Mac is lessened by the fact of more daily productivity and less maintenance downtime and costs.
Stop spouting the same old myths.

Please don't applaud Jobs. Yeah he built apple (with help, remember) but he had some very wrong ideas he wanted to push onto the people. Ideas which sought to facilitate more control over our lives while exempting the 'socially aware' (aka other elitists such as Steve Jobs).
Hopefully none of those things will be completed, but death has not been known to stop every liberal.

Dave....Let me remind you of what the computer industry was like before Steven Jobs.
The federal government directly controlled the IT industry by being the majority buyer (+60%) of computer equipment and services through the numerous governmental agencies.
The federal government indirectly controlled the rest of the IT industry because it could dictate the terms of usage to the corporations.
For example, a high-end graphics card or high-speed memory and processors ( above 100 kilocycles / second) were considered controlled munitions grade equipment, one security level down from nuclear weapons.
You used it exactly as written in federal regulations or you want to jail.
Due to the ultra-high costs due to governmental mandates, all computing services were grouped into centralized computer data centers where you submitted your programing job to the priesthood for the batch-processing of program runs.
Services were strictly watched, rationed and controlled to be within governmental dictates.
Steven Jobs along with others freed the IT industry from governmental control by changing the computing paradigm from a deeply centralized processing with multiple users to the personal computer format.
As a result the federal government could no longer control as they could no longer monitor usage.
There were too many computers spread too widely to keep up especially with the IT industry fracturing into every market niche.
Soon the federal government gave up and let the IT industry go, free of all restrictions.
The result of Steven Jobs was the Computer Revolution of the 1980's, 1990's and beyond.
Steven Job's advancement of human freedom will not be properly evaluated for centuries.

Steve Jobs was a Californian, and a Progessive liberal Democrat. He was a strong supporter of both John Kerry and Barrack Obama. If you want to Google his political contributions, you'll find that he gave generously to, among others, Rahm Emmanuel, Edward Kennedy, Bill Bradley and Nancy Pelosi.
He was the epitome of the modern Californian: brilliant, sharp, entreprenuerial, tolerant and progressive. He changed our world, and for the better. We will miss him deeply!

Briefly, Rousseau posited that a "social contract' exists between the government and the people and when the government violates its just limits, the contract is null and void.
Like all Liberals / Marxists / Progressives / Democrats, Elizabeth Warren has bastardized the original intent of the words, "social contract," to justify governmental intrusions into the lives and property of We, the People, which Rousseau would have never countenanced.

Steve Jobs' accomplishments throughout his short life will stand on their merits. My career has been influenced by his considerable creative talents but to this day I've never owned an Apple product and probably won’t. The thrust of the reasons for that are the same as why I won't own a Chevy Volt.
Of all the things Steve Jobs got right about PCs he never understood or respected the free enterprise nature of his creation. Apple's policies from day one were of "control" of every aspect of their products’ lives. The closed architecture of the Mac's kept them in the closet of academia long past the point where the market cared and thus like the Betamax vs. VHS battle (both technologies developed by Sony) the "inferior" product as Sony saw it is what the market bought into in mass. Take away the gadget product line and Apple computers exist almost exclusively in the upscale Yuppie world of academia. I sit surrounded by hundreds of Windows based servers and thousands of Windows based PCs none of which need anything Apple produces today to earn their keep. Apple has begrudgingly over time had to make it possible at extra expense to run Windows software on their closed Unix based systems which speaks to what the dominate software platform is and has been for going on three decades now. A casual look at the software selection on the shelves at any retailer outside of academia will bear out why Apple computers have remained a niche in a very large mass market of products comprised of both hardware and software built around Windows OS. Apple bent over backwards to make the possible when it had the option to embrace an open hardware architecture concept.
Apple's considerable success today is based upon delivering a new generation of I-things every year and willingness of its loyal customer base to not want to be seen with last year's model year after year. Take away the trendy product line of products that focus on fashion and form more than function and value coupled with ridiculously high prices for said functions and Apple will find itself in deep do-do as it has in the past. A co-worker tried to impress me with his IPhone via its apparent speed advantage over my Droid. When I showed him what my Droid could do his IPhone could not do (last year's generation and already obsolete) he was speechless. I'm sure he will get the IPhone 5 after he upgrades to the Iphone4S to replace his IPhone3. Another friend bought a Mac Book Pro for three times the price of a comparable Windows laptop with the same screen size, memory, graphic processor and CPU. He said he bought it because it "works". His father's habit of buying 5+ year old used Windows based laptops with the original OS on them so that each of his three kids could have their own computer probably had some bearing on his belief that hundreds of millions of Windows based PCs don't work. The top of the line Mac all in ones can't hold a candle to the Windows desktops I build to meet my needs. Anyone playing the most popular PC games on Macs?
People like Steve Jobs are often times their own worst enemy. Passionate and creative people tend to be "control freaks" at some level. Building closed architecture products, suing your competition to control the market of similar products are both losing propositions in the long run. Apple's own efforts in court put an end to any possibility of the Mac interface being ported to the open architecture X86 market when that could have meant something. Apple is repeating the same mistake with its IPAD and its suit happy nature against Samsung's Android OS tablet. When IBM tried to control the IBM compatibly market it established, it went from an 80% market share to 8 in a few short years. Apple's share of the PC market stayed in that range for most of its life while the X86 market exploded. Something to be said for, not acting like a monopoly even when your every action says you want to be one. Apples policies over the years have reminded me on many levels of how government approaches a free enterprise market it wishes to control.
Steve Jobs was clearly the life force behind Apple's ultimate success in the niche markets it chased after. If Jobs cultivated a back field of likeminded creative talent at Apple the success story will continue for some time but by the same measure if Apple can't continue to get customers to flock to its annual new generation of I thing gadgets and continue paying the price premiums for its products and services in a rapidly growing market of competitors the fortunes of Apple, formerly known as Apple Computer are a whole lot less certain. History is full of success stories build around one man and the ideas that drive him but soon disappear from the front page when that creative life force is no longer present. Jobs was that kind of force, roses and thorns together. The computer industry is full of Rising Stars that fell to earth when the next great idea couldn’t be brought to market and maintain the same margin of profitability that corporations like Apple and Microsoft are so accustomed to.
I have to wonder how many of the I-Thing generation camping out on Wall Street and elsewhere comprehend that companies like Apple, Microsoft and Intel make two and three times the profit margin as the oil companies and that Mac Book Pro with the 3 inch smaller screen than I have on my Windows powered laptop cost what my annual gasoline bill is? Probably not. They likely didn't pay for their I-Things in the first place.
People like Steve Jobs leave their mark in many ways. The Apple fraternity will surely miss his insight.

Dixie Pixie, I appreciate the complement here but I would not call Apple computers “sports cars” unless you mean that in the adding body accent panels to a Toyota Corolla and calling that the “sport” model. On balance, Macs are no better than the mid range Windows PC with the same CPUs, etc in raw application performance. The highest end Macs today can’t touch the high end Windows’s PCs in overall performance simply because Macs are appliances now. By that I mean they are designed from the outside in and form and fashion trump function. You simply can’t cramp all that graphic card and cpu heat in a Mac chassis and get it out of it. Windows desktops can be configured to some very heavy lifting when required and they are flexible enough to have a long life through adaptions without buying a completely new system. I see the Macs as the two seat Z8 BMWs with 4 of the eight cylinders disconnected while the typical Windows desktop is kind of an SUV. I was kind of a fan of the PowerPC (P5s) in the Macs before they moved over to intel and went back to the closed in cute things. I think many people buy Apples for the same reasons a guy in his 50s or 60s buy his first Vet and puts 4000 miles a year on it…..
I came up through the revolution with a Commodore 64, Atari ST520 (played some with the Commodore Amiga, IBM 286 AT clones (10 mhz), IBM 386-40 (AMD) clone. I left Intel when it started to “SX” stuff and try to control the market through market gimmicks vs. innovation and competition. I’ve been all over the PC world but always found what Apple offered to either be outlandishly priced and restrictive or more of a fashion statement than a tool to do real work on. You are right in one sense, far too many people buy a Mac as a statement more than as a tool to do meaningful things with. Both will get you downtown and back. One will leave change in your pocket so you can do something else useful.

That is two different market niches.

PC people just don't get it. They are always and only about specs. Specs, specs, specs, ad nauseam. It's the whole thing together, how it works, software and hardware in one seamless whole, that matter. Macs have been shown time and time and time again to be superior in HUMAN PRODUCTIVITY.
Translation: Specs aren't the game.
Macs are vastly superior to PCs, and PCs are nothing more than fugly, backwards, clunky rip-offs. PCs are the trailer trash of computers.

Super posts and all have a lot of truth to them. Until recently, Macs were easier to use for both high and low end users. With windows, I found myself continuously fighting the OS and a victim of it's own success with the various flavors out. I worked a company where they had a room full of different Windows computers in order to test their software to ensure it worked on all of them!
However, Windows7 is now autorecognizing all of my digital cameras and phones. I plug in a memory stick, and it works. Most printers also are autodetected. With my Mac, I now find myself doing what I had done with windows in the past: fighting to find drivers that work with my version and playing with configuration files to get peripherals to work.
Sadly, the Mac's main purpose was to drive Windows to improve out of shame.

I was referring to P.K. and others.

That would be the first time Polis Knight has ever been called a " liberal"!

RCV, I've been called worse! :-) Seriously though, I've been accused of being a marxist here in the past.
As the pirates of silicon valley show, both Gates and Jobs were obsessed with protectionism and monopoly. Gates achieved his via branding and market domination and Jobs with hardware and licensing restrictions that did more to hobble than help him. He sold lots of ipods and iphones, but that hardly makes him revolutionary since smartphones and mp3 players have already been around for some time.

Dixie, I am sure you already know this. There are just a world full of Mac Folk and PC Folk, and never the twain shall meet.
I guess it's kinda like the Ford truck guys/gals and the Chevy truck guys/gals. I had the '91 Chevy, Silverado, V8, 5 speed auto trans, short bed, wheel wells, metallic blue, well known around Kissimmee, Florida. . .but I digress. . .
And there will always be the hot weather/cold weather lovin', morning persons/night owls, country music/60s Rock/classical/R&B/Yanni (oh shit, did I really say that)lovers, weathermen are all crazy/honey get online and see how it's gonna be at the beach next week, glass half empty/glass half full, Beatles/Rolling Stones, Levi 501s/designer jeans, issues on which we diverge without dividing.
I love the Apple products and for video editing and art, I hear nothing matches Mac. I use an EVO droid, and just bought a great cheap Gateway laptop on sale. Keywords for me: on sale.
Macs are NEVER on sale, new ones anyway. And. . .I will probably get a droid pad, not IPAD 2.
I think God was awesome to give birth in my lifetime to two such great inventors as Jobs and Gates. I also think how sad that they never proclaim(ed) Him as their source.
Gates still has time to see the Light of the World, and I wonder if Steve Jobs got a chance to before he left the planet. I still hope so, after all, the "good" theif caught Christ just as he was leaving. Maybe Jobs did too.
