Heirloom Scionwood:
If you are interested in grafting, or rejuvenating your old trees with different heirloom varieties, we suggest a few great sources for apple scion wood:
The nonprofit Tower Hill Botanic Center in Boylston, Massachusetts is the site of The Davenport Collection , a preservation orchard of pre-twentieth century apple varieties.
Comprised of four orchards located on the Front Range of Colorado, The Masonville Orchard is a small family operation that specializes in unique heirloom apples and pears.  Masonville sells high quality fruit in season, and scionwood.  Masonville’s scionwood is harvested in February.
Alternatively, Maple Valley Orchards also specializes in antique apples, propagated at their nursery in Northeastern Wisconsin.
