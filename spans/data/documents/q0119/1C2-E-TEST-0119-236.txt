13 May, 2008 @ 6:21 am by Lioncourt
On Thursday, 15/May/2008, Apple Inc. will be opening its third Apple retail store in Boston, Massachusetts. The new store, located at 815 Boylston Street, will open its doors to the public at 6:00 PM.  Like most grand-openings, T-shirts and other give-aways will be available to those who attend the event while supplies last.  The Boylston Street store is one of the largest Apple Stores, sporting three floors.
Apple retail stores are a great place to get a hands-on experience with Mac OS X and VoiceOver.
