Calculations are based on public records filed with the Federal Election Commission of all individual contributions of at least $200. In charts comparing contributions by the party of the recipient, only contributions where the recipient's party could be identified are included. In some cases, contributions that are over the FEC's limits have been reassigned to other donors. Data is current through the third quarter of 2011.
