The Boston Redevelopment Authority today gave approval to Apple Computer Inc. to build a store near the Prudential Center.
Apple is proposing to demolish the building at 815 Boylston St., recently home to a Copy Cop store, and construct a three-story, 21,350- square-foot space with a glass facade and green roof.
The project also calls for sidewalk improvements along Boylston. Construction for the store is expected to last a year.
The proposal still needs to go before the city's Zoning Board of Appeals.
Apple has six stores in Massachusetts. This would be the company's first in Boston.

The Back Bay Architectural Commission backed preliminary designs for Boston's first Apple Store earlier this year.
