McAlister Drive's first song on their Made on a Mac presentation/set. Live at Boylston Street Apple store 10-1-10
Lyrics:
As her accent gets stronger
I miss her a little longer
But there is a happiness that waits
Till the next time I see Mary Kate
We sour as the time passes
And I just can't remember when
But there is still something that always lasts
With her and the way we had been
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, girl
I'll wait for my Mary Kate
You talk to the one's who don't know
The one's I could never show
Why we make the perfect two
It's just us two no matter what we want to do
We sour as the time passes
And I just can't remember when
But there is still something that always lasts
With her and the way we had been
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, girl
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, babe
I'll wait for my Mary Kate
Just be strong
Babe, it won't be long
Just be strong
Just an ocean skip away
Just an ocean skip away
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, girl
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, babe
I'll wait for my Mary Kate
Just an ocean skip away
Just an ocean skip away
Just an ocean skip away
