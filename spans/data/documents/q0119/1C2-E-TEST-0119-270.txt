What's great about it: wifi, youtube, all the apps, large screen, touch screen scratchproofness
What's not so great: shorter battery life, back scratches easily
This is my 3rd ipod and it is the best. There are apps for everything under the sun. The screen is amazingly clear and the browser is fast. I gave the price a 4 because the 3.0 firmware is 10 dollars and I think it should 215 instead of 250. The durability is 3 stars because that shiny back that looks gorgeous will never look the same after 1 hour. It is very easy to use and has great features. The battery will last longer if you go to settings and turn the wifi off. The back problem can easily be solved with a 20 dollar case. I would suggest you buy screen protectors with it and you will be good to go. One more thing, no matter what anyone tells you, DO NOT JAILBREAK YOUR IPOD.
I would recommend this to a friend!
