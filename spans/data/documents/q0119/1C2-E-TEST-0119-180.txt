Leave your iPhone on the T?  Forget your iPad at Starbucks?  Lose your iPod Touch at Boston Sports Club?  Worry no more Boston.  Whether you left your iPhone on the Red Line headed out to Quincy, your iPad at the Starbucks on Boylston at Berkeley, or your iPod Touch on the Stairmaster at the One Bulfinch Boston Sports Club, Apple’s iOS 4.3 went “Gold Master” to Developers today.  Apple is planning iOS 4.3 to be released soon and include the Find My iPhone/iPad/iPod feature for free!
Lauded as the savior of many iDevices, the “Find My…” feature has long been a pay-for feature of Apple’s Mobile Me service.  Though pending rumors of changes coming to Mobile Me see the “Find My…” feature transitioning as the first free service.  One caveat is what devices will get 4.3?
Following its pattern of phasing out old devices by withholding updates, Apple plans to release iOS 4.3 for the iPhone 3Gs, the AT&T iPhone 4, the Third and Fourth Generation iPod Touch, the iPad, and the iPad 2.  Got one of those devices?  Then get ready to turn on this great free feature soon and get excited for the great stories that follow.  Emitting a loud tone and vibrating, you’ll be able to find your device fast and save the cash of having to run over to our #10 Apple Store in Chestnut Hill and buying a replacement.
