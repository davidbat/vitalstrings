Trying to find Apple Accessory (MBP) Retailers in Boston, MA
Hey all. I know this is probably going to be looked over by a lot of people, but I am tired of running around this city trying to find what I am looking for. Does anyone know of any retail stores (chain or not) besides the Apple Store that sell MBP accessories like palmguard/wrist pads and keyboard covers? I am in need of a new palmguard for my early 08 MBP and have searched high and low throughout the city for the past 2 weeks trying to find stores that carry them. The Apple Store in Copley doesn't carry any of the "original" MBP anymore, and even if they did, the ones they carry are too thick (after Apple Store replaced my screen, I can no longer close the MBP). I have check MicroCenter, Best Buy, The Coop, and a Copley Apple repair center for them and I have come up with nothing.
Again, I doubt anyone will be able to help, but if you live in the Boston area and can point me towards a store that carries palmguards (preferbly Moshi PalmGuard or Isis Dei Hand-Plant), I would be very greatful.
Thanks ahead of time to anyone who can help me out.
