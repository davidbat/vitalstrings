Apple holiday hours
In anticipation of the holiday season, Apple has posted the extended holiday hours for its chain of retail stores.  Exact hours are dependent on individual stores, but increase in length as December 25th approaches.  Some stores in cities such as Los Angeles and Newark are expected to stay open until 10 or 11PM as soon as November 28th, coinciding with the "Black Friday" shopping peak.
Most locations should retain normal or slightly extended hours until mid-December however, when 10 and 11PM hours will become common through to December 23rd.  Christmas Eve hours should be scaled back, and most stores will be closed Christmas Day, with the exception of New York City's flagship Fifth Avenue shop , which is open all day year-round.
Apple has meanwhile posted a teaser image on its retail site and distributed e-mail, reminding people of its annual Black Friday sale.  Apple offers sharp discounts both at retail and online during the event, but unlike most vendors, refuses to announce prices until they take effect.
