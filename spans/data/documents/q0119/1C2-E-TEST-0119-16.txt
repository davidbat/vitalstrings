Summary
Apple Shines Through Boylston Street
The Boston Redevelopment Authority has finally approved the construction of a new Apple store on Boylston Street in Back Bay, which could be done as early as December 2007. Not only will you be able to wait in frustration for hours at the "Genius Bar", but you'll be able to join the scads of Bostonians you try to avoid in said line. Sweet.
Admittedly, the building (a giant glass cube) is alluring. Moreso, though, The Boston Globe got the right idea in hoping that the Apple Store (and recently completed ICA) signal a trend of Boston accepting more contemporary architecture:
The building makes a statement about the city. Boston isn’t yet fully embracing contemporary architecture, but the store’s arrival shows the city is willing to experiment with it. It’s one thing to put a gorgeously innovative building such as the Institute of Contemporary Art down on the waterfront, where there’s a clean slate; it’s far riskier to put an unapologetically modern building in the historic Back Bay, not far from the neighborhood’s Victorian town houses and Gothic Revival columns.
So you take it there, Boston...be bold, be brave, try on those Emperor's New Clothes. And if you wouldn't mind, how about hooking Bostonist up with a couple new laptops while you're at it.
