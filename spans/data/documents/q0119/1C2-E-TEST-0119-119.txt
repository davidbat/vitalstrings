Our History
In 1906 Caswell and Etta Wood bought                              the property which consisted of a traditional farm                              house with all post and beam barn and wind driven                              well. Their only surviving child, Edith Wood, a well                              known elementary school teacher in town married “the boy next door”, Norman Sawyer, from the Sawyer                              farmstead of Mary Had a Little Lamb fame. In the 1940's                              Norman planted the standard orchard of mostly macintosh                              apples still used today for PYO and cider apples.                              Norman and Edith’s oldest grand daughter, Diane,                              and her husband Rick moved here in 1989. They were                              the first to make it a retail farm operation. It started                              with a single PYO pumpkin patch for their 3 daughters                              to earn enough money to have a horse. The farm has                              changed and grown with the family
Now Clearview Farm is a 32 acre seasonal orchard                                and farm stand run by Rick and Diane Melone. It                                is located at 4 Kendall Hill Road in Sterling, Massachusetts.                                This farm has an interesting historical background                                because of it’s ties to the home of Mary E.                                Sawyer, the little girl in the nursery rhyme “Mary                                Had a Little Lamb.” A statue in the center                                of Sterling commemorates Mary and her lamb. Diane                                is a sixth generation descendant of Mary and currently                                owns the Sawyer homestead. Rick                                still farms some of the original Sawyer farmland.                                This site has been a farm for 200 years and in this                                family 6 generations. The farm includes: 20 acres                                of apples, 4 acres of peaches and nectarines, 12                                acres of pumpkins, 6 acres raspberries and blueberries,                                2 acres of other vegetables. In addition, 17 acres                                leased orchards and fields. Farmer Rick is a very                                capable orchardist and adds about 60 trees per year                                to upgrade the orchards and reflect the changes                                in consumer demand for variety. The farm currently                                has 27 varieties of apples. The farm is not certified                                organic due in part to the fact that orchards don’t                                lend themselves to crop rotation, an essential part                                of organic farming. Rick is certified in Integrated                                Pest Management (IPM) methods and uses them to grow                                their orchards, fruits, and vegetables. IPM promotes                                minimized pesticide use by using environmentally                                sound practices. This combined with crop rotation                                and natural fertilizer use helps Clearview Farm                                produce a healthy product.
