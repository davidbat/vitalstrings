Fedco is a cooperative seed and tree company up in Maine with one of the most amazing selections of apple trees anywhere, including many very rare and traditional New England varieties. Their trees catalog has a wealth of knowledge regarding the attributes of these varieties, their suitability to different climates, and lots of growing tips.
Also note that in most cases, a single tree will not bear much fruit, because most varieties are not self-pollinating. This means that you need more than one variety (and ones that bloom around the same time) to be planted in close proximity for pollination purposes.
