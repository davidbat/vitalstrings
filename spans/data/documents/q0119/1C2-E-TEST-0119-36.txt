Apple Street Farm Dinners
Each month we will celebrate the freshest ingredients of the season with a special dinner showcasing the organic produce, poultry and eggs fresh from the fields. Arrive at Apple Street Farm and take some time to explore the beautiful grounds while enjoying a seasonal cocktail and hors d’oeuvres prepared by Chef and Farmer Frank McClelland of L’Espalier and Sel de la Terre restaurants. Then, take a seat in the open air (or under a tent in the case of inclement weather) and enjoy a four-course meal with a trio of wine pairings.
