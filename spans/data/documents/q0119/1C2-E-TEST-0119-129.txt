Speaking the Truth in Love...

I just recently heard of this show (through Wretched...) and I have listened to every single episode over the past couple weeks.  Mike Abendroth (and Steve Cooley) are not afraid to speak the truth (even if it means stepping on some Evangelical toes), however they do it in a very sound-minded way--always letting the cripture have the final say on the topics every day!  American Evangelicalism needs more men like this to speak truth over the airwaves--and drive us back to the Scriptures!!  Great show guys!!

Pastor Mike is sweet and sensitive yet manly all at the same time. This show is so good I would pay to keep it on the air

Love this Podcast--a LOT! Theology is sound and grounded on Biblical facts, very little on opinionated interpretations. This tremendously helpful podcast is perfect for understanding cardinal points of Scripture.
I truly wish more people listened to this, and more podcasts were like this with as much substance and unwavering belief. I also want to add that we as Christ's followers who profess the Christian faith need to grow, and grow, and grow, until the end of this temporal sojourn, in the faith. Imbibing this will help you do just that.
I am especially grateful for the uncompromising outreach (see Already Compromised and Already Gone  by Ken Ham). Keep up the great work and may God bless you immensely for it.
The reviewer below me is misconstruing our role as Christ's followers. The Bible, though not completely perfect (this is a result of humans flawed nature after the fall), is God's special revelation to us, and for this reason alone, deserves our full attention to the utmost. If you don't regard it as having this intrinsic sacrament, then you are, by definition, not a Christian who serves a real purpose in the Christian faith, which includes work akin to Gospel outreacher's in this podcast. It certainly is not inclusive of claims that other fellow Christians are commiting perversion and idolatry by adhering in Christlike manner to the Scriptures! How kooky of the reviewer to say that.
