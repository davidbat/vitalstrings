Apple Boylston Street, Boston, USA
Architect Bohlin Cywinski Jackson
Client Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA
We were responsible for the entire structure of this new five storey building in the historic centre of Boston, Massachusetts.
The new piled basement sits below the waterline in the challenging Back Bay area. Careful consideration of the foundations was needed to prevent damage to fragile buildings on either side which sit on timber piles.
Above street level, the main structure is a steel frame. It derives its lateral stability from frame action. This avoids the need for concrete cores and other vertical structures in the central area of the main retail space.
The glass façade has a continuous deep recess at ground floor level. Consequently, the massive glass frame supporting the façade is designed as a moment frame, taking vertical support at the roof level only and horizontal restraint at the first floor. The result is a dramatic glass box applied to the front of the building, evoking the 5th Avenue Cube, with an apparently simple glass storefront at street level.
A two storey glass spiral stair sits in the central space. Similar to the 14th St store in New York, this is supported at floor level with cantilevering glass beams spanning across a central glass drum.
