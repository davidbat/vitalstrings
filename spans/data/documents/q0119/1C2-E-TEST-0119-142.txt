Tower Hill Botanic Garden
The beautifully designed gardens and broad range of plants laid out by the Worcester County Horticultural Society at Tower Hill attract visitors from far and wide. There are more than 350 species and varieties of trees and shrubs in the lawn garden to delight in and to admire, as well as perennials, annuals, and an orchard containing 119 pre-twentieth-century apple varieties. In addition to all this unique and colorful vegetation is a nature trail, often overlooked by visitors, which winds in and out of woodlands, meadows, exposed cliffs, and low-lying marshes. The diverse terrain allows for a wide variety of wildlife, and the staff at Tower Hill has constructed a wildlife garden to attract birds, bats, and butterflies as well as a rock garden and childrenâ€™s garden. Highlights: Gardens, views, fruit trees, meadows, woodlands, visitor center.
