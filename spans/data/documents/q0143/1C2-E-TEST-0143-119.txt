Ewok Cat!
October 27, 2011
We’ve already seen dogs that look like Wookiees , so it was only a matter of time before we started seeing cats dressed as Ewoks. Here’s an especially cute feline that would make Wicket proud.
Megan from Stellar Four Blog made this adorkable costume for her cat:
This year, I opted not to carve a pumpkin. Instead, I channeled my crafty impulses into making something for Lilly.  Something awesome. I made her a Wicket costume.
Thank goodness Ewok headdresses are so poorly sewn
(Ewoks may have opposable thumbs but they’re still pretty bad with a needle), it makes my ineptitude look authentic.
