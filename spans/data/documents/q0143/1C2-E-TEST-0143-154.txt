Description:
Nyub Nyub, folks, it's the Ewok Village, one of the largest Kenner action figure toys. Despite the fact that nearly nothing action-oriented happened at the site in Return of the Jedi, you still had to appreciate this toy version of the Ewoks' treetop abode-- it was a veritable Xanadu of Star Wars cuddliness! On top of that, it came with a bevy of neat features, including a plastic boulder that hung from a dead branch. Seriously, it just hung there. Also included were a fake fire pit, a capture net, an elevator and a litter for carrying around C-3PO. (C-3PO, remember, masqueraded as an Ewok god in Return of the Jedi. Apparently, the Ewoks were in the habit of worshipping effeminate robots.)
It's not incredibly easy to find this toy loose since many of its parts were small and easily lost. Kenner recycled the tooling for the Ewok Village for their early '90s Robin Hood line of toys. The later toy is distinguished by a green plastic garnish meant to represent leaves. (Click here for more information on recycled Star Wars toys.)
