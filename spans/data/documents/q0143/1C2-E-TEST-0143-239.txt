Star Wars: Ewok Adventures
(1985)
This live-action double bill executive produced by George Lucas stars the adorable but incredibly tough Ewoks from the Star Wars saga. Both Caravan of Courage and The Battle of Endor earned Emmys for their visual effects. In Caravan of Courage, two children on an interplanetary search for their parents land on the forest moon of Endor. In The Battle of Endor, the Ewoks and a hermit (Wilford Brimley) protect a girl from an evil space witch.
