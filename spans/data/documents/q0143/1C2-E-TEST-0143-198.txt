Re: ewok sound files?
In the scene where Leia first meets him, they then get hit by a Biker Scout.
They take cover and Wicket pokes his head up from behind the log, saying "ee cha wa wa".
There's another blaster... errr... blast and he yelps something like, "ee cha wa wa yu... yub yub" as he buggers off, leaving Leia to get jumped by the Biker Boy.
Man, I haven't seen the film since I was around 11.
How the hell do I know this stuff??!!
