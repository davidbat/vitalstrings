Background
From a Kenner Toy Fair catalog:
Straight from the forest ENDOR and the kingdom of the EWOKS, it's Kenner's  own EWOK Village. Our playset features an operated "net" trap for capturing  wayfaring REBELS, a working "vine" elevator and tree escape chute, carrying  litter 2 huts, even a "campfire." Kids love reenacting their favorite EWOK  scenes from the new movie with this new Kenner playset.
The Ewok village was the largest of any playset that Kenner produced.  It is one of the easier playsets to acquire today, but with as many small parts as this set has, it's often tough to find a complete one.
