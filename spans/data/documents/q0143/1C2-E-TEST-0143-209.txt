Here at OCD (Obscure Character of the Day) Headquarters, we're scouring the globe for those forgotten heroes of pop culture the one-minute wonders who show up and rock our collective world, then disappear back into the mists. We're always on the lookout for the next Pop Tart appearance.
Yesterday, we profiled the beef stick-chowing, farmer's tanned Doug, from the amazing Terry Zwigoff movie Ghost World. Today, we are going near and dear to the hearts of IGN fans: Star Wars, and more specifically, Return of the Jedi. That's right, it's only Day Two and already we're mining the depths of George Lucas' hallowed sixer.
Today we present Obscure Character of the Day #2: Dead Ewok .
Actually, on Day Two of a feature, it may already be jumping the shark to list any character from Jedi. After all, roughly 85% of the IGN office regards the first trilogy as holy scripture, and anyone who grew up when Jedi was in theaters will remember the saddest moment of the series by far: the fallen Ewok warrior.
No matter what your feelings on the Ewoks as a race (Lucas had originally intended Endor to be none other than Kashyyyk, the Wookiee home planet), Dead Ewok is a heart-rending reminder of the tragedy of war. With one poke from his teddy bear cohort, Dead Ewok was cemented in the minds of a generation as a symbol of the brutality of conflict and the utter pointlessness of the Battle of Endor. Empire, Rebellion what does it all mean if an anthropomorphic, furry forest creature loses its life?
