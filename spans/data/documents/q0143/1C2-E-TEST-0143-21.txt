Edit
The first Ewok minifigures were released in 2002 , in the first Ewok Attack set. The Ewok LegoÂ® minifigures were smaller in size than the normal minifigures were. This was achieved by giving them a normal body but shorter legs. All the Ewok minifiures were made the same, with short legs, a normal body, and a head piece that covered over the torso to make the appearance of fur. The original minifigures had only one or two colors on their bodies. One of they was all brown, while another one was brown with a tan face and hood. In 2009 , LEGO began printing the Ewok minifigures with much more detail. The minifigures' hood color was seperate from the face and ears, as well as having different colored eyes and nose. Even more detail was later put on, to make the appearance of strings, and other extra vanity items.
