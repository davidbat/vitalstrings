Originally called "Revenge              of the Jedi: Game I".  A prototype box with this title exists.
 
Star Wars: Ewok Adventure was one of the games everyone was sure existed          somewhere, but didn't turn up until 1997 when a collector had a friend          whose father worked at Parker Brothers give him one of the most sought          after 2600 games in existence.  Unfortunately the rom was never distributed          for various reasons ranging from fear of lawsuits from Lucasfilm to the          possibility of selling it on Ebay.  While this prototype was never          seen again (most likely sold to a collector in a private deal), a PAL          version was discovered in 2001 and finally dumped for the gaming community          to enjoy.  Recently another NTSC prototype was discovered in a thrift          shop near Boston, and will hopefully be dumped soon.
 
The gameplay can best be described as a combination of Sky Jinks and          Frontline (if you can picture that I'm impressed).  You control an          Ewok glider and must attempt to destroy the shield generator bunker hidden on the forest moon of Endor.  This can be done in one of two ways,          either you can land your hang glider on the bunker doorstep after picking          up some explosives from your buddy in the woods, or you can take control          of an AT-ST Walker or Speeder Bike to do the job.  Of course the          Imperials aren't just going to hand over a Walker or Speeder Bike because          you asked nicely, your going to have to take it from them "Ewok Commando"          style.
 
Your first task is to control the glider and not to crash into the various          forest obstacles (trees, rivers, and boulders), not to mention the Imperial          forces (speeders, walkers, and stormtroopers).  The glider can be          controlled by pushing left or right to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise,          and by pressing up and down to either dive or climb.  Diving downwards          puts you directly into dangers path but lets you gain speed, climbing          upwards will take you high above the danger but you'll begin to loose          speed.  The controls take a bit of getting used to, but become almost          second nature after awhile. Scattered throughout the forest are large          swirls, which will instantly boost your altitude without a reduction in          speed if you fly over them.  Think of them as giant forest fans.
 
Your Ewok buddy isn't defenseless; he's carrying several          large bags of rocks to rain down destruction upon the enemy (maybe that's          why he has trouble getting off the ground?).  To sling rocks at your          enemies simply press the fire button, but be careful as you only have          a limited supply (indicated at the bottom of the screen).  If you run out of rocks you can reload by flying low over a boulder screen.  You          can also avoid enemies all together by flying over them, but the taller          the enemy the harder it is to fly over them.
 
Of course if you go about destroying all the vehicles you          see you'll never be able to infiltrate the bunker, you need to take control          of an enemy vehicle.  To confiscate an enemy vehicle you must carefully          fly over it while exactly matching its altitude (you can use the shadows          on the ground to help determine you altitude).  This is rather tricky,          but if you succeed you'll have your very own Imperial vehicle to smash          the bunker with.  Unfortunately you'll soon notice that Ewoks can't          drive worth shit, and the vehicle will basically be out of control.  You          can loosely affect which way the vehicle is going with the joystick, but          it's mostly a matter of luck.  If you're skillful enough you can          take the vehicle to the bunker for the final showdown.  The arrow          at the bottom of the screen will show you which way the bunker lies and          will disappear when you're directly beneath it.
 
The bunker screen is really easy, simply drive your vehicle          up to or land your hang glider the doorway.  You'll see a lone          Ewok run out of the bunker and it will blow up.  After this you'll          be taken to level two which has more obstacles to avoid and now the enemy          fires at you!  Also take note that from level two onward you must          pick up explosives from your Ewok buddy in the woods to blow up the bunker          with the hang glider (destroying it with a vehicle doesn't required the          extra firepower).  From level three onward your glider will initially          be hard to control until you fly over a fellow Ewok in the forest (I guess          he fixes your glider).  You can tell if your glider has been "fixed"          because the screen boarder will change from blue to red.  If you're          bored you can find programmer Larry Gelberg's initials hidden in the game          by flying all the way to the bottom mountain range from any "green" screen.          You'll see the initials LG beneath the mountains, but they'll look like          TG since the PAL version doesn't scroll far enough down to reveal the          bottom part of the L.  If you complete the sixth level, at the start          of every new level you'll see the words "Tribe Member" indicating that          you have way too much time on your hands.
 
Ewok Adventure is a fun yet challenging game.  Unlike          most other PB games which were based off arcade games, Ewok Adventure          didn't have to live up to an already existing game so there is not feeling          of being "let down" when the conversion didn't go well.  About the          only complaint I can make is the lack of in-game music.  Programmer          Larry Gelberg explains the lack of music this way:
"With Ewok Adventure, I always wish that we had enough room for music,              but that was a fairly graphics intensive game, so we didn't have enough              memory (even with our whopping 8K!) for tunes.
 
So why was Ewok Adventure never released?  One word: Controls.  According          to Larry:
"I had this artistic vision of the purity of the hang-glider controls              - forward dives and speeds you up, back climbs and slows you down,              and catching thermals every now and then maintained your altitude.  The marketing weasels either didn't get it or just didn't like              it.  They tried time and time again to get me to put in a mode              where you just go in the direction where you point the joystick.  But              I was young and arrogant and refused, and they ultimately killed the              game.  Sorry, everyone."
So because some marketing weasels couldn't figure out how to control the          glider the game was ultimately cancelled.  How's that for management          at work?  It's a pity that Ewok Adventure never got released, because          it's simply awesome, and the best Star Wars game overall for the 2600.  Well at least we can finally play Ewok Adventure after a 20-year          absence, and it was well worth the wait.
