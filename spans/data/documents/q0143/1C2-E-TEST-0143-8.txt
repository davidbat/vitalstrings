MAD vs CANCER auction.
June 29th Blog update. 2012.
One of the best people around, and a damn good friend of Living Proof  Magazine, MAD (ESC KD WH NSF crews; co-founder of the Infamous Mag;  respected Philadelphia artist; and all-around good dude) was recently  diagnosed with cancer. As you know, cancer is a bitch in way more ways  than one.
MAD had no insurance nor workman’s compensation, and, accordingly, he  is in major financial distress. While his medical bills are  astronomical, there is an immediate need for financial support for his  basic costs of living and more. MAD has two beautiful children to  support, his home and family to care for, and with week-to-week  inpatient Chemotherapy, can not work a normal job, even IF his weakness  and nausea weren’t a factor. So, he needs Help.
That’s why we called on our extended network of awesome artist to  donate a little something to help raise funds for MAD’s continued  treatment! Check out the goods below and bid big! Or if you just want to  donate,
