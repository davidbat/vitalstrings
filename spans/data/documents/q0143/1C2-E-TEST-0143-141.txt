Let's play chess.
My girlfriend of 16 months and I always used the term "play chess" whenever we were going to have sex. We made that up because I'm quite a fan while she wasn't, so whenever I tried to convince her into a match she'd seduce me in order to not play.  As of today, over two months after the break-up, I always have an erection whenever I'm up against a female.
