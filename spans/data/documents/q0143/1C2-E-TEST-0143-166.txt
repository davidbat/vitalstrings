Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2  may not have been met with the best reviews, but there is definitely a beacon of hope for the game. A small, furry beacon of hope. The executive producer, Gio Corsi of LucasArts Singapore, has confirmed upcoming DLC will feature Ewoks.
The upcoming SW: The Force Unleashed 2 DLC will not only feature Ewoks, you'll be able to fight them. Hopefully we won't just get to "battle" with them but also be able to hack off limbs and torment them with force powers. The DLC will take place on Endor, the Ewok inhabited moon featured in Return of the Jedi. It will serve as an "infinite storyline", like the Hoth Bonus Mission in the first T he Force Unleashed game. For those of you haven't played the first game, Hoth Bonus Mission offered an alternate take on a battle shown in the Empire Strikes back. While it's not canon, it will answer the question of "What if?" or more specifically, "What if you could brutally kill Ewoks with lightsabers?"
“Who knows where the infinite storyline can take Starkiller, there are so many possibilities but right now we are focusing on the Endor Bonus Mission,” Corsi said in a recent interview with IGN . Leading us to believe that despite The Force Unleashed 3 seemingly unlikely there is still plenty of content to be released. The DLC will also offer new achievements.
The Endor Bonus Mission DLC is planned for later this year. Are the promises of new DLC enough to justify the purchase of this game? What other DLC packs would you like to see? Jar Jar Binks, Ewok crossover?
