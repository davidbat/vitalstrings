Wicket and his fellow Ewoks live in a village built high in the Endor trees. This keeps them off the forest floor, where dangerous predators roam at night. A bit of a loner, Wicket scouts the forests by himself during the day.

C-3PO
C-3PO was afforded a place of honor in the Ewok village, for the Ewoks mistook him to be some sort of god. Threepio was carried aloft on a wooden throne hastily built by the Ewoks in his honor.

Luke Skywalker
After the destruction of the Death Star and the defeat of the Empire, Luke Skywalker celebrated the victory with the Rebels and Ewoks. He saw the Force spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda and his father, Anakin, during the celebration.
Princess
Leia Organa
Princess Leia Organa was welcomed in the Ewok village as she was brought there by Wicket. She tried to convince the Ewoks that her friends were not intruders -- and definitely not food for a banquet.
