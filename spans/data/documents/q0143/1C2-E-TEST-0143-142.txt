'Dancing with the Stars' results week 2: Save the 'Ewok' edition
The Comedian, the Italian beauty and the 'Ewok' land in the bottom three

"Dancing with the Stars" is getting plenty of airtime this season, with an hourlong recap (replaying, essentially) of Monday night's show leading into a second hour of results. All this hype is designed to torture viewers and draw out the eventual elimination, which occurs in approximately the last 11 seconds of the show. And let's be honest -- that's what we really care about!
Before we got to the meat of the episode, we were distracted by musical performances and flashy pro dances (with lots of feathers this week). Viewers also got an exclusive peek at the DWTS "Training Crib" complete with an inflatable children's pool "spa," rooftop impromptu driving range, sweet communal refrigerator and extensive wardrobe archive introduced by (who else?) Carson Kressley.
Speaking of Carson, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found out that he was safe to dance another week — not because he's a great ballroom technician, but because he is pure entertainment.
Not as lucky this week were those in the dreaded bottom three: David Arquette, Chaz Bono and Elisabetta Canalis.
Despite a vastly improved performance and review from the judges, Elisabetta was at a disadvantage because she's not a well-known celebrity to most U.S. viewers. And as such, she was sent packing.
Celebrity helped Chaz on the other hand. He earned the lowest score from the judges, but was saved by viewers' votes.
It was obvious that Chaz's partner, Lacey Schwimmer, drastically simplified their routine to compensate for Chaz's strained joints, which were audibly cracking during their taped rehearsal. The result lacked excitement or, as described by judge Bruno Tonioli, was like watching "a little Ewok dance with Princess Leia."
