Ewok!
This, ladies and gentlemen, is Lily -- the 5th title holder of the Six Apart Cutest Dog award.  She is being held by her owner Jamie, who I am now insanely jealous of.
Lily is a "Goldendoodle" a mix of a Golden Retriever and a Poodle.  She is indeed like a live teddy bear, except much more soft.  I would definitely jump in front of traffic for this dog.
