"A few days before we were going away on vacation (to Trick or Treat at some amusement parks), I still didn't have a costume for my son. He reminds us of an Ewok, so I thought this would be perfect. I looked a few other places, but found the best value here at Costume Express. Plus, the costume was shipped to me cheaper than and faster than I ever would have expected. When the costume arrived, I was very pleased with the look and feel of the fabric. It fit our 'lil guy perfectly with space underneath for a sweatshirt and sweatpants (he is slightly small for his age of 10 months). Our Halloween was saved, for sure!"
