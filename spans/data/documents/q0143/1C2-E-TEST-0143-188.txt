- Where can I find an Ewok costume for my dog?
Where can I find an Ewok costume for my dog? I've searched ALL over! My dog's face looks exactly like an ewok's face, so I always wanted to dress him up as one, but I've been searching for three months now and no luck. Please help.
A You really only have to get a piece of thin leather or brown  course fabric.. and make a Hoodie type thing, where his ears will come through... look here , you can probably make it yourself.. http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dewok%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8&w=234&h=357&imgurl=luzoscura.tripod.com%2Frebels%2Fwicket1.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fluzoscura.tripod.com%2Frebels&size=23.9kB&name=wicket1.jpg&p=ewok&type=jpeg&no=10&tt=64,831&oid=6884dd4d1da07466&ei=UTF-8  or like a grain sack...
- Where can I find a ewok dog costume? Have been looking and only get pictures but no where 2 buy one.?
I think my dog would make a really cute ewok (star wars) for Halloween, I started looking online and found two pictures of a cute ewok dog costume but can't find a site where I can buy one.  Can anyone help? http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/pets/dog-star-wars-costumes
A I am guessing the costume on that website was handmade. Looks like they just took a teddy bear and ripped out the face. You have a couple months, get sewing!  Or, just get a Shih Tzu. They're always wearing an Ewok costume :)
