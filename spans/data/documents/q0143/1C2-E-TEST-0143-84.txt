About Ewok Rabbitry
The Rabbit "Barn" :)
I used to keep my rabbits on my back porch with shading and fans going, but it is just to hot down in florida, so I decided to invest in a shed that has air conditioning to keep the bunnies not only cool, but improve their condition and overall health.
I currently have a 45 hole rabbitry. 10 of those cages primarily for mothers and their babies.
These aren't the greatest pictures, but it is a work in progress!
What we feed
Currently I feed all the rabbits PenPals 16%, which has made a major impact on my rabbitry. I switched over from Purina Show feed because I found myself losing too many rabbits. As soon as I switched over, you could see that they had much better flesh condition and their coats felt much smoother. They also started eating more food!
As an additional aid to keeping them in good show condition, I feed them "Koenig's Kountry Konditioner" which is a mixture of oats, barley, wheat, soybeans, black oil sunflower seeds, flaxseed, vitamin D, and much more. You can purchase this nutritional supplement off of Koenig's website, or you can make an equivalent of your own :)
