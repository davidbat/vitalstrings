Ewoks: The Battle For Endor
In 1985, George Lucas, with directors Jim and Ken Wheat, returned Star Wars to the small screen with the sequel to Caravan of Courage:  The Ewok Adventure.  In this second venture, Wicket and Cindel must face off against the evil Marauders.  At the beginning of the story, the Marauders capture all the Ewoks, and kill Cindel's family.  The duo isn't at it alone, though.  On their journey they meet Noa, an old hermit who is also looking for a way home, and his small but fast companion Teek.  Together, the four friends try to rescue the Ewoks, facing off against a whole army of evil Marauders led by King Terak, a witch named Charal, and a bloodthirsty dragon.
Ewoks: The Battle For Endor is a surprisingly good television movie.  It could have just as well been released in theaters.  This movie is just as good as the first Ewoks movie, and many will argue that it is just as good as the four other Star Wars movies, as well!  I, for one, have watched this movie many times since its original airing, and have enjoyed it almost as much as the original Star Wars trilogy.  And that's exactly why I wanted to pay this little tribute to it, hoping it will remain a cult classic for future generations to come.
