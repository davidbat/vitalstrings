This                        Star Wars spin off line had its own cartoon series which                        lasted two seasons. The Family Hut, Fire Cart and Woodland                        Wagon were released for Kenner's pre-school line and also                        included non-articulated figures. A second series was featured                        in the 1986 Kenner Toy Fair catalog but was never produced.                        These were Bondo, Chituhr, Weechee, Morag, Chief Chirpa,                        and Paploo.
