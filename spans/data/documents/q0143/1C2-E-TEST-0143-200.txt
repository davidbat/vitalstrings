PATTERN for Ewok - Star Wars Mini Amigurumi
From lucyravenscar
*PLEASE NOTE - THIS LISTING IS FOR A CROCHET PATTERN NOT THE FINISHED ARTICLE.*
This is an original crochet pattern of my design to make a cute little Ewok. They're not big anyway, but this guy is only 3‚Äù tall, so you can pop him in your pocket and take him anywhere. Or equip him with a spear (cocktail stick) and he will guard your computer for you.
The pattern is fairly straightforward and suitable for beginner/intermediate crocheters. The instructions are detailed and easy to follow if you know the basic stitches and techniques used to make amigurumi.
The pattern will be sent to you as a PDF file (you will need Adobe Acrobat to open it) within 24 hours in most cases. Let me know the email address you would like it sent to when you place your order. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have as you are making it.
You will need:
25g mid-brown yarn, double knitting weight.
25g rust brown yarn, double knitting weight.
25g beige yarn, double knitting weight.
Small amount dark brown yarn.
Stuffing.
1 pair 7.5 mm black safety eyes.
Wire pet brush (optional - to brush yarn to give a furry effect).
Tapestry needle.
