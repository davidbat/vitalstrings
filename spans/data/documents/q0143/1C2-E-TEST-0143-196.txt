I ordered this costume for my 2-year-old in the largest 'toddler' size, when it arrived it was the perfect size for my 6 month old (who wears 18 month clothing). Other than that the costume is great! it's really cozy and warm (polor fleece) and I love that it's got velcro on the inside of the legs for diaper changes!Not to mention, it is super cute on the baby!
