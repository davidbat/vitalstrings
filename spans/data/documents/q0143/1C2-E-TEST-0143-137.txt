Collecting Highlights
 
My 'Ewok wall': Vintage Ewok MOCs and Ewok multi-packs , a diorama of loose Ewok action figures , life-size Ewok mother with baby and three multi-signed Ewok autographs (one framed 16x20 inch Ewok CS piece signed by 28 Ewok actors and two framed 11x14 pictures with 10 respectively 9 Ewok signatures). I'm pretty proud of this. 
A great custom made George Lucas in Carbonite . Looks really cool!
George Lucas answering to my 'Through The Mail' autograph request in 1987. Find this autograph in the 'Multi signed' and 'G - L' sections of my Star Wars autographs. Also look for the letter coming with this success from 'Judy Niles'  in the 'M - R' section. I tried again in 1996 and 2008, but without success. See the failure letters from Lucasfilm's Anne Merrifield in the 'M - R' section.
Longest wait for an autograph: Avery Brooks as Cpt. Benjamin Sisko from Deep Space Nine: Wrote him during season two and received an answer one year after the end of season eight. Eight years! Imagine how surprised I was, when I opened that letter!!
Seeing Patrick Stewart (Cpt. Jean-Luc Picard) live on stage in New York performing a One-Man-Show of Charles
Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. Just amazing!!!
Meeting Mark Dermul ( The Autograph Bounty Hunter ) at Celebration Europe and Jedi Con 2008. Meeting new friends is always a great aspect of collecting! Find pictures of Mark and me here .
