The dwarf who played this Ewok was clearly not Bashful.
Actor Nicholas Read is facing jail time after he admitted to flashing a college student on a train headed to Manchester, England, the Sun reports. Read played an Ewok in "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."
After he showed the student his manhood, he took a picture of her horrified friend's reaction, according to the paper.
This is the second time Read has gotten in trouble for flashing a woman on a train, and this latest sex crime is a violation of his suspended sentence for his 2010 offense. Read could have to go to jail to complete the 20-week suspended jail sentence, plus any additional time from this most recent brush with the law.
"The bottom line is you are in breach of a suspended sentence," Judge Roger Thomas told Read. â€œThe normal consequence of that is to prison you go and that may well have to be the outcome." Read will be sentenced in July.
The Manchester Evening News reports that the judge denied a request by Read's defense attorney for a psychiatric report on her client. Thomas said there was "very little" evidence of mental illness in his case.
Read's film credits include playing a goblin in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and part of the Goblin Corps in "Labyrinth," according to his IMDB page.
CORRECTIONS: A previous version of this story misidentified Read's role in "Labyrinth." A previous version also showed a photo of an Ewok not played by Read.
