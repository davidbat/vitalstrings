About this Site
This is a directory for free Amigurumi pattern links. It is  maintained by me (Rob). At least every 2 weeks I add new pattern links.
If you see a link that does not work then please report  by writing a comment.
Also write a comment if you have published a pattern and like to add your link or e-mail: free.amigurumi.world@gmail.com.
This directory does not contain Amigurumi patterns! It only contains links to patterns on other blogs and websites.
I do not ask permission before copying a photo into this directory. Most designers like the link. If you are the copyright owner of a pattern and want the photo to be removed: send a short e-mail to free.amigurumi.world@gmail.com.
My spouse designs and publishes patterns under the name K&J Dolls. On the right are advertisements for her patterns.
Enjoy finding & making patterns
