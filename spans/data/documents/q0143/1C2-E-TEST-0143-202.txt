Ewok Hood
From iFiCantFINDaReindeer
Just in time for Comic-con, Star Wars in Concert, or any Star Wars convention or party!
Direct from Endor, a plush Ewok hood. Made from faux suede, with hand stitching to make each hood unique.
These were a huge hit when worn to various Star Wars events, and so now I'm sharing them with the public.
One size fits most.*
These have been worn by adults and children.
*May be slightly large on a small child, but the bottom is left unfinished and can be easily cut down to size for your own unique ewok look.
