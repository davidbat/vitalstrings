Edit
Everyone will be talking about the new edition of the Festival of Love, so don't miss it! Be sure to visit one of the participating cities (Tyrena, Kaadara, and the Southern Ewok Lake Village) and enjoy the festivities. There will be plenty of camby berries and chak juice to go around, so hurry now and help celebrate this year's Ewok Festival of Love!
You will find an Ewok Chief and Shaman near the chocolate fountains in celebrating cities. In Kaadara, Chief Chirpa and Logray from the Star Wars™ films will be making a special appearance!
The disillusioned love sage has lost his way and players must help him re-discover the true meaning of the Ewok Festival of Love and prove to him that there really is love in this crazy galaxy of ours.
Rewards
Edit
Upon completion of the Ewok Festival of Love activities, you will receive Ewok Chak Hearts to be used at one of the vendors to purchase Festival of Love rewards.
One such reward that can be purchased is a brand new painting exclusive to this year's Festival of Love!
Players will also be able to use their earned Chak Hearts to purchase a miniature chocolate fountain, a Crossbow of Love that decreases an enemy's hate toward the player who uses it, a very special Ewok Festival of Love familiar , a brand new Ewok Festival of Love costume, and even some unique Festival of Love Wings to help you get in the spirit of things!
And no, the wings don't actually make you fly; they're just for looks and are perfect for use in the Appearance Tab!
Chief Chirpa has a whole new bouquet of flowers this year for those who know the secret to unlocking his heart…(target chief and say "allayloo Ta Nuv".)
Don't worry if you missed last year's Festival of Love. Those flowers will be on sale from the vendor at any of the festival locations at a very exclusive price.
