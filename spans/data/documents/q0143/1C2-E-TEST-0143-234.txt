On this weeks extremely funny episode of How I Met Your Mother , Barney attempts to explain to Ted (and his class) the importance of the "Ewok Line". This is a line that separates people who were younger or older then 10 when Return of the Jedia was released in May of 1983. This back story was to explain why he felt Nora was actual 37 and therefore lying about her age being 29.
Forget all that nonsense for now. What we are here to discuss is the extremly detailed amount of information that Barney has compiled on the Ewok. CBS has posted a clip on their website with the entire slide show for our viewing pleasure. As the site describes it:
