Photo Hunt #179: Graveyards/Clean
For those who have been reading/visiting my blogs for years, you’d know that I have shown this before, probably not in Photo Hunt though.  However, I don’t have any other graveyard image that I could remember in any of my old albums.
Other than the flower petals on the ground, this graveyard is pretty clean.
This is the Trinity Church Cemetery inside the compound of Trinity Church located at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway in NYC.  I didn’t know much about this cemetery but wiki is reporting that among the ones calling this a resting place are: Alexander Hamilton , William Bradford , Robert Fulton and Albert Gallatin.
This has more of a park-like atmosphere where people are found to be seating on the benches eating their lunch or soaking up the sun.  I even found a few of them with eyes closed, in a meditative pose.
While graveyards can be eerie place, this one in the middle of bustling Wall Street is very inviting.
