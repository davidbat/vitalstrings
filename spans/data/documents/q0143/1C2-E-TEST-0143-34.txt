Chaz Bono Dubbed 'Basketball, Penguin, Ewok' By Judges
Chaz Bono has blasted the judging panel on Dancing With The Stars for their "disrespectable" comments concerning his weight. Bono, who was eliminated during Tuesday's results show (25th October 2011) claims he was dubbed a "basketball" amongst other things while competing on the reality show.
Speaking on Wednesday's Good Morning America, Cher's son hit back at the judges' hurtful comments, saying, "I was called a basketball, a penguin, an Ewok, and I just didn't appreciate it". He singled out Bruno Tonioli as the judge who gave him a particularly hard time, saying, "If you want to critique my dancing and give me some constructive advice so I can try to improve the next time that I'm there, that would be great.But I don't really know how to be less penguin-ish, and so I kind of took offense to that". The writer and activist notched up just 19 out of a possible 30 on Monday night's show, leaving him and partner Lacey Schwimmer almost certainties for elimination. Following their inevitable exit, Chaz suggested he would continue dancing, but stated his desire to move onto Broadway, saying, "If Broadway comes knocking, please. I'd be very happy to do anything. I'd love this experience".
Army veteran turned soap star J.R. Martinez is looking likely to scoop this season's mirror ball trophy, although Ricki Lake and Rob Kardashian continue to receive similarly high scores.
