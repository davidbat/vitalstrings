An Ewok chooses a secret "tree name" that only he and his birth-tree share.
Return of the Jedi cast list does not show individual names of Ewoks. Probably for the above reason and keeping with the film.
Therefore, unless you already have some names you'd like people to pick from, it's going to be hard to help you out.
Although I do believe "Wicket" was an Ewok (played by Warwick Davis - also of Harry Potter, Labrynth, Leprechaun and Willow).
