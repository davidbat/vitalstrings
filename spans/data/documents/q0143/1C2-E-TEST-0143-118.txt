Hah.  Dressing up pet =/= me finding a piece of scrap fabric and placing it on his face.  I refuse to buy anything other than collars for my dog to wear.  Also, I took this years ago just for kicks, not for the purpose of intarwebs.
And I agree with lols, my dog is horrifically ugly.  He’s rightfully earned the nickname of “Uggo” in our house.
