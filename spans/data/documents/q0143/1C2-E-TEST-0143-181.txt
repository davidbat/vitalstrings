Look, I love puppies more than anything else in the world. This is just a true fact. But sometimes I like my puppies to look like other things, like say for instance a bumblebee or an arrow-slinging inhabitant of Endor. You know, what every girl dreams about when she looks into that pet shop window and goes "Mommy can I have one?!" And I thought I had lucked out with my shih-tzu, which looks amazingly like Nippet from 'Return of the Jedi,' but then I ran into a Brussels Griffon in the dog park and holy moly, now that's an Ewok. Literally, that's what George Lucas based the Ewoks on. Love!
Legend has it that Lucas owned five of these little suckers leading up to his filming Star Wars. And you really can't find anything more ridiculous looking in the entire world; they don't even look like dogs. More like bearded moneys that walk on four legs . Love it!
Another fun movie fact? These are the same breed of dog that Greg Kinnear had in 'As Good As It Gets' , which caused an explosion of Brussels Griffon purchases in America after the movie was released. We all want to put these puppies in a laundry chute. Adorbs!
I'm...I'm sorry, I can't help it. I want to talk like a normal human being, but every time I even do a basic Google image search on these things, it's like an instant lobotomy. Like even their description on Wikipedia seems entirely anthropomorphic: "The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with his or her master. They display a visible air of self-importance." Like how do we know if a dog has a huge heart? For all you know your dog loathes you, and the way it shows hate is by licking your face. We'll just never know. That being said, my dog loves me more than anything else in the world. And she'll love me even more once I bring one of these babies home so it can start fighting the galactic empire.
