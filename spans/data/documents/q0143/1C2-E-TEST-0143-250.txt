Maybe not that ewok, but the ones from the actual movies, the cute little ones, ya there’s a slight resemblance. The little features and bright/dark eyes.
But ewoks are better, and this girl is…well, she looks cute. As in young. As in far too young. No way she can be almost 19.
It’s more of a…theoretical resemblance.
