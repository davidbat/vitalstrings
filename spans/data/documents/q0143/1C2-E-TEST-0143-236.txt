****EWOK ON STEROIDS MOD****  3/4/08
This is -RLcT-Lea.Fang's SWBF1 mod that replaces the Wookie with an Ewok that is wookie size!
The ewok gets a bunch of cool weapons too. I made the ewoks eyes red too!
Thanks to:
Majjin Revan for releasing the Republic Commando assets so I could have the ewok use the Anti-Armor
gun.
Everything else was done by me.
