It's a space station. As you may or may not know, the t-shirt was invented in 1722 by a Mr. Nathanial T. Shirk to keep your nipples from falling off.  One misnomer at the London patent office later and the rest, my friends, is history .  A history I just made up.  Which let's be honest, is far more interesting than the real thing.  Did I ever tell you the one about how our solar system was created by two magicians fighting over a turtle?  Okay that one's actually true.
