Synopsis of Star Wars Ewok Adventures: Caravan of Courage/The Battle for Endor
Viewed by Star Wars fans as either a fascinating side note to Return of the Jedi or as a painfully embarrassing teddy-bear picnic, the made-for-television Ewok films have finally made their way to DVD. The disc features a two-sided presentation consisting of both Ewok films, Caravan of Courage (titled simply The Ewok Adventure in its U.S. television premiere) and the dark, fantasy-flavored sequel The Battle for Endor. Both features are presented in 1.33:1 full-frame and accompanied by closed-captioned audio rendered in 2.0 Dolby Surround Sound. Those familiar with the blurry VHS versions will be ecstatic to see how crisp and carefully cleaned up both of the films' picture qualities have become. Both films' new audio mixes, while not quite up to the high THX standards of the Star Wars DVDs, are quite impressive as they send all the tiny exotic alien planet noises of Endor shooting around the viewer's living room. The fact that no other bonus features are included is a disappointment, as the films are such curious oddities and a making-of documentary would help shed some light on just how they ever came to be and where the film's very young cast is today. Ideal for young Star Wars-crazed children and older Star Wars-crazed super fans, The Star Wars Ewok Adventures DVD is a decent presentation of two of the space fantasy's strangest moments. ~ Jason Gibner, All Movie Guide
