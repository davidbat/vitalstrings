Re: Peyton Manning vs Tom Brady Lifetime Postseason Stats
yes. again this is what indy fans are trying to use to get us down now because they can't spin an argument that would say their team is better. if you really want to break it down even more, look at the numbers manning has put up in postseason games they have lost. last week he was pretty good, but before that he did not get his team enough points. shut out against the jets, 3 and 14 against the patriots, 18 against the steelers.  those numbers are all way below the teams average points scored in the regular season. last year the colts won in spite of manning, he had 3 ints against KC, and was unable to get his team into the endzone against the ravens. he had 3 tds and 7 ints in the postseason last year.
