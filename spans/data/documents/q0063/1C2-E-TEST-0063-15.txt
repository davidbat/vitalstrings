All about Raider football, baby. Football played the way it’s supposed to be played….with bad intentions.
Raiders Vs the New York Paper Planes was real football yesterday. Forget throwing the ball 50 times.

Brady know that unless he can give his D-IIIII a 30 point lead, the Pats will not be safe. I fully Expect Brady to break Marino’s record.
His 50 TDs might be in jeopardy as well although that seems less likely. If the Pats D doesn’t improve.  He might reach the 50 mark again.
scudbot says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:25 PM
Okay, nobody questions Brady’s passing ability.  But this has to be due partially to the lockout and lack or D prep time.  Defenses all over the league are lagging offenses.
Sep 26, 2011 12:27 PM
Patriots still leave Buffalo with a LOSS.
Sep 26, 2011 12:27 PM
At least two picks last year were tipped. Two were tipped yesterday.
The guy simply makes the best throws in the game.
If the defense gets more pressure consistently, then we have a SB winner.

His passing yardage is ridiculous,  and yea he’s set to throw a lot of touchdowns as usual, but you’re crazy if you think he’s gonna keep throwing int’s like that.  i can’t stand the guy but lets be realistic here lol
Sep 26, 2011 12:28 PM
4 picks yesterday. I hope he averages 4 a game from here on out.

I find these numbers by Aaron Rodgers much more impressive:
He leads the league in completion pct with 71.8% and in QB rating with 120.9

Sep 26, 2011 12:28 PM
This is kind of sad. The league has become such a pass happy league, that if your QB is not getting 350-400 yards a game you won’t win a lot of games.

Brady reminds me so much of Marino lately. No run game, no defense, no postseason success but a million yards.
achap39 says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:29 PM
Who cares? He threw two passes that he tried to force into double coverage to get a seam route. If he doesn’t make those two mistakes, we’re not talking about the Bills at 3-0, we’re not bemoaning the Pats D (as much).
As for “the Patriots look like they’re going to be in a lot of games where they need Brady to throw 45 times…” Last I looked, a lot of his throws are coming when the Pats are winning and should be grinding it on the ground, not going shotgun and 4 wide. But hey…you guys are the “experts,” after all.
gimmeabruschi says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:31 PM
Yeah, with that lame defense he should be throwing all the time.

Sep 26, 2011 12:31 PM
This right here is the Patriots problem.  Belichick putting everything on Brady and running the team like it is a fantasy team to put up big numbers.
The 2011 Patriots have possibly the worst defense of any in the Belichick era.  They have decent running backs in BJGE and Danny Woodhead.  So with a 21-0 lead and a suspect defense, the Pats keep on airing it out and refuse to establish any sort of a ground game and when they do run it is utterly predictable.
Why not work the clock so that the porous defense is on the field as little as possible?  Just goes to show for all his genious Belichick has apparently learned nothing from the 2009 season.  Frustrating as all hell.
Sep 26, 2011 12:32 PM
Like 4 interceptions in one game?  That is unprecedented!

He will have to average 500 yards passing and 5 TD’s a game to have a shot at winning those games with such a pathetic defense .
No better than 10-6 for this overrated team that just got schooled by Chan Gaily and a superior Bills team.
Can someone please remind me of what the Patriots have accomplished since they were busted for cheating?

It won’t be sunny and 74 degrees for much longer though, something else to consider.

Chairman Al says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:40 PM
Raiders may be 2-1, but QBs are putting up 300+ against them each game.  Brady will be airing it out against a secondary that could possibly (if the injuries are bad) be Stanford Routt, Chimdi Chekwa, Tyvon Branch, and Matt Giordano….
Chimdi held his own against Sanchez, but Sanchez is a schmuck compared to Brady.
The man with the longest name in football that I won’t even type out, BJGE, will be contained.  But Brady will make us Raiders fans sweat all day.
Two high-powered offenses; Pats in the air, Raiders on the ground.  Should actually be a great game.
dolphandan says:

What a great natural experiment to put all the emotional arguments to rest and determine the better quarterback:  Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.
In 2008 Tom Brady suffered a torn ACL, was out the rest of the season, and the New England Patriots went  11 – 5 in the regular season. The next year with Tom Brady back the Patriots went 10-6 and won a division title.
In 2011 Peyton Manning is out for the season, so we can just look at the Colts records this year and next  to have some facts when discussing who is better quarterback.
Pat MyHog says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:49 PM
I’m a Pats fan and our defense is suspect! Its not everyday Brady those 4 ints and he will surely rebound. On the bright side, Brady those 4 ints and we lost by 3 points on a last second field goal. Having said that, Pats were up 21-0 and blew it. Defense needs to get stronger or we’ll never have a shot in the playoffs. Bills will make the leap this year and come in 2nd in the AFC East. Jets will drop it like its hot after they lose the next 2 weeks to go to 2-3.
Sep 26, 2011 12:50 PM
That’s what a 99 yard pass will do for your stats.
As good as Brady has been so far this year, it has still be more than six years since the Patriots last won the Super Bowl.  At the end of the season, that’s the only stat that matters.
marinephinfan says:
Sep 26, 2011 12:54 PM
Of course Brady will break records when he’s still throwing the deep ball 30 points ahead with 2 minutes left in the game.
Brady= average QB.
Sep 26, 2011 12:54 PM
“Unprecedented”, “Phenomenal”,
A 3 game sample size is not worthy of these terms.

How does that determine who the better quarterback is? It would probably tell a lot about how the team is run, how the organization is run, how good the backup qb is but you’re saying that we can judge who is the better qb when they’re not even playing? That makes zero sense!

The post isn’t about winning the SB, numbskulls.  It’s about the passing yardage and touchdowns.  Neither WINS superbowls (though they help you get there).  But neither does Vick’s hand being broken or not.  It’s just a piece of interest.  Sheesh you guys are so literal.
And yes, if the Pats D continues it’s march to equally historic suckage, Brady will need to blow those old marks away.

It’s all he’s got.
By all indications, nothing prior to Feb. of 2008 counts….though depending on his argument, that date can and will be adjusted accordingly.
14-5 post season record and 3 rings be damned.
That’s his “go to” and all he’s got.

^^^^^^
Consider these stats:
Last year at Chicago in a near blizzard conditions: 27/40 – 369 yards – 2 TD’s – 0 Int in a 36-7 win
2009 vs. Tennessee in a snowstorm: 29/34 – 380 yards – 6 TD’s – 0 Ints in a 59-0 bloodbath
Say what you want but weather is one thing that does not slow the Pats offense down, ever.  Bad weather favors the Patriots against probably ever other team in the league.

All this talk about Brady.  The worst sport for hype is Football.  The media is too unafraid to grab the groin of what they perceive to be the stars and then hype them up like they are heroes.    Remember the year after the Colts won the superbowl?  The media was about to blow up the Pats.   And then the Pats go 16-0 and the media starts rubbing the groins of Brady, and Belichik again, and haven’t stopped.
My question is this.  Is this team really committed to winning?  I don’t think they are because they sure can’t stop the pass or run.
Is Tom Brady concerned about winning?  For all his gaudy numbers I think he has forgotten how to manage a football game.
Kudos to Wes Welker the real MVP and heart of the Pats.

“No better than 10-6 for this overrated team that just got schooled by Chan Gaily and a superior Bills team.
Can someone please remind me of what the Patriots have accomplished since they were busted for cheating?”
First of all, they did not get “Schooled” by Chan Gaily. The Pats had 4 bad turnovers that were just great plays by the Bills. And still only lost by 3. I wonder how many Bills fans were praying that Jackson went down at the 1.
Secondly, what the Patriots have done since 2007 is have an undefeated regular season, went 11-5 without Brady, then put up a 14-2 season. Yeah we have been one and done in the playoffs recently, but there is no other team that has had the more consistent success that the Pats.
Pats, Colts and Steelers are the only teams that have been relevent EVERY SINGLE YEAR sine 2000.
Gotta give credit to the Tatanka though… they made the most of of their opportunities and beat my beloved Pats.
Long season folks….
Sep 26, 2011 1:04 PM
iknowitallandmore,
I’m interested in what your definition of “schooled” is…
The Pats:
- Had three SIGNIFICANT injuries that altered both their offensive and defensive schemes
- Were playing on the road surrounded by drunk, shirtless (seriously, most fans I’ve seen without shirts at one game), loud, oblivious fans
- Lost the turnover battle
- Gave up a pick-six
and yet managed to lose by a field goal.
I know its a loss, but if you think the Bills are for real, you’re high.
01/01/2012 50-3 PATS > BUFFALO

That argument is so dumb it boggles the mind.
The Patriots went 16-0 on 2007 and the whole team was back in 2008.  Matt Cassel was the back up, who is now a starter in the league and brought KC to the playoffs last year.  Cassel lost 5 more games than Brady did with the same team behind him.  Since Indy went 10-6 last year with Manning if they went 4-12 this year it would be comparible.  Indy doesn’t have a comparible back up QB to the 2008 Patriots and had to go out and get a veteran who didn’t know the system.  So if thy go 2-14 it might be comparible.  The 2008 Patriots went from being the greatest offensive team ever to missing the playoffs.  That’s a huge drop off and nearly as big as what is happening to Indy.

It makes sense because we can determine how good each team is without their star QB, which then tells us how much of their sucess due to the coaches  and rest of the team.
As much as I hate to say it, maybe Rex Ryan was right last January when he said when discussing Peyton Manning: “There’s nobody like this guy in the league. Nobody studies like him. I know Brady thinks he does. I think there’s probably a little more help with Belichick with Brady than there is with Peyton Manning.”

You can say anything you want about Brady’s hair, magazine covers, dancing ability at Brazilian Carnival, but no one can question how clutch the guy is as a QB.  He is better than Joe Montana because he has never had the weapons Joe Montana had. Aside from the 1 year with Randy Moss, Brady has worked with below average to average WR’s his entire career and had amazing numbers.  Welker wouldn’t be half the player he is for New England on any other team.
Brady didn’t lose in the playoffs the first 3 times he went, has 3 rings, and is QB for the only team that wins as much as the Colts have in the regular season the last 10 years.

Yesterday is one game which TB has not thrown 4 picks since 2006. Once every five years is OK and they still had a chance to win despite Brady’s day. The D was Chungless, Sergio Brown had a welcome to the NFL game and hopefully he’ll improve.Its week#3, long season ahead.

___________________________________
I couldn’t agree more! I would even go a step further and say that the explosiveness of this offense has a lot to do with how this defense plays. Until this defense wins a game like yesterday when Brady was clearly having an off day, they will never be an elite defense. They need to be a more balanced team and quit letting the defense depend on the fact that the offense may put up 30+ pts per game.

I think you’re missing my point.  I’m not blaming Tom Brady for the Patriots failure to win a Super Bowl.  However, the goal is to win the Super Bowl, and as good as Brady and Belichick have been over the past several years, they have fallen short.
In one sense, it’s staggering to consider because they are the best organization in the league.  I’m wondering aloud why it is that the Pats keep falling short, that’s all.

How is his argument dumb? The pats without brady are still a playoff caliber team (11-5 makes playoss almost anseason with the 08 exception) and thus far the Colts without manning are obviously no where near playoff caliber as they are 0-3. That shows which qb works with the worse team an lifts his team to a higher level, manning.
Pats have always been a better team which has always helped brady perform on such a high level. His oline is solid and early on he had 3 great defenses that helped him win 3 titles. People forget to compare the hand that each player was dealt when comparing how the two players perform.

He’s putting up Madden-esque numbers. That passing yards record is as good as broken.
ikasey says:
Sep 26, 2011 1:47 PM
If Chung played, there would have been a lot more stops on Jackson and Nelson, and most importantly, Jackson’s bust-out run at the end. Call it an excuse, but Chung is emerging as the predominant leader on the D.
Regardless, the Pats have basically converted to an all 4-3 defense this year, which is a huge change for a defense. Furthermore, Haynesworth AND Shaun Ellis were out yesterday which puts a lot of pressure in the middle on Wilfork.
