I always hate watching old 49er records get broken. :tvhorror:
yeah that does suck to see.  today was the first time i've seen the patriots play this season and their offense just made it look so easy.  i mean 5 tds and there were two others by moss that could have easily counted :shock:

It doesn't matter that Tom Brady does, he can have 8 SB rings but Joe will somehow always be the best ever here.

Why are you surprised? This is a 49ers message board.

Where did I say that I am surprised?  :)

Seems like that's what you were implying.

Explain how Montana is better then Brady.

I don't care; Steve Young still rules to me.

I don't think Montana is better than Brady, especially the way Brady has been playing this year.  I am just saying that around here, no matter what any other non-Niner QB does, he will never be as good as Joe.

Well of course. It's just like if you go to the Broncos message board. They'll believe John Elway is the best.

Sadly, that might not be the last....I could see Brady throwing 7 TDs in the SB :thud:

Who cares, they're both better than Marino.

Sucks, but Niner fans might want to get used to Brady braking old Niner QB records and achievements. At this point looks like the dude will win more SBs than Joe.

I still think Montana is the best and no one can change that. Also remember one thing, none of the Super Bowl rings that Brady have one was because of a winning drive, or a complete dismantling (Super Bowl XXIV Niners/ Broncos), they were either close or won by a field goal.
The play off game against the Raiders, with the retarded tuck rule, thats 1 Super Bowl that can be questioned, whether or not the Pats should have even been there. As well as we all wonder how long has good ole Bellicheat been video taping opposing teams play calling? Im not trying to take anything away from the Pats, but they dont exactly have a clean slate, so to speak. Montana FTW!
