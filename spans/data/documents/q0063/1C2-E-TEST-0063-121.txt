This is quite possible.  The only caveat is the number of INT's to go along with 40+ TD's.  Rodger's has really only thrown 1 errant pass deserving of a pick, the one to Urlacher.  His other two bounced off receivers hands (not high either, on the money).  If Rodgers hits 40+ TD's I doubt he has more than 8 INT's.
