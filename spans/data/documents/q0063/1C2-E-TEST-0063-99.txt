Tom Brady sets postseason record with five passing TDs in first half
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has thrown a postseason-record five touchdowns in the first half against the Broncos.
Brady has completed 18 of 25 pass attempts for 246 yards, five touchdowns and one interception in the first half.
Three of the touchdowns were to Rob Gronkowski, who led the NFL during the regular season with 17 receiving touchdowns and set the single-season record for tight ends.  Receivers Wes Welker and Deion Branch have caught the other two touchdowns.
Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow has completed three of 10 pass attempts for 28 yards.
Barring a miracle, the Patriots, who are up by 28 points, will get their first postseason win since losing Super Bowl XLII.
