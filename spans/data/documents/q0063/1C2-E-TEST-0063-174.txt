Born: August 03, 1977
A pro football quarterback praised by no less than Sports Illustrated magazine as the most gifted player in the NFL, New England Patriots mainstay Tom Brady made international headlines for his spectacular record on the field. A California native, Brady grew up in San Mateo as the son of Tom Brady, Sr. and Galynn Brady, and attended Serra High (a private, all-boys Catholic school) and the University of Michigan, playing football for the U of M Wolverines. Within a year of Brady's U of M graduation in 2000, the Patriots tapped him as part of their draft, and he racked up a long string of accomplishments on the field that included leading the Patriots to three Super Bowl championships, playing in three Pro Bowls, and netting two Super Bowl MVP awards.
Cinematically, the majority of Brady's appearances have been football videos and documentaries depicting his football accomplishments; he also hosted a special episode of Saturday_Night_Live in 2005. He and actress Bridget_Moynahan had a son in 2007 and in early 2009, Brady married Brazilian supermodel Gisele_Bündchen . By the summer, Bündchen and Brady announced she was expecting.
