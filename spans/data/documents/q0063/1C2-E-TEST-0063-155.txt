I don't live in Boston. I do know that fatty fatty two by four rex ryan is mad jealous of the Patriots and their 3 superbowl rings. He will never will shit until he gets over his obsession.

P.S. I am a Bostonian but I do not engage in nor do I condone inbreeding--the very thought gives me the vapors.

Her chest looks awfully red. It can't be sunburn though because she only goes out in the sun before 10 a.m. or after 4 pm. Right, Gis?

They went down the water slides without the kids? Gisele seems like the type who would be jealous of anyone and anything that Tom paid more attention to.

It's just creepy to see the kind of hold Gisele has on him.
***************************************
As fellow Pats fans, I guess we must agree to disagree, Centaurious.
What "hold" does she have on him--where does that even come from? Looks like they're happy and enjoying each other to me. No deeper or more meaningful than that--this "creepy" stuff and the alleged "hold" she has on him is pure, media-fabricated, bullshit.

The cracked skulls suggest people haven't changed much in 3211 years. That whole website is fascinating. I loved the bit on Blackbeard's anchor.

Early Bronze Age battle site found on German river bank
May, 22 2011
"The archaeologists found no pottery, ornaments or paved surfaces which might be suggestive of formal graves or burial rituals. "
"""""""""""""""""""
This also means no signs of settlement which suggests they were most probably disputing territory rather than invading a neighbouring village/town.
I watch Time Team. :D

I can't believe the Pat's fans put up with this.
It must be killing them. It's killing me.

Put up with what, exactly? Having one of the best QBs ever to play the game lead your team to three Super Bowl rings? Don't worry about us poor little Pats fans--we're more than fucking thrilled to have Tom Brady.
He can coast down water slides with goofy looks on his face all the livelong fucking day for all we care.

Although it is Gisele.
I understand him fucking her.
It's not like, "How the hell could Arnie have fucked that maid?"

WhiskeyTango: Here ya go. One cool CSI deet is the fact the brainiacs knew the soldiers had died suddenly in battle because their bones had never healed, as they would if the injured had kept living.

That's true (about the French-English royals, not the wedgie). I heard some cool news today about a new archeological find along the banks of a German river: a mass grave of soldiers killed in battle in 1200 BC (all with gross skull fractures, embedded arrowheads, and stuff). I'll post a link if I see it online.
_______________________________________________
cool....please do! I wonder if the royals figured out that all that sibling and cousin-marryin' foolery was causing all those problems. I remember learning about the "Hapsburg Lip" in high school bio when we did the unit on genetics...poor King Charles never had a chance.
Or maybe they did know about the problems that can result from inbreeding, but figured it was better to forge alliances with other royal families and take their chances.

Tom had better produce until he retires, or else have Gisele walk him to his car every night after games.

I picture some sort of regression flip-flop issue going on in that family, ie, the baby working on his PhD, and Tom valiantly working on his toilet training.

I would tend to agree with the Samson analogy (see my post below) but are we sure he wasn't a babbling idiot when he had a crew cut?
He's got one of those prominent eyebrow-ridges which makes him look like he may communicate by grunting and drawing stick figures on the fridge.
