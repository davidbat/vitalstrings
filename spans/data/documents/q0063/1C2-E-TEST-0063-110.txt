Brady and Stafford Eclipse 5,000 Yards; Steal Stigma From Brees Record?
In 1984 Dan Marino set the NFL record for most passing yards in a single season, breaking Dan Fouts 1981 record of 4,802 passing yards. Marino also became the only NFL player in NFL history to break the 5,000 passing yards mark. A standard in that era of football which was unheard of and remarkable.
Then 25 years later, Drew Brees became the 2nd QB in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season. Brees fell short of Marino’s record by only 15 yards.
Now, 3 years after becoming the 2nd QB in NFL history to throw for 5,000+ yards in a single season, Brees has shattered Dan Marino’s record of 5,084 yards with an amazing 5,476 yards this season. Drew Brees has become the only QB in NFL history to throw for over 5,000 yards a season twice. Undoubtedly Brees breaking this record has become the sports headline of the 2011 season. But two other QB’s this season are taking the ‘shock and awe’ away from this utterly amazing accomplishment.
Tom Brady also broke a record that once was, yet is no more. Tom Brady threw for 5,235 yards this season. Replacing Dan Marino as #2 on the single season passing yards record books. Brady became the 3rd NFL QB to throw for 5,000 yards in a season.
Matthew Stafford wanted to join the party this season and he did in a way. Matthew Stafford fell only 46 yards short of breaking Dan Marino’s record. Stafford threw for 5,038 yards this season, becoming the 4th NFL QB to throw for 5,000 yards in a season.
Dan Marino stood alone for 27 years as the pinnacle of NFL passing. Drew Brees broke his record, but so did Tom Brady with Matthew Stafford not to far behind. Breaking an NFL record is a career milestone no player will ever forget. With that being said, does Brady and Stafford’s career best years take away from the history making magnitude of Brees’ record?
There is no question or doubt that the NFL has become a passing league. Rules now favor the QB and work against the effectiveness of the defense. Setting the pace for more passing yards and better QB play. Without a  shadow of a doubt we are seeing the best overall QB play the NFL has ever seen.
With such rules paving the way towards higher passing yards, Drew Brees’ throwing for 5,476 yards does not hold the same ‘wow’ factor as Marinos’ did. It has  become easier for NFL QB’s to throw for 5,000 yards, we saw 3 QB’s do so this season, with Eli Manning falling 67 yards short with 4,933 passing yards, ranking 6th in NFL history.
Think of it this way. Before 2011, only 2 NFL QB’s threw for 5,000 yards in a season in the 90 year history of the NFL. In the 91st season of the NFL, 3 QB’s threw for over 5,000 yards.
Going forward, passing marks for QB’s may not be the pinnacle of one’s career. Considering 4 of the top 6 seasons for passing yards were set this season (Brees 1st, Brady 2nd, Stafford 5th, Manning 6th).
Drew Brees set an incredible mark this season. However, with such great QB play of late, I see this being a record that will be challenged and broken for years to come. With Aaron Rodgers, Matthew Stafford, Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Phillip Rivers, we are witnessing the greatest group of QB’s to play together in NFL history. Get your popcorn ready, records will continue to fall.
