Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers, And Tom Brady All On Pace To Break Dan Marino’s Passing Yards Record

The title says
it all. Not one, not two, THREE quarterbacks are all on pace to break Hall of Famer Dan Marino’s individual record for most passing yards in a season. The passing yards record of 5,084 thrown by Dan Marino back in 1984 is in danger of being surpassed finally by all three super-duper, All-Pro quarterbacks.
Drew Brees through the NFL half-way point (eight games) has compiled 2,746 yards and that puts him on pace to end the season with 5,492 yards breaking the record by over 300 yards. Let’s not forget Brees nearly broke Marino’s record in 2008 , failing to do so by a meager 15 yards
Aaron Rodgers through seven games has 2,372 yards . With 9 games still to play that puts him on pace to end the season with 5,420 yards. absolutely astonishing. Brett who?
Mr. Uggs, or as we know him Tom Brady is on pace to only finish with 5,396 yards. Brady has also only played seven games. Brady also came close previously to breaking Marino’s record back in 2007 falling 278 yards short.
Rest easy Dan Marion, two of the three quarterbacks mentioned play in Green Bay and New England. With this said it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the weather situation that will be implemented on these quarterbacks in about 2 weeks. Drew Brees however plays in a dome. In fact Brees finishes out the season playing in doors for every game except one, week 14 at the Tennessee Titans.
In the pass happy NFL that is among us now, this shouldn’t come to anyone’s surprise. Spread offenses are as routine as Rex Ryan Super Bowl predictions. Could this be the year Dan Marino’s record gets broken? I think the more logical question is, how many quarterbacks will break the record this year?
