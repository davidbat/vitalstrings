Everybody say, “Awwwww.”
Tom Brady and his adorable son Jack, 3, were spotted last week (June 23) as they spent some father-son time together after the youngster finished his day at camp in Malibu, Calif.
Jack is Tom’s son with his ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan. The football star and his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, are parents to 1 1/2-year-old son Benjamin.
Tom is going through a tough time right now as he deals with the news that his mentor, Northern California coaching legend Tom Martinez, is gravely ill and has been given only a few weeks to live. “I just can’t say enough about him, and what he’s meant to me,” Tom said . “When I heard how serious it was the other night, I was there in bed with my wife, and it was just a sad moment. Very tough on his family, and on ours.”
