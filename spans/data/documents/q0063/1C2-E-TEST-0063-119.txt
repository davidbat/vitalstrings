I can't help but think the worst when it comes to football. So, I envision a HUGE day for Brady (minimum 400 yards -- probably more) easily passing Marino and may even surpass Brees.
I know this is farfetched, but of course he is playing the Bills, and the football Gods just love to spit at us, so I can't be the only one who thinks this may actually happen, can I?
I don't even care if we lose, but if Brady sets yet another milestone stone against us, I just might snap.
Thoughts...?
The hope is that, unless a miracle occurs, the Pats get up early and brady takes a seat.  If the Hoodie and Brady try to run it up and get yards passing, I hope that someone knocks Brady silly and he has to miss the playoffs. Not looking for a career ender, but a nice broken finger or thumb on the throwing had would work fine.  Maybe a dislocated shoulder.
