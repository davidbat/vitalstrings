(FNN Media) — New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had quite the first half in Super Bowl XLVI.
Brady broke Brett Favre’s record for most career postseason completions (482).
He also moved passed John Elway and Joe Montana into 2nd place all time in Super Bowl yards with 1,148.  He is eight yards shy of breaking Kurt Warner’s record of 1,156.
Brady finished the half 15-of-18 for 147 yards and a touchdown as the Patriots held a narrow 10-9 lead over the New York Giants.
In addition, the Patriots’ 96-yard touchdown drive at the end of the half tied for the longest in Super Bowl history.
