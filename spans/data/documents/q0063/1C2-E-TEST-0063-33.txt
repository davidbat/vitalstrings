I went to the final game of the Patriots regular season at Giants Stadium, where the Patriots won to complete the first ever 16-0 regular season. On this play, Tom Brady broke the single season touchdown throwing record once held by Payton Manning, and Randy Moss broke the single season record for touchdown receptions previously held by Jerry Rice. It was an amazing play that broke two all-time records simultaneously.
