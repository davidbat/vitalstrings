As it usually is when he's on, Tom Brady 's first-haf performance against the Denver Broncos in Saturday's second divisional round playoff game was ruthlessly efficient in a way that made the defense find it hard to breathe. And in all of his great games, Brady had never done what he did against the Broncos â he set an NFL record with five touchdown passes in a single half of playoff football.
