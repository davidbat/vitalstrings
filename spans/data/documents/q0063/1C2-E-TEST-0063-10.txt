"I'm glad I'm not throwing interceptions," Brady said. "I think our team has done a really good job this year of not turning the ball over in general. All the guys that have handled it this year are doing a great job of taking care of it.
"I'm very fortunate. Believe me, I've had plenty of plays that definitely could have gone for them. It's a good trend for us to be on, and hopefully it continues."
Brady broke the mark of 308 attempts without a pick previously set by Cleveland's Bernie Kosar over the 1990-91 seasons with his 17th attempt in the third quarter of New England's game against Buffalo on Sunday. It came on a short pass over the middle that tight end Rob Gronkowski dropped at the goal line.
The two then hooked up for an 8-yard TD on the next play to put the Patriots up 31-3. Brady finished the game 15-of-27 for 140 yards and three touchdowns.
Brady has thrown only four interceptions this season, his last coming nine games ago when he threw two in a 23-20 win over Baltimore on Oct. 17.
Coach Bill Belichick said he was unaware that Brady had set the record.
"That's great," he said. "Tom does a great job managing the game and taking care of the ball. I think he deserves that."
