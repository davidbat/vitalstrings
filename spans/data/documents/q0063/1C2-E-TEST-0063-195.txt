NFL Playoffs are in full swing gearing up for one of the biggest days of the year – the Super Bowl. I saw a few requests online to have this pairing take place so I am happy to make all your wishes come true. This Wednesday, the battle is between Denver Broncos’ QB Tim Tebow and New England Patriots’ QB Tom Brady. In advanced, you’re welcome.
Tim Tebow, 24,  seems to making headlines less for his football skills and more for “relationship” with the divine – and the intervention that seems to be bestowed upon him when all the chips seem to be down. Tebow joined the Broncos in 2010 and is their current quarterback donning the #15. Tebow is a spokesman for Nike, Jockey International and FRS Health Energy. In 2008, he graced the cover of Men’s Health.
Tom Brady, 34, has played in four superbowls and won three of them. He’s also won two Super Bowl MVP awards and holds the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a single season. Brady is unstoppable. Brady has played for the Patriots since 2000 donning #12, and playing quarterback. Brady endorses Nike, Sirius and Visa. Check out photos of the men and vote below.
