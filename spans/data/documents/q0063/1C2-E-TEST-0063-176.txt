A lot has been made this week about the six quarterbacks drafted ahead of Tom Brady in the 2000 NFL draft before he was finally taken with the 199th pick. Just who were those guys and where are they now?
Chad Pennington
NFL Team: New York Jets
Selection: 18th (1st round)
Skinny: You can’t blame the Jets for this pick. Pennington was all-world at Marshall, leading the Thundering Herd to a perfect 13-0 record as a senior in 1999 after starring with Randy Moss for one season in ’97. He was also a great student and Rhodes Scholar finalist earning him the nickname “The Golden Boy” before it was bestowed upon Brady.
He wasn’t bad in the pros either. Pennington never went to a Pro Bowl but did lead the Jets to three playoff appearances. With his arm strength shot due to shoulder surgery, Pennington spent a couple years in Miami but now appears like he has played his final NFL game after tearing his ACL a couple weeks ago in a pick-up basketball game.
