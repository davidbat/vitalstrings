The competitiveness of these two players can be felt around the league, and they are loved by football fans throughout the United States. Tom Brady led the New England Patriots to a perfect 16-0 season, and returned the team to their fourth Super Bowl appearance in less than a seven year period. Tom Edward Patrick Brady has revolutionized the quarterback position, his calmness under pressure speaks volumes on what he has managed to accomplish in a brief NFL career. He has become the poster child of cool, and he is surely missed in this NFL season. Although in respect to Peyton Manning, the Colts quarterback has managed to achieve what some quarterbacks only dream of. By winning his first Super Bowl in 2006 he has achieved his ultimate goal. Although Tom Brady has two more Super Bowl rings than Manning, Peyton holds a few records of his own.
