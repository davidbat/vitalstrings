Will Tom Brady Break Passing Yardage Record
September 21st 2011 19:16
After two weeks of the NFL season Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is on pace to pass for 7,520 yards. You read that right.
7,520 yards.
Of course, he won't throw for that much. No one has ever thrown for over 6,000 yards in an NFL season. 7,000 would probably have to wait for the 20 game schedule.
But he could very well shatter the single season passing yardage record of 5,084 set by Miami Dolphin hall of famer Dan Marino in 1984 (has it really been almost 30 years). New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees is the only other person to throw for over 5,000 as he had 5,069 in 2008.
At the moment Brady has thrown for 940 yards in two games. He would have  to throw for just over 4,100 yards the rest of the season to break the record. With 14 games to go he would have to average 293 yards a game to come close to breaking it. Considering the fact that the Patriots don't run the ball much, Brady will get many chances to put the ball in the air and do it.
Of course, things change suddenly in the course of an NFL season so there is no guarantee that Brady will throw for 4,000 much less 5,000 yards. A key injury here or there to someone on the Patriots offense or Brady himself can change everything. The competition will get tougher as New England still has to play the Jets twice, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
But the schedule also has Denver, Kansas City, the Giants depleted secondary, Buffalo and Oakland.
One thing we do know. If Brady has a chance to break the record Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick will give him every opportunity.
So hold on to your hats.
Like it or not, here comes Brady.
