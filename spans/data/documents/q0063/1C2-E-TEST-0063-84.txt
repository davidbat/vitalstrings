You need to specify which of Farve's record(s) you're wonder about.  Having said that, I don't think Brady will break any of Farve's career records.  I don't like Farve so I don't know all of his records.  The one that comes to mind is the consecutive games played record.  There's no way Brady will touch that record, that one will be taken by Manning.  I think Farve set a few all time records this season but I can't think of any off the top of my head.  Brady won't play as long as Farve has and won't be as productive as Farve has been for as long.  I wouldn't give Brady more than 7 years before he walks away.  That's not long enough for him to touch any of Farve's records
