Tom Brady Says...
"I can't tell you how many golf clubs I broke as a 10-year-old. Every time I hit a bad shot, I'd try to break my club. I once busted our TV with a video game . I threw the remote through the screen. Every time I'd lose, I'd just throw a fit. That was me growing up. I guess it's still the same."
