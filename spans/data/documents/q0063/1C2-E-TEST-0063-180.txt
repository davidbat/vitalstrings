Tom Brady might have gone home after the Super Bowl to cry in wife Gisele Bundchen ’s bosom, but he’ll probably be getting some crap from his teammates this afternoon.
Because apparently Gisele violated ‘The Code.’ The Patriots reportedly have some kind of understanding in which you don’t talk crap about each other after losing a game. It’s called the “code of brotherhood"

Tom Brady , husband to supermodel Gisele Bundchen and quarterback for the New England Patriots lost to the New York Giants last night, so it was a very sad day for the Brady-Bundchen household. Actually what am I even talking about, these are two of the most attractive people ever, stop feeling sorry for them!
Anyways, Gisele was NOT a happy camper when her hubby’s team lost last night and according to some sources who heard her as she left the stadium last night, she was pretty pissed off with The Patriots too.

Gisele Bundchen is married to Tom Brady , the quarterback for the New England Patriots, or as I refer to him, that hot football guy that’s married to Supermodel Gisele Bundchen.
So anyways, in light of this weekends festivities, aka the Super Bowl (which for many of you reading this right is an excuse to complain about how sports are dumb and feeling bad about how many calories are really in potato skins

Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady ’s new mansion looks like they took five regular houses, put them next to each other, added in a lake, tossed in a shopping mall, and called it “home.”
The NFL star and his supermodel wife have been building a massive estate in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood, Los Angeles. It’s just about done, and it’s a sight to behold.
The $20 million estate is 22,000 square feet, has eight bedrooms

They say in life, it’s healthier to count the things you do have rather than the things you don’t.
Yeah, screw that, look at this freaking paradise Gisele Bundchen is living in. Gisele and her NFL husband, Tom Brady , purchased a $25 million, custom made, gigantic, WTF mansion in Brentwood, California. Construction is just about done, and the two will share the compound with their two-year old son, Benjamin.
