Feb 6, 2012 - For the New York Giants , the biggest prize of anything reaped from their 21-17 win over the New England Patriots in the 2012 Super Bowl is obvious. The Giants, a 9-7 team in the regular season that at one point lost four straight games, brought the Vince Lombardi Trophy to New York for the second time in four years. New York's four Super Bowl victories ties them with the Green Bay Packers for the fourth-highest total in the league.
Individually, Eli Manning and Tom Coughlin also broke several Super Bowl Records. Manning's nine straight completions to start the game (he finished 30-for-40 with 296 yards and one touchdown) were the most to do so, while Coughlin, 65, became the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl. Manning also became the fifth player in NFL history to win the Super Bowl MVP Award at least twice. Joe Montana won it three times, while Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw and Tom Brady won it twice.
Ahmad Bradshaw became the fourth player to score the game-winning touchdown in the final minute of a Super Bowl, joining John Taylor (Super Bowl XXIII), Plaxico Burress (Super Bowl XLII) and Santonio Holmes (Super Bowl XLIII).
Speaking of Brady, New England's quarterback also broke several Super Bowl records from the opposite sideline. His 16 straight completions stretching into the second half was the longest streak of completions in Super Bowl history.
