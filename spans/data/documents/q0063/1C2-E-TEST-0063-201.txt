Brady good to go
News: As usual, Patriots QB Tom Brady was on the team's injury report heading into a game and he is not listed among the team's inactives. Brady will start the Week 15 game against the Packers.
Analysis: There's no doubt that Brady is a must-start Fantasy option heading into the Sunday night matchup, even against the fifth-best Fantasy defense against the quarterback. He has thrown for multiple touchdowns without throwing an interception in six straight games, tying him with the late Don Meredith for the longest streak in NFL history.

Brady on historical pace
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady has thrown for multiple touchdowns without throwing an interception in six straight games, tying him with the late Don Meredith for the longest streak in NFL history. The MVP candidate will look to set the new mark in the Week 15 game against the Packers on Sunday night. Brady leads the NFL's top scoring offense (31.9 points per game) and he's doing it in the same fashion that helped New England win three Super Bowls in a four-year span, by connecting with six different targets for scores this season. With one more touchdown toss, Brady will become just the 12th player since the NFL merger to throw for 30-plus TDs in two different seasons.
Analysis: Brady threw for a season-high 369 yards against the Bears last week in the midst of what looked like a snow storm. The forecast for Sunday night -- low of 30 degrees, 10 percent chance of snow --seems like a summer vacation in Foxboro compared to snowy Soldier Field. Either way, it's evident that Brady is one of the few signal-callers who the cold weather does not effect. Green Bay is also no stranger to dipping temperatures, and their defense has evolved into a top-three unit against the pass. They allow less than 200 yards per game through the air, and four of the last five QBs they have faced have been held under that mark. Only two opposing QBs have throws for multiple TDs against them all season. All that said, Brady is arguably the best in the league, and he has a healthy compliment of weapons on a prime-time stage. There's no doubt that he is a must-start Fantasy option heading into the Week 15 matchup, even against the fifth-best Fantasy defense against the quarterback.

Brady sits Wed. as usual
News: As has been the trend lately, Patriots QB Tom Brady sat out practice Wednesday with a sore foot. New England hosts the Packers in Week 15, and Brady will likely remain on the injury report as usual with foot and shoulder problems.
Analysis: Brady and the Patriots can't seem to do anything wrong lately with no turnovers in their last five games. Brady's last interception came in mid-October, which tells you exactly how dialed in the likely 2010 MVP has been over the last couple of months. While the Packers can be pretty decent against the pass at times, last week's performance against the Bears in the snow proved that Brady is a must-start Fantasy option in all leagues no matter what the weather. He should be able to put up solid numbers once again in Week 15.

Weather can't slow down Brady
News: Even a cold, windy day couldn't slow down Tom Brady in Week 14. The Patriots quarterback threw for a season-high 369 yards and two touchdowns in the 36-7 win over the Bears. His first score came on a 7-yard strike to TE Rob Gronkowski in the first quarter. He added a 59-yard touchdown pass to WR Deion Branch on the last play of the first half, despite the sideline calling for a knee. He has now gone six consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes and no interceptions. "Whatever the elements are, we've got to be mentally tough to play in them," he said. "Both teams are playing in them. Coach always stresses that the opponent that we're playing is the Chicago Bears -- not the weather, not the refs, not the crowd." Brady completed 16 passes to WRs Wes Welker and Branch, totaling 266 yards and one touchdown.
Analysis: Brady has been simply on fire over the last eight games, tossing 19 scores over that span with no interceptions. The conditions were horrid in Week 14 but he executed the Patriots game plan perfectly, completing lots of short passes and keeping the chains moving. He made a few poor decisions on Sunday but luckily the Bears could not come up with the interception on a few occasions. Brady has gone over the 300-yard mark in three straight games and will be looking to continue that trend in Week 15 against the Packers. Green Bay entered Sunday ranked sixth in the league against the pass but Brady has proven himself as a must-start Fantasy QB. Be sure to have him active next week.

Brady ready for windy affair
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady (right shoulder, foot) was listed as active for Week 14 against the Bears. The matchup in Chicago will be impacted by freezing temperatures, strong winds including gusts over 40 m.p.h. and several inches of snow. That could impact the Patriots' passing offense and could mean less-than-ideal numbers for Tom Brady , who is the hottest quarterback in the league right now. Snow isn't the issue -- last year he tossed six touchdowns in the snow at home vs. the Titans -- but the wind is. That game against the Titans had moderate winds; a home game vs. the Jets in 2007 had slightly stronger winds and the team opted to run the ball and Brady had no scores in what would be his least productive matchup in his record-setting season. Working in Brady's favor is his experience in the poor conditions and the Patriots' dink-and-dunk offense that allows for lots of short, quick-hit passes that won't be affected by the wind. There will be low visibility, probably even in the stadium, National Weather Service meteorologist Richard Castro told the DeKalb Daily Chronicle. There will be snow on the field, and that will be blowing around with the very strong winds. The other thing is, being right on the lakefront, thats where were expecting the strongest wind gusts out of this storm.
Analysis: Brady is coming off a game in which he threw for 326 yards and four touchdowns in a 45-3 rout of the Jets. If you start him in Week 14, lower expectations. We don't think he completely struggles against the Bears, though it's obvious to mention that he's going up against the Bears' 13th-ranked pass defense that has allowed just over 215 yards per game and have held opposing quarterbacks to just 11 Fantasy points on average per contest. If you have another quality quarterback playing in better conditions and with a favorable matchup, you might want to consider him over Brady in Week 14.

Brady to face tough task
News: Patriots Tom Brady has tossed 17 touchdowns in his last seven games but will face one of the better defenses in the league in Week 14 against the Bears. Chicago ranks 13th in the NFL against the pass, allowing over 215 yards per game, and have held opposing quarterbacks to just 11 Fantasy points per contest. In two career games against the Bears, Brady has thrown for 595 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.
Analysis: Brady has been on fire of late and enters Week 13 fresh off a 45-3 beatdown of the division-rival Jets, a contest in which he threw four scores. While he has gone five consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes and no interceptions, the Bears know how to cause turnovers and have been able to limit some of the better quarterbacks in the league. Chicago is giving up the least amount of Fantasy points to opposing signal callers through the first 12 games but Brady has been too productive to bench. Sunday's game will be a windy, cold affair and Brady has excelled in those. Consider the five-time Pro Bowler a No. 1 Fantasy QB for Week 14.

Brady unstoppable at home
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady won his 26th straight regular season home start, setting an NFL record, in Week 13 against the Jets. He also tossed four touchdowns and threw for 326 yards in the 45-3 blowout. His first scoring strike came in the first quarter when he hit WR Deion Branch on a fourth-and-3, which the receiver took 25 yards for the touchdown. Brady then found WR Brandon Tate from 4 yards out and finished the half 10 of 16 for 152 yards with the two scores. He came out firing after halftime, finding WR Wes Welker for an 18-yard score and he capped off the win with a 1-yard toss to TE Aaron Hernandez for his fourth passing touchdown of the game. Brady, who also gained 3 yards on one carry on Monday night, passed Drew Bledsoe for 13th on the all-time touchdown list (252) in the victory. "That's what makes Tom the quarterback he is," coach Bill Belichick said.
Analysis: Brady, who posted a near perfect QB-rating (148.9 out of a possible 158.3) against the Jets, could not be stopped in Week 13. He has now gone five consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes and no interceptions. In fact, he has not been picked off since Week 6, and has tossed 17 scores in his last seven games. Fantasy owners that thought his numbers would have gone down without WR Randy Moss have been pleasantly proven wrong and there is no telling how many more touchdowns he can throw with four games to go in the season. Coming off back-to-back four touchdown games, consider Brady a No. 1 Fantasy QB and a must-start against the Bears in Week 14.

Brady good to go vs. Jets
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady was after for Week 13 against the Jets after missing practice earlier in the week with right shoulder and foot injuries. He is 12-4 as a starter against the Jets, which included a Week 2 loss, completing 62.6 percent of his passes for 3,568 yards, 18 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He has won 25 straight regular-season starts at home, which is tied with Brett Favre for the longest streak for a starting QB. Brady has also done very well in his career on Mondays. He is 9-4 with 28 touchdowns (27 passing) and 13 interceptions in 13 games. He is averaging 257.1 passing yards per contest in that span.
Analysis: Brady has come to life for Fantasy owners since the departure of WR Randy Moss. He has multi-touchdown games in four straight contests and hasn't thrown an interception since Week 6. In fact, he has thrown a pick in just two games this season, including twice in Week 2 against New York. The Jets will provide a tough matchup in Week 13, but Brady did catch a break on Friday. The Jets lost starting safety Jim Leonhard to a broken leg, so New York could have a potential weakness in its secondary. Keep Brady active as a No. 1 Fantasy QB for Week 13.

Brady sits out practice Tue.
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady continued his trend of missing early-week practices when he sat out Tuesday with a foot issue. Brady has been on the injury report every week for the last few seasons, but still plays. New England hosts the Jets in Week 13.
Analysis: Brady has played sensational over his last three games: 70 of 95 passing for 877 yards and 10 total touchdowns (one rushing), putting his midseason struggles behind him. Brady threw for 248 yards and two touchdowns at New York earlier this season with two interceptions, and both touchdowns went to departed receiver Randy Moss. Continue to roll with Brady in all Fantasy formats as a No. 1 Fantasy option.

Brady throws four TDs at Detroit
News: Thought Tom Brady was great at Pittsburgh two weeks ago? Turns out he was even more sensational on Thanksgiving against the Lions. Completing 21 of 27 passes (77 comp. pct.), Brady and his receivers chewed up the Lions' secondary for 341 yards and four touchdowns -- two each to Wes Welker and Deion Branch , including a 79-yard catch-and-run bomb to Branch. Brady had a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3 -- the second perfect QB rating of his career. He also hasn't thrown an interception in his last six games.
Analysis: Brady has played sensational over his last three games: 70 of 95 passing for 877 yards and 10 total touchdowns (one rushing). Normally, owners would have absolutely no problems starting a quarterback like this -- especially if they landed an 10-day break between games after playing on Thanksgiving -- but the Patriots host the Jets in Week 13. Brady threw for 248 yards and two touchdowns at New York earlier this season with two interceptions, and both touchdowns went to departed receiver Randy Moss. Obviously, the Patriots' offense is humming just fine without Moss around, and Brady's playing better than anyone in the league right now. Look for the Pats to use their smart passing offense to mix up the Jets, opening the door for Brady to put up good numbers. Start him in Week 13.

Brady active, ready to go
News: The Patriots will start Tom Brady at Detroit today after he barely practiced this week with shoulder and foot issues. Brady will take on a Lions defense that has allowed two 300-yard passers and 16 passing touchdowns through 10 games.
Analysis: Brady is considered a very solid start for Week 12 against a suspect Detroit secondary. Now that you know he is playing, make sure he's active in your lineup.

Brady questionable for Turkey day
News: The New England Patriots are listing quarterback Tom Brady as questionable for their Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions. Typically Brady is listed as probable, but Brady sat out practice for a second straight day Wednesday with shoulder and foot injuries as New England continued preparations for its Thursday game against the Lions in Week 12. He also sat out practice Tuesday.
Analysis: Brady took one day off from practice during the weeks leading up to the team's previous two games. Both times, however, he was listed as probable on the report. Brady played in both games, victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts, and totaled five touchdowns. Brady's owners shouldn't panic about this news, as Brady doesn't really need to practice much at this stage in order to be ready for a game. They should certainly double check with us on Thursday morning around 11 a.m. ET to make sure he's active, though. Brady was extremely efficient in Week 11and is now tied with Brett Favre for most consecutive regular season wins at home. Brady has thrown seven touchdown passes with no interceptions over his last three games and has racked up 760 passing yards over that stretch. While he might not be able to match the production of a Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers most weeks, Brady can still be a very productive Fantasy QB. Consider Brady a low-end No. 1 Fantasy QB heading into Week 12 as long as he's good to go.

News: Patriots QB Tom Brady (shoulder, foot) did not practice Tuesday as New England continued preparations for its Thursday game against the Lions in Week 12. He took a day off from practice for the third straight week with a sprained foot. He participated on a limited basis on Monday.
Analysis: Brady's owners shouldn't panic about this news, as Brady doesn't really need to practice much at this stage in order to be ready for a game.

Brady limited in practice
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady (right shoulder, foot) was limited in practice on Monday in preparation for Week 12 against the Lions. Brady went 19 for 25 for 186 yards and a pair of touchdowns in Week 11 against the Colts.
Analysis: Brady has been known to take it easy in practice from time to time but there is not much threat in him missing a game. He was extremely efficient in Week 11and is now tied with Bret Favre for most consecutive regular season wins at home. Brady has still thrown for seven touchdown passes with no interceptions over his last three games and racked up 760 passing yards over that stretch. While he might not be able to match the production of a Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers anymore, Brady can still be a very productive Fantasy QB. The Patriots have a short week as they head to Detroit to the play the Lions on Thanksgiving. Consider Brady a low-end No. 1 Fantasy QB heading into Week 12.

Brady keeps on winning at home
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady recorded his 25th straight regular-season win in Week 11 against the Colts. Coming off a 350-yard, three-touchdown performance against Pittsburgh last week, Brady threw only six incompletions on Sunday and had a pair of touchdown passes in the 31-28 win. He hooked up with Wes Welker on a 22-yard strike in the first quarter and then found Aaron Hernandez from 8-yards out to give New England a 14-0 lead in the second. He only threw for 55 yards after halftime, but still wound up with a quarterback rating of 123.1. Brady hooked up with six different receivers in the victory and finished 19 for 25 for 186 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
Analysis: Brady was extremely efficient on Sunday and is now tied with Bret Favre for most consecutive regular season wins at home. Still, after starting the game off very hot, Brady recorded just 55 yards passing after halftime. Some of that can be attributed to New England's running game as the Patriots racked up 168 yards rushing against the Colts. However, the other part of it is the result of New England not having a receiver who can stretch the field. Almost all of Brady's throws are on underneath routes and his longest completion on Sunday went for just 25 yards. However, Brady has still thrown for seven touchdown passes with no interceptions over his last three games and racked up 760 passing yards over that stretch. While he might not be able to match the production of a Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers anymore, Brady can still be a very productive Fantasy QB. The Patriots have a short week as they head to Detroit to the play the Lions on Thanksgiving. Consider Brady a low-end No. 1 Fantasy QB heading into Week 12.

Brady officially ruled active
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady (right shoulder, foot) has officially been ruled active for Week 11 against the Colts. Brady only took limited practice reps this week after sitting out Wednesday. He will face a Colts' team that is ranked 10th in pass defense, allowing 211 passing yards per game. Indianapolis has surrendered 11 touchdowns through the air this year and has allowed an average of 15 Fantasy points to opposing QBs on the season.
Analysis: Brady is always on the injury report with a phantom right shoulder injury, but these last two weeks he has popped up with a foot injury. However, you saw against the Steelers how much the injury impacted his performance -- not very much. Brady has had some success in his career against the Colts (17 touchdowns in eight games) and seems to have the Patriots' offense firing on all cylinders at the moment. He has now thrown for 814 yards and six touchdowns over his last three contests and has completed 61 percent of his passes over that stretch. The Colts have been decent against the pass this season, but Brady proved last week can still produce against a good defense. Consider him a low-end No. 1 Fantasy QB heading into Week 11.

Brady shreds the Steelers
News: Patriots QB Tom Brady had his most impressive game of the 2010 season -- by far -- in the Week 10 win over the Steelers. Not only did he throw for a season-high 350 yards against the NFL's fourth-ranked defense (heading into the game), but completed a season-high 30 of 43 pass attempts. Even more impressive were his three touchdown passes, all to TE Rob Gronkowski , who beat Steelers DB William Gay in man coverage on all three scores. The first TD came from 19-yards out on the opening drive of he game, and the second was a 9-yard hook-up on the team's opening drive of the second half. The third was a game-sealing 25-yard pitch-and-catch in the fourth quarter. Brady also took a QB-sneak for a 3-yard score in the third, good for his first rushing TD of the season. "We made big plays when we needed to make them," Brady said. "It's an exciting game for us in this locker room. We haven't been this happy in a long time. We're pretty good when we execute the right way."
Analysis: Brady had his way with the Steelers defense, and that was the plan from the beginning. The Patriots came out of the gate throwing much more than they elected to run against the league's top rush defense. Brady worked the short passing game early, then attacked the three windows of the zone on down-the-field passes to the middle and outsides. Even though the Steelers knew the Pats were going to throw more than usual, they did not sack him once on the night. Brady will look for a repeat effort in Week 11, when they host the Colts, to renew another rivalry. Indianapolis sports the NFL's 10-th ranked pass defense, but Brady is firing on all cylinders, so he should remain a No. 1 Fantasy QB in that matchup.

Brady to start Sun. night
News: As expected, Patriots QB Tom Brady will play in the Week 10 game against the Steelers despite a shoulder and foot issue. He was probable on the official injury report.
Analysis: Brady has struggled recently coming into his game with the Steelers. In his past four games  all without WR Randy Moss  he has averaged just 15 Fantasy points with last weeks game at Cleveland his best performance with 224 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. But the Browns dont present the same level of difficulty as the Steelers, who are among the league leaders with only eight touchdowns allowed and 24 sacks. The Patriots have become a dink and dunk offense, and Brady might finish with minimal stats. Now, with Pittsburghs run defense, Brady could be throwing all game and finish with quality production. He also has a great history against the Steelers with an average of 334 passing yards in four meetings with nine touchdowns and three interceptions over that span. The bottom line with Brady is that its starting to become a risk to keep him active in Fantasy leagues. If you feel comfortable benching him it might be a move that makes depending on who else is on your roster.
