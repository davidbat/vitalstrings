Pin It
Soon-to-be #1 and #2.
Just in case you haven’t heard yet, New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees broke Dan Marino’s single-season passing yardage record last night on Monday Night Football against the Atlanta Falcons ( which some are crying foul over ). The mark set by Brees now stands at 5,087, 3 yards above Marino’s 5,084 yards. Brees has next week’s game against the Carolina Panthers to pad that record some more.
New England Patriots QB Tom Brady is next in line to pass Marino’s 27-year-old record. Brady currently has 4,897 yards, so he would need to throw for at least 188 yards this week against the Buffalo Bills to move past Dan Marino, making Brady #2 all-time and pushing poor Danny boy to #3 all-time.
Does Brady have a shot at moving past Brees and claim the #1 spot in the record books?
Not likely, but it could make for a fun Sunday. Brady would need 191 passing yards to break Brees’ record, but that would be without Brees throwing for another yard. The Patriots and the Saints are playing their respective games at 1 p.m. EST, so Brady breaking the record earlier in the day and Brees reclaiming it in the late afternoon isn’t in the cards.
Here’s a fun what-if scenario: Brady gets hot in the first half of the game Sunday while Brees struggles in his game. We can see the record being claimed, reclaimed, claimed, reclaimed, etc based on when the Patriots and Saints offenses take the field. How much fun would that be? We could see the record change hands several times in one 3-hour period of time. It’s not likely to happen, but it would be fun, no?
No matter what happens, here’s what’s likely to happen on Sunday barring any unforeseen injuries or struggles: Drew Brees will be #1, Tom Brady will be #2, and Dan Marino will be #3 all-time for single-season passing yardage.
