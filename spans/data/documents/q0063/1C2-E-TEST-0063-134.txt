No, but you're not accepting the fact that Moss played an immense roll within that Patriot offense. Moss's ability to take a team from great, to amazing is what led to that 50 TD season.
LOL, I never said or insinuated that in any way, shape or form.

Not even half of Brady's 50 TD's were to Moss. Packers have talented enough recievers all around to inflate Aaron's TD number.
Maybe I am reading too much into this but you seem to be stating with your first point that Moss's 23 TDs weren't all that impressive because they only made up for around half of Brady's 50 TDs. Because the Packers have so many weapon that would mean they wouldn't need a guy like Moss. However a player like Moss has shown his ability to score TDs, and his ability to take an offense and make it even more explosive than it is. Yet you believe he wouldn't benefit your team in anyway? That seems like you're understating Moss's value to a team.

I never said Moss wasn't great, I just said Moss not being on the Packers has nothing to do with Rodgers having a shot at breaking Brady's record.
Him being a key component in Brady's 2007 season doesn't hold any meaning in an argument comparing two QBs to each other? I apologize if find comparing two QBs each other without looking at the pieces around them strange.
