FOXBOROUGH -- After all these years, it still hasn't lost its luster.
Tom Brady is getting ready to play in his fifth Super Bowl in 11 years, and its still as surreal to him now as it was the first time.
”It’s incredible. You watch this game; I was a kid growing up, I was a 49er fan so I got to watch a lot of Super Bowls," Brady said. ”You pinch yourself to get this opportunity. I’m privileged to be part of an incredible organization (and) to play with a great group of teammates. It’s really a privilege to play quarterback on this team.”
Brady and coach Bill Belichick have now reached five Super Bowls together, an NFL record for a quarterback-coach combo.
Told of the achievement after Sunday's 23-20 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick said he was proud of the mark.
"Anything that’s associated with winning, I’m proud of," Belichick said. "I mean, I'm proud – there’s no quarterback I’d rather have than Tom Brady. He’s the best. He does so much for us in so many ways on so many different levels. I’m really fortunate that he's our quarterback and for what he's able to do for this team. It’s good to win with him and all the rest of our players."
