About Tom Brady:
Tom Brady is the only quarterback in the history of the NFL to start and win three Super Bowls before the age of 28.  He was also the youngest QB to win a Super Bowl at the time his New England Patriots won their first Super Bowl (XXXVI).
And he has accomplished all this despite being an afterthought in the 2000 NFL Draft, lasting until the sixth round where the Patriots were the fortunate team to finally pull the trigger.
From the moment he got the chance to start, Brady displayed the poise that would lead his team to three championships in four years.  He began by setting a league record for the most consecutive passes without an interception to start a career.  He also had a streak of 147 postseason passes without an interception
Did You Know... Tom Brady, like many great athletes, was a multi-sport star.  In fact, his ability as a catcher led to his being drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 18th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft.
