I think he will come close
A few weeks ago, I would have said, no he won't break the record. The last few weeks there seems to have been times when most teams would have taken out their starting quarterback and the Patriots didn't. I am a Patriots fan so I am having fun watching them put all the points on the board.
Something else is going on. I don't know what it is but the Patriots, all the way from Billichek on down, seem like they are trying to prove something. They definately took the "camera gate" allegations to heart and it's almost like they need to show they are a great team.
I'd like to see Brady break the record because he's never had the receivers in the past to do what they are doing now. The second half of the season should be interesting.
