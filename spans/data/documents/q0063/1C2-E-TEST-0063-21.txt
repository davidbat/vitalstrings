The first question for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after his record-setting performance in a 38-24 victory over the Dolphins tonight was what he might do for an encore.
"Well, it was a good night in that sense, we executed pretty well at times," Brady said. "Look, it's a team sport. Those guys were making some great plays catching the ball. Aaron (Hernandez), Gronk (Rob Gronkowski), Chad (Ochocinco), Deion (Branch), Wes (Welker). There was a lot of tough looks out there that we got and guys really stayed aware of the situations. We made enough plays to win. That's the goal."
Brady passed for 517 yards and four touchdowns. His yardage was the fifth-highest total ever in the NFL and he became the 11th quarterback to exceed 500 yards in a game. Norm Van Brocklin set the record of 554 yards in 1951.
Brady did suffer one loss when center Dan Koppen left the game with an ankle injury.
"That's tough. He's the best. There's no one like him," Brady said of Koppen. "I think he and I have a great chemistry between the two of us, we always have. He's one of my great friends, and hopefully he's back at some point."
Brady and the Patriots frequently used a no-huddle scheme, and racked up a team-record 622 yards of offense.
"It's a fine line between putting pressure on the defense and playing out of control, and I thought at times we did both," Brady said. "You never really want to play out of control on offense, but it was a good pace at times, gave them some problems, but at other times, they adjusted to it. We've got to find ways to execute better
Is a fast pace Brady's preferred style?
"I enjoy scoring points. Whatever the hell we need to do to score points, that's what I enjoy doing. Sometimes we go fast, sometimes we go slow. It's just a matter of what the point of the drive is, what we're trying to execute, and ultimately trying to get the ball in the end zone," he said.
