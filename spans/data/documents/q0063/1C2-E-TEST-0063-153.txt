Brady: No plans to retire: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told Sports Illustrated he has no plans to retire "any time soon" even if he will be 35 in August. "Well, I love doing [my job]," Brady said. "I don't want to wake up and be bored. That's probably my greatest fear is to have nothing to do. What better job is there than to play quarterback for an NFL team, and certainly one that I've been on for a long time and had success with? I don't plan on giving it up any time soon."
