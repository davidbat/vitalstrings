Tom Brady in the snow bowl
Week 6: Its ben allmost a year since i`ve posted because nobody has broken any records. Unless you count Brett Favre breaking his own records each and every week. Well Favre is gonna have to stick around a little longer cause Tom Brady and the New England Patriots have shattered more records today in a winning battle over the Tennessee Titans 59-0. There was 4 records broken.
1) Brady's 5 TD passes in 2nd quarter an NFL record.
2) New England beat single-game franchise records for points 59.
3) New England established single-game franchise records for 619 yards of total offense.
4) It also went down as the Patriots' largest margin of victory in franchise and NFL history matching the Los Angeles Rams' 59-0 win over the Atlanta Falcons in 1976.
