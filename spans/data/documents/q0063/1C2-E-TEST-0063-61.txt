NFL Career
Draft and Rookie Year
In 2000, the New England Patriots drafted Brady in the sixth round (199 overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft . Brady who had been expecting to be drafted in the third or forth was tremendously disappointed with being drafted so late in the draft. However, as disappointed as Brady was at getting drafted in the sixth round - he may have been luckily to have been drafted at all. One scout wrote about Brady prior to the draft in a scouting report that Tom had "Poor build, very skinny and narrow, lacks mobility and the ability to avoid the rush, lacks a really strong arm." [8] When Brady arrived at the Foxboro, Massachusetts in the summer of 2000, the Patriots at the time already had three quarterbacks on the roster so Brady didn't have a guarantee of even making the team, but he ended up played well in preseason and training camp and won the third quarterback roster spot. He only appeared in one game as a rookie and completed one pass.
2001 Season
In his second season with the Pats (2001), Brady moved up on the depth chart from third quarterback behind Damon Hurd to the second quarterback spot and became the direct backup to then starting QB Drew Bledsoe . In week two of the season in a game against the Jets, Bledsoe was hurt while scrambling to get out of bounds and gain some yardage. Brady entered the game and completed 5 passes for 46 yards but the Patriots lost the game 10 to 3. The next week, Brady started his first NFL as a quarterback vs the Indianapolis Colts . Brady ended up starting the rest of the regular thirteen season games and the Patriots finished the season with a with an 11 & 5 record an AFC East devision title and most importantly a playoff berth.
