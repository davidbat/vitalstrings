Quarterback Tom Brady has three times led the New England Patriots to the championship of the National Football League. In only his second year in the league, Brady replaced injured starting QB Drew Bledsoe in the second game of the 2001 season and remained the starter the rest of the year. With Brady at the helm, the Patriots scored a 20-17 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI in February 2002. Brady was named the Super Bowl's most valuable player and became the youngest starting quarterback ever to win the Super Bowl. In 2004 the Patriots were back in Super Bowl XXXVIII, and again Brady was named the game's MVP as he led the Patriots to a 32-29 win over the Carolina Panthers. In 2005 Brady and the Patriots again went to the big game, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, 24-21, in Super Bowl XXXIX. He was named the most valuable player of the NFL in 2007, when the Patriots had a perfect 16-0 record in the regular season before losing to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl by a score of 17-14. In the very first game of 2008, Brady injured his knee and missed the entire season. He was replaced that year by backup Matt Cassel, but returned for the 2009 season. He signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension before the start of the 2010 season, paying him $18 million per season with a total of $48.5 million guaranteed. That made Brady the NFL's highest-paid player (at that moment, at least) and assured that he would stay with the Patriots through the 2014 season. He again led the Patriots to the Super Bowl in 2012 (after the 2011 season), but they again lost to the New York Giants, this time 21-17.
