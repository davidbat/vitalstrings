Tom Brady against the Buffalo Bills
Tom Brady Fact
Brady                              used to wear Yankee hats around the Patriots locker room until someone told him not to. He now wears Red                              Sox and SF Giants caps. It's no surprise his fellow                              Patriots weren't too pleased with his wearing the                              cap of a number one competitor. In fact, one can safely                              assume that it wasn't like someone had to create                              QR code to get the message across, it was probably                              pretty obvious that Brady was expected to give up                              his Yankees cap.
