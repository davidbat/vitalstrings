To say Tom Brady’s performance Monday night against the Miami Dolphins was impressive would be an understatement.
The New England Patriots quarterback passed for 517 yards on Monday coming up just shy of Norm Van Brocklin’s single-game record of 554 yards set on Sept. 28, 1951.
Wes Welker reaped the benefits of Brady’s hot hand.  He pulled down eight catches for 160 yards and two touchdowns, including a 99-yarder in the fourth quarter.
Tight end Aaron Hernandez added seven grabs for 103 yards and a score.
Deion Branch and Rob Gronkowski also had multiple catches and racked up big yardage.
In his Patriots debut, Chad Ochocinco was limited to just one catch for 14 yards.
Defensively, Albert Haynesworth seemed as though he is on the long to redemption.  Although the big tackle recorded just two tackles, he was a persistent disruption in the Dolphins backfield.
Fellow former Washington Redskins defensive lineman Andre Carter recorded a sack in his first game as well.
Brady’s big numbers overshadowed a strong performance for Miami’s Chad Henne.  The Dolphins quarterback was 27-of-43 for 369 yards and two touchdowns without an interception.
His favorite target?
Brandon Marshall is on his own path back after a tumultuous offseason in which he was stabbed in the abdomen by his wife and the revelation he lives with borderline personality disorder.
He was able to put those distractions aside on Monday, catching six passes for 129 yards.
In his first regular season game with the Dolphins, Reggie Bush carried the ball 11 times for 38 yards.
