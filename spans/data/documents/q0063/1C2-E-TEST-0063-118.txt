Tom Brady passes Dan Marino's all-time single season passing record
January 2, 2012 By admin Leave a Comment
Tom Brady finished up his season with the second most yards passing in NFL history.  Brady finished with 5,235 yards after throwing for 338 today against the Buffalo Bills. Even though Brady passed the record that was set by Dan Marino in 1984, he was still second best behind New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees . It was just last week  on Monday Night Football that Brees broke Dan Marino’s record of 5,084 yards. Brees piled on another 389 yards today and finished the season with a 5,486 yards.
What a year Tom Brady has been having. Can you imagine being a quarterback and breaking the great Dan Marino single season passing record and being in second place? That would have to be a weird situation to know you have played so well and a given it your all and there is a guy that has one-upped you. These guys can say the records don’t matter and only winning the Super Bowl matters but that is just hot air. They can say that all they want to the television cameras but we all know the truth. They want these records and there is nothing wrong with that. It’s just another accomplishment and who doesn’t like to accomplish things?
Rob Gronkowski sets the single-season receiving record for tight ends
Just like the New Orleans Saints, it was a record setting day for the Patriots. Rob Gronkowski also set a new NFL record. Gronkowski set the single-season receiving record for tight ends with 1,327 yards. Gronkowski broke the record previously set for the day of 1,310 yards by Jimmy Graham of the New Orleans Saints. The record of 1,290 receiving yards was set in 1980 by Tight End Kellen Winslow of the San Diego Chargers.Yes we also miss Dan Fouts as well. What a great passer he was.
