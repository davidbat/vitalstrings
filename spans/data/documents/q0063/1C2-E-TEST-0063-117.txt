A quick six-yarder to Jermaine Wiggins brought the          ball into field goal range at the St. Louis 30-yard-line. Tom stopped          the clock with a spike with seven seconds remaining.
Tom trotted off the          field and watched wide-eyed as Vinatieri split the uprights to win the          game, 20-17. Toms final numbers were workmanlike—16 for 27          for 145 yards and a touchdown. He was named the games MVP.
Toms life was          a whirlwind after the Super Bowl—parties, interviews, and celebrity          golf tournaments. That made preparing for the 2002 season even more difficult.          The Patriots returned much the same squad from the year before. The most          notable change came on offense at tight end where Christian Fauria and          Cam Cleeland were signed to give Tom more optionsin the red zone. Another          welcome addition was speedy receiver Deion Branch.
Early in the campaign,          Tom had no problem getting everyone involved in the offense. The Patriots          won their first three games, lighting up the scoreboard at nearly 40 points          a contest.
But New England ultimately          showed itself to be a flawed team. The running game was inconsistent,          which enabled opponents to drop more defenders into pass coverage. After          starting 3-0, the Patriots lost their next four in a row, then struggled          the rest of the way to stay above .500. All too often the club found itself          playing catch-up, able to move the ball only when it went to the hurry-up          offense. Though Tom usually flourished in these situations, he had only          so many comebacks stored in his right arm. And there were times, as well,          when he was New Englands biggest problem. Tom was criticized for          lacking fire at various points during the season, and some questioned          his health when the accuracy of his throws dipped. To his credit, he took          the hits from the media and fans in stride, and never concocted excuses          for his uneven performance.
For all the questions          raised about Tom, his numbers were still impressive—3,763 yards          passing, 28 touchdowns and a better than 60 percent completiong rate.          On the final Sunday of the regular season, he engineered a stunning rally          at home against the Dolphins, leading the Patriots to a 27-24 overtime          victory, which kept New Englands slim playoff hopes alive. But Tom          and teammates wound up on the outside looking in when the Browns and Jets          both won, too.
As Tom learned in          2002, life as a Pro Bowl quarterback and Super Bowl MVP is challenging          in ways he never imagined. The demands on his time—whether he was          receiving an ESPY Award or serving as a judge in the Miss USA pageant—never          seemed to end. Focusing on what he deemed most important was extremely          difficult. Tom found ways to stay grounded and keep his personal life          out of the newspapers. He had no misconceptions about what people in New          England wanted from him. When the Patriots slumped, Tom realized that          fans and reporters sometimes had selectively short memories.
Tom spent the offseson          recovering from a separated shoulder he had suffered in the season's final          game. Tom opted not to have surgery, and the team kept the injury quiet.
The 2003 edition of          the Patriots posed a lot of questions, particularly on defense. Gone was          Milloy, replaced by Rodney Harrison, a veteran picked up off the junk          pile after a long career in San Diego. Other key newcomers included Ted          Washington and Rosevelt Colvin. On offense, Tom was supported by a squad          that featured no major stars, relying instead on the likes of Smith, Brown          and Branch.
The Pats opened the          year against the Bills. The game was a catastrophe—Buffalo scored          a 31-0 shutout, and Colvin suffered a season-ending hip injury. The press          wondered whether Tom was up to the challenge of saving what looked to          be a lost season. Most around the league believed that Belichick had lost          the faith of his players.
One week later, it          was a different story. Tom led the Patriots into Philadelphia and shredded          the Eagle defense in a 31-10 win. An impressive 23-16 victory over the          Jets the following Sunday was followed by a close loss in Washington to          the Redskins, leaving New England at 2-2.
With injuries were          beginning to erode Tom’s offensive line, he was beginning to feel          his shoulder ache again. Every hit he took made the pain a little worse.          Several times during the year his name showed up among the probables on          the injured list.
The injury bug bit          New England all season long, as 42 players started in 22 spots. Somehow,          however, the Pats mixed youth and experience and managed to win their          final 15 games. Tom was magnificent, pulling off overtime road wins in          Miami and Houston, and doing whatever it took to get the job done. New          England’s defense pitched three shutouts in November and December,          including a 31-0 pasting of Buffalo. Tom finished the year with 3,620          yards and 23 touchdowns against just 12 interceptions.
The team continued          to perform at a high level in the postseason. First, the Patriots edged          the Titans, 17-14. Then they beat the Colts in the AFC Championship Game          to reach the Super Bowl. In both games, Tom had all the time he needed          in the pocket. The games were close and exciting, but this time there          were no controversial calls.

New          England faced Carolina in Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Panthers threw everything          they had at Tom in a ferociously played first half. The Patriot defense,          meanwhile, was doing a number on the Panthers, thanks to Mike Vrabel.          The veteran linebacker forced a fumble that led to New England’s          first touchdown—a short pass to Branch from Tom, who earlier had          kept the drive alive with a 12-yard scramble.
After a long TD pass          from Jake Delhomme to Steve Smith knotted the score, Tom threw another          TD, this time to David Givens. A field goal by John Kasay made it 14-10          going into halftime.
The Patriots maintained          a measured amount of control over the game until the fourth quarter, when          the Panthers scored on an 85-yard bomb to take a 22-21 lead. The Carolina          TD marked the first time since November that New England trailed in a        game.
Tom responded with          67-yard scoring drive, the key play being a clutch reception by Brown.          On second-and-goal from the one, Belichick inserted two defensive stars          on offense. Vrabel lined up at tight end and Richard Seymour entered the          game as a blocking back. Tom faked the run and tossed to Vrabel to put          New England ahead with less than three minutes left. On their successful          two-point conversion, Tom pretended to drop the snap, freezing the defense          while Kevin Faulk snuck across the goal line.
Ever-resilient, Carolina          tied the game just over a minute left on a Delhomme pass to Rickey Proehl.          Coach John Fox took some heat later for calling a timeout, which ultimately          gave Tom and company one last shot at a regulation victory.
When Kasay’s          kickoff went out of bounds, Tom took charge. Starting on his own 40, he          calmly completed four of five passes to put Vinatieri within field goal          range. The man who had iced the game two years earlier nailed a 41-yarder          with four seconds left to win it, 32-29.
With a pair of Super          Bowl rings and two MVP awards, Tom was a bona fide superstar. While other          quarterbacks around the league put up flashier numbers, he had gained          the full respect of opposing players and coaches. And among fans, particularly          women, he was viewed as a matinee idol. Again, Tom balanced his offseason          between the demands of celebrity and the challenge of defending his second          NFL title.
The Pats entered 2004          as the AFC favorites to go to the Super Bowl. Their most significant addition          was All-Pro running back Corey Dillon, who gave the club its most devastating          running threat in years. The rest of the roster remained almost completely          unchanged, an amazing feat given football's normal free agent feeding          frenzy.
In the season opener          against the Colts, the Patriots picked up right where they had left off          against the Panthers. New England slowed down Manning and the high-powered          Indy offense just enough, while Tom had a field day with the ball in his          hands. In the Pats' 27-24 victory, he threw for 335 yards and three touchdowns.
After a pair of easy          victories at Arizona and Buffalo, the Patriots won their record 19th in          a row, 24-10 over the Dolphins. In a contest dominated by defense, Tom          managed the game beautifully. He passed for only 76 yards, but two of          his nine completions went for scores. New England then improved to 6-0          with wins over the Seattle Seahawks and Jets. Two days after beating          New York, however, Dillon hurt his foot in practice and was forced to          the bench. The injury couldn’t have come at a worse time. The Patriots          were readying themselves for their toughest test of the season, at 5-1          Pittsburgh. Without their top rusher, the Pats lost the contest and their          21-game winning streak. 
The Patriots regrouped          to go 14-2. Aside from an uncharacteristic fourth quarter meltdown in          Miami—Tom was picked off twice in the final two minutes of the game—New          England was perfect. The team's strong finish was testimony to the brilliance          of Belichick and his coaching staff. The Pats suffered a rash of injuries,          including the loss of Law for the season. Seymour, their best defensive          lineman, also went down. But the resourceful Pats adjusted. With his secondary          thin on bodies, Belichick turned to Brown, his top receiver, and asked          him to play both ways. The veteran relished the opportunity. In his handful          of games as a nickle back, he was rarely out of position and even intercepted          two passes.
The regular season          was another success for Tom. He hit on more than 60 percent of his passes          for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns. Even more impressive was his proficiency          throwing the deep ball. Once accused of having a weak arm, Tom completed          52 passes of more than 20 yards and 10 of more than 40 yards.
After a first-round          bye, the Patriots hosted the Colts in a Divisional battle. With Manning          coming off a record season, the New England defense had its hands full.          But the Pats again designed a perfect scheme to stop the Indy quarterback,          putting the clamps on Edgerrin James and mixing up their looks in the          secondary.
With New England clinging          to a 6-3 lead to start the third quarter, Tom got the offense on track.          He engineered a pair of lengthy touchdown drives that extended the score          to 20-3. That's how the contest ended.
Up next for the Pats          was a rematch with the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. New England          was installed as the favorite, even though the contest was being played          at Heinz Field. The New England defense set the tone early, intercepting          Ben Roethlisberger on his first pass attempt. Tom and his mates converted          the turnover into a field goal, and they never looked back. Tom was rock          solid once again, passing for 205 yards and two touchdowns, including          a long strike to Branch. 
The two would hook          up 11 more times in Super Bowl XXXVI against the Eagles. The media hype          before the game focused on Philadelphia receiver Terrell Owens, who vowed          to play despite suffering a broken leg several months earlier. The Pro          Bowler made good on his promise and looked surprisingly strong. In a ho-hum          contest, however, it was New England's steady defense, a handful of bad          decisions by Donovan McNabb and another heady performance by Tom that          spelled the difference.
With the contest knotted          at 14-14 heading into the fourth quarter, Tom orchestrated two scoring          drives that gave New England a 10-point margin. Philly found the end zone          with just under two minutes remaining. But thanks to some questionable          clock management, the Eagles left themselves with prescious little time          to set up a shot at the game-tying field goal.
When Harrison picked          off McNabb for the third time of the night, the Pats sealed their third          Super Bowl title in four years. Branch earned MVP honors, which was just          fine by Tom, who again came up big (22 of 33 for 236 yards and two scores).          His only mistake was a second quarter fumble that was recovered by the          Eagles.

Tom          and the Patriots found themselves defending a Super Bowl championship          for a third time in 2005. They would do so without coordinators Charlie          Weis and Romeo Crennel, gone to  Notre Dame and Cleveland, respectively.          The defense also took a step backward after Tedy Bruschi suffered a stroke,          Ted Johnson retired and Ty Law was released in a salary cap move.
Nevertheless, the          season began on a high note, as New England beat the Raiders, 30–20.          Tom had a big game, passing for more than 300 yards. After a loss to the          Panthers, Tom topped 300 yards again, this time against Pittsburgh. Tom          completed his final 12 passes to rally the Pats from a 13-10 deficit to          a 23–20 win. Unfortunately, putting two good weeks together proved          a challenge for New England. The team did not record back-to-back wins          until late November.
A perfect December          boosted New England to a 10–6 record, good enough for the division          title and another trip to the playoffs. Considering that injuries had          led to 45 different starters during the year, winning the AFC East was          quite an accomplishment. No division champ had ever had as many starters          hurt.
Tom was one of the          few Patriots who remained healthy, and his numbers showed it. Against          the Jets in the season’s second-to-last game, in fact, he became          the second NE quarterback ever to surpass 4,000 yards when connected with          Branch on a 22-yard play.
In the opening round          of the playoffs, the Patriots stomped Jacksonville, 28–3. Tom managed          the game beautifully, throwing for three TDs against the Jags, including          a 63-yarder to Ben Watson that iced the game in the third quarter. It          was a different story a week later, however, as New England stumbled against          the Broncos. The Pats committed five turnovers—two on intercepted          passes—and Denver converted them to 24 points. The Patriots actually          had the lead late in the first half, but the Broncos turned the tide with          10 quick third-quarter points enroute to a 27-13 victory. It was Tom’s          first postseason defeat after nine straight victories.
The 2006 season posed          some questions for New England's passing game. Givens was gone and Branch          was a holdout, which eventually precipitated his trade to the Seahawks.          Tom and the Patriots shook off these losses and won six of their first          seven. The lone defeant came at Gillette Stadium against Broncos.
New England’s          first major test came against the Colts. The game seesawed back and forth          until Indy seized control in the second half. Tom could not get his team          after intermission, and the Pats fell 27–20. A week later, New England          suffered another loss, this time to the Jets. It had been 57 games since          the team had last dropped two in a row. The NFL record was 60.
Tom and his teammates          righted the ship with a 35–0 pasting of the Green Bay Packers. New          England went on to win six of its last seven games to finish at 12–4.          Along with the San Diego Chargers, the Pats were the team to beat heading          into the playoffs. Tom had another stellar season, passsing for 3,529          yards and 24 TDs.
The Patriots opened          the playoffs against the Jets and cruied to a 37–16 victory. Tom          threw a pair of touchdown passes in the game. A week later, the Pats edged          the Chargers, 24–21. It was not a pretty game. New England could          not get its running attack going, and Tom threw three interceptions. But          the game turned when the Chargers fumbled while bringing back their third          INT. The Patriots recovered, and moments later Tom found Reche Caldwell          in the end zone to make the score 21–19. Faulk then took a direct          snap and barreled into the end zone for the two-point conversion that          tied the score. When New England got the ball back, Tom connected with          Caldwell again for a long gain that set up the game-winning field goal.
New England's momentum          continued in the AFC Championship Game against the Colts. The Pats scored          two defensive touchdowns in the first half, and Dillon ran for a score          to build a 21–6 lead. The Colts, however, controlled the second          half. They moved ahead with a minute left in the fourth quarter, and then          kicked off to the Patriots. Tom had more than enough time on the clock          to engineer a scoring drive, but this time he didn't deliver. His first          interception of the game squelched New England's hopes, and the Pats lost          38–34.
During the off-season,          owner Bob Kraft made improving the receiving corps the number-one priority          for the Patriots. Donte Stallworth was signed as a free agent, Wes Welker          was acquired from the Dolphins for draft picks, and the coup de grace          was a draft-day deal with the Raiders for Randy Moss. Suddenly, Tom had          the NFL’s finest set of receivers.
Hardly one to squander          such a blessing, Tom revved up the New England passing game. In the 2007          opener against the Jets, he connected with Welker, Watson and Moss for          touchdowns in a 38–14 blowout. After the game, a controversy erupted          when the Pats were accused of illegally spying on the New York sideline.          The league came down hard on the team and Belichick, fining them a combined          $750,000 and stripping New England of at least one draft pick.
The Patriots beat          the Chargers a week later by the same score, with Brady and Moss hooking          up for a pair of TDs. The Brady-Moss pairing, in particular, sent shivers          up the spines of NFL defensive coordinators. A perfectly thrown ball to          Moss was literally unstoppable, and one off the mark was still catchable.
The Patriots kept          rolling, scoring 38 for the third straight game against the hapless Bills.          The Cincinnati Bengals were the next victims, falling 34–13 in a          Monday Night game. The Pats then beat the Browns 34–17 the following          Sunday. Talk began of an unbeaten season in New England.
Next came the Cowboys          in Dallas. In front of the largest TV audience in more than a decade,          Tom outgunned Tony Romo, throwing five TD passes in a 48-27 shootout.          The following week, Tom torched the Dolphins with six scoring passes in          a 49-28 blowout. It got even uglier against Washington, as New England          rolled to a 52–7 win over the Redskins. Tom passed for his 28th          touchdown of the year early in the contest, tying the career high he had          set in 2002 and again in 2004.
That set up the game          of the century, against the defending Super Bowl champion Colts, who were          also unbeaten at this point. The TV audience eclipsed  that of the          earlier New England-Dallas contest to become the most-watched Sunday game          since the NFL began keeping records. With the Pats trailing by 10 points          in the second half, Tom connected with Welker to make it a three-point          deficit, and then hit Faulk in the end zone on the next New England possession          to give his team the lead. The defense stripped Manning on the following          possession to seal a 24–20 victory. The Pats improved to 9–0.
Any thoughts of a          letdown in Week 10 were erased when Tom picked apart the Buffalo defense          in the first half to take a 35–7 lead. The final score was 56–10.          In the process, Tom became the all-time franchise leader in touchdown          passes, passing Steve Grogan, who had 182.
Six weeks later, on          the last Sunday of the regular season, Tom broke Manning's single-season          mark with his 50th scoring strike. The TD pass—a perfectly thrown          bomb to Moss—also helped the Pats secure a 16-0 record.
That final win, 38-35          over the York Giants, was a microcosm of the weekly battles New England          faced over the campaign’s second half. Teams slowed down games against          the Pats, trying to limit the opportunities for Tom and the offense to          make big plays. New England was test on several occasions, but passed          every one of them.
It was more of the          same for the Patriots to start the playoffs. In a workmanlike performance,          they dispatched Jacksonville, 31-20. After the Jags scored on the first          drive of the game, New England took over, mixing the run and pass effectively.          Tom hit on 22 of 33 attempts for 278 yards and two touchdowns.
Next up was San Diego          in the AFC Championship Game. The Chargers, fresh off their suprsing win          over the Colts, played the Patriots even for most of the contest. Tom          struggled at time, throwing several uncharacteristic interceptions. The          difference was defense in the red zone. New England socred touchdowns,          while San Diego kicked field goals. The Pats won 21-12.
The news afterward          centered on Tom. He had sprained his right ankle against the Chargers,          and pictures of him wearing a soft cast surfaced. Tom pledged he would          be ready for the Super Bowl.
To complete their          perfect season, the Pats would have to beat the Giants for a second time.          New York entered the game brimming with confidence and kicked a field          goal on its opening drive to take a 3-0 lead.
When New England got          the ball, the Giants made it clear that Tom had a bullseye on his back.          New York pressured him from the get-go. Because of his gimpy ankle, throwing          the deep ball was the biggest challenge for Tom. The Giants made sure          he had little room to step up in the pocket.
Still, the Pats were          able to move the ball. Tom led his teammates on a time-consuming drive          of their own in the first quarter, which was capped by a short touchdown          run by Maroney. The half ended with New England up 7-3.
The Giants, however,          felt they had the advantage. New York continued to batter Tom in the second          half. He always seemed to have a defender in his face. On the day, the          Giants sacked him five times and hurried him a dozen others.
