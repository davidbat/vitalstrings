No you can't get Mew-three in any Pokemon Game THAT NINTENDO MADE. But their was this guy who made Pokemon Cauos Black and  Mew-three is the main Pokemon. But on the cover of the box and game it's a evil thingly that Soice the Hugehug had to fight. And if you find if (mostly on Ebay) and play it you will be in a guy's way on the Honnen Regen. And you have to fight Mew-three at Lever 100. So with that in your mind if you get a Master Ball use on him/her. (Is a hake of Fire Red and don't wast your money on it) But the point is no you can't get Mew-three in Pokemon Leaf Green EVEN IF YOU TRADE THE MEW-THREE FROM CAUOS BLACK TO ANY POKEMON GAME. (I was once watching a You Tube Video and it made the sound of Mewtwo)
