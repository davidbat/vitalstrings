colour of the leaf:
The colour of the leaf is green because as we all know that the leaf has chloroplasts in it, the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorbs the colours like red and blue range, but the colour green is least absorbed by the chlorophyll ,other absorbed colours vanish after being absorbed but the least absorbing g colours like green reflect the surface of the leaf, because of which we can see the leaf as coloured green.

The green color in leaves is caused by the presence of a compound called "chlorophyll," which the plant produces to do photosynthesis, which is how plants get energy from sunlight. The purpose of chlorophyll is to assist the plant in making food for itself by utilizing energy from sunlight and nutrients from the soil.
The chlorophyll is green because it absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light -- and so green is not absorbed and is reflected, making the plant look green to your eyes. Non-transparent things are the color they are because that is the color that is NOT absorbed -- the color you see is the color that is reflected... which is why you see it!
There are two basic ways by which we can see colors. Either an object can directly emit light waves in the frequency of the observed color, or an object can absorb all other frequencies, reflecting back to your eye only the light wave, or combination of light waves, that appears as the observed color. For example, to see a yellow object, either the object is directly emitting light waves in the yellow frequency, or it is absorbing the blue part of the spectrum and reflecting the red and green parts back to your eye, which perceives the combined frequencies as yellow.
