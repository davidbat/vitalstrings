Leaves are the food making factories of green plants. Leaves                        come in many different shapes and sizes. Leaves can be simple .                        They are made of a single leaf blade connected by a petiole to the stem. An oak leaf or a maple leaf are examples. A compound leaf is a leaf made up of separate leaflets attached by                        a petiole to the stem like an ash or a locust.
Leaves are made to catch light and have openings to allow                        water and air to come and go. The outer surface of the leaf                        has a waxy coating called a cuticle which protects the leaf. Veins carry water and nutrients                        within the leaf.
Leaves are the site of the food making process called photosynthesis .                        In this process, carbon dioxide and water in the presence                        of chlorophyll (the green pigment) and light energy are                        changed into glucose (a sugar). This energy rich sugar is                        the source of food used by most plants.
Photosynthesis is unique to green plants! Photosynthesis                        supplies food for the plant and oxygen for other forms of                        life.
A green plant helped make the oxygen you are breathing                        today.
