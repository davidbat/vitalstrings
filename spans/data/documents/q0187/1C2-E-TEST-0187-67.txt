chlorophyll
 
In this endothermic transformation, the energy of the light          absorbed by chlorophyll is converted into chemical energy stored in carbohydrates          (sugars and starches). This chemical energy drives the biochemical reactions          that cause plants to grow, flower, and produce seed.
 
Chlorophyll is not a very stable compound; bright sunlight          causes it to decompose. To maintain the amount of chlorophyll in their          leaves, plants continuously synthesize it. The synthesis of chlorophyll          in plants requires sunlight and warm temperatures. Therefore, during summer          chlorophyll is continuously broken down and regenerated in the leaves          of trees.

Another pigment found in the leaves of many plants is carotene.          Carotene absorbs blue-green and blue light. The light reflected from carotene          appears yellow. Carotene is also a large molecule (C40H36)          contained in the chloroplasts of many plants. When carotene and chlorophyll          occur in the same leaf, together they remove red, blue-green, and blue          light from sunlight that falls on the leaf. The light reflected by the          leaf appears green. Carotene functions as an accessory absorber. The energy          of the light absorbed by carotene is transferred to chlorophyll, which          uses the energy in photosynthesis. Carotene is a much more stable compound          than chlorophyll. Carotene persists in leaves even when chlorophyll has          disappeared. When chlorophyll disappears from a leaf, the remaining carotene          causes the leaf to appear yellow.
 
A third pigment, or class of pigments, that occur in leaves          are the anthocyanins. Anthocyanins absorb blue, blue-green, and green          light. Therefore, the light reflected by leaves containing anthocyanins          appears red. Unlike chlorophyll and carotene, anthocyanins are not attached          to cell membranes, but are dissolved in the cell sap. The color produced          by these pigments is sensitive to the pH of the cell sap. If the sap is          quite acidic, the pigments impart a bright red color; if the sap is less          acidic, its color is more purple. Anthocyanin pigments are responsible          for the red skin of ripe apples and the purple of ripe grapes. Anthocyanins          are formed by a reaction between sugars and certain proteins in cell sap.          This reaction does not occur until the concentration of sugar in the sap          is quite high. The reaction also requires light. This is why apples often          appear red on one side and green on the other; the red side was in the          sun and the green side was in shade.

During summer, the leaves of trees are factories producing        sugar from carbon dioxide and water by the action of light on chlorophyll.        Chlorophyll causes the leaves to appear green. (The leaves of some trees,        such as birches and cottonwoods, also contain carotene; these leaves appear        brighter green, because carotene absorbs blue-green light.) Water and nutrients        flow from the roots, through the branches, and into the leaves. The sugars        produced by photosynthesis flow from the leaves to other parts of the tree,        where some of the chemical energy is used for growth and some is stored.        The shortening days and cool nights of autumn trigger changes in the tree.        One of these changes is the growth of a corky membrane between the branch        and the leaf stem. This membrane interferes with the flow of nutrients into        the leaf. Because the nutrient flow is interrupted, the production of chlorophyll        in the leaf declines, and the green color of the leaf fades. If the leaf        contains carotene, as do the leaves of birch and hickory, it will change        from green to bright yellow as the chlorophyll disappears. In some trees,        as the concentration of sugar in the leaf increases, the sugar reacts to        form anthocyanins. These pigments cause the yellowing leaves to turn        red. Red maples, red oaks, and sumac produce anthocyanins in abundance and        display the brightest reds and purples in the autumn landscape.
 
Sugar Maple
The range and intensity of autumn colors is greatly influenced          by the weather. Low temperatures destroy chlorophyll, and if they stay          above freezing, promote the formation of anthocyanins. Bright sunshine          also destroys chlorophyll and enhances anthocyanin production. Dry weather,          by increasing sugar concentration in sap, also increases the amount of          anthocyanin. So the brightest autumn colors are produced when dry, sunny          days are followed by cool, dry nights.

In recent years, autumn colors have been attracting more          and more tourists and travelers to prime color regions: New England, Michigan,          and Wisconsin. (In Wisconsin, the fall-color tourists spend over $1 billion.)          The right combination of tree species and likely weather conditions produce          the most spectacular displays in these regions. States in these regions          maintain a fall foliage "hotline," keeping color watchers apprised of          the peak viewing locations and times. In Wisconsin, this information is          provided by the Division of Tourism at (800) 432-8747 and on the Web at www.travelwisconsin.com/search/FallColorReport.html .          The U.S. Forest Service also operates a Fall Foliage Hotline at (800)          354-4595. A detailed report can be found on the Web at www.fs.fed.us/news/fallcolors/ .
