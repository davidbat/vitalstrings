Lack of chlorophyll, probably due to (although it can be produced by other reasons) a lack of nitrogen in the soil, which easily gets washed/leached out by frequent waterings, which is why it needs replacing regularly via nutrient feeding.
Nitrogen controls the plants ability to produce proteins for new cell protoplasm and is one of the essential nutrients in the production of acids, enzymes, nucleic acids, chlorohphyll and alkaloids. It's also the main nutrient element responsible for leaf and stem growth as well as size and vigor.
Nitrogen is most active in the younger buds, shoots and leaves in vegetative growth and being a mobile element moves to where it's needed most and that's usually in new leaf growth, which is the reason lower and older leaves start turning yellow when there are limited quanities available.
There's a whole host of other reasons for why leaf edges may yellow and not all of them are down to Nitrogen deficiency, but that is the most common cause in the vegetative growth stage.
