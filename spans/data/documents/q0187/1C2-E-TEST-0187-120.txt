During summer, leaves are generally bright green.  What would you hypothesize that his indicates about the role of green light wavelength, chlorophyll, and the photosynthetic process?
Chlorophyll reflects the green light wavelength.  So, why do you only see green, but not the other colours given off by the xanthrophylls, etc?
Don’t believe the first answer about the sun being closer in the summer (it isn’t true).
