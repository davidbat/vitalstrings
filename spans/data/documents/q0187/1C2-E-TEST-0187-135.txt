just moved my plant under my new 125W cfl i got on the side of it (youll understand if u seee my pics) and i got another 30W , directly above it ..
im afriad i may have burnt it ad the top small leaves have a blackish edge? isit burnt ? ... i got my cfls 2+ inches away maybe 3in... ? i dont see how they can be burning...
my plant has got pale green leaves and it looked slightly yellow on the edge what is this and how do i fix it and make it a strong bright green..?
i use water mixed with baby bio , growing in soil. PH7 ...
my tallest plant was seriously streched and i was abit heavy handed and basicly snapped the stem i proped it back up but the leaves are now dropping alot will it sort out ?
