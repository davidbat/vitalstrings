I had the same problem earlier during a fast growth period. I know that potted plants which do not need repotting sometimes show pale or yellow growth when they need magnesium. Plants will also show leggy and pale growth when they are iron deficient. I agree with the ironite suggestion, if you think iron is the culprit. I was able to fix my problem with a dose of epsom salts, which contain magnesium. I used the drugstore kind, but I think Espoma makes an organic salt that may contain more trace nutrients that the pure salts wouldn't have.
