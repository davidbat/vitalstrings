As a gardener I can tell you, from my experience, it has to do with the nutrients in the soil, the amount of water it gets while growing, and the pH balance of the soil.  Might also have to do with the age of the plant when the leaves were harvested.  The older the plant, the more bitter it tends to taste.

Don't know the answer to that, but I just bought a bag of romaine mixed with that purple stuff (can't remember the name) and that purple stuff is awful bitter!  I just try to spear a bunch of green along with one piece of purple when I eat a bite!

Some lettuces, like arugala, are bitter. Baby romaine (a mix of green and purple) is a staple at our house.
