Collect 2 to 3 large leaves all from different trees
Cut the leaves in to very small pieces and put them in the small jars
Label the jars with the location/type of tree
Pour rubbing alcohol into the jars covering the leaves; just enough to cover the leaves
Use the plastic spoon at this point to gently chop/grind the leaves while in the alcohol
Cover the jars very loosely with plastic wrap or aluminum foil.
Very carefully (taking care not to get burned) sit jars in a shallow tray/pan of hot tap water (approximately one inch of water)
Keep the jars in the water for at least 30 minutes.  As you wait, the alcohol becomes a dark color (you can wait longer than 30 minutes if needed).
Twirl the jars (very gently every 5 minutes) and replace hot water as it cools
Next, cut paper coffee filters into long strips and label as to which jar the strip will be placed in.
Remove jars from water and uncover.
Place a strip of filter paper into each jar so that one end is in the alcohol and bend the other end over the top of the jar and secure it with tape.
The alcohol will travel up the paper filter and it will bring the colors with it.
30 to 90 minutes later (sometimes a little longer) the colors will travel different distances up the paper as the alcohol starts to evaporate.  At this point you should be able to see different colors of green and possibly some yellow, orange, and red depending on the type of leaf.
Document what you see as the experiment progress.
Take pictures.
Remove tape and allow paper filters to dry.  Once dry tape to plain paper.  Label the paper filters once secured to paper.
