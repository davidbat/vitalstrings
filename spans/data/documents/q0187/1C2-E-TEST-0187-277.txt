I don’t think they will be traumatized.  They will be grateful — if it is not too late.

I bought an Anthurium in October 2011. It looked great and leaves/flowers were healthy. Within a month or so, the leaves started drooping and turning brown. It went from about 20-30 leaves/flowers to about ten (they started turning brown and were gone completely and dried out). I went back to the florist and she re-potted the plant and cut off all the other leaves that were browning (in November).
I continued watering it every week. I bought Schultz plant food in January because I saw no improvement in the health of the plant. I’ve been watering it every week (about 6:30am) as per the directions of the plant food (with 1 Quart of water). It drains very well but I just don’t see any improvement in the plant.
When I first got it, I had it next to my bed so the only light it got was the natural light in the daytime. After the leaves started turning brown/dying, I put it on a table next to my window. My curtains are very sheer so the light from outside does shine on the plant. About half of the leaves are curling upwards and all that has happened since it went thru the trauma is one new leaf.
What am I doing wrong?
Should I remove it from the window and put it next to my bed?
My house is hot from the heat but when it goes off, it gets cold. Is it the weather?
What is the reason for the leaves curling up?
What else can I do to save it?
Thanks…
