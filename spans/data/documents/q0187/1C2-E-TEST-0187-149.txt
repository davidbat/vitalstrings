Alright, I followed the directions almost.  I think I read it a bit wrong.
I mixed my usual watering solution:
4 litres (1 quart)
30 ml of fish emulsion (5 - 1 - 1)
Then I added 1 tsp of epson salts.  Then I watered them.  I wasn't going to spray cause' I didn't understand what it would do, but then I thought "better safe then sorry" so I did.  And I put "a little" extra espson salt in.
The spraying solution was:
.5 litres spring water (there's a spring near my house)
1.5 tsp epson salts
5 ml no damp (I though I should add some sort of funguside because they were going to be wet)
Then I sprayed them all (not the bottoms, just the tops).  Once again, "better safe then sorry" and watered the plants with the left over spraying solution.
So in total the things did wrong were: a too highly concentrated solution was used to spray them, I didn't get the underside of the leaves, and I watered them with epson salt solution even though watering was never mentioned.
Anyway, I went to look at them today and they were even lighter (bordering on yellow at the center)!  There was a slight limping of leaf as well.  And there was a bit of white residue from the salts.  They are in about 2 months old and in vegitative state under 4 flourescents and are about 8-12" tall.
I really need help on this one!
