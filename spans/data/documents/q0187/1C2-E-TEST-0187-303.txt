Help!    :)
Added you could try spraying the leafs to water them if you have been adding too much water to the soil, this will provide the plants with water and give the roots time to recover! 75% 3 Votes 0% 0 Votes
Usually this is caused by growing the tom plants too close to your pot plants. :) 0% 0 Votes
