Devils Ivy: Why Do The Leaves Change Pattern?

Devil’s Ivy Raphidophora aurea and Epipremnum aureum
Wondered why your multi-colored Devil’s Ivy Leaves have changed their color permanently?
The leaves of this plant will change from a bright green and yellow spotted leaf designs to a solid green color if the plant is not getting enough light.  It’s just that simple!  Although this office plant does well  in many situations and isn’t something to thrust into bright light, with minimal lighting it will actually produce only solid green leaves, and literally change it’s spots.
As more office buildings are opting to leave their lights off all weekend long, or install motion sensitive lights to conserve energy, plants that enjoy 7 day per week light are adapting to far less light per week.  While Devil’s Ivy is not damaged by less light, if the color change bothers you it may be time to move the plant to a location underneath an emergency light that is on 24 hours per day – 7 days per week, or nearer a window.
It may take a few months, but with a little more light, your plant will return it’s leaf pattern to what it was when you purchased it.
