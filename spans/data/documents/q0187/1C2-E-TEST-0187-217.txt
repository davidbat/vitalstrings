LEAVES
I found 14 Bible verses with         the word "leaves" .
"The         green color of forest, field, and garden is caused by         leaves. They are the dress of trees and other plants.         They are far more important than mere dress, however. The         foods by which the plant lives and grows are made in the         leaves. All the food eaten by human beings and other         animals can be traced back to plants and the green leaf.         Even our bacon and eggs start with plants, for pigs and         chickens live on plant food. Without green leaves there         would be no animal life on Earth.
Most         leaves are broad and very thin, but they have many         different shapes. The needles of the pine trees are         leaves. The long ribbon streamers of the seaweeds, the         fronds of ferns, the tiny hairs of mosses, the hollow         traps in which the pitcher plant catches insects, and the         climbing tendrils of the garden pea are also leaves. The         leaves of water plants show many interesting differences         from those of land plants."
Why         Leaves Change Color and Fall
"In         the autumn, leaves turn from green to brilliant shades of         scarlet, gold, orange, and purple. Then they finally fall         to the ground. It is not a season of dying: the tree or         shrub is preparing for winter.
In         late summer, as the growing period slows down, a corky         layer of cells forms at the base of the leafstalk where         it joins the stem. This corky layer is called the         separation layer. It does not pass through the woody         fibers that connect the leafstalk with the stem. These         fibers hold the leaf in place until frost or wind tears         it free. After the leaf has fallen, the scar where it was         attached to the stem is sealed and protected by the         separation layer.
As         the separation layer forms, the manufacture of food         materials within the leaves slows down. The cells and         veins in the leaf become clogged. No more chlorophyll is         produced, and the green color disappears. Other colors         were present in the leaf, but they were hidden by the         stronger green. Now they appear in all their splendor.
All         leaves contain yellow pigments called carotene and         xanthophyll. The yellow pigments are formed in the         protoplasm of the leaf cells. The reds and purples are         due to pigments called anthocyanins. They are formed in         cell sap that is rich in sugar. Sugar maples, oaks, and         sumacs have the most brilliant scarlet and purple colors.         To develop such high color they must be exposed to the         sunlight. Sugar maples that are heavily shaded by larger         trees do not become red and show only yellow coloring.
Frost         is usually given credit for autumn color, but actually a         particular temperature has little effect on it. A         combination of favorable weather conditions is required.         Red pigments are formed in the sunlight in leaves that         have stored sugar. Cloudy, rainy weather or a very hot,         dry summer prevents the pigments from developing. If warm         days are followed by warm nights the sugars drain out of         the leaves and into the woody portions of the plant.         Ideal conditions are bright, sunny days followed by cool         nights.
Frost         is chiefly responsible for freeing the leaves from the         twigs. On a cold, frosty night ice crystals form in the         separation layer and break the woody fibers that hold the         leaf in place. Then when the ice melts in the morning         sun, the leaves flutter in a gold and scarlet shower to         the ground. In some oaks the separation layer does not         develop fully, and the leaves remain on the tree all         winter.
The         wise gardener does not burn fallen leaves but adds them         to the compost pile. Rotted leaves (leaf mold) are a         valuable soil conditioner."

How         to Make a Leaf Collection
"Late         spring, when leaves are fresh and green, is the time to         start a leaf collection. Keep the leaves fresh and         uncrushed as you collect them. Spread them carefully         between two or three layers of newspaper on a flat         surface. Then place books on the top layer of paper and         put something heavy on the books. Change the papers every         day for the first four days, then leave the leaves         pressed, undisturbed, for another week. Next, remove them         and mount them carefully with clear tape on heavy paper.
Leaf         prints are less work to prepare than a pressed and         mounted collection. A collection of spatter prints is         interesting and easy to make. A bottle of ink, an old         toothbrush, a piece of wire screening, and sheets of         white paper are needed. Place a fresh leaf on the paper         and pin it down flat. Then dip the toothbrush into the         ink bottle, letting the excess ink drain off. Hold the         wire screen over the paper and rub the bristles over it,         working from side to side and from top to bottom. Draw         the bristles toward you so the ink will spatter away from         you. When the ink is dry remove the leaf. The imprint         will remain.
For         leaf blueprints use blueprint paper, a piece of window         glass, and a basin filled with clear water. Working in         dim light, lay the leaf on the treated side of the         blueprint paper and cover with the window glass. Expose         it to sunlight until the paper turns dark blue. Remove         the glass and the leaf and quickly wash the paper in the         basin of water until the color "sets." Dry the         paper on a smooth, flat surface so it will not curl. The         impression of the leaf will be white or pale blue on a         darker blue background.
A         printer's ink print shows the veins as well as the         outline of the leaf. Needed materials are a tube of         printer's ink, a sheet of window glass, two rubber         rollers, and several sheets of paper. Spread a thin film         of ink over the glass with one of the rollers. Place a         leaf, underside down, on the inked glass. Cover it with a         sheet of paper. Run the second (clean) roller over the         paper several times. Now the leaf is thoroughly inked on         its underside. Discard the inky paper and place the leaf,         inked side down, on clean paper. Cover with a sheet of         clean paper, and again work the clean roller over the         paper. Finally remove the top paper and the leaf. Let the         finished print dry.
A         plaster cast may be made by putting a leaf in a greased         saucer and covering it with plaster of Paris. After the         plaster has set, the leaf may be removed. Its imprint in         the plaster may then be painted and trimmed to the         outline of the leaf."

SEASONS
"Virtually         every living thing is affected by the seasons. Farmers         plant and harvest their crops in the         warm months and mend fences and tend their livestock and         machinery in the winter. As the seasons change, people         wear heavier or lighter clothing and eat different foods.
The         seasons are still known by the names that dimly reveal         primitive peoples' feelings about them. Winter is an old         Germanic word meaning "time of water"--of rain         and snow. Spring refers to the springing forth of living         things. The original meanings of summer and autumn are         lost. People in the United States, however, generally         call autumn by its alternative name, fall, from "fall of the leaf."
Cycle         of the Seasons
"The         four seasons make a year, often called the year of the         seasons. For the most part, the four seasons are         recognized only in the world's middle latitudes. In         tropical regions hot, humid months alternate with cool,         dry months.
Before         the calendar, people looked to the sky for signs that a         new season was approaching. Such knowledge was vital to         determine planting and harvesting times. In the Northern         Hemisphere, for example, the bright star Regulus climbing         above the eastern horizon signals that spring is at hand.         Blood-red Antares heralds the approach of summer. The         square of Pegasus means that autumn is near, and the         appearance of Aldebaran is a sure sign of winter.
The         seasons have a profound effect on plant and animal life.         In spring, plants and trees sprout new leaves, flowers         appear, birds migrate to warmer regions, and many animals         emerge from hibernation. With summer, the lengthy hours         of sunshine provide energy for photosynthesis and         stimulate growth in plants and animals alike. In autumn,         the final harvesting is done, many plants shed their         leaves, birds migrate to warmer regions, and nearly all         furry creatures grow new, thick coats. With winter,         animals hibernate or construct warm, protected burrows;         seeds have hard coats to keep out the cold; and buds are         wrapped in wax as protection against ice."
Maple         Syrup and Sugar
"The         North American Indians discovered the secret of tapping         maple trees. For nearly two hundred years maple sugar was         the cheapest and sometimes the only readily accessible         sweetener available to American colonists. It is said         that trees planted by the Pilgrims in 1620 are still         giving sap today.
The sweet-water sap from which syrup is made is different         from the circulatory sap of the growing tree; it is a         special seasonal secretion. When the tree is dormant, the         sap will flow from any wound in the sapwood, such as a         taphole, each time a period of freezing is followed by a         period of thawing. Normal tapping does not deplete the         tree's resources. It removes only about 8 percent of the         tree's sugar, which is easily replaced the following         year. Although the sap contains 1.5 to 3 percent solids,         mostly in the form of sucrose (a type of sugar), it does         not have the color or flavor of maple syrup until after         it has been processed.
For a good run of sap, the weather should be alternately         freezing and thawing; if it remains either warm or cold,         the flow of sap slows or stops. Where the climate is         favorable, the sap begins to run in very early         spring--anytime between mid-February and mid-April. It         may flow for as little as five days or as long as six         weeks, depending on seasonal conditions. To tap the tree,         farmers drill holes into the bark at waist level. They         drill one to three holes, depending on the size and         sturdiness of each tree. Spouts are then driven into the         holes. Some farmers have a pipeline system leading from         the trees to storage tanks. Most farmers, however, hang         pails on the spouts to collect the dripping sap. The sap         may run swiftly or slowly, and the amount of sap produced         varies from tree to tree. For a good tree, the flow         ranges from 120 to 400 drops a minute, which amounts to         an average of 35 gallons (132 liters) of sap per season.         Boiled down, this yields about 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of         syrup or 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) of sugar.
Maple syrup is made by boiling down the sap. Constant         watch is kept to monitor the syrup's thickness.         Impurities are strained out, and the syrup is canned         quickly so that it will not become soured by bacteria.         Maple sugar is obtained by boiling down the syrup until         enough liquid has evaporated to cause the residue to         granulate.
Maple sugar and maple syrup are exclusively North         American products, simply because the European climate is         not conducive to substantial sap running. The United         States output comes chiefly from Vermont, New York,         Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,         Massachusetts, and Maine. Most of Canada's production         comes from Quebec and Ontario."
PUMPKINS
I         love pumpkin seeds. Have you ever tried them?
"On         Halloween night, porches are lit with the orange glow of         jack-o'-lanterns--carved pumpkins that grin, grimace, and         scowl by the light of a flickering candle within their         walls. The pumpkin is a versatile fruit commonly grown in         North America, Great Britain, and Continental Europe for         human food and livestock feed. In the United States and         Canada it is a traditional holiday pie filling. It is         also served as a vegetable and used in puddings and         soups.
Pumpkins         are large, orange, and generally round with a smooth,         furrowed rind. The plant has rough, heart-shaped leaves         and large yellow flowers. The names pumpkin and squash         are applied inconsistently to certain varieties of the         genus Cucurbita.The pumpkin comes most commonly from         varieties of Cucurbita pepo, C. mixta, C. moschata, and         C. maxima."

GOURDS
Gourd         is mention in the Bible. Eastman Bible defines them here . Naves Topical         Index say this about them . When I looked the         word up in the concordance it was listed 4 times .
"Varieties         of the pumpkin and squash family grown chiefly for their         ornamental fruits are called gourds. The hard-shelled         fruits grow in many shapes and sizes. In pioneer days         American settlers cleaned and dried the gourd shells and         used them for cups, bottles, water jugs, and other         utensils. Now gourds are used mainly in winter         arrangements with other dried plant material.
The         gourd is an annual trailing vine that is sticky, hairy,         and musk scented. The leaves are roundish and up to a         foot (0.3 meter) across. The vine is fast growing and         makes a good cover for the ground or a fence. The flowers         may be either white or yellow, depending on the variety.         They wither in the sun. In some countries the fruit is         eaten as a vegetable.
Gourds belong to the family Cucurbitaceae. Two varieties         are commonly grown in the United States. Cucurbita         pepo, which the Indians cultivated,         has yellow flowers and pear-shaped fruits. The         white-flowered Lagenaria siceraria produces gourds in odd shapes and sizes, known as         Hercules'-club, dipper, snake, calabash, and bottle.
Some         vines of the Luffa genus also are called gourds. The vegetable sponge, or         dishcloth gourd, has a fibrous interior that can be dried         and used as a sponge. The wax gourd, or Chinese         watermelon Benincasa hispida,         is native to tropical Asia."
