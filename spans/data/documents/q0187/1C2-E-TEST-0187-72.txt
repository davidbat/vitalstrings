Cindy     : Good morning Mrs Astuti. How are you today?
Mrs Astuti           : Good morning, girls. I’m just fine. How about you?
Liana      : We are also fine. Are you busy at the moment?
Mrs Astuti           : Not so. Is there anything I can help?
Cindy     : We have one question. Why are most leaves green?
Mrs Astuti           : Most leaves are green, because they contain chlorophyll.
Liana      : What is chlorophyll, teacher?
Mrs Astuti           : Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is a green pigment found in almost all plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.  Do you know what the function of the chlorophyll is?
Liana      : Sorry, we don’t know.
Mrs Astuti           : It is doing the photosynthesis, which is processing the light into energy.
Cindy     : Thank you, teacher.
Mrs Astuti           : You’re welcome.
