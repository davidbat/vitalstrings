Springtime and plenty of chlorophyll.
Each spring leaves contain green, red, orange and yellow pigments.                      Throughout the summer, the green is dominant due to chlorophyll                     production.
Day length, rainfall and sugar.
Many factors influence autumn coloration and the most important                      being day length, followed by rainfall, sugar accumulations                      in the leaves, wind, and prolonged periods of cool, bright,                      sunny autumn weather without a                    killing frost. The brighter the light during this period, the                    greater the production of these pigments.
Cool autumn days.
When the days of autumn are sunny and cool, the nights chilly                      but not freezing, the brightest colorations                    usually develop. This is when the production of chlorophyll                    , which is created by sunlight during photosynthesis, slows                    down.
Autumn colors. As sunlight hours decrease, the green starts                    to disappear and the other pigments - red, orange, yellow,                    scarlet and purple - come alive!
Getting ready for winter.
Meanwhile the tree produces a waxy substance to protect itself                      from the elements once a leaf                    separates from the branch. That's why leaves can withstand                   strong  wind and rain during the summer, but come down so easily                   during  a fall rainstorm. The key is to get a picture of your                   favorite  tree when you see it: don't wait!
Here's a guide to the species of trees and the color they produce                    during autumn:
Yellow:
Green and black ash, basswood, beech, birches, butternut, and                    elm. In the maple species - boxelder, mountain, silver, striped                    and sugar. And don't forget mountain ash, poplar, serviceberry,                    willow, and witch hazel.
Red and Scarlet:
Red, mountain, and sugar maples; black, red, scarlet and white                    oak; hornbeam, sumac and tupelo.
Brown:
Purple:
White ash and witch hazel.

How do I take great fall                  foliage pictures?
Here are a few tips for those of you who are taking photos                    with point-and-shoot cameras.
Use 400-speed color print film. The lenses of                    most point-and-shoots are fairly slow. A fast film helps you                    on those less-than-bright days and the quality and sharpness                    of modern 400-speed print films is outstanding. Don't worry                    about using it when the sun is bright. Print films have broad                    exposure latitudes and at worse, your automatic camera will                    be using its fastest shutter speeds (cutting down on camera                    shake) and its smallest lens openings (improving depth of focus).
Add Depth. Add a sense of depth to your landscapes.                    When shooting the distant hills of color, include a closer tree,                    or other object in the foreground.
Scale. Occasionally include an object for a sense                    of scale to visually depict how large a landmark is in real                    life. This way, when you're home looking at your vacation photographs,                    you can point to how high you were on top of Mt. Battie in Camden,                    for instance. You can include a man-made object or another person                    to achieve a sense of scale.
Think Macro! Don't forget the macro setting on                    your camera. Most point-and-shoot cameras have a close-up or                    macro setting (many times indicated by a tulip symbol on the                    controls). Bringing your camera as "up close and personal" as its minimum focusing distance will allow, can give you a                    whole different type of foliage photo to enhance the large landscapes.
Cloudy Skies? - Don't Despair! If the sun isn't                    out, sometimes the best foliage shots are possible. As long                    as you're not insistent on having blue sky in your photos, the                    light available from overcast or even rainy days can give you                    a host of colors with a nice even contrast. On especially dark                    days, one of the new 800 or 1000-speed films might be advisable.
How do I preserve leaves?
There are different ways to preserve leaves. Our suggestion:
Make a solution of one-third glycerine and two parts boiling                    water. Place the stems in the solution while it's still hot.                    Keep the leaves in the solution over night. Remove and dry the                    next day.
To press leaves, place them between sheets of newspaper and                    place them under something heavy, like a stack of books. You                    can also press leaves with a warm iron. Place leaves between                    tissue or wax paper first. The color will last longer if you                    keep leaves out of direct sunlight and away from the air.
