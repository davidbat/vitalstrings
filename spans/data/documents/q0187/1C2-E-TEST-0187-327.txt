Green Giant
>> No, I'm not leaf-covered, jolly and I can't produce an abundance of peas and sweetcorn.  I can however feel freakishly overdressed, whilst attending my cousin's wedding here in Hong Kong (which is why I'm a little post-lite).  What I thought was an appropriate Tibi dress turned out to a little bit of a mis-step in that most of the other guests turned up in quite casual attire.  With my hair bun, I stood about a ruler taller than the other female guests hence why I named this post 'Green Giant'.  Cue awkward shuffle at the ceremony.  Oh well, I landed here on the winding steps of Central and amongst the green closed-up shacks, at least I got a somewhat decent picture out of it what is a rare mono-piece outfit.  Because THAT'S all that matters in the realm of blogging, right? 
In all seriousness, there are times when you just have to leave an outfit the f*** alone and this this Tibi 'silhouettes' dress is one of those occasions.  I may have been overdressed for the wedding but at least I got to pad around the older bits of Hong Kong, feeling all fancy and Maggie Cheung-esque (there's something about the slits of the dress and the cut that had a whisker of an In the Mood for Love vibe). 
Oh, and what is the point of a piccy post themed that is vaguely themed around Hong Kong without the backdrop of the legendary Tsui Wah in Central (HK's answer to a 24 hr greasy spoon), a luminous drink to match the dress and a cheesy peace out sign.
