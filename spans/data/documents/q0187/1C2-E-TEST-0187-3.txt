the green portion of light which have the wave length of 550nm doesn't carry the {biggest}energy content because the energy content of the wave length is inversely proportional with the wave length.
i mean if for example there is a light with 400nm ,this light will have greater energy content that that of the green light so the green light do not have the highest energy content.so when plant reflect the green light [not another light] they are already absorbing a higher energy content that that of green light.i wish i could satisfied you.

Hello!
I`m a new member, and because, my first language isn`t English I`ll probaply have some spelling errors so I apolgise for them in advance. To be honest I`m not a biologyst , but I`m interrested int it.  To be precise I study electrotechnics. A few days ago we learned about light, and our professor said that in the ordinary white light-ray the green component, which has the wavelength of some 550nm carries the most energy. Now if it`s true, then I have a little logical problem. I know from my previous physics studies that if an object reflects a specific wavelength in much greater measure than the other wavelengths than we see this object in that color wich is represented by that most reflected wavelength. So my question is,that if the aim of the photosynthesis is to make organic material out of energy and unorganic materials, than it`s normal that plants " want" as much energy from the sun as possible. Now if all that`s right,  than why are they reflecting the most valuable wavelengths of the suns light-rays?  Other words WHY ARE THEY GREEN?
IP.s: I`ve asked my physics professor and she said that she simply doesn`t know why, so I would be very pleased if some of you would be so kind to explain me this thing
Thank you in advance
