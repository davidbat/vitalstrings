North America is one of the few places in the world where deciduous trees          produce vibrant fall colors, according to hgtv.com .          In Germany, a sugar maple turns a dull yellow at best, while in Vermont          an identical sugar maple will turn a yellow so bright its almost          fluorescent.
Though several factors influence this phenomenon, the key is climate:          To produce great fall color, trees need crisp, cold nights and clear sunny          days.
Color change in leaves is brought on by a series of chemical reactions,          many of which kick in by changes in day length. But to understand why          some leaves turn brown while others burst into color, its necessary          to understand why leaves are green in the first place.
Green leaves contain chlorophyll, which is vital for photosynthesis and          plant growth. In spring and summer, leaves are loaded with chlorophyll,          so they remain
green. When the days grow shorter though, leaves stop producing          chlorophyll. The green color bleaches out and a whole new batch of chemicals,          or pigments, start creating fall colors.
Heres          where the egg yolk thing comes in. The two pigments responsible for yellow          and orange are xanthophyll and carotene, the same compounds that create          the color in eggs and carrots.
So there you have it. A bit of trivia you can share with your friends..
