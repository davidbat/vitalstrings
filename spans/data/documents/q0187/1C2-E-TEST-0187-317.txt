What the Pho?! Get 2 helpings of the crepe!. It's cliche... but no one makes a Vietnamese crepe like my grandmother. Believe me I've pilgrimaged to the REAL Saigon as well as the OC's Little Saigon (and many places in between) in search of the best. No luck... until Green Leaf came into my life.
Across from House of Hong bustle in the ID, off of Jackson, this 2-story Vietnamese eatery delivers a strong menu and daring specials that no boring pho joint could compare. Think Monsoon but 1/4 the price. The best reason to go and return ... is HOME COOKING! Nothing pretentious here, just good old fashion Vietnamese food -- that is freshly made and great explosion of flavors.  For me it's all about the crispy crunchiness of the hot crepe, mingled with the fresh coolness of the lettuce and herbs.
Forget about Pho friends... that's like getting only phad thai at your favorite Thai joint. It's a once in a while indulgence. Vietnamese crepes are forever!
PS - Try weekday dinners. Going on a weekend during weekend dim sum/brunch rush hours will be helter skleter -- beware. The House of Hong parking lot craziness will drive up your blood pressue.â€¦
