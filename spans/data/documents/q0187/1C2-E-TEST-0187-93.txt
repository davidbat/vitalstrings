Hi!
Using chlorophyll, leaves capture the Sun's rays. Then, by combining that energy with water and CO2, the leaves make food, i.e., sugar, for the plant. This process, as I'm sure you've heard, is called photosynthesis. Roots transport water up to the leaf, or the leaf itself collects water. Then, using the Sun's energy, this water, and CO2 from the air the plant makes sugar, which is also known as its chemical energy.
