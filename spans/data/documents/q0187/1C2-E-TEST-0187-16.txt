Why Are Leaves Green?
Author:    Jon Stokes and John White
ISBN:    978-0-904853-07-0
When should I prune my trees? Why do leaves change colour? Which is the world's oldest tree? Does ivy kill trees? These are just some of the many questions that the people of this country regularly ask Britain's Tree Wardens.
Why are leaves green? is a colourful guide to everything you ever wanted to know about trees. The inspiration for the book came from two groups of Tree Wardens - in South Somerset and West Sussex - which are part of The Tree Council's Tree Warden Scheme. They were keen to have answers to some of the questions about trees that they were frequently being asked. The Tree Council decided to help, and invited all its 7,500 volunteer Tree Wardens across the UK to send in the most popular questions. These have been answered by The Tree Council's Jon Stokes and by John White. This unique initiative has resulted in a handy guide which will prove invaluable for anyone interested in trees - not only Tree Wardens but also their local communities, schools and the general public.
