Spring Pesto with Fava Leaves and Green Garlic
March 31, 2010 by fairviewgardenscsa
This recipe completely changed my relationship with fava leaves. Sure, I added them to quiches and sautes, but the leaves never inspired me as a culinary ingredient. So after reading about fava leaf pesto in the New York Times, I decided to see if this sauce could be as creamy, spicy, and wonderful as traditional pesto. Try this recipe for yourself and you’ll see why I’m a convert.
2-3 cups of fava leaves, washed
1/3 cup of pine nuts (you can also use California sunflower seeds for a local food alternative)
1 green garlic stem (washed and chopped), or 2  garlic cloves (chopped)
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 cup of olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Directions: Pulse all ingredients in a food processor until creamy. Toss with pasta or spread on baked polenta. This is just another reason to love spring.
