Re: Why have my Burgundy Lace Japanese Maple leaves turned from burgundy to green?
I think Vertrees suggests that this maple is prone to leaf burn in full sun and your climate and zone is particularly hot for a long time.  You can always try more shade and see.  Also understand that it may take several years for the maple to establish itself where planted and, once established, this will also protect against some leaf burn and signs of stress.  You can also make sure that it is watered once or twice a week until it is established and this will further help reduce stress.
I suggest being patient (this means a year or two) and if these suggestions don't work, try a different cultivar.  After summers like this one in my zone, quite a few of my cultivars, even with shade and weekly water, will show leaf burn by August.  Most of mine have also been in the ground for at least 3 years and are in the 7 to 10 year old range.
Not discouraging you, but you may have to experiment to find a hardy cultivar for your area.  Research cultivars like Seiryu, Kamagata, Fireglow, Sherwood Flame, Shaina, to name a few,as these do best in my zone which is on the edge between 7 and 8. Maybe someone else from zone 9 can make some suggestions for hardy cultivars from their experiences.
