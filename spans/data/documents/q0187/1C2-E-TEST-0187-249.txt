Organic Green Tea from the Fujian Mountains
Taimu Mountain Organic Mao Feng
ORGANIC GREEN TEA
No need to wonder: this is green tea lover's  tea, the finest organic Mao Feng ("Fur Peak") green tea available from the Fujian Mountains. Hearty, rich and nutty, and you will not find better green tea   anywhere unless you visit the tea farm itself.
When steeped, these loose leaves have the pure green tea flavor you can only get from young, fresh whole leaves.  The air-tight paperboard container and sealed inner bag keep it fresh. USDA Certified Organic.
CAUTION: This potent green tea is very high in theine ("caffeine").  If you want less caffeine, pre-steep for 1 minute, then drink the lighter second, third and fourth steepings.
