I dont believe its the nitrogen you need to worry about. usually yellow leaves come from to much ph. water your plants with no chemicals for a couple of days. be sure to leave the water outside in a bucket or something for 24 hours prior to watering. They will fall off though but that doesnt mean your plant isnt trying to tell you something.
