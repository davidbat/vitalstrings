You go to four island with a ditto and your flareon and put them in the daycare and it will breed an egg which inside will be an evee
A2:
You can Just as Easily Catch a Ditto In The Wild , there is a patch of grass where there are bikers riding up and down on the road that leads to fuchsia city , there is a short tree up from where the bikers are and where the tree is you'll notice a ledge ,you have to have a Poke'mon in your party that knows cut , and cut down that tree up from the bikers  and run around in that patch of grass for a while and you'll encounter a ditto , catch it and then when you have beat kanto and are able to go to Four Island , Home to Elite Four's Lorelei , talk to the day care man and the day care lady and then deposit your Caught Ditto and Your Flareon and the egg you get back should be an Eevee or If you get two Flareons one Male and Female , breed them and you should get a brand new normal type Eevee, that's at least how it worked for me
best of luck!
PS : it may take several tries to get your Normal type Eevee!
but it works ! I Promise!
