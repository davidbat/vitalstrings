Well, I guess the two of us are livening things up in here! Where the heck
is everyone?
Anyway, after I posted, I FINALLY found my way out! I was thinking that the
house with the girl and her Pokemon was the same house with the policeman.
Well, it wasn't! I went down the street, found the house with the policeman
and went out the back door. I was able to advance after the fight!
Phew! I sometimes get lost on these maps.... Especially when there is a
battle in a maze like part, I can forget which way I was going... Aaarrgghh!
Well, I levelled up quite a bit while I was stuck, so I guess that is a good
thing...
