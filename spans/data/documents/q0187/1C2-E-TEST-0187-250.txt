Why do leaves change colour in the fall?
Golden path.
Ever wander what makes the trees change colour? As if they were magically transformed by Bob Ross?
Leaves process water and carbon dioxide with the help of phontosynthesis. These nutrients are processed into glucose (building block for growth and energy in plants) with the help of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is what gives leaves their green colour.
As seasons change, the days get shorter and sunlight more rare. Because there are not enough nutrients for the trees in the form of water or sunlight during the colder seasons, they start “shutting down” for the winter by slowing down production of chlorophyll. As chlorophyll fades away, yellow and orange colors (xanthophyl, carotene) start showing.
In trees like maple, glucose is trapped after photosynthesis stops. Glucose in the leaves turns red with colder autumn nights and sunlight. And brown leaves are stained with trapped waste.
Pretty cool.
