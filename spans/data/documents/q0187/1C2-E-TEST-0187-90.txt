Why are my pumpkin plant leaves turning light green to yellow?
it is june in the uk and i am growing pumpkins, so far every thing has been fine, i have had 4 flowers, but all of a sudden my leaves are turning light green/ yellow, i still have a flower on it, but other buds are dieing, and new leaves are looking pale. the steam on the flower is green but the rest of the stem in pale green/ yellow, also the flower has been half open for a few days?
anyone have any ideas?
