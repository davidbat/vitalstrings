Why did the garlic cloves in my pickles turn green or bluish green?
This reaction may be due to iron, tin or aluminum in your cooking pot, water or water pipes reacting with the pigments in the garlic. Or, the garlic may naturally have more bluish pigment and it is more evident after pickling. Immature bulbs should be cured 2-4 weeks at 70Â°F. The pickles are safe to eat.
I accidentally limed my pickles in an aluminum pan.  Will they be safe to eat?
Aluminum is not recommended for use with lime because the lime can "pit" the container, increasing the aluminum content of the finished product.  This is not a procedure that you would want to do each time you made pickles and then use the product.  However, one batch of pickles should not cause health problems.  If the container, however, is badly pitted, the best option would be to discard the product.
I would like to make sweet pickles, but I am diabetic.  Can I use an artificial sweetener?
The best approach is to take dill pickles slices, rinse to remove the salty flavor, and sprinkle with artificial sweetener.  Allow these to sit in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before use.  Substituting artificial sweeteners for the sugar in sweet pickle recipes is not recommended.
