Q: PLEASE HELP
A: They contain chlorophyll, which is what makes plants green. Plants undergo photosynthesis, which is their way of turning water and carbon dioxide into sugar. When the fall comes, the days get shorter, and plants know it is time to get ready for winter. During the winter, there isn't enough light for photosynthesis. They store their energy and the green color fades away as the chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. The yellow, orange, and red colors appear in the leaves because these colors have been there all along and they are only now visible because they were covered up by the chlorophyll before.
Autumn-Why do some leaves on trees change colors faster than other leaves on different trees?
Q: I am starting to see more and more Autumn colors,like yesterday this tree I was looking at had leaves one color and then the next day the leaves were the same color but they were a darker color,does anyone know why do I still see trees that still have green leaves on them and none of the leaves are changing colors and when the wind blows the leaves don't fall off,but that tree with the darker colored leaves when the wind blows leaves come falling down to the ground and sometimes the wind doesn't have to be blowing strong and other times the leaves just fall off without the wind blowing,this question may sound puzzling,here are examples of what I am talking about the first picture is the picture of the tree with the all green colored leaves(picture is not the actual tree just an example)http://www.flickr.com/photos/soylentgreen23/662479630/now here is the tree with Autumn leaves(not the actual tree)http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DAutumn%2Btree%26js%3D1%26ni%3D18%26ei%3DUTF-8%26y%3DSearch%26fr%3Dfptb-%26xargs%3D0%26pstart%3D1%26b%3D181&w=375&h=500&imgurl=static.flickr.com%2F2225%2F1957282552_d7a460e369.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Ffwickafwee%2F1957282552%2F&size=224.3kB&name=autumn+tree&p=Autumn+tree&type=JPG&oid=1675dbce9e453b42&fusr=fwickafwee&tit=autumn+tree&hurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Ffwickafwee%2F&no=195&tt=262,772&sigr=11j8reiek&sigi=11gct2pmi&sigb=13n3ql83r&sigh=118u34oigSince Halloween is coming up,be sure to watch my Halloween safety videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ttGzA_ujc&feature=related
A: Maybe the age of the tree has something to do with color, texture and strength of the limbs and leaves.  It may take more time to change.
