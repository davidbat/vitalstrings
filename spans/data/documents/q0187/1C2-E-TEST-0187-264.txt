Help! My green tea tastes bitter. Photo by Kanko* .
Earlier this year, I spent some time browsing Yahoo! Answers to see what kinds of questions people had about tea. One of the most common questions I came across was this: “I know green tea is supposed to be healthy, so I’m drinking it – but why does it taste so bad?”

I’m no statistician, but I’d hazard a guess that nine times out of ten it comes down to how you’re making your green tea. More specifically, it depends on the temperature of the water you’re using.
If you pour boiling water over your green tea – be it in a tea bag or in loose leaf form – chances are that the tea’s astringency will dominate, leaving you with the impression that green tea is awfully bitter. So if you’d prefer to avoid a bitter cup,
either wait five minutes after the water has boiled, or stop your kettle before it reaches boiling point.
There are, of course, many other ways of improving the flavour of your tea – but take this as a starting point.
