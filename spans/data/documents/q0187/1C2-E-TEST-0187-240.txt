1st thing is after you beat the elite 4, 20 times, you must talk to prof oak.( note: You must atleast get the half of national dex pokemons ) u must find one of prof oaks aides in route 2,(the other one aides that talked to you from vermillion,near the pokemon centre to the right, after you've catch a 60 pokemons from kanto) u must find him, beause that aides likes to hide, i saw him near trees near the house this aides changes his location, so its hard to find like that mew, u cant actually see him there, but i walked there for 10 minutes, then i saw him, he will give you a permission to surf at the side of port in vermillion city, then after you get in, surf at the right side of bridge, the you will see another bridge that has a parking truck, go there ,walk around on that bridge , then  after few more minutes, you will able to move that truck using the strength ,(note: If youre going on that, you must prepare a 1 master ball, because its hard to catch that freakin' mew, you also you must bring all pokemon that knows all the HM) after you move that boulder,somewhere inside the truck are hiding mew,just go around on that truck for a few more minutes, then you will see mew lvl 50 there,mew actually dont fight, unless you use sleep powder,that's why you catch it with a master ball, because it flees, i've tried it, and it works, finally i catched mew without a cheat, i knew it because i have red more suggestion ,comments, and formations, but im the one only who did that actually,, i surprisingly guessed that thing.and it really works, so just wanna share my knowledge to you guys...hope it help you

This doesn't go for Fire Red or Leaf Green, but it works on Yellow and I'm assuming Red and Blue, and you can do it with one badge! After you go through Mt. Moon and into Cerulean City, defeat Gary and all the people on Golden Bridge. There's a guy in the grass to the right, DON'T defeat him yet, instead, continue to the right and battle whomever you wish EXCLUDING the guy with the level 17 Slowpoke. Talk to Bill and go to Route 5, there you need to catch a Abra because it knows Teleport (it's easier to catch it if someone in your party puts it to sleep like a higher leveled Butterfree). Once that's all said and done, act like you're walking back to Bill and this time, turn left to the guy in the grass. Right before the battle you might want to save in case you mess up, walk up to him and pause before he sees you, then use Teleport (the first time walk up to him, the square you get stopped on when he sees you is the square you teleport on). It will take you to Cerulean City, notice that your pause screen doesn't work now.. Finally, go to the kid with the Slowpoke and battle him, after the battle, teleport again. You're just about to get Mew now! The last step is to walk not even half way up the Golden Bridge and a random battle will occur, it's a level 7 Mew. It wasn't SUPER hard to catch, but it was annoying, using sleep helps so I would recommend getting one in the beginning of the game (Veridian Forest). Hope that helps!

You are all wrong!! First you get a beedrill, at lvl 59. And you have yo make it so it has 1 exp  to level to 60, then with that beedrill beat the elite for 19832 times, (i know its hard) then after that go outside the elite four and run up in to the cave, and back in to the elite four place, about 155 times, then you go and buy a ultra ball  from the mart in saffron city, then fly to pallet town, and walk ten steps to left 23 down,ten right, then release you starter. Go down and  catch a tengela at that little grass. Then fly the the game corner place, buy 100,000 coins, and then spent all of them on the games, after this got to one island, and walk to celio talk to him 1028392 times then go to the top of mount ember, release the tengela you caught and athen make to the bottom of mt ember in less then 50 second,  THIS IS IMPORTANT!!! You must fly to pallet town , ( get a full good party) and walk into your house.MEW will have you mother hostige, you must use 90 pokeballs, and then a master ball, if this is not excact you will not catch him because he dodges the master ball! This work i have done it!

In order to catch Mewtwo, first one must defeat the elite four and then get the sapphire and the ruby and then hand it to Celio. Then go to the island with the brail cave. Using the brail booklet, enter the entrance door reading 'use cut'. Follow the direction that is given.to get the sapphire, you must beat everyone in the Rocket Warehouse. Fly to Cerulean city and go inside the Cerulean Cave. Go through the maze and find Mewtwo. He is very tough to catch, but it's worth the effort. Of course, it won't be hard to catch him with the Master Ball if you have managed to save it. If not keep attempting and you might ultimately catch him. He knows Psychic, Recover, Barrier and Swift.

First you fly to saffron city go to safari zone then catch a chansey evolve chanse to blissey, wich will be pretty hard by the way, after that go to cinnibar island with blissey in the last slot of your party,,, then the exiting part!!! Surf east going exactly straight till you hit somthing anything then surf back to cinnibar go talk to blain 3 times ( after beating him) then go back outside fly to cerilean cave walk around abot a minut with a level 60 in first slot till mew comes out! I did this 5 times so belive me it works!

You guys are all retarded i mean honestly, on all of these games you CANNOT catch a mew except via gameshark action replay, nintendo event. And even then the eve t only works on emerald!!!!! I mean im more desperate than any of you to get mew coz he rocks but guess what the rest of you *beep* should get lives and stop creating these fake fantasies because you men and your boyfriends thought it would be funny. Now run away pansies and stop irritating everyone!!! Fruitcakes!!!!

In order to catch mew, you will have to first beat the elite four 12 times. You have to go in the cave near Indigo plateau called Victory road. Just walk around for a while and he will eventually appear. I travelled for about 30 minutes because he is so rare.

The way to catch mew is you have to beat all the gym's BUT NOT THE ELITE FOUR,  u go through victory road and enter the elite four and heal your pokemon! Next walk out of the elite four and fly to pallet town. Go inside and talk to bill.(im not sure if this step is necessary but thats how i did it) next walk to the place where you need all the badges to get to victory road. Walk through all the gates enter victory road and walk to the end run around the floor where the exit is. Finally a mew will appear BUT ...
You catch different pokemon depending on your starter pokemon
