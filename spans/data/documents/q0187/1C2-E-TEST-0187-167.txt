Dark green and Light green leaves on Tomato Plants
I have plants with lighter green leaves, my mother in laws plants have dark green leaves. All the plants are very healthy and strong. Mine have lots of flowers and small tomatoes. Mums have few flowers, no toms but lots of foilage.
All plants are from the same seed batch. My plants are in a tub with ordinary compost, mums are in a tomato growbag. Why are the leaves different shades of green?
