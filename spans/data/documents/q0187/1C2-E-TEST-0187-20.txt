Leaves, and other vegetation, are green due to the presence of chlorophyll, the substance which basically makes things green in colour.
Chlorophyll absorbs the red and violet parts of sunlight, but reflects the green, thus giving plants their characteristic hue.

Because they contain Chlorophyll (most of the time) which is green.
Chlorophyll reflects this frequency/wavelength of the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and absorbs all the others.
That is why anything is the colour that it is!

Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in chloroplasts, the part of the leaf that absorbs light for photosynthesis.
"Chlorophyll absorbs the red and violet parts of sunlight, but reflects the green, thus giving plants their characteristic hue" does answer the question somewhat, as the leaf only needs to absorb certain wavelengths of light, so what you see is the unnecessary (waste?!) light reflected from the leaf.
That's my understanding of it anyway. I got a bit of info from Wikipedia, though.
