Re: Plant turning light green at top, yellow leaves + brown spots
id definatly say high pH causeing phosphorus lockout. This has happened to me once and it killed my plant... that sucked, anyway. Stabilize the pH with acidic water. First get a pH meter and water your plant with pH'd water (at about 6.5). You can drop the pH down using lemon juice or vinegar to this 6.5 level from your ( i assume) 7-7.2 level. Then once you have a watering pH of 6.5 water your plant a bit and check the pH of the runoff, adjust the watering water's pH until you get a runoff of 6.5 from the bottom of your pot. From then on try to use water with a pH of 6.4-6.6 to keep it stable.
However, test your runoff pH every watering. Use the same method as above, add a little water check the pH and adjust accordingly. Sometimes soils can become more alkaline over time since nutes and salts build up in them (especially in high nute situations). Hope that helps.
