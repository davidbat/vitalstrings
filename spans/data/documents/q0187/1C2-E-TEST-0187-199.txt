Isn't it beautiful to see
all the colors of autumn leaves?
Why and how do leaves
change color in fall?
Why does an oak leaf turn red/brown?
Where do the yellows + oranges come from?
Leaves are Nature's great invention.
Plants take water from the ground through their roots.
Leaves take carbon dioxide = CO2 from the air.
Then plants use the sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose - a special sugar.
Glucose is food for many living beings, used for energy and as building material to grow.
The process of turning water and carbon dioxide = CO2 into sugar is called
photosynthesis
Translated: "putting together with light"
Plants and some animals use
chlorophyll
Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color.
Light gets shorter as summer ends and autumn comes,
giving a signal to the trees and plants
to prepare for winter.
If there isn't enough trees will rest,
lower their metabolism using the food
stored during the summer.
Less light and photosynthesis isn't working -
so the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves.
As the bright green fades away,
brown, red, yellow and orange colors are shown.
These colors have been in the leaves all year long.
But the green chlorophyll covered them up.
Spanish oak with fall colors
Red and purple coloring is produced in fall
when glucose is trapped in the leaves.
Sunlight and the cool nights of fall
are turning this glucose into a red color.
The brown color of trees is made from wastes left in the leaves.
So, you see there is a wonderful plan for all life on Earth.
For thousands of years humans try to understand these wonders.
