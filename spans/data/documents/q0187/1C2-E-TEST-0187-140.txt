Leaves of green
The most important aspect of all landscape design is plants.  Trees create a sense of place and beauty that is mysterious and timeless:  an old straight track from the heart of the Earth!
We help you to plan and design the right planting scheme for your patch, and we have the right experience in how to get your new plants to grow and grow quickly.
See some examples of our plantings below, and read more about planting trees in school grounds here...
We also create ornamental bomb proof planting schemes which look good too!

Leaves of Green
1997 - 2009 See how they grow….before, during and after: 12 years of tree planting in schools.
Harvington First School 2000-2009
 
In 2000, the school was given a new plot of ground and we built a garden of exploration on the old football field.
The photos on the left were taken during a Saturday volunteer day in 2001 when many of the paths around the grounds were laid out. Note the apex archway in the background: this log edged path was planted to form a hazel tunnel .The photos below were taken in 2007-2009 and show the hazel tunnel maturing.
 
Harvington CE First School
Built by children, parents past and present, governors, local gardeners and staff. Funded by friends, the local horticultural society, businesses and government. Designed by Guy Redmond, using ideas from us all. Created by community co-operation.
