Why the colors change
ydrangea macrophylla, the large-leaf hydrangea, has large flowers in a variety of colors ranging from white to blue, pink, red, purple and shades in between. It is probably best known for its chameleon-like ability to change the color of the flowers, an event that happens over several years. This phenomenon is due to the concentration of aluminum ions in the soil — more aluminum is available at a low (acid) pH, so in acid soil, blue hydrangeas are blue. In nursery growing media, which is closer to a neutral pH, the flowers will be a light pink and turn blue when they are planted in acid soil. Red or pink hydrangeas are more of a purple in acid soil, and red at higher pH. They will not turn blue! These plants enjoy shade and moisture, so they’re perfect for a northern exposure. H. macrophylla blooms on OLD wood, so prune only back to live buds in Spring, and remove old canes at the end of the season. The newest trend in these hydrangeas is cultivars which can bloom on new wood as well as old. You’ll want to try some of these exciting new introductions!
