Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll is the pigment that gives leaves their basic green color.
Chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis, the chemical reaction that lets plants use sunlight to make food.

Carotenoids are the pigments that produce yellow, orange, and brown colors in the leaves.
The are also found in things like corn, carrots, and bananas.

How do they all work together?
Chlorophyll and carotenoid are in leaf cells all the time during the growing season. But the chlorophyll covers the carotenoid .  That's why summer leaves are green, not yellow.
Most anthocyanins are produced only in autumn. Not all trees can make anthocyanins.

Anthocyanins are the pigments that give leaves their red color.
The are also found in cranberries, red apples, blueberries, cherries, and plums.

Why do the leaves change color?
Leaves change color mainly because of the longer, cooler nights that occur in Autumn.
As the nights get cooler and longer, a biochemical process takes place that causes the leaves to change in color.

How does it work?
During the spring and summer, chlorophyll is continually being made, and leaves are green.
As the nights get longer in the fall, chlorophyll making slows down and then stops and eventually all the chlorophyll is gone.
The carotenoids and anthocyanins that are in the leaf are then able to show their colors.

Why do the leaves fall?
In early autumn, the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf gradually close off.
These closed veins trap sugars in the leaf and start the making of anthocyanins.
When this is complete, the leaf is ready to fall
Quit
What happens after the leaves fall?
On the ground, fallen leaves are broken down by bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and other organisms.
The broken-down leaves give the soil nutrients and become part of the layer on the forest floor that absorb and hold rainfall.

When do we get the best color?
The autumn colors are the most vibrant when there has been:
A warm and wet spring
A summer that isnâ€™t too hot or dry
A fall full of warm days and cool nights.
