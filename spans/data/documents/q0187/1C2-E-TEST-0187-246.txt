Why Leaf
Austin is the quintessential town that embraces the hallmarks of local business and a healthy lifestyle.  Eating habits are a crucial component of a healthy existence and the dining culture here is a big part of why Austin is Austin. For these reasons, Adam and Jon realized in the fall of 2005 that this was the perfect place for the first Leaf to be planted.
We will serve fellow Austinites the best salads in the world!  Our promise to you is to serve the freshest and tastiest product around!  We will prepare our dressings from original recipes, and run our environmentally conscious business with a huge smile.  Our impeccable staff will strive to serve you with common courtesies, speed, and of course, a little Austin flair.
