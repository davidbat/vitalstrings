Welcome to Green Leaves!
Let's talk about environmental education, but mainly let's try to build a network of good educational practices for children, young people and also for ourselves adults. Let's make up a network of good practices starting from small jobs that are performed daily in schools (and not just in schools).
We would like that these experiences were shared here, first of all, as for to go further.
