One Island...This Island is the first, and yet one of the Biggest islands. There are few bits to mention here but here we go:
The First Thing of Note is that the Pokémon Center is quite larger as it contains a Giant Machine that allows you to trade with Ruby, Sapphire & Colosseum. But you need to power it with the Ruby and Sapphire Plates
There are trainers in the waters and hiding in the Grass aswell as Wild Pokémon Such as Fearow
On your path North through the Island are some Hot Springs which allow you to heal your Pokémon after the Many Battles on the way up and also contains a Man who will give you HM06
Also, High Up on this Island in a cave quite far to the north is a Level 50 Moltres. Moved from Victory Road and Now Here. But you can only get to it as soon as you rid the Islands of the Bike Gangs
