the green pigmentation in the plant leaves is called chlorophyl.  Healthy plants "breathe" through the stomata (which are pores found on the leaves of skin where gases are exchanged)  Healthy plants with a lot of sunshine etc. have very healthy green leaves.
As said in some of the answers to this question... not all leaves are green.  Cabbage, crotons and colias have coloured leaves, - red, green, light green, pinkish, orange etc.
However some leaves do change colour as they die or during autumn when they turn yellow and fall.
