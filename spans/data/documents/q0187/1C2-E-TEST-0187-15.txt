An explanation of how light affects the color as we see it in leaves.
Have you ever wondered why plants, trees, and leaves appear green? The answer is light. Light coming from our sun is what is affecting how the color we see on all these things. 
First let us begin with a structure found in plants called the chloroplasts. A chloroplast is an organelle plants use during photosynthesis. The chloroplast has an outer membrane and an inner membrane. In the inner membrane there is a liquid substance called the stroma. In the inner membrane there are also thylakoids, which are sacs that are piled together forming granum. Which then leads to the thylakoid space, this is the inside of the thylakoids. This makes up our chloroplast:

From this we are able to see exactly light passes. The light from the sun passes through the chloroplast which the chlorophyll molecule uses to and reflects only the green color. This reflection is what causes plants to look green. You see the chlorophyll molecule absorbs blue, orange, red, violent but they do not sue the green part of the light. The most useful colors for photosynthesis are absorbed instead.
