Tender Tea Shoots - Why They Make Best Green Tea
Tender Tea Shoots
Why They Make Best Green Tea
The best green tea is made from young tender tea shoots harvested early spring. Why they make the tastiest and healthiest tea.
Finest Chinese and Japanese green tea is    usually harvested once a year in spring. These spring tea is the highest quality. In fact, the earlier the tea is picked in the season, the higher the quality.
Unknown to many Westerners, tea nutritional value decreases with leaf age. These early picks are the  tenderest and have the highest levels of theanine, caffeine, EGCG and aromatics    oils - delightful stuff that thrills the connoisseurs.
Seasonality
Autumn tea is the next best. They are more floral, but doesn't taste as good.  They are better for making oolong tea.
Summer tea is coarse. Its rich polyphenols content make them bitter and    astringent. They make the lowest grade tea. But their high polyphenol content    makes them excellent for making red tea or black tea.
Health and Nutritions
Tender shoots not only taste better, they are healthier. Tender tea buds contain higher levels of soluble compounds. They have the highest concentration of the calming    theanine and antioxidant catechins. To quote Bokuchava from his 1980 study:
The first and second leaves of the shoot are    richest in catechins.
As the leaf ages, the content of total catechins      decreases with the amount of EGCG and ECG falling sharply and the amount of EGC      and EC rising.
... the site of catechin synthesis in the      tea plant is in young leaves and shoots.
Tea plants accumulate heavymetals such as fluoride and lead from the  environment. These young shoots contain the least of these contaminants. According to some sources, the mature, old leaves can contain 10 to 20 times  more fluoride than the tender tea shoots of the same tea plant.
