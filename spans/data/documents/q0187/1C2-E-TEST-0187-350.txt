Groudon, Kyogre, Latias, Latios, and all three Regi-Pokemon are some of the rarest, and strongest, Pokemon in the Pokemon Leaf Green video game for the Gameboy Advance. But, with an Action Replay and these Pokemon Leaf Green video game cheat codes from Cheat Street, you can catch all of these Pokemon and more.
Catching Pokemon With an Action Replay
To use these cheat codes you need an Action Replay. It's a plastic device you plug into your Gameboy Advance game slot, then you plug your game into it. When that's all set, turn on your GBA and enter these codes to unlock items , capture Pokemon and get free pizza! Ok, so there's no free pizza, but there are Pokemon! Start with this code, or the rest won't work.
