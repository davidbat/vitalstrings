Leaves are the food factories of plants. Plants take water from the soil onto their roots. They take carbon dioxide from the air and in the presence of sunlight turn water and carbon-dioxide into glucose (a kind of sugar). The process utilized by the plants to convert carbon-dioxide and water into sugar is known as photosynthesis .
Glucose is consumed by the plants for energy and growth of the plants. The process of photosynthesis ("putting light together") happens because of a pigment in the leaves of the plants called chlorophyll. This pigment is responsible for giving plants its characteristic colour.
The food-making procedure takes place in the leaf, in the numerous cells containing chlorophyll. The sunlight is used by the chlorophyll as energy to convert carbon-dioxide and water to carbohydrates, such as sugar and starch.
