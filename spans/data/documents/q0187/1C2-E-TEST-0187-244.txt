Answer
Hi Ryan,
The two items you want to know, are connected to each other. I explain. On Island 6 you find cave. Drop down and then take the top hole, then the left, then the right and then the hole at the bottom. You'll find the Sapphire Gem, but the Team Rocket scientist steels it from you and gives you the second password. Now go back to the warehouse and enter the password. At the end of your adventure in the warehouse, you find the same scientist back and after defeating him, he will give the Sapphire Gem back.
