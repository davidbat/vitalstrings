Why are Leaves Green?
Glad you asked...
Leaves receive their green color during the process of trying to absorb energy from the sun.  The sunlight strikes the leaves, which contain chlorophyll, and the chlorophyll reacts by emitting the green color.

Then again, this answer might help you...
Leaves are green because that is the only wavelength of light that is not absorbed by the structures within the leaf.  That is to say, all the light that comes from the sun gets absorbed into the leaf, but the green light bounces off, thus making the leaf appear, green.
