It will grow to 30' high. This one is about 25' long. It                      spreads along a gravel bar by Bryant Creek.
  Flowering              Dogwood
Dogwood family. Cornus florida
The shiny simple smooth-edged leaves are 2.5-5" long. In                      this picture the stalks and twigs are green, but they turn                      reddish in the fall.
 
Flowering dogwoods are understory trees. They                    bloom before being shaded by taller trees. Their blossoms seem                    to float through the woods in April, before trees have begun                    to leaf out.
The real flowers are crowded into the center.  Four white petals, called bracts, make them appear showy white.
  Eastern              Redbud 
Cercis canadensis
Common name: judas-tree.
Redbuds, understory trees, bloom throughout the woods at                      the start of April. Flowers cover the twigs and smaller branches.
 
Their simple heart-shaped leaves are 2.5" to                    4.5" long with smooth edges.
Pods, carrying bean-shaped seeds, grow from their                    twigs and branches.

Ebony family.
Dyospyros virginiana
These leaves are from 2" to 6" long. They are  oval,                      smooth around the edges, thick and shiny. Among them you can                      see a green persimmon. It will ripen in the fall and taste                      best after the first frost.
 
This persimmon is about 30 feet high.  They                    will grow to 70 feet. 
They grow all through the river valley, along roads, and                      in old fields, like this one. 
 
Annona (Custard Apple) family.
Asimina triloba
Pawpaws are understory trees. You can find them by looking                      for their big floppy leaves.  In late summer, check carefully                      for their delicious fruits.
