Mottled Leaves On Zucchini Plants
« on: April 30, 2009, 01:18:54 PM »
First of all, my EB has Miracle Gro potting mix and the 7-7-7 fertilizer and dolomite that came with the Earthbox kit. I mixed the dolomite into all but the bottom couple of inches of the EB. The wicking seems okay since the plants are growing fast. The only thing that seems odd is that they still wilt a little in the direct sun, even in cool temperatures.
I started 2 zucchini plants and 2 yellow squash from seed on April 1st and transplanted them into the EB 12 days ago on April 18.
About 1 week ago all the new leaves on the zucchini plants have been coming out 'mottled' with whitish spots all over the leaves. Also, the green part of the mottled leaves is a darker green than the original leaves. This started when the leaves first appeared and continues as they are growing. Some are 5-6" across now. The oldest leaves have kept the normal medium-green color they started with. They are not 'turning' mottled, only the new growth has that.
What makes this harder to diagnose is that the yellow squash plants still appear normal in every way. Pure green leaves with no spots and growing in the same Earthbox as the zucchinis.
I've found some posts about mottling and see that maybe the problem is a magnesium deficiency. If this is the case, is there a way to feed something through the tube that might help?
Why the heck would the yellow squash not show they same symptoms?
Thanks for any insight.........  dennyboy
