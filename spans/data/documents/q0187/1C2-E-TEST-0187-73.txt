covers for jars or aluminum                     foil or plastic wrap
rubbing alcohol, paper coffee                     filters
shallow pan, hot tap water,                     tape, pen
plastic knife or spoon, clock                     or timer.
Procedure:
Collect 2-3 large leaves all                     from different trees. Cut the leaves into very small pieces                     and put them into small jars labeled with the name or                     location of the tree.
Add enough rubbing alcohol to                     each jar to cover the leaves. Using a plastic knife or                     spoon, carefully chop and grind the leaves in the alcohol.
Cover the jars very loosely                     with lids or plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the jars                     carefully into a shallow tray containing 1 inch of hot tap                     water.
Keep the jars in the water for                     at least a half-hour, longer if needed, until the alcohol                     has become colored (the darker the better). Twirl each jar                     gently about every five minutes. Replace the hot water if it                     cools off.
Cut a long thin strip of coffee filter paper for each of the jars and label it.
Remove jars from water and                     uncover. Place a strip of filter paper into each jar so that                     one end is in the alcohol. Bend the other end over the top                     of the jar and secure it with tape.
The alcohol will travel up the                     paper, bringing the colors with it. After 30-90 minutes (or                     longer), the colors will travel different distances up the                     paper as the alcohol evaporates. You should be able to see                     different shades of green, and possibly some yellow, orange                     or red, depending on the type of leaf.
Remove the strips of paper,                     let them dry and then tape them to a piece of plain paper.
Now, Analyze the                 data and come up with your own conclusion.
