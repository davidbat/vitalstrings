Question:
Why are some leaves greener than other ones?
Replies:
The colors of the leaves have to do with the amount and kinds of pigments in the leaves. Most plants have more than one pigment present, not just chlorophyll. The colors you see in leaves in the fall are pigments that are still present in the leaf after the plant stops producing chlorophyll for the season.

Related to the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves needed for photosynthesis http://www.cwu.edu/~verheys/bot461/Photosynthesis/Photosyn.basics.html

Leaves are green because of the amount of chlorophyll(s) in the leaf. There are three types of chlorophyll depending upon the type of plant/algae. The chlorophyll absorbs sunlight which provides the energy for photosynthesis that converts CO2 into the plant cellulose and gives off oxygen, O2, as an end product.
In general, plants which grow in shady conditions require more chlorophyll to provide the energy for photosynthesis and appear a darker shade of green than plants that grow in direct sunlight. However, this is an oversimplification because there are overlaps and exceptions because the botany of plants is far more complex than I have stated.
