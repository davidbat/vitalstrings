Answer
Ann Marie,
Fertilize geraniums with a fertilizer that has a slightly higher amount of nitrogen (the first number of the three numbers on the fertilizer label) - examples are Osmocote Indoor Outdoor, and Proven Winners fertilizer.  You could also use something like Peters All Purpose Plant Food that has even numbers - 20-20-20.  Just don't use the so called bloom-booster fertilizers that have a high middle number.  If you use time-release like Osmocote you only have to apply it once for the rest of the summer.  Use a liquid fertilizer every two weeks, and always water your plant before you apply it.
Geranium leaves get light green if the plant isn't getting enough light as well - they need four or five hours of direct sun.  Also, it's natural for the oldest leaves to periodically turn yellow and fall off - if the new growth looks green and the plant is growing well, ignore a few yellow leaves.
I hope this helps!
