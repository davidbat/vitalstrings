Why Raking Leaves is Wrong!

I was just being forced to rake some leaves up in the back yard when I came up with the idea of this soapbox. Here you'll find several reasons why leaf raking is not only boring, but a disadvantage to the Earth.
-OK, first off, leaves are obviously biodegradable. So if we left the leaves alone they would slowly degrade. They would make the grass greener, the soil richer, and even make everything slightly healthier for the animals!
-Unfortunately many people don't do that. They break their backs raking up those poor leaves and burn them, which obviously isn't very good for the environment.
-Also, rakes can harm and rip out grass and mess around with the soil if it's a certain kind of rake. That isn't good for the environment either.
-For some support on the topic, leaf raking is a complete waste of time and completely pointless. They'll all go away eventually like I said before!
-You could be on Fanpop rather than doing that stupid junk! And everyone knows going on Fanpop is a lot better than making piles of leaves for hours on end!
As you can see, leaf raking isn't something most of you want to be doing right now, hmmm?
