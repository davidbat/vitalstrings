There are 9 possible reasons why
your plant's leaves are turning yellow
1.  The "Good News" reason is that leaves naturally turn from green to yellow then brownish and dry and shriveled
All plants?
Yes
In the two pictures at the top, each of the yellow leaf areas are the lower, OLDER leaves whose time is over.  Nature re-captures the nutrients from the old leaves                     into the main plant and the leaf color becomes yellow
What to do?
Nothing, except relax, Nature is in control
2.  Sudden unexpected cold
If a plant is used to suitable conditions then cold comes in, leaf yellowing and                     leaf drop is common
What to do?
Usually nothing, except with potted plants.  If you expect more cold, shelter                     your plant indoors in a warm, bright area where people are comfortable
But  ....you should have taken your plants to shelter well before the cold came                     in.  Here is our article on how to successfully winterise your potted plants to bring indoors for the winter
3.  Heat
Many plants comfortable in moderate temperature conditions can "complain" by dropping leaves with ongoing excess heat.  The time from green to yellow                     to drop can be very fast
What to do?
Consider if a better location is possible for this plant.  For example, rather                     than a full sun location, a spot with afternoon shade could be your permanent solution
3.  Too wet
Too much water chokes roots and very often causes leaf yellowing
In the case of potted plants, you control the water
In the landscape, your sprinklers may need                     adjusting
4.  Too dry
If water is needed and not available, a plant can not "hold" all its leaves.  In defense plants shed leaves.  In this case the green to yellow to drop process                     can be very fast
What plants want is consistent water for best growth and daily happiness.  Of course, that amount varies by the variety of plant
Plants which are native to swampy areas may need to be constantly moist to be happy,                     so ANY fall off in available water = instant leaf complaints (yellowing)
On the other hand, our desert rose plants can go a long time between watering.  Cactus and succulents in general require                     excellent drainage and no standing water, otherwise, you see yellow leaves and leaf                     drop
5.  Your new plant suddenly is getting sick fast.  Yellow                     leaves are developing rapidly and leaf drop is scary
This situation is very common.  We call this "decline" and yellow                     leaves are the first symptom.  We have a separate article on this subject
6.  A change of location
Virtually 100% of the time, if you move a plant to a new location, you will see                     leaf yellowing.  Unless the new location is more suitable than the old location,                     your plant needs to adjust/adapt to the new location so leaf yellowing is part of                     the process
For example, if you move a plant into more sun, the leaves may be stressed.  The plant "knows" the current leaves can't withstand the increase                     in sun sun and so, in defense, grows new leaves that can handle the new exposure
Moving to a location with less light//sun/hours/intensity, the plant can no longer "hold" the same amount of leaves so starts to shed leaves trying to balance                     light and leaf quantity
7.  Fertilizer, especially liquid chemical fertilizers
Folks tend to use fertilizers in excess.  Too much fertilizer, especially liquid                     chemical fertilizers, create a toxic situation and rapid leaf yellowing (burn) is                     the result
Fertilization is a very important subject and so we have a separate article on fertilization
8.  Disease
There is virtually no technology for plant diseases.  Scientists study causes                     but the "cures" side of the equation is almost zero
Your best defense is promoting plant health especially with proper feeding
9.  Damage
Improper maintenance, often via your lawn man, can cause plant damage, like when                     using a weed whacker.  You may not see (because you don't look closely)                     where equipment may have hurt your plants.  Be sure you know how to manage your lawn man for starters
Damaged plants may be able to heal themselves.  You may be able to do some                     pruning to assist.  The main point is to avoid the damage in the first place
