Why are my pole bean leaves pale green to yellowish?

My corn, which is about 4" high, in a different box, is also a paler green to yellowish.
I top dressed both boxes with leftover mixed composts from my MM.
I'm not sure if corn and green beans need more nitrogen or less nitrogen. I would think compost would help the nitrogen levels, no?
My peas are looking good and green, so some things are doing well. The squashes seem to be healthy.
But usually green beans are pretty easy to grow.
I've been watering every day to two days, the soil hasn't dried out. I try to not get water on the leaves, but that's pretty hard. But there aren't any noticeable spots on the leaves, it just seems like the general coloring is off.
