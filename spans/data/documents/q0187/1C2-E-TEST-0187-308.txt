Things You Should Know =========================  This section is dedicated to helping you actually start the game. Most of it is covered in the pre-game tutorial.  ============ 1a. Controls ============  Up, Down, Left, Right - Controls basic movement. Allows you to scroll through       (D-Pad)           various options and such.  L and R               - Bring up the Help screens or use them in the menu.  A                     - Use this button to confirm a choice. This button will                          be the one you'll be using the most often, because it                         it's the button that controls all decisions.  B                     - This button is used if you want to cancel a choice. You                         will use this button more when you obtain the Running                         Shoes (or if you mess up a lot).  Select                - Once you get Key Items, you can set one to Select. This                         allows you to use that item while out of battle without                         having to open up the Start Menu each and every time.                         Select also allows you to change the order of items in                         your pack. Simply press Select on an item, use the                          D-Pad to scroll through your pack, and press Select                         again to set its new position.  Start                 - Brings up the Start Menu.  ============================= 1b. Version-Exclusive Pokemon =============================  What, you thought that you could "catch 'em all" in just one game? Now, what kind of company would The Pokemon Company be if they didn't try and squeeze every cent out of you they could? ^_^  No, you'll be trading between the games if you want them all. Here's the list:  o---------o | FIRERED | o---------o  Scyther, Scizor, Delibird, Psyduck, Golduck, Murkrow, Ekans, Arbok, Wooper, Quagsire, Qwilfish, Elekid, Electabuzz, Oddish, Gloom, Vileplume, Skarmory, Shellder, Cloyster, Growlithe, Arcanine  o-----------o | LEAFGREEN | o-----------o  Pinsir, Mantine, Slowpoke, Slowbro, Slowking, Staryu, Starmie, Vulpix, Ninetales, Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Victreebel, Magby, Magmar, Remoraid, Octillery, Misdreavus, Azurill, Marill, Azumarill, Sneasel  =============== 1c. What's New? ===============  This section is dedicated to pointing out brand-new things that make their debut in this game, as well as things that have changed from the color games. Things like the following:  1.  When one of your Active Pokemon levels up, blue lines will appear from it. 2.  If another Pokemon levels up but isn't active, its picture and new level     will appear in the upper right corner. 3.  When you capture a Pokemon, stars will appear around the ball's center. 4.  The items now have pictures to show what they look like. 5.  When you view your Pokemon's stats, the Pokemon's icon will jump based on     your current HP and status. Even their cries change. That's cool. 6.  After you give Celio the Sapphire, head to the Elite Four. Have fun! 7.  Text is now color-coded: blue for boys, red for girls, black for info. 8.  There's a Revive instead of a HP Up in Mt. Moon (gonna need help w/these). 9.  You can move an item from a Pokemon straight to the PC. 10. When you capture an extra Pokemon, it will tell you what Box it went to. 11. You get 600 steps instead of 500 while in the Safari Zone. 12. Elevators are now time-based. You'll be stuck there longer depending on the     distance between selected floors. 13. You can no longer deposit into your PC anything that isn't a disposable     Item (no Key Items, no Poke Balls of any kind, no nothing). 14. The Lapras you receive in Silph Co. is Lv.25 instead of Lv.15. 15. Revive a fossil and find that it's only Lv.5 instead of Lv.30! 16. Dragonair can now be found by fishing with the Super Rod in Safari Zone. 17. The Moon Stone in Pokemon Mansion has been moved. 18. The first question in Cinnabar Gym has been changed (for clarification). 19. The last question in Cinnabar Gym has been slightly changed. 20. Moltres now resides in Mt. Ember instead of Victory Road. 21. Indigo Plateau's Pokemon Center now has Gym music. 22. Jr. Trainers are the only Trainers from the color games that no longer     exist. They are now called Picnicker (female) and Camper (male). 23. The Unknown Dungeon is now called "Cerulean Cave." 24. The TM/HM list copies that of Ruby and Sapphire. 25. Text for Hail damage has been changed (pelted instead of stricken). 26. When you white out, it walks you through what happens. 27. You can see items being used on your Pokemon. 28. When you load your game, it will recap recent events in case you forgot. 29. Gamblers are now called Gamers. 30. The word “evil” has been completely and totally removed from the game. 31. The TM and Berry pockets in your bag have been replaced with Key Items. 32. Team Rocket will vanish from Mt. Moon and Rocket Game Corner once you beat     them there. 33. In the color games, if you had the Dig TM in your pack, the man who owned     it will say he doesn’t need it. However, if you used it, he will continue     to chastise Team Rocket. Not so in this game. (thanks to The Wierdo for     changes 29-33).   Find anything I missed? E-mail me.  ============= 1d. Abilities =============  Each specie of Pokemon has one (sometimes two, but only one of the two at a time) of 76 different Abilities (plus two you can only get through using a cheat device, so 78 if you count that) that are designed to help it in battle. This is a list of each and every one of them.  o----------o------------------------------------------------------------------o | AIR LOCK |      Weather effects are cancelled.

Ability: Soundproof =======================  o------------------------------------------------o      Grasswhistle | The Soundproof Ability negates all moves that  |      Growl | are based on sound. It's helpful to know which |      Heal Bell | moves fall into this category, so I've taken   |      Howl | the liberty of composing this list of moves.   |      Hyper Voice | Each attack listed to the right is sound-based |      Metal Sound | and will fail if used on a Pokemon that sports |      Perish Song | the Soundproof Ability. Although no Pokemon in |      Roar | the currently known 387 (excluding Munchlax)   |      Screech | can naturally have the Cacophony Ability, it   |      Sing | works just like Soundproof. If none of the     |      Snore | moves are different, why did they exclude it?  |      Supersonic o------------------------------------------------o      Uproar  ====================== 1g. Special Conditions ======================  Taken from the Pokemon TCG, I use the term "Special Condition" to refer to major status effects. These can only be inflicted one at a time.  BRN - Burn. Attack stat is cut in half. Damaged by 1/8 max HP between turns. Go       to a Pokemon Center or use a Burn Heal, Full Heal, or Full Restore to       cure this condition.  FNT - Faint. Cannot be used in battle. Go to a Pokemon Center or use a Revive,       Rare Candy (at Lv.99 or lower), or Max Revive to cure this condition.  FRZ - Freeze. Cannot attack. If Flamethrower or Fire Blast is used on the       Frozen Pokemon, said Pokemon will defrost. Also, if said Pokemon uses       Flame Wheel or Sacred Fire, user will also defrost. May defrost after a       random number of turns. Go to a Pokemon Center or use an Ice Heal, Full       Heal, or Full Restore to cure this condition.  PAR - Paralyze. Speed is cut by 75%, 20% chance per turn of being immobilized.       Have the move Smellingsalt used on you, go to a Pokemon Center, or use a       Parlyz Heal, Full Heal, or Full Restore to cure this condition.  PSN - Poison. HP will drop by 1/16 between turns. The exception to this is if       the PSN status is inflicted by the use of Toxic or Poison Fang, in which       case poison damage begins at 1/16 max HP and increases between turns.       Outside of battle, each Pokemon inflicted with the PSN status will lose 1       HP for every four steps taken by the Trainer. Go to a Pokemon Center, or       use a Full Heal, Full Restore, or an Antidote to cure this condition.  SLP - Sleep. Cannot attack unless Sleep Talk or Snore is used. Will wear off in       battle after a random amount of turns. If the SLP status is inflicted by       use of Rest, it will wear off in two turns (one if the Pokemon has the       Early Bird Ability). Go to a Pokemon Center, or use a Full Heal, Poke       Flute, Full Restore, or an Awakening to cure this condition.  ======================= 1h. Evil Status Effects =======================  These status effects are evil because there's no limit to how many you can put on a Pokemon. To cure the evil status effects, simply switch out... if you can. They have no abbreviations, but the list goes like this:  1. Attract.    The foe of the opposite gender falls in love with the user. As a                result, they have a 50% chance of not attacking. Don't want to                hurt the ones you love, right? Use the move Attract to obtain                this effect. Wears off when the user of Attract is recalled.  2. Confuse.    The foe becomes more confused than a hungry baby at a topless                club, which means there's a 50% that the foe will hurt itself.                Use Swagger, Flatter, Confuse Ray, Supersonic, Confusion,                Psybeam, or Water Pulse to obtain this effect. Will wear off                after a random amount of turns. You may also use a Full Heal or                Full Restore to cure this condition. Note that you can also                confuse yourself by using Petal Dance, Outrage, or Thrash.  3. Curse. The foe is afflicted by a vicious curse that takes 1/4 of a                foe's max HP between turns at a one-time cost of 50% the user's                max HP. Have a Ghost-type use the move Curse to obtain this                effect.  4. Disable.    The foe's last successfully performed move is disabled,                preventing its use for a random number of turns. Use the move                Disable to obtain this effect. Only one move can be Disabled per                Pokemon at any given time.  5. Flinch.     This effect can only be seen if the Pokemon trying to obtain                this effect is faster than its foe. The foe will retract in fear                for one turn, preventing them from attacking. Equip a Pokemon                with the King's Rock item or use Astonish, Bite, Extrasensory,                Fake Out, Headbutt, Needle Arm, Rock Slide, or Sky Attack to                obtain this effect.  6. Imprison.   The foe can no longer use moves the user knows. Use Imprison                on a Pokemon that shares a move with your Pokemon to obtain this                effect.  7. Seeded.     Seeds are planted on the foe's body, sucking their life away at                a rate of 1/16 the foe's max HP between turns. Note that Grass-                types cannot be seeded. Use Leech Seed to obtain this effect.  8. Taunted.    The foe becomes enraged, forcing them to only use moves that                cause direct damage for two turns. Use Taunt to obtain this                effect.  9. Trapped.    The Pokemon cannot escape battle.  Most will wear off between                3-5 turns after use. Have either the Arena Trap* or Shadow Tag                Ability, be a Metal-type against a Pokemon with the Magnet Pull                Ability, or use Bind, Fire Spin, Ingrain, Mean Look, Sand Tomb,                Spider Web, Whirlpool, or Wrap to obtain this effect.                 * Flying-types, as well as those with the Levitate and Run Away                Abilities, are not affected by Arena Trap.  ================== 1i.

Frequently Asked Questions ==============================  Ha! I remembered to include it this time!  Question: IS THIS GAME IDENTICAL TO POKEMON RED AND BLUE?    Answer: Well, not exactly. While 99% of the text, Pokemon locations, and           Trainers are the same, tiny bits and pieces have been added (like           names for the Trainers (Picnicker Kelsey, for example)). For more           information on the changes that have been made, I refer you to the           "What's New?" section.  Question: I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND. WHICH VERSION DO I GET?    Answer: Get LeafGreen. If you don't have anyone to trade with, LeafGreen can           net you the most complete Pokedex. And besides, LeafGreen has all the           cool Pokemon anyway (like Ninetales).  Question: I DON'T HAVE FIRERED/LEAFGREEN. WHAT POKEMON AM I LOSING OUT ON?    Answer: See section 1b, "Version-Exclusive Pokemon."  Question: I WANT 184 RARE CANDIES, MAX REVIVES, AND MAX ELIXIRS!    Answer: Too bad. No glitch from the original games works in the new versions,           including the one that let you get Mew. Nintendo made sure of that           (even moved a Gambler (Gamer) to be absolutely certain).  Question: CAN I GET MY OLD [Pokemon] BACK FROM [Pokemon game for GB{C}]?    Answer: No, you can't. As of this game's release, you can get every Pokemon           back except Mew (unless you've got an imported Pokemon Emerald) and           Celebi (unless you trade it from someone who has the JP Colosseum           Bonus Disc in which you get Celebi). Most Pokemon from Johto are           found in Pokemon Colosseum, which can also connect to Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire. You can connect this game to Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire, but           not right away; you have to beat the Elite Four and complete a           certain quest first. You also can't have any series 2 (152-251) or           series 3 (252-386) Pokemon until you beat the Elite Four.  Question: MOM WON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR ME. LINK ME TO THE ROM!    Answer: Nah...  Question: FISHING IN RUBY & SAPPHIRE SUCKED! DO THEY KEEP THE SAME METHOD?    Answer: Actually, no! True to the original, simply use the rod to fish.  Question: MY POKEMON STOPS EVOLVING, BUT I DIDN'T PRESS B! WHAT'S GOING ON?    Answer: Your Pokemon has a friendship-based evolution, and if it were to           evolve, your Pokedex would go haywire and explode because it doesn't           know what your new Pokemon is. To stop this from happening, beat the           Elite Four and have at least 70 Pokemon owned in your Pokedex to get           the National Pokedex, which allows entries for all 386 Pokemon. After           that, just level up.  Question: DO THE BUTTON-PRESSING TRICKS FOR CATCHING POKEMON STILL WORK?    Answer: They never worked. Nintendo has confirmed that there are no existing           "tricks" for catching Pokemon. Press all the buttons you want when           the Poke Ball is being thrown and you can press A and B 500 times for           all I care. It won't get you anywhere.  Question: WHAT STARTER SHOULD I PICK? WHICH IS THE EASIEST/HARDEST TO RAISE?    Answer: Professor Oak's got that area covered. Bulbasaur's the easiest to           raise, because the first two Gyms get thrashed by it, and it evolves           to its final form the earliest. Squirtle takes a little more time           than Bulbasaur, but has an easy time against the first Gym, but a           hard time with the second. Charmander takes the longest to raise and           has weak attacks for most of its technique-learning life, and gets           the crap stomped out of it by the first two Gyms. You'll need           assistance if you pick her.  Question: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "COLOR GAMES" AND "METAL GAMES?"    Answer: Red and Blue (colors), Gold and Silver (metals).  Question: ALT + 130 FOR é!    Answer: Yeah, I know. It's just that some browsers out there can't see it,           and no one really cares anyway. "Pokemon" is just fine.  Question: I'M POOR! WHAT'S A FAST WAY TO GET MONEY?    Answer: If you've defeated the Elite Four at least once, the best spot for           earning cash is near Selphy's house at Resort Gorgeous, by far.           Position yourself on the western beach so Jacki (far left), Destin           (top), Gillian (center), and Celina (below Gillian) are all visible,           then use the VS Seeker. Assuming all four want to battle, defeating           them will get you 21,368 money. Activate the Amulet Coin in the four           battles for a total of 42,736 money. After that, take your 100 steps           (it should only be around 60 since you have to walk to each person)           and use the VS Seeker again. You can have over 500,000 money in less           than thirty minutes. How cool is that?            Don't have the Amulet Coin? It's upstairs in the building connecting           Cycling Road and Celadon City. You must have at least 40 Pokemon           owned in the Pokedex, so make sure you meet that requirement.  Question: THEY TOLD ME MY POKEMON HAS POKERUS. WHAT IS THAT?    Answer: You have been graced with the most awesome thing since the invention           of held items, the Pokerus. Pokerus is shown as PKRS on the Summary           Screen (and only there), and you can find it where a status effect           would normally be shown (it'll only appear if there is no status).           What it does is double EV points given from a particular battle. For           example, for every Diglett your Pokemon slaughters, it gets 1 point           in Speed. If the slaughterer is infected with PKRS, it would receive           double the points, or 2. Now let's say that this certain Pokemon is           equipped with the Macho Brace for double points again, or 4. This           means that Diglett will give you 4 Speed points every time you kill           it. Assuming all you run into is Diglett, and you always kill it in           one shot, it would take you about 20-30 minutes to complete Speed EV           training.  Question: POKERUS EQUALS GREAT... BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CATCH, RIGHT?    Answer: All good things must come to an end. The same holds true for PKRS.           After about three days (sometimes less), the PKRS will vanish. Those           that were already infected with PKRS cannot be infected again.           However, there is a way to preserve your PKRS: Simply get someone you           generally don't really care about (in my case, a Lv.5 Pichu, which           will be how I refer to the sucker you infect), and infect them with           PKRS. Drop it in the Box (mark it with all four marks so you can           easily find it) and let it sit there forever. It won't infect your           Box Pokemon, but the PKRS won't leave, either. Whenever you have           someone new to infect, bring out Pichu and infect the new guy. Once           that's done, drop it off again. It's usually helpful to infect           multiple Pichu so you don't ever have to worry about the PKRS           mysteriously running out on you.  Question: HOW DO I INFECT MY OTHER POKEMON?    Answer: Simply keep a healthy Pokemon on your team along with the one with           PKRS. The healthy Pokemon will eventually become infected (and so           will your whole team).  Question: I COULDN'T GET TO A WONDERSPOT MACHINE. HOW DO I GET DEOXYS?    Answer: Like I said before, if you don't have a friend who has one and you           didn't get one of your own, you *have* to cheat to get it.  Question: WHERE DO I GET A DRAGON SCALE?    Answer: Beat Double Mode in the Trainer Tower on Seven Island (once). You can           also get it on the way to Ruin Valley. Simply Surf to the right and           go as far down as you can (thanks to The Wierdo for this tip).   Question: HOW DO I GET TO FOUR, FIVE, SIX, AND SEVEN ISLAND?    Answer: You need the Rainbow Pass, which is given to you by Celio. He will           fork it over after you have the National Pokedex. If you don't have           it, get 60 owned in your Pokedex and go see Professor Oak.  Question: I BEAT THE ELITE FOUR. WHERE IS LORELEI?    Answer: She’s in the back of Icefall Cave. You’ll need Waterfall to get to           her, and the HM to use it is found in the cave. If none of your           pokemon can learn Waterfall, catch a pokemon there. Most can learn           it.   Question: WHERE IS THE KEY ITEM ‘TEA?’    Answer: Second floor of Pokemon Mansion, talk to the old lady.   Got an idea for a question? E-mail me and I'll consider it.  ===================================== 2. New Beginnings and the First Badge =====================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Get acquainted with the controls of the game. * Meet Professor Oak and receive a Pokemon. * Meet the professor's grandson, and have your first battle with him. * Travel through Viridian Forest. * Earn your first Badge.  Okay, so you're ready to begin your adventure. Begin by turning on your GBA [SP] and watch the intro screen, re-done (the old one was better, in my opinion). After you press Start on the title screen, you'll see a few screens that explain the buttons "in the order of their importance." Then you'll see a couple screens that's like a pep talk of sorts to get you raring to go on your new adventure. After this, Professor Oak will introduce himself and Pokemon.  First off, you'll need to tell the professor if you're [going to be playing as a] male or female. After selecting a gender, you will be prompted to name yourself. After this, Professor Oak will introduce his grandson and prompt you to name him. Do so. I called him Gary. And I don't want to hear any "BUT THAT ISNT HIS NAME U NUB" nonsense. I know that already. For the sake of the game, I'm going to refer to that young man from here on out as Gary. Don't like it?  -----------------------------> TOO BAD. <----------------------------------  The rest of Oak's speech is garbage.  Before we really get into this, there's something I must say. Be absolutely sure to talk to and check EVERYTHING. And I mean EVERYTHING. Signs, people, everything. The reason for this is because of an item you get later. If you want to complete this item, you'll need to do these things beforehand so you won't have to come back later.  Now that you've control of yourself, it's time for the menu tutorial. Press Start and you'll find a list of options.  The first option is for your pack. You don't have any items yet, so it's pretty bland. You'll be getting many, many items to fill this baby up later on.  The choice below that is your name. This is where you go to see your Trainer ID, how many Poke Dollars (referred to henceforth as 'money') you currently have, and how many Badges you've earned. Press A to see the back - the entire thing's blank... for now. Press A to exit, or B to flip it back to the front.  The next selection is the most important one - Save. Use this to save your progress. If you don't, you'll regret it.  Below Save is Options. You can change the various options of the game. From top to bottom, here's what they do:  1. Text Speed.        Cycle left or right to change how fast text appears. The                       default choice is medium speed, and varies from slow to                       medium to fast.  2. Battle Scene.      Use this to decide if you want to see the attacks'                       animation (on) or not (off). 'On' is default.  3. Battle Style.      You can choose to be able to switch out when you faint                       one of your foe's Pokemon (Switch) or sit there and wait,                       like in Colosseum and Link Battles (Set). The Switch                       option is default.  4. Sound.             You can choose to hear the sound through one speaker                       (Monaural) or two (Stereo). Of course, unless you're                       wearing headphones, this option's totally useless.  5. Button Mode.       Have them remain as help buttons (Help), have L and R                       function as left and right, respectively, in menu screens                       (LR), or have the L button function as A (L=A). "Help" is                       default.  6. Frame.             Choose one of ten borders to be used for all text boxes                       and menus. Type 1 is default.  The very last option is Cancel. Use that or press A, B, or Start to exit.  Okay, now that we've finished with that, you can actually maneuver around now! You find yourself in your room. Walk to your PC and press A to turn it on. Select "Item Storage" and then "Withdraw Item." Do this in any Pokemon Center to withdraw items you have stored in your PC. Right now, it only contains a Potion, which restores the HP of one Pokemon by 20. Press A on the Potion and select "Withdraw." You don't have a Pokemon to "Give" the Potion to (and even if you did, Potions aren't hold items, so it would do nothing anyway), so take your item, close out the PC, head downstairs, and go out of your house.  =============================================== 2a. Pallet Town - Shades of Your Journey Await! ===============================================  Try to head north out of the town, and you'll be stopped by Professor Oak. It's dangerous to travel alone! He'll escort you to his laboratory, where Gary awaits. Professor Oak says that you can take one of his three Pokemon that sit to your right. Gary will whine because you get to pick first, and Professor Oak tells him to know his role. Proceed to choose your partner. From left to right, it's Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander.  Here are their evolutionary lines:  Bulbasaur  -> (Lv.16) -> Ivysaur    (Lv.32) -> Venusaur Squirtle   -> (Lv.16) -> Wartortle  (Lv.36) -> Blastoise Charmander -> (Lv.16) -> Charmeleon (Lv.36) -> Charizard  Bulbasaur's line is all Grass/Poison, and Squirtle's is pure Water. Charmander and Charmeleon are both pure Fire, but gains a Flying type when Charmeleon evolves.  After choosing your starter, you'll get to name it. Joyous day.  Gary's starter depends on yours. If you pick Bulbasaur, he'll take Charmander. If you choose Charmander, he'll want Squirtle, and if you decide on Squirtle, he opts for Bulbasaur. Now that you're both in possession of your first Pokemon, everyone's happy, and you've unlocked the Pokemon sub-menu. Press Start to look at it.  Now might be a good idea to save your game.  When you try to leave, Gary will challenge you to a fight.  ================= 2b. Gary Battle 1 =================  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o |  Squirtle  |  5  | o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Charmander....5|Squirtle......5|Bulbasaur.....5| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 80  In battle, there are four options. They are:  FIGHT    BAG POKEMON  RUN  Select 'FIGHT' to look at your current moves. The 'BAG' command allows you to use an item. Note that you cannot use items in a Link Battle. 'POKEMON' allows you to switch [one of] your current Active Pokemon with one in your reserves (unless specific circumstances disallow switching). 'RUN' does just that. You will attempt to flee from a battle. Note that you cannot flee from a Trainer battle.  Select 'FIGHT' and choose either Scratch or Tackle, depending on who your starter is, to beat on your foe. It shouldn't happen, but if your HP get too low, don't hesitate to use that Potion you got from the PC at home. After all, it's not like they're hard to come by.  Defeat your foe to earn enough experience to advance to Lv.6.  Gary will leave. Do the same.  ================ 2c. Leaving Home ================  You can now leave to Route 1. Don't forget that from this point, your mom will serve as your own personal Pokemon Center.  o-------------------------o | ROUTE 1 POKEMON LISTING | o-------------------------o | Rattata (Common)        | | Pidgey  (Common)        | o-------------------------o  There'll be a guy that you can't miss as you pass through Route 1. Talk to him, and you'll be one Potion richer.  To the north lies Viridian City.  =============================================== 2d. Viridian City - An Eternally Green Paradise ===============================================  Lots of different things here. Wander around. The building with a red roof is a Pokemon Center. All major locations have one, so don't be shy about running to the nearest town or city and healing up - it's totally free. Simply talk to the lady behind the counter and choose Yes.  So, what now?  There's a Gym here, but the Leader appears to be out. Huh. Well, that's odd.  o--------------------------o If you want, you can battle the Pokemon that are | ROUTE 22 POKEMON LISTING | found here for some experience. You can't catch o--------------------------o anything yet, so just concentrate on getting used | Rattata (Common)         | to battling and raising your Pokemon's level. Once | Spearow (Rare)           | you get Poke Balls, lazy Charmander Trainers who | Mankey  (Uncommon)       | don't want to raise her until she learns Metal o--------------------------o Claw should capture a Mankey for assistance later. Bulbasaur-havers may want to get a Spearow from here or a Pidgey from Routes 1 or 2 (although that would mean leveling up Pidgey until she learns Gust (Lv.9), and Spearow already starts with a Flying-type attack) and use their Flying attacks to obliterate the bugs that lace Viridian Forest.  After you've killed your share of Pokemon from Route 22, stay away from there. The only thing there is the entrance to Victory Road, and since you don't have all the Badges, you're not going to get very far; even if you did, you'd be spanked thoroughly by the Trainers and wild Pokemon there.  If you try to head north out of the city, you'll be stopped by a cranky old man who hasn't had his morning coffee and won't let you pass.  The only thing left to do is visit the building with a blue roof. This, as the "MART" sign indicates, is a PokeMart. You can purchase various things here... but not yet. Immediately upon entering, the clerk recognizes you and asks (well, more like forces, actually) you to deliver a package to Professor Oak.  ================== 2e. Back to Pallet ==================  If you leave south out of the city, you'll see the brown ledges that are in your way. These ledges can be jumped from if you're coming from the north side, so do this to avoid every patch of grass on Route 1. Of course, you'll still have to suffer and walk through the last one. Upon arrival, heal if you need to and enter Oak's lab.  The professor will take his package from you, and Gary will walk in. Oak will give each of you...  ================ 2e1. The Pokedex ================  With each new game, we get a new Pokedex, and FireRed and LeafGreen follow the same pattern. There are several ways to view your Pokemon using this, making it very easy to find the Pokemon you're looking for. Let's go over how it works:  The main mode is Numerical. It will show every Pokemon you've ever seen before, according to their assigned Pokedex number. To the right it will show that Pokemon’s type(s). If you’ve owned it before, a Poke Ball symbol will appear to the left of the Pokemon’s name.   There are several in-depth modes, and if you know what category the Pokemon you want falls into, it can be much easier than going through Numerical.  More or less, this is what you can expect to find in them (not always true):  Grassland - These Pokemon like the open air and freedom of the grasses you can             find all over.  Forest - These Pokemon are most at home in forests, where trees are abundant,          but space is not.  Water's-edge - These Pokemon inhabit any water that isn't the ocean.  Sea - These Pokemon live in the open sea, free of restrictions.  Cave - These Pokemon avoid daylight and prefer the darkness of caves.  Mountain - These Pokemon like the high reaches of mountainous regions.  Rough-terrain - These Pokemon are like the Grassland Pokemon, but they prefer                 to live in an area less touched by humans.  Urban - These Pokemon can be found alongside humans.  Rare - These Pokemon are rare and hard to find. This doesn't necessarily mean        they're one-of-a-kind.  (The last four are search modes, used to find a Pokemon quickly.)  A to Z - List owned Pokemon in alphabetical order.  Type - List owned Pokemon by type.  Lightest - List owned Pokemon, lightest first.  Smallest - List owned Pokemon, smallest first.  The last option is Exit.  Professor Oak will also bestow five Poke Balls upon you to be used to capture Pokemon. Spiffy. Leave now.  If you want, you can head next door to Gary's house. His sister will give you the Town Map, which displays all of Kanto. Use the D-pad to move around the map and view the name of an area. If you press A on a landmark (not a city), it will tell you a little bit of information about the place you just examined (thanks to The Wierdo for pointing this out). o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o    ================= 2g. Past Viridian =================  Head to Viridian City. We can enter the PokeMart and buy things now, so why don't you do that? At least browse...  o---------------------------o |  VIRIDIAN CITY SHOP LIST  |  If you want to actually catch things, you might o---------------------------o  want to buy a few more Poke Balls. It would be | Poke Ball............$200 |  wise to pick up one or two Antidotes, as well. | Potion...............$300 | | Antidote.............$100 | | Parlyz Heal..........$200 | o---------------------------o  Head left as if you're going to Route 22, but head north at the last second through a gap between the rock and fence. Follow this path to the end to find a Potion.  ================= 2f. Gary Battle 2 =================  If you want, you can battle Gary the second time you come to Viridian City. Leave west out of the city to Route 22 and cut through the patch of grass. Take a few steps west and he'll challenge you.  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |     Breeding wins. o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  5  |   Machop   |  7  |   Grimer   |  5  | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  4  |   Flareon  |  6  |  Mr. Mime  |  7  | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgey........9|Pidgey........9|Pidgey........9| |Charmander....9|Squirtle......9|Bulbasaur.....9| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 144  If you only have one Pokemon, I suggest not doing this battle. I mean, you don't have to raise a new Pokemon only for this fight. Just catch one so you can switch out to it in case Pidgey abuses Sand-Attack. Otherwise, you shouldn't have much trouble.  Past Viridian (continued) -------------------------  Back in the main portion of the city, going north will reveal that the old man is much more cheerful now that he's had his cup o' joe. To show his cheerfulness, he'll show you how to capture a Pokemon. After he's finished, he'll give you the Teachy TV. Watching this will give you various tutorials on different aspects of playing the game, starring the Poke Dude. As you progress through the game, a few more tutorials become available.  Poke Balls can be found in the pack. Use left and right to cycle through the different pockets.  The basic technique for capturing Pokemon is to whittle away HP until they're in the red, inflict a Special Condition, then throw. It doesn't always take exactly those tactics (higher-level Balls can catch lower-level Pokemon without them taking so much as 1 HP of damage), but it's the general gist of things.  Route 2 awaits you. It's worthless right now because you can literally only explore half of it, so continue on to Viridian Forest.   =================== 2g. Viridian Forest ===================  Upon entry, you'll get a neat FPV (First-Person View) of the forest entrance. This'll happen every time you enter a major location, even after the first time you've been there.                                        CATCH A CATERPIE. It's awesome. You see, o----------------------------------o  Caterpie evolves into Metapod at Lv.7, | VIRIDIAN FOREST  POKEMON LISTING |  who in turn evolves into Butterfree at o----------------------------------o  Lv.10. Butterfree's Compoundeyes Ability | Caterpie (Common)                |  multiplies the accuracy of all its moves | Metapod  (Uncommon, LG)          |  by 130%, making it lethal at this stage | Metapod  (Rare, FR)              |  of the game because it can inflict | Weedle   (Common)                |  Special Conditions without breaking a | Kakuna   (Uncommon, FR)          |  sweat. Lucky for you, if you choose not | Kakuna   (Rare, LG)              |  to catch a Caterpie, you won't even SEE | Pikachu  (Rare)                  |  Butterfree until you've got at least two o----------------------------------o  Badges, so no worries, but wouldn't you                                       like to have some multi-eyed doom as a                                       part of YOUR team?  Okay. Head up and to the left upon entry to find a Poke Ball. Backtrack to the entrance, and head right to find a Potion.  Head north from there and you'll find your very first Trainer! What luck!  Bug Catcher Rick                         o----------------------------------o Weedle, Lv.6; Caterpie, Lv.6            / Beware of Weedle's Poison Sting! / Money: 72                              o----------------------------------o  Continue north for another Trainer.  Bug Catcher Doug Weedle, Lv.7 (x2); Kakuna, Lv.7 Money: 84  More going north yields an Antidote. If you're Poisoned from Weedle's Poison Sting attack, use this to rid yourself of it. You don't have a lot of HP, so poison damage can really hurt.  If you head to the right, then up, you'll find another Trainer.  Bug Catcher Anthony Caterpie, Lv.7; Caterpie, Lv.8 Money: 96  Continue west to find a Trainer, but he won't fight you unless you initiate contact.  Bug Catcher Charlie Metapod, Lv.7 (x2); Caterpie, Lv.7 Money: 84  Keep following the path until you come to a fork. Take the right path to find a Potion.  Retrace your steps and continue on to find Viridian Forest's last Trainer.  Bug Catcher Sammy Weedle, Lv.9 Money: 108  After defeating him, continue north to find the forest's exit. Head through the gate and leave Route 2 to reach Pewter City.  =================================== 2h. Pewter City - A Stone Gray City ===================================  There's nothing of importance here, save the Gym - at least, not right now, anyway. You can check the Mart for some brand new items.  o-------------------------o Nothing as of yet can Burn you, so you won't need |  PEWTER CITY SHOP LIST  | to buy the Burn Heals. You can be put to sleep for o-------------------------o the first time in a while, so it wouldn't hurt to | Poke Ball..........$200 | get one or two Awakenings, as well as a few Escape | Potion.............$300 | Ropes for quick exits when you're hurting. If you | Antidote...........$100 | lack the money (and I don't know how that can be, | Parlyz Heal........$200 | unless you went psycho when buying Poke Balls and | Burn Heal..........$250 | bought 15 more of them), you might choose to buy a | Awakening..........$200 | Repel, which blocks all wild Pokemon whose level is | Escape Rope........$550 | lower than your Active Pokemon for 100 steps. | Repel..............$100 | They're way cheaper than Escape Ropes, and one or o-------------------------o two can get you out of a fix if you need them. Even if you don't need them, buy a few now; they get much more expensive later.  Speaking of the Mart, if you talk to the man standing next to it and answer "No," he'll escort you to the Museum, which means nothing to you right now.  There's a hidden Poke Ball in the patch of light grass in the upper left corner of the city. Stand next to the fence and take two steps up and one step left. Face up and press A to claim your prize.  The only other exit out of the city is due east, and if you try that, a man will tell you that Brock's looking for new challengers. Then he'll escort you to Pewter City's Gym.  Put him out of a job and go there yourself.  =================== 2i. Pewter City Gym ===================  Quite the tiny Gym, isn't it?  There's only one lowly for you to smash here, unfortunately:  Camper Liam Geodude, Lv.10; Sandshrew, Lv.11 Money: 220  You might need to heal after defeating the aforementioned Camper. If you  don't, you won't need much help to waste the Leader.  ========================================== 2j. Brock, the Rock-Solid Pokemon Trainer! ==========================================  The first of Kanto's eight Gym Leaders, Brock will provide a challenge for those who have neglected to raise their Pokemon... or those without Bulbasaur or Squirtle.  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  8  |   Machop   |  11 |   Grimer   |  9  | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  10 |   Flareon  |  9  |  Mr. Mime  |  10 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Brock's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Geodude  |  12 |    Onix    |  14 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 1400  If you picked Bulbasaur or Squirtle, there is NO REASON AT ALL you should lose this fight. None whatsoever. The only way you can not have shame befall you is if you chose Charmander, and your only other offense is a Pidgey, and even then, she (Charmander) should have at least known Metal Claw. Using Bulbasaur's Vine Whip or Squirtle's Water Gun should faint each of Brock's Pokemon in one blow. If you've got a Charmander, you might want to be careful if you decide to pit your deadly minion known as Butterfree against either Onix or Geodude - both of them know Rock Tomb, to which our favorite insect has a double weakness to, guaranteeing its demise in one shot. In the event your Pokemon survives the hit, Rock Tomb will lower your Speed by 1 level. Crush Brock and his Rock-types to earn the Boulderbadge, the ability to use Flash out of battle, the TM Case if you don't have it already (Equip a TM to a Pokemon, trade it to another game, start a new game, get the Pokemon back, and remove the TM to have it magically appear in your inventory), and TM39, Rock Tomb.  =============== 2k. TM... what? ===============  The TM Case is an item that holds any TM (Technical Machine) or HM (Hidden Machine) that you have in your possession (You'll notice later that they put the HMs on top this time! It's about time!). They look like CDs, but hey, I'm not arguing or anything... Find this item in your Key Items section - it sorta resembles a yellow flashlight... kinda.  Just a little!  ====================================================== 3. Speed, Bad Guys, Greedy Nerds, and the Second Badge ======================================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Meet Team Rocket. * Teach someone the importance of sharing. * Traverse Nugget Bridge. * Meet Bill. * Earn your second Badge.  All right! We're one Badge closer to being able to go to Victory Road. Since you've defeated Brock, the man blocking the east exit will be gone, but someone's in his place...  ================================= 3a. Go Fast. Quick, Like a Bunny. =================================  The man who wouldn't let you pass earlier has been replaced by one of Professor Oak's Aides, who will bestow the Running Shoes upon you. Hold B to sprint.  Once you've been speedyfied, you can finally leave Pewter City. Head to Route 3 and find that it's infested with Trainers.

Bug Catcher Greg Weedle, Lv.9; Kakuna, Lv.9; Caterpie, Lv.9; Metapod, Lv.9 Money: 108  From this point, you've got the choice to either jump the ledge and fight the Trainer below you...                        o-----------------------------------------------o Youngster Calvin      / If you do decide to battle him, you'll have   / Spearow, Lv.14       /      to jump the ledge and go back around.    / Money: 224          o-----------------------------------------------o  Find the dark patch on Calvin's little plateau for a free Oran Berry.  ...or skip him and battle the one to the right.  Lass Sally Rattata, Lv.10; NidoranF, Lv.10 Money: 160  Now we can finally continue on.                                          o------------------------------------o Bug Catcher James                       / Your Pokemon are probably going to / Caterpie, Lv.11; Metapod, Lv.11        / be a bit out of shape after all of / Money: 132                            / those battles, so it might be wise /                                      / to heal them and restore their PP. /                                     o------------------------------------o  o---------------------------o If your luck is as bad as mine is, you'll find |  ROUTE 3 POKEMON LISTING  | that Jigglypuff successfully uses an inaccurate o---------------------------o Sing attack almost every time. For that, you'll | Rattata    (Common)       | need to either walk around with sleeping Pokemon | Pidgey     (Common)       | until you find a Pokemon Center or make use of | Spearow    (Common)       | the Awakenings I recommended to you earlier. As | Jigglypuff (Uncommon)     | far as Pokemon go, you can also pick up both | NidoranM   (Uncommon, FR) | Nidoran, but unless you're obsessed with filling | NidoranM   (Rare, LG)     | your Pokedex as soon as possible, I suggest | NidoranF   (Uncommon, LG) | waiting until later and just capturing whichever | NidoranF   (Rare, FR)     | one is easier to catch in your version. Which one | Mankey     (Rare)         | you get doesn't matter; both Nidoking and o---------------------------o Nidoqueen are good fighters in their own right.                        o-------------------------------------------------------o Lass Robin           / Jigglypuff's Cute Charm Ability can and will Attract  / Jigglypuff, Lv.14   / your Pokemon if they are the opposite gender (and in  / Money: 224         / this case, male) if you physically strike Jigglypuff. /                   o-------------------------------------------------------o  Robin's the last Trainer on Route 3. Head east and then north to reach the end of the Route, as well as a Pokemon Center, but let's not go inside quite yet. Do you see the three rocks to the left of the building? Stand next to above the middle rock and press A facing left or right (depending on which side of the rock you're on) to find a Persim Berry, which adds the Berry Pouch to your Key Items pocket if you don't have it already (are there berries before this?).  Still can't find it? Look at this:        O = rock                                           X = where you stand       O    X@X  O                         @ = Persim Berry             O  ========================= 3b. Let's Buy a Magikarp! =========================  If you talk to the man in the upper left corner of the first floor of the Pokemon Center, he'll offer to sell you a Magikarp for 500 money. The Magikarp is Lv.5, and won't learn anything until Lv.15; it evolves at Lv.20. All it knows is Splash. If you feel like raising it, place it in the lead of your party, switch it out so it gets experience and doesn't die, then switch it back in with each new Pokemon. It's a slow, surefire method for leveling up.  To the right lies Mt. Moon. Let's not keep those new Pokemon waiting, shall we?  ============ 3c. Mt. Moon ============  o---------------------------o | MT. MOON  POKEMON LISTING | o---------------------------o       o --------------------------o | Zubat    (Common)         |      / Paras will only appear on / | Geodude  (Uncommon)       |     / the B1 level of Mt. Moon. / | Paras    (Common)         |    o---------------------------o | Clefairy (Rare)           | o---------------------------o  You'll get a FPV of the cave's entrance upon entering.  Once inside, you'll be able to see an item ball on the ground. No one's around to claim ownership of it, so it's all yours. Inside is TM09, Bullet Seed.  There's a Parlyz Heal lying up and to the left of the Bug Catcher to the north of the TM, but what say we dispose of him first? Not like he's a threat or anything...  Bug Catcher Kent Weedle, Lv.11; Kakuna, Lv.11 Money: 132  Head back towards the entrance and you'll see a girl standing next to a sign. If you enter her line of sight, she'll challenge you to a battle.  Lass Iris                     o-------------------------------------------o Clefairy, Lv.14              / Clefairy also has the Cute Charm Ability. / Money: 224                  o-------------------------------------------o  Continue on the path and you'll find a ladder. Descend it and follow the path (this small path is where you'll find Paras). Go down the second ladder and take one step to the right to be ambushed by a Team Rocket Grunt.  Team Rocket Grunt Sandshrew, Lv.11; Rattata, Lv.11; Zubat, Lv.11 Money: 352  On a platform to the right of this Grunt lies a Star Piece. This item (among others) is specifically designed for increasing the amount of money you have; it has no use in or out of battle. Go back to the main floor and head south from here and you'll find that a wall blocks you. Take the left side to find a Potion, and another Trainer.  Super Nerd Jovan Magnemite, Lv.11; Voltorb, Lv.11 Money: 264  After defeating him, you can go up and fight the Trainer that's in between two walls if you want.  Bug Catcher Robby Caterpie, Lv.10 (x2); Metapod, Lv.10 Money: 120  Continue on the right side and pick up the Rare Candy and Escape Rope. Be sure to go north a little more and talk to the man next to the rocks before heading left to continue your onslaught of the cave.  Lass Miriam Oddish, Lv.11; Bellsprout, Lv.11 Money: 176  Continue left and head down the stairs. You'll find a Team Rocket Grunt here.  Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.11; Ekans, Lv.11 Money: 352  That wasn't so hard, was it? On the platform above him lies TM46, Thief. The rock to his right contains a hidden Ether. Take both items and head back to the main floor of Mt. Moon. The path now is quite straightforward, so just continue on until you reach the end of the cave (which isn't far).  Youngster Josh Rattata, Lv.10 (x2); Zubat, Lv.10 Money: 160                                         o------------------------------------o Hiker Marcos                           / Don't forget the Moon Stone by the / Geodude, Lv.10 (x2); Onix, Lv.10      / exit. It's one of only 4 in Kanto! / Money: 360                           o------------------------------------o  Go down the stairs and follow the underground paths. When you get to the main rooms, head north to find a Revive. Then head right and battle the Grunt.  Team Rocket Grunt                   o-----------------------------------------o Rattata, Lv.13; Sandshrew, Lv.13   / Veterans of this series will remember a / Money: 416                        / vicious Lv.16 Raticate this guy used to /     o----------------------------o have. Since it knew Hyper Fang as well  /    / as Quick Attack, it decimated entire teams without breaking a sweat. /   o----------------------------------------------------------------------o  After that joyful battle, all you have to do is follow the straightforward path all the way to the end, where one last Grunt awaits you.  Team Rocket Grunt Rattata, Lv.13; Zubat, Lv.13 Money: 416   Head north a bit. Do you see the rock in between the two walls? Examine that rock to find the second Moon Stone. The man standing near here is the last fight of this cave. It seems that he's found two rare fossils of long-extinct Pokemon, but he's not willing to share. Looks like we're going to have to rough him up a little and see if he changes his tune.  Super Nerd Miguel Grimer, Lv.12; Voltorb, Lv.12; Koffing, Lv.12 Money: 288  If Not wanting to get beaten any more badly than he already has, Miguel agrees to share the fossils with you. You only get one, so choose wisely. The question is, which one do you want?  ================== 3d. Dome or Helix? ==================  The Dome Fossil contains the remains of Kabuto, while the Helix Fossil holds the remains of Omanyte. Both Pokemon are Rock/Water in type, and both carry the Swift Swim Ability. Omanyte has the Shell Armor Ability as well, but it does the same thing as Kabuto's Battle Armor - prevents the foe's critical hits. Overall, it's a matter of which one you like better. I picked Helix, because I believe Omastar (Omanyte's evolution) is better battle-wise. Moving on!  =================================== 3e. The Point of No Return... Sorta ===================================   We've almost reached this point, but we have just a few more things to do. Once you make your selection of fossil, Miguel will take the other one. Pick up the Antidote on your way out and enjoy your well-deserved dose of sunlight. If you move to the right, you'll notice two men facing each other. These are Move Tutors who will teach ONE of your Pokemon a move. These moves come from the color TM list, and, like TMs, can only be used ONCE. The man on the left will teach Mega Punch; the other, Mega Kick. I suggest not using them. At least, not right now. A bit further and you'll find TM05, Roar.  Step on the square below the TM and go straight down. After you jump the second ledge, you should be able to just press A for a Razz Berry. If not, get in the upper right corner and take a step down and face left or step left and face down. Either way, press A for the berry. Just a little bit more and you'll see a patch of grass, followed by a path if you continue right.  This is the point of no return. If you jump either of these ledges, you will be stuck in the northeast region of Kanto until you earn the right to use Fly out of battle and have obtained it (Fly). When you're ready, go ahead and jump.  o---------------------------o |  ROUTE 4 POKEMON LISTING  | o---------------------------o | Rattata    (Common)       | The only new faces here are Ekans and Sandshrew. | Ekans      (Uncommon, FR) | Pick one up and be on your way. | Sandshrew  (Uncommon, LG) | | Spearow    (Common)       | | Mankey     (Rare)         | o---------------------------o  ======================================================== 3f. Cerulean City - A Mysterious, Blue Aura Surrounds It ========================================================  o---------------------------o As you can see, they have a new item, the Super |  CERULEAN CITY SHOP LIST  | Potion. While it costs more than twice the money o---------------------------o for a Potion, it heals 50 HP, which can prove |  Poke Ball..........$200  | quite useful. Someone needs to inform the manager |  Super Potion.......$700  | of this shop that Repels are in very high supply |  Potion.............$300  | and are NOT worth 350 money. I hope you bought |  Antidote...........$100  | some. Some of these items aren't even worth your |  Parlyz Heal........$200  | time (namely, the Burn Heal and Escape Rope), |  Burn Heal..........$250  | but enough about that. Welcome to Cerulean City! |  Awakening..........$250  | First things first. Head right and then north to |  Escape Rope........$550  | find two houses next to each other. Enter the one |  Repel..............$350  | on the left. A man lives here who will explain o---------------------------o the different benefits of each Badge. Leave through the back door and find five flowers in a W shape on the far right. Search the empty area in the middle on the bottom of this 'W' to find a Rare Candy. Leave this man's house and enter the house next door. In this home is a man who creates things from Berry Powder. Berry Powder is made upstairs in Pokemon Centers, and makes use of the new wireless adapter feature of this game. You'll need another person if you want to crush berries into Berry Powder, but what to store them in? We certainly don't want our Berry Pouch getting dirty. However, this guy's a real nice bloke, and he'll give you your very own Powder Jar. Leaving here and going south a bit, we find a shop that will make your life complete! This guy has one on sale for the low, low price of 1,000,000 money!  What do you say? Interested? > I'll take one      Don't need it  Well, nope. Not getting it. Your wallet only holds up to 999,999 money, one less than they demand. Darn. -__- Even if you could afford the million money, the amount of time you would spend earning that million would be, well, phenomenal, to say the least. Don't worry, though - we'll find a way to get it. We have the important stuff out of the way, so save your game if you haven't already, head towards the bridge on the north side of the city, and get ready for a familiar face.  ================= 3g. Gary Battle 3 =================  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  15 |   Machop   |  17 |   Grimer   |  15 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  14 |   Flareon  |  14 |  Mr. Mime  |  14 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeotto....17|Pidgeotto....17|Pidgeotto....17| |Rattata......15|Rattata......15|Rattata......15| |Abra.........16|Abra.........16|Abra.........16| |Charmander...18|Squirtle.....18|Bulbasaur....18| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 288  One should note that you CAN go beat Misty first, but I'd wait until you've met Bill before attempting that, as Misty is extremely hard if you're weak and will annihilate you if your Pokemon's levels aren't close to or higher than hers (~20). Her Pokemon are fast, so you can't hope to win on type matching alone.  If you fought Gary west of Viridian, you found that he had a Pidgey, which has evolved. Of course, that doesn't really mean much, considering it IS, after all, only Pidgeotto (who is pretty weak to say the least). Abra's only move is Teleport, which, when used properly, can do up to a grand total of ZERO DAMAGE. You'll have to hope he doesn't teleport from this battle, or else you won't get any experience... oops. Silly me, I forgot. This isn't a wild battle, which means Abra is free experience. Bring in that Magikarp if you bought it and Splash it to death for some nice experience. Gary hasn't evolved his starter yet, which could be a good thing if you're weak, but bad if you're strong and need the higher exp. from a strong Pokemon. Oh well.  Don't worry. Gary will get much harder to beat in the future. After sending him packing, he'll come back. Not to taunt you more, but to give you a new item, the Fame Checker. This worthless item is why I told you to talk to EVERYTHING. What this thing does is let you recall things that have been said about famous people. Almost anything that talks about a certain person (all of this is covered in the Fame Checker section) will add that thing to the Fame Checker, whether it be a sign, a person, or a piece of paper on the wall. You'll find people throughout the entire game who will talk about people you met ages ago, so don't worry about having those blank spots.  Gary will leave again, allowing you access to Nugget Bridge and the rest of Kanto's northeastern side.  ================= 3h. Nugget Bridge =================  "People call this the Nugget Bridge! Beat us five Trainers and win a fabulous prize! Think you got what it takes?"  Cale will tell this to you before he challenges you, and that's the gist of it: beat the five Trainers of increasing difficulty, starting with Cale himself.  Bug Catcher Cale Caterpie, Lv.10; Weedle, Lv.10; Metapod, Lv.10; Kakuna, Lv.10 Money: 120  Lass Ali Pidgey, Lv.12; Oddish, Lv.12; Bellsprout, Lv.12 Money: 192  Youngster Timmy Sandshrew, Lv.14; Ekans, Lv.14 Money: 224  Lass Reli                           o-----------------------------------------o NidoranM, Lv.16; NidoranF, Lv.16   / Careful of their Ability, Poison Point! / Money: 256                        o-----------------------------------------o  Camper Ethan Mankey, Lv.18 Money: 360  Hooray, you've done it! Before you go claiming your prize, take a look in your wallet. Are you short on money? If you don't have as much money as you'd like, then go to the Pokemon Center and deposit your entire team. Withdraw someone weak (like that Lv.5 Magikarp you should have bought) and then come back here.  This is still a good tip for those who are financially secure, so read anyway. Talk to the man after Ethan to receive a Nugget and an offer to join Team Rocket. While I've shouted "YES! YES! I'M SAYING YES HERE!" on several occasions at the screen, it doesn't help. Your character will refuse the offer, and he'll fight you because you need convincing.  Team Rocket Grunt Ekans, Lv.15; Zubat, Lv.15 Money: 480  If you like your money total, waste this guy and be on your way.  If not, you should now have that lone Magikarp facing off against Ekans, who will waste no time in killing it. Your Pokemon has been fainted, and you lose half your money... but you're one Nugget richer. If you go back to see the Grunt again, he will give you ANOTHER Nugget and ANOTHER offer and ANOTHER battle. Lose again, and you lose half your money again. Return to the Grunt to receive a THIRD Nugget. See the pattern? Do this 10 times and you'll have an easy 50,000 money in ITEMS. You can become rich quite easily this way.  Note: I accidentally erased the e-mail of the guy who submitted this tip to me. E-mail me so I can give you credit!  After this, you're free to continue on your way.  ============================ 3i. The Road to Bill's House ============================  The road to Bill's house is laced with new Pokemon and Trainers, so it would be wise to head back for a quick heal. When you're ready, go forth.  o---------------------------o Route 25's Pokemon listing is the same as this. | ROUTE 24 POKEMON LISTING | Wow, what's this? You can't catch tons of Rattata o---------------------------o anymore! It's been replaced by Pidgey, and you'll | Pidgey     (Common)       | be seeing a lot of them. Much like Gary's Abra, | Abra       (Uncommon)     | the wild Abra know only Teleport, which makes | Weedle     (Uncommon)     | capturing them very difficult. If you've got | Kakuna     (Rare)         | Sleep Powder (Butterfree or [Bulba/Ivy]saur), | Caterpie   (Uncommon)     | utilize that or try confusing it to save a few | Metapod    (Rare)         | turns. If you don't, this also serves as the | Oddish     (Rare, FR)     | perfect opportunity to get yourself a Grass-type | Bellsprout (Rare, LG)     | for your team. You don't have a choice, but it's o---------------------------o still a Grass-type.  While we're in the grass, let's beat up the scared Trainer hiding in the grass.  Camper Shane Rattata, Lv.14; Ekans, Lv.14 Money: 280   Before you leave this area, be sure you pick up an extra Abra! Keep it with you, store it in the PC, just catch one you don't need.  Just north of Nugget Bridge is TM45, Attract. Get it.  Heading east, tackle each Trainer one at a time, healing when necessary. These guys are pushovers, though. You probably shouldn't need to heal.  Hiker Franklin                       Hiker Wayne Machop, Lv.15; Geodude, Lv.15        Onix, Lv.17 Money: 540                           Money: 612  On Route 25, stand to the left of the lower left square of grass. Take four steps left and press A for a Pecha Berry.  Youngster Joey                       Youngster Dan Rattata, Lv.15; Spearow, Lv.15       Slowpoke, Lv.17 Money: 240                           Money: 272  Picnicker Kelsey                     Hiker Nob NidoranM, Lv.15; NidoranF, Lv.15     Geodude, Lv.13 (x3); Machop, Lv.15 Money: 300                           Money: 468  Do you see the item ball? After you defeat Nob, be sure to let the Trainer to the north of him walk to YOU so you can pick it up, which contains TM43, Secret Power. If you don't, you'll have to come back once you get Cut.  Camper Flint                         Youngster Chad Rattata, Lv.14; Ekans, Lv.14         Ekans, Lv.14; Sandshrew, Lv.14 Money: 280                           Money: 224  Time for some more bad art!                B B             Find this at the There's a hidden Oran Berry here.          B o             bottom of the screen B = bush, o = Oran Berry, F = flower       B   F F         by where Chad is.  Lass Haley Oddish, Lv.13 (x2); Pidgey, Lv.13 Money: 208  Stand to the left of Haley and take two steps up. Face left and press a for a Bluk Berry.  Talk to the girl by the cape to add her to Misty's section of the Fame Checker.  Enter the house and talk to the thing that resembles a Pokemon and it will reveal that it is Bill, the biggest Pokemaniac ever and inventor of the Pokemon Storage System on PC. The thing is, he's been mixed with a Pokemon, and he needs you to help him out. Even if you don't agree to help him, you'll be forced to. When Bill enters the capsule, go to his computer and press A on the screen, which will run the Cell Separation System. You'll see a small animation, and Bill in human form will emerge from the other capsule. He'll give you the S.S. Ticket as thanks, and that's the end of that. From now on, "Someone's PC" is changed to "Bill's PC," and, if you want, you can exit and then re-enter Bill's house and look at his computer to add Eevee, Flareon, Jolteon, and Vaporeon to your Pokedex. When you're finished there, go to the bottom and take the path under all the Trainers back to Cerulean City. There's only one thing left to do before leaving this town, so let's get right to it.  ===================== 3j. Cerulean City Gym =====================  This Gym is just screaming simplicity. The first Trainer is totally optional, but he's super weak, so let's just beat him down.  SwimmerM Luis Horsea, Lv.16; Shellder, Lv.16 Money: 64  Picnicker Diana        o-----------------------------------------------------o Goldeen, Lv.19        / Don't be scared by the high level. It's still weak. / Money: 380           o-----------------------------------------------------o   Well, that wasn't so difficult. Go back and heal, then come back and save.  ================================= 3k. Misty, the Tomboyish Mermaid! =================================  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  15 |   Machop   |  17 |   Grimer   |  16 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  16 |   Flareon  |  15 |  Mr. Mime  |  17 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Misty's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Staryu   |  18 |  Starmie   |  21 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 2100  Staryu shouldn't be very hard to kill, but don't play around, lest you want to get confused by Water Pulse, which both her Pokemon know. Once you kill Staryu, get to hoping and praying, because Starmie's likely faster than your Pokemon. It knows Swift, which will never miss as long as you're on screen, and has better Defense than Staryu. She's got a Super Potion that she'll use when Starmie's HP get low, so use a few weak attacks to knock Starmie's HP into the yellow, then use a powerful attack to get the kill, rendering the item useless. Either that, or try to knock Staryu into the red so she'll waste the Super Potion on it. That way, you won't have to worry about healing the powerhouse. Upon defeat, you will earn the Cascadebadge, the ability to use Cut out of battle, and TM03, Water Pulse.  ==================================================== 4. Boat Rides, HM Monstrosities, and the Third Badge ====================================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Backtrack to Cerulean and pick up a Bike. * Board the S.S. Anne and defeat the Trainers there. * Get your first HM. * Earn your third Badge.  Before we can accomplish the first objective, we need to actually make it to Vermilion City, so let's go. Leave the Gym and circle left around the Mart and Gym to a building with the police officer standing next to the entrance. Enter here. Turns out that this couple was robbed of a TM that lets a Pokemon dig holes. You're a good person, so you're going to get it back from the guy who stole it (but you never agreed to return it... gotta love those loopholes). Leave through the hole in the wall to find an "innocent bystander" standing there. Of course, we're not going to buy that, so let's teach him a lesson.  Team Rocket Grunt Drowzee, Lv.17 Money: 544  After putting him in his place, he'll run away after returning TM28, Dig.  o---------------------------o Route 6's Pokemon listing is the same as this. | ROUTE 5  POKEMON LISTING  | The only new face is Meowth, a mediocre Pokemon o---------------------------o with an awesome Ability - Pickup. This particular | Pidgey     (Common)       | Ability lets Meowth (and anyone else with Pickup) | Meowth     (Common)       | pick up a berry or item after a battle. Get one | Oddish     (Common, FR)   | if you want. Moving on, we find that we can't go | Bellsprout (Common, LG)   | east because a small tree blocks the way. Let's o---------------------------o go south instead. If you jump the ledges in between the walls, we'll come across the Pokemon Day-Care. Here, you can leave one of your Pokemon for this man to raise. For every step you take, that Pokemon earns 1 exp. point. To get a Pokemon back, it's 100 money plus 100 more money for every level said Pokemon gained while in the care of the man. It's a good place to dump the Magikarp you may have purchased back at Mt. Moon.  We can't pass south into Saffron City because the guard's thirsty. That only leaves one other option: the underground path connecting Routes 5 and 6. Enter to find a girl who wants to trade her female Nidoran for your male one. Those with LeafGreen who were too lazy to look for a male Nidoran are in luck. Go down the stairs, follow the path, and get back out. When you exit the building, go all the way to the left side. Stand in between the ledges by the grass, face north, and press A to find a hidden Sitrus Berry. Do the same on the right for your third Rare Candy. Are you saving them?  Now go back to the left so we can tackle the Trainers that inhabit this area.  Bug Catcher Keigo Weedle, Lv.16 (x2); Caterpie, Lv.16 Money: 192  Camper Ricky                     Picnicker Nancy Squirtle, Lv.20                  Rattata, Lv.16; Pikachu, Lv.16 Money: 400                       Money: 320  You may want to consider saving before this next fight.

Be careful!       / o----------------------------------------------------------------------o  If you can manage to beat Elijah without much trouble, you shouldn't need any additional help to make it to your destination.

Vermilion City - The Port of Exquisite Sunsets ==================================================  Head into the Pokemon Center. Talk to the woman next to the counter to receive the VS Seeker. This item, when used, will notify you of Trainers who would like to rematch you if they are in the surrounding area. Those who want another fight will have "!!" above their heads and begin jumping; otherwise, it's "X". If you still haven't fought them for the first time, it will just be a "!" Once used, it takes 100 steps to recharge the battery (talk about a short life span). Leave here and enter the house to the left. Talk to the Fishing Guru and tell him 'yes' to receive the Old Rod. Leave, head east a bit, then go south and then all the way west to reach the Pokemon Fan Club. It's funny,       o----------------------------------o because there's a guy inside who       / "Great. A Magikarp stick."       / says that his Pikachu's cuter than    /    -- AstralFire on the Old Rod  / "that one," but just whose Pikachu   o----------------------------------o is he talking about? Just one of those things to make you go "Hmm." Talk to the old coot on the upper left and answer 'yes' to hear him ramble about his Rapidash. After he's finished, he'll give you a Bike Voucher for your trouble. This is the item that you will need to get a million-money discount on a Bike in Cerulean City, so get yourself back there and get one.  And as long as you're in the Cerulean area, why not stop by Route 4 for an extra Spearow? No, seriously. Get one.  On your way back, you should be very relieved to find that you can indeed ride the Bicycle in all underground paths.  Back in Vermilion, take that Spearow you caught to the house next to the Pokemon Fan Club. Inside is a girl who will gladly give you a Farfetch'd (that isn't found anywhere in Kanto, which makes you wonder where she got hers) for that Spearow (which is found almost everywhere). About the only thing more awkward than that is the name of her Farfetch'd, Ch'ding. What happened to Dux?  There's a Max Ether hidden in the corner lower left corner of the sand. Walk directly south from the Pokemon Center's entrance until you hit water. Face left and press A.  o---------------------------o | VERMILION CITY SHOP LIST  | The only thing left to do in Vermilion City prior o---------------------------o to boarding the S.S. Anne is to look at the shop |  Poke Ball..........$200  | and see what's new, so let's take a look, eh? |  Super Potion.......$700  | Potions have been removed, which means that we're |  Antidote...........$100  | getting stronger. Still using the same old Poke |  Parlyz Heal........$200  | Ball, though. A brand new item, Ice Heal, has |  Awakening..........$250  | been added. You haven't even seen any Ice-type |  Ice Heal...........$250  | Pokemon yet, let alone attacks that can freeze. |  Repel..............$350  | Why on earth would they put it there? o---------------------------o  ================= 4b. The S.S. Anne =================  Welcome to the S.S. Anne, a cruise liner that just so happens to be in Vermilion on its annual visit. Bill said there was supposed to be a party going on, but it seems that the party's been finished for quite some time. Why hasn't the boat left yet? Hmm... Upon entering, one of the sailors will warn you that some of the more restless Trainers will challenge you, but that's not much of a problem. After all, that's what we're here for!  Go all the way to the right, south, and downstairs. Inspect the trash can for a free Hyper Potion you don't even need yet, and go into the nearest door. A guy inside will brag about how strong his Machoke is, but we don't care. Steal the Super Potion he must have left lying around (it's on the table) and leave. Next door, we have two Sailors who will fight you.  Sailor Leonard                 Sailor Duncan Shellder, Lv.21                Horsea, Lv.17; Shellder, Lv.17; Tentacool, Lv.17 Money: 672                     Money: 544  If you enter the cabin to the left of these guys, you are immediately jumped.  Sailor Dylan Horsea, Lv.17 (x3) Money: 544  Grab the Ether next to the chair and get out. Another Sailor awaits next door.  Sailor Huey Tentacool, Lv.18; Staryu, Lv.18 Money: 576  By the bed is TM44, Rest. There's only one more cabin on this floor, and it contains two dudes who want a fight.  Sailor Phillip                 Fisherman Barny Machop, Lv.20                  Tentacool, Lv.17; Shellder, Lv.17; Staryu, Lv.17 Money: 640                     Money: 612  After that, leave, go back upstairs, north, and head into the far right cabin.  Gentleman Thomas         o--------------------------------------------------o Growlithe, Lv.18 (x2)   / Both Growlithe have Intimidate, just like Ekans. / Money: 1296            o--------------------------------------------------o  Moving cabin by cabin, the next one contains a woman who offers to let you rest (a pseudo-Pokemon Center). Nothing else here.  If you enter the third from the far right cabin, you get jumped again.  Gentleman Arthur NidoranM, Lv.19; NidoranF, Lv.19 Money: 1368  The next cabin has a woman who somehow, despite your complete and total lack of any type of clothing that even remotely resembles a uniform of any kind, mistakes you for one of the ship's staff and asks you for cherry pie.  A bit loony, but she's got good taste. <3  So yeah, moving on, we find a room with a man, a young boy, and his Wigglytuff. That's no fun, so let's keep going. We find three people standing around, and the two closest to the door want a piece of you.  Far be it from us to withhold it from them. Let's start with the girl.  Lass Ann                                Youngster Tyler Pidgey, Lv.18; NidoranF, Lv.18          NidoranM, Lv.21 Money: 288                              Money: 336  Take the item ball in the bottom corner of the room for TM31, Brick Break.  The last cabin (the one on the far left) contains an undercover agent on the trail of Team Rocket. While you may want to bust out the chloroform rag on him, it isn't an option, so let's just go south and through the door at the end to end up in the kitchen. No one in here will fight you, but if you inspect the trash cans on the right side, you'll find a Pecha Berry in the top one, a Cheri Berry in the middle one, and a Chesto Berry in the bottom one. These three Berries heal PSN, PAR, and SLP, respectively. Check the garbage can in the lower left corner to find a Great Ball.  Leave and go back north. Go up the stairs, go south, and then up the stairs. Follow the path to the ship's deck to find two more Trainers.  Sailor Trevor                           Sailor Edmond Machop, Lv.17; Tentacool, Lv.17         Machop, Lv.18; Shellder, Lv.18 Money: 544                              Money: 576  We're at the final stretch of the S.S. Anne, so heal if you need to. Enter the first cabin on the far left and talk to the man there. He'll show you a picture of Snorlax, which will add it to your Pokedex. If you enter the second cabin, you'll see an item ball, but two Trainers will see to it that you don't get it.  Fisherman Dale                          Gentleman Brooks Goldeen, Lv.17 (x2); Tentacool, Lv.17   Pikachu, Lv.23 Money: 612                              Money: 1656  Claim your prize (some Stardust, which, like the Star Piece, is shop food). You can skip the next cabin if you want; nothing of note is there. As we head into the third-to-last cabin on this ship, we find another item ball that we want to get our hands on, but we won't have it without a fight. Well... two fights, if you fight the Gentleman first. It's an X Attack.  Gentleman Lamar                         Lass Dawn Growlithe, Lv.17; Ponyta, Lv.17         Rattata, Lv.18; Pikachu, Lv.18 Money: 1224                             Money: 288  The last two cabins have nothing of worth in them. Go back and heal, then come back and save your game. Head forward, and Gary descends the stairs. He brags a bit about his Pokedex (at this stage of the game, 40 Pokemon means he caught and evolved just about everyone you can find thus far), then challenges you.  ================= 4c. Gary Battle 4 =================  It's Gary, complete with hot new battle sprite action!  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  20 |   Machop   |  20 |   Grimer   |  20 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  20 |   Flareon  |  20 |  Mr. Mime  |  20 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeotto....19|Pidgeotto....19|Pidgeotto....19| |Raticate.....16|Raticate.....16|Raticate.....16| |Kadabra......18|Kadabra......18|Kadabra......18| |Charmeleon...20|Wartortle....20|Ivysaur......20| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 720  Oh my, what's this? Gary's gotten smarter! He knows how to switch out now, so he'll occasionally do that and throw you for a loop. Don't worry, though. He's still hardcore weak-style, so beat him around like a redheaded stepchild. Wait a second... a Lv.16 Raticate? My illegality-detecting radar is going off...  I guess his Rattata must have been eating his Poke-Wheaties.  After shaming him, he will take off.  ============== 4d. Cut Sucks. ==============  If you need to do anything that involves leaving the S.S. Anne, do it now.  When you're ready, talk to the man standing next to the garbage can. You will then proceed to give a strange old man a sensual back massage. He, of course, feels much better because of it, and gives you HM01, Cut, as thanks.  This particular HM is less than useful in battle. We don't want to waste one of our precious move slots for such a horrible move, so what to do? Hm... I know!  ======================= 4e. We Need Farfetch'd! =======================  Ah, Farfetch'd! How could I almost forget our lovable little leek slapper? Drag Ch'ding out of whatever Box you've got him in and slap that CD on his head. Keep him on your party until further notice. Oh, and while you're in the Pokemon Center, why not bring that extra Abra I told you to get into the light?  ================== 4f. Diglett's Cave ==================  We're almost ready to storm Vermilion's Gym (hehe), but we've got a couple things to do first. Diglett's Cave is one of them. Before we enter, make sure you're carrying an Abra. You are? Great. How about a Cutter? Yes? Ok. Let's go!  Diglett's Cave can be found on Route 11, east of Vermilion City.  The path is straightforward, and you can ride the Bike in here, but you've got to be careful about putting weak Pokemon in the lead. The only two Pokemon that inhabit Diglett's cave are naturally Diglett and its evolution, Dugtrio. To find a wild Dugtrio is very rare, and they're at levels that are probably higher than your team, so you may want to go fast through this cave. Dugtrio isn't the problem, though. The problem is the Ability they share, Arena Trap. Since it prevents fleeing or switching if you're not part Flying or have  Levitate, make sure a Pokemon who meets any of this criteria leads your party while you're in Diglett's Cave. And speaking of Arena Trap, if you'd like a Diglett for yourself, make sure you try to flee before catching it, to make sure that your new Diglett will come with Arena Trap instead of the inferior Ability, Sand Veil (ups evasion in a sandstorm). With that said:  Follow the straightforward, Diglett-laced path to the end.  ========================== 4g. Mr. Mime Is Mandatory! ==========================  Well, not really, but he is if you want to complete the Pokedex!  When you exit Diglett's Cave, go into the south house and confront your destiny. The boy in the back will trade you the grandmaster Pokemon known as Mr. Mime for the pathetic beast called Abra.  In reality, there's nothing 'grandmaster' about Mr. Mime. Sure, he's got access to Calm Mind (SP.ATK +1, SP.DEF +1), but that's about it. I just love him.  You should, too. <3  Cut the tree to the south and enter the building there. Inside is another of Professor Oak's Aides. If you have caught or owned at least 10 species of Pokemon, he will give you HM05, Flash...  ========================================== 4h. The Worst HM in the History of Pokemon ==========================================  Yes, indeed. Flash is nothing more than a glorified Sand-Attack, and we all know how useful Sand-Attack is in the game (and especially linkplay, look out). Flash has been with us for almost ten years, being in all three series as the same HM, and not a day went by without someone asking a random PokeGod why The Pokemon Company plagued the Pokemon world with a horrible HM such as this. And with no way to rid yourself of it in the color games, it was worse. This is why Pokemon slavery was invented, and God bless the guy who thought of it. For those new to the series, this is why you'll never see Flash (or Sand- Attack, for that matter) in a real battle that means anything:  Type: Normal      A blast of light Power: ---        that cuts the foe's Accuracy: 70      accuracy. It also PP: 20            illuminates caves.  What was The Pokemon Company thinking?  I mean, come on. For something as mediocre as lowering accuracy (by the time it's done any good, you're already dead), you'd think that they'd raise the accuracy by oh, say, 30. Alas, it isn't the case. Flash is now, has always been, and will always be the worst HM in the history of Pokemon.  ==================== 4i. Pewter Revisited ====================  Leave the house from the south side, and pick up the Ether. If you want a free Parlyz Heal, keep going. When you're finished, head back to Diglett's Cave and cut the sapling tree to the left of it. A bit north and you're back in Pewter.  Now that you have Cut, you can get to the back of the Museum. To get there, go to the northeast corner of the city. You can't miss the tree to Cut. Go inside.  At the lower computer is a Move Tutor who will teach someone Seismic Toss.  The bookshelf in the upper right corner contains Brock's last entry for the Fame Checker, but it'll only be there if you have the other five entries.  The man in the upper center has what we're looking for. This guy wants you to take the piece of amber that's sitting next to him to a Pokemon Lab, wherever you can find one, to see if you can revive a Pokemon from it. You don't have a choice, so you get the Old Amber.  Before you head back to Vermilion, it should be noted that you can go back to Viridian City, cut the sap by the water, and talk to a Move Tutor who will teach someone Dream Eater.  Whenever you're ready, go back to Diglett's Cave and get to the Vermilion side.  ========================== 4j. Snorlax Blocks the Way ==========================  o---------------------------o | ROUTE 11 POKEMON LISTING  | Head east to Route 11, where new Pokemon and o---------------------------o Trainers await. Head north immediately to find an | Spearow    (Common)       | Awakening. I find it easier to tackle the | Drowzee    (Uncommon)     | northern Trainers now and get the southern ones | Ekans      (Common, FR)   | on your way back, so that's how I have them | Sandshrew  (Common, LG)   | listed. o---------------------------o  Youngster Eddie                   Youngster Dillon Ekans, Lv.21                      Sandshrew, Lv.19; Zubat, Lv.19 Money: 336                        Money: 304  Engineer Braxton                  Gamer Darian Magnemite, Lv.21                  Growlithe, Lv.18; Vulpix, Lv.18 Money: 1008                       Money: 1296  See the X Defend? Take it if you want.  Youngster Yasu Rattata, Lv.17 (x2); Raticate, Lv.17 Money: 272  A rock in the middle of nowhere. Hm, I wonder if there's a hidden item.  Get the Escape Rope and go inside the house. If you go upstairs, you'll find someone who wants to trade his Nidorino for your Nidorina. Those who didn't partake of the Nidoran swap a while ago can do so with their evolutions here. This is also helpful for those with LeafGreen who _did_ do the trade, but don't feel like raising that NidoranM. You'll also find yet another of Professor Oak's Aides, and he wants to give you the Itemfinder. Only problem is that you have to have 30 Pokemon owned. The Itemfinder isn't mandatory; it's not even  very useful. It detects invisible items on the ground and points you in their general direction. I should like to think that I've found most, if not all, of the invisible items so far, and if I haven't, all the ones that matter.  Anyway, if you leave through the eastern exit, you'll find a big... thing blocking the road. This "thing" is Snorlax, a colossus of a Pokemon, weighing in at more than half a ton (only 1,014 pounds in reality, but "more than half a ton" sounds like much more, doesn't it?) It's snoozing soundly, and there are no forklifts nearby to eject that fat mass into the nearby sea, so you have to turn back. Defeat the south trainers on Route 11 if you haven't already.  Gamer Dirk                        Gamer Jasper Voltorb, Lv.18; Magnemite, Lv.18  Bellsprout, Lv.18; Oddish, Lv.18 Money: 1296                       Money: 1296  Feel free to pick up the X Defend if you didn't do it on your way here.  Youngster Dave                    Engineer Bernie NidoranM, Lv.18; Nidorino, Lv.18  Magnemite, Lv.18 (x2); Magneton, Lv.18 Money: 288                        Money: 864  Gamer Hugo Poliwag, Lv.18; Horsea, Lv.18 Money: 1296  ====================== 4k. Vermilion City Gym ======================  Talk to the sign outside to add Lt. Surge to the Fame Checker.  You know... while I was training, I found myself subconsciously making my way towards Rock Tunnel (because at the time of writing this sentence, I've been awake all night since 4 P.M. the previous day), and I realized that I hadn't beaten Vermilion's Gym yet. I blazed through the game in my mind, and I figure out that I don't _really_ need to beat Lt. Surge until the very end of the game when they do the Badge check on the way to Victory Road. I may be wrong, but you don't have to beat him any time soon. Of course, there's no real reason to wait; the experience is much more valuable now.  And if his Badge wasn't the key to using one of the most helpful moves in the entire game, I'd tell you to skip him completely and come back later.  The good lieutenant only has three cronies for you to test your skills against. Dispose of them quickly; they aren't the real trouble.  Sailor Dwayne         Engineer Baily                      Gentleman Tucker Pikachu, Lv.21 (x2)   Voltorb, Lv.21; Magnemite, Lv.21    Pikachu, Lv.23 Money: 672            Money: 1008                         Money: 1656  Talk to Tucker after defeating him to add him again to the Fame Checker.  Go back and heal. If you solve the puzzle, leave, and come back, it resets.  You'll find that two huge bolts of energy block your way to Lt. Surge. Your job is to make those energy bolts disappear by use of finding the two switches that will do that. These switches will be in the garbage cans that surround the three Gym Trainers. When you find a switch, the second one will always be directly to the left, right, north, or south. So:  F - first switch                  T S F     Good job if this is your S - possible second switch        T T S     scenario. Only 2 options. T - trash                         T T T  S F S T   With three choices, you've got  T S T T   If this is the case, T S T T   slightly worse chances, but     S F S T   you probably won't T T T T   not the worst you can do.       T S T T   get it right.  If you guess the second switch wrong, the first lock will reset and will teleport to a random trash can, making you start over.  Really, it's a lot simpler than I'm making it sound. You'll see.  After you get them both, the energy bolts disappear, leaving Lt. Surge vulnerable to your onslaught.  ====================================== 4l. Lt. Surge, the Lightning American! ======================================  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  20 |   Machop   |  22 |   Grimer   |  21 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  |   Pidgey   |  20 |   Flareon  |  20 |  Mr. Mime  |  22 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Lt.

I mean, he's really not that hard. Look at his team. Two words: Go! Diglett!  There you go. Send out a Diglett and you win. Dig him to death.  If that's not your cup of tea, just know that Shock Wave won't miss. Getting through this yawner of a Gym nets you the Thunderbadge (great name, Lt.), the ability to use Fly out of battle, and TM34, Shock Wave.  ===================================== 5. More Bad Guys and the Fourth Badge =====================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Enjoy the beauty of Pokemon slavery. * Head through Rock Tunnel. * Meet and beat the leader of Team Rocket. * Earn your fourth Badge.  Once you have five of Lt. Surge's entries in the Fame Checker (and you should if you fought everyone and talked to Tucker again), the final entry is on the bookshelf in the Pokemon Center. Get it to complete Lt. Surge's section.  Get a Psychic-type Pokemon that you don't care about and put it on your team. Teach that unlucky Pokemon how to use Flash, and keep whatever you've been using to Cut. Meowth and Oddish can learn both.  You may want to purchase a couple Escape Ropes if you've been using the ones you found on the ground during your adventure. Rock Tunnel is a large dungeon, and there are many Trainers there. Don't forget to stock up on Super Potions if you need to.  Get to Cerulean City, but instead of jumping the ledge and entering the city, go right and cut the small tree and gain access to the bulk of Route 9.  ======================== 5a. The Path to Darkness ========================  o---------------------------o Nothing new yet. This Route, like a few others, | ROUTE 9  POKEMON LISTING  | is infested with Trainers who are ready and more o---------------------------o than willing to give their money to you. There | Spearow    (Common)       | are a total of ten Trainers until you get to | Rattata    (Uncommon)     | Rock Tunnel, and none of them require any real | Ekans      (Common, FR)   | outside preparation. They look like they'd have | Sandshrew  (Common, LG)   | a hard time against Misty, for crying out loud. o---------------------------o So anyway, let's get started, shall we?  Picnicker Alicia Bellsprout, Lv.18 (x2); Oddish, Lv.18 (x2) Money: 360  Below her is TM40, Aerial Ace. This is a very good attack, so save it.  Hiker Jeremy Machop, Lv.20; Onix, Lv.20 Money: 720  When you come to the split in the path, take the top route first and battle the Trainers there.  Camper Chris                           Bug Catcher Brent Growlithe, Lv.21; Charmander, Lv.21    Beedrill, Lv.19 (x2) Money: 420                             Money: 228  Then, go back to the fork, all the way down, then all the way to the right.  Hiker Alan Geodude, Lv.21; Onix, Lv.21 Money: 756  Pick up the Burn Heal and make your way back to the fork. Take the middle path and go all the way right, then up a bit.  Bug Catcher Conner Caterpie, Lv.20; Venonat, Lv.20; Weedle, Lv.20 Money: 240  And to the left of him...  Camper Drew Rattata, Lv.19; Sandshrew, Lv.19 (x2); Ekans, Lv.19 Money: 380  Go back right and north to continue.  Hiker Brice Geodude, Lv.20 (x2); Machop, Lv.20 Money: 720  Directly west of him is a dark patch containing a Chesto Berry.  Head to the right and jump the ledge. You don't have to fight her.  Picnicker Caitlin Meowth, Lv.21 Money: 460  o---------------------------o We have a new Pokemon on this Route; Voltorb. | ROUTE 10 POKEMON LISTING  | Its evolution is the fastest Pokemon in Kanto. o---------------------------o I wouldn't waste too much time training in this | Voltorb    (Common)       | area. The Power Plant (inaccessible for now) and | Spearow    (Common)       | the upcoming Rock Tunnel will provide more than | Rattata    (Uncommon)     | adequate training for the fat lot of nothing | Ekans      (Uncommon, FR) | that's ahead. You won't be challenging a new Gym | Sandshrew  (Uncommon, LG) | for a long time, so don't feel hard-pressed to | Mankey     (Rare)         | make your Pokemon strong. There will be plenty of o---------------------------o time for that later on.  Head south to find many small trees you can Cut, the last Trainer, and a much- needed Pokemon Center.  Picnicker Heidi Pikachu, Lv.20; Clefairy, Lv.20 Money: 400  Go back, heal, and get ready. Enter the cave when you're ready.  =============== 5b. Rock Tunnel ===============  o------------------------------o Just for clarification, "(later)" means later | ROCK TUNNEL  POKEMON LISTING | on in the dungeon, towards the Lavender side. o------------------------------o Upon entering, you get a nice FPV of the cave | Zubat    (Common)            | entrance, and you find it's totally dark. Use | Machop   (Uncommon)          | Flash and the entire area will light up (thank | Mankey   (Uncommon)          | God it's more than just a tiny circle). The | Geodude  (Common) (later)    | encounters here are very high (at least they | Onix     (Uncommon (later)   | were for me), so Repel will be very useful o------------------------------o throughout this cave.  The path is long, but straightforward. Head east for a Repel, then go back and stomp the new brand of Trainer, the Pokemaniac.  Pokemaniac Ashton Cubone, Lv.23; Slowpoke, Lv.23 Money: 1104  Follow the path downstairs and you'll find small rocks that you can't do anything with at this time because you don't have the move HM to teach Rock Smash, and even if you did, you can't use it out of battle yet. Ignore them for now and continue following the straightforward path.  Pokemaniac Winston             o--------------------------------------o Slowpoke, Lv.25               / All the way west of him is a Revive. / Money: 1200                  o--------------------------------------o  Picnicker Martha                       Pokemaniac Steve Oddish, Lv.22; Bulbasaur, Lv.22        Charmander, Lv.22; Cubone, Lv.22 Money: 440                             Money: 1056  If you keep going north, you'll see a Hiker. Don't forget to get his friend on the other side of the wall/rock/whatever.  Hiker Allen                            Hiker Eric Geodude, Lv.25                         Machop, Lv.20; Onix, Lv.20 Money: 900                             Money: 720  Go down the stairs in the northwest corner.  Hiker Lenny Geodude, Lv.19 (x3); Machop, Lv.19 Money: 684  Straight south of him is a hidden Hiker of sorts.  Hiker Oliver                           Hiker Lucas Onix, Lv.20 (x2); Geodude, Lv.20       Geodude, Lv.21; Graveler, Lv.21 Money: 720                             Money: 756  Grab the Escape Rope and utilize the stairs. If you go north, you'll find more Rock Smash-able rocks you can do nothing with, so continue west a bit.  Picnicker Sofia Jigglypuff, Lv.21; Pidgey, Lv.21; Meowth, Lv.21 Money: 420  North of her is a valuable Max Ether you'll want to pick up.  South of her is a Move Tutor who will teach the move Rock Slide.  Hiker Dudley                           Pokemaniac Cooper Geodude, Lv.21 (x2); Graveler, Lv.21   Slowpoke, Lv.20 (x3) Money: 756                             Money: 960  The last set of stairs is past Cooper.  Picnicker Leah Bellsprout, Lv.22; Clefairy, Lv.22 Money: 440  Picnicker Ariana Bellsprout, Lv.19; Pidgey, Lv.19; Rattata, Lv.19 (x2) Money: 380  Pick up the Pearl (free money!) and fight the last Trainer in Rock Tunnel.  Picnicker Dana Meowth, Lv.20; Pidgey, Lv.20; Oddish, Lv.20 Money: 400  Congratulations, you've done it. Leave the cave and you'll find a few more Trainers that are on the short path to Lavender, but none of them are mandatory. If your Pokemon are strong enough, feel free to take them on now... or just go to Lavender, heal, and beat the crap out of them later on.  Stand to the right of the "Rock Tunnel" sign. Take four steps right and one up. Press A for a Nanab Berry.  Picnicker Carol                        Hiker Clark Pidgey, Lv.21; Pidgeotto, Lv.21        Geodude, Lv.21; Onix, Lv.21 Money: 420                             Money: 756  Hiker Trent                            Pokemaniac Herman Onix, Lv.19; Graveler, Lv.19           Cubone, Lv.20; Slowpoke, Lv.20 Money: 684                             Money: 960  ========================================= 5c. Lavender Town - The Noble Purple Town =========================================  Just listen to the sad music...  o---------------------------o |  LAVENDER TOWN SHOP LIST  | o---------------------------o It's about time we got a chance to sell the junk |  Great Ball.........$600  | we've been accumulating and purchase some more |  Super Potion.......$700  | items. Great Balls, the next step up from a Poke |  Revive............$1500  | Ball, are available for the first time; Super |  Antidote...........$100  | Repel and Revive make their debuts here as well. |  Parlyz Heal........$200  | I suggest buying a few of all of them. As you can |  Awakening..........$250  | see, Ice Heal has been removed from the list. You |  Burn Heal..........$250  | still aren't going to see any Ice-types for a |  Escape Rope $500  | good long time. |  Super Repel........$500  | o---------------------------o  When you enter the city, you'll see a huge structure visible from Lavender's side of Route 10. This is Pokemon Tower, a building constructed to honor the life of Pokemon that have died.  Southwest of the tower is the Lavender Volunteer Pokemon House, where Mr. Fuji resides. Mr. Fuji takes care of lonely and abandoned Pokemon, but he's not in right now. Talk to the little girl at the north end of the house to add Mr. Fuji to the Fame Checker. Check the book on the table for another Fuji entry.  South of the LVPH is the Name Rater's house, where you can change the nickname of any Pokemon that _you_ own (their OT is your Trainer ID).  Before we leave Lavender Town, there's one last thing we have to do. Go heal and enter Pokemon Tower. Go up the first set of stairs and save. Head north...  ================= 5d. Gary Battle 5 =================  ...and it's Gary!  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  23 |   Machop   |  24 |   Grimer   |  24 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  22 |   Flareon  |  23 |  Mr. Mime  |  24 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeotto....25|Pidgeotto....25|Pidgeotto....25| |Gyarados.....22|Exeggcute....22|Growlithe....22| |Kadabra......20|Kadabra......20|Kadabra......20| |Exeggcute....23|Growlithe....23|Gyarados.....23| |Charmeleon...25|Wartortle....25|Ivysaur......25| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 900  I guess the Poke-Wheaties didn't do as much as Gary had hoped, because Raticate has been permanently removed from his team. Also, check out the starter- dependent teams!  Exeggcute knows Leech Seed and Reflect. Kill it quick to avoid these problems.  Gyarados has monster Attack power and a powerful Normal attack called Thrash that can make short work of your Pokemon if you're weak or have low Defense. It causes self-confusion in 2 or 3 turns, but you still need to be fast. Pick on its double weakness to Electric if you can.  Growlithe isn't anything special... yet. Standard type matching will do.  After you beat the bejesus out of his team for the fourth or fifth time, he makes a note about how he caught a Cubone but can't find any Marowak (little does he know that's because there _are_ no Marowak in Pokemon Tower). Then he leaves, leaving you free to do whatever. I'd leave the tower, because you can't get to the top anyway. In addition to that, anything you run into will be called "Ghost." If you try to attack them, your Pokemon will be to afraid to do anything to it. It will then tell you to "Get out..." (the reverse of this if the Ghost is faster than your Active Pokemon). You can't catch them either, which means fleeing is your only option.  So we're back in Lavender Town. We're not ready to go south yet because of Snorlax, so we have to take the only other path out of the town.  ============ 5e. Westward ============  o---------------------------o Spearow and Pidgey have switched again, and | ROUTE 8  POKEMON LISTING  | Meowth has returned from Route 5. As expected, o---------------------------o the Ekans/Sandshrew pairing is present, as well | Pidgey     (Common)       | as a new pairing: Growlithe/Vulpix. If you didn't | Meowth     (Common)       | pick Charmander as your starter, this is your | Ekans      (Common, FR)   | first chance to get a Fire-type. The next chance | Sandshrew  (Common, LG)   | will come up soon (Flareon), but these two are | Growlithe  (Rare, FR)     | perfectly fine. Growlithe has superior Special | Vulpix     (Rare, LG)     | Attack over Vulpix, but Vulpix is a bit quicker. o---------------------------o  Quite a few Trainers on this Route. Let's not keep them waiting!  Lass Julia                             Gamer Rich Clefairy, Lv.22 (x2)                   Growlithe, Lv.24; Vulpix, Lv.24 Money: 352                             Money: 1728  To access the grass, you'll need Cut. If you look very closely, you can see a very small dark patch of grass in the center of the short grass (no wild Pokemon). In each of these patches is a berry. A Rawst Berry is on the right side of the second row, a Lum Berry's on the left side of the third row, and a Leppa Berry can be found on the right side of the third row. Can't find them?    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @                        Key @ @ F G G   G G   G G     @ @                     ----- @ F     G G G G G * G G F   @              @ = fence @   F G G - G   G G   G   F @              F = flowers @     G G G G G G G G G G   X              G = tall grass  (wild battles) @ F G   G   G   G   G G G   @                = short grass (no battles) @   G G G G G G G G   G   F @              X = small tree to use Cut on X     G   G   G G + G   G   @              * = Rawst Berry @   G   G G G   G G G G G   @              - = Lum Berry @ F   F   G   G G F   G   F @              + = Leppa Berry @   F   F   G   F   F   F   @              W = wall W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W  Super Nerd Glenn Grimer, Lv.22 (x2); Muk, Lv.22 Money: 528                               o-----------------------------------------------o Twins Eli & Anne             / Your first 2-on-2 battle!

If you have the Itemfinder, you can find loads of sucky items here. Sell them for cash if nothing else.  From the east staircase, go to the top row and stand directly under the first light. Take three steps right, face down, press A. An Ice Heal will thank you.  Stand on the blue line and follow it until you pass another light. Stand where the blue line and light intersect and take five steps left. Face down and press A for an Antidote.  Stay on this blue line and continue until you get to the third light. Two steps left from the light, face up, and press A for a Burn Heal.  There will be a large gap in between the third and fourth light. When you get to the fourth light, stand directly under it, still on that blue line. Face left and claim an Awakening.  Stay on the blue line and continue until you get to the fifth light. Five steps left of it, face down, press A and be one Parlyz Heal richer.  Continue and position yourself in front of the west stairs and take one step up and three steps right. Press A for a Potion.  ============================================= 5f. Celadon City - The City of Rainbow Dreams =============================================  Welcome to the largest city in all of Kanto, Celadon. Naturally, there are many things to do, so let's start off with shopping. The Department Store can be found on the western side of the building. It's got two entrances, so pick one and go inside.  ================================= 5g. Celadon City Department Store =================================  Wow. Just look at this place's brand new look. Very spiffy. Instead of writing a "walkthrough" for this place, I think it'd be easier to list shops and things of note.                        o---------------------------------o                        |  CELADON CITY DEPARTMENT STORE  |                        o---------------------------------o  o----------------------o  o----------------------o  o-------------------------o | SECOND FLOOR,  NORTH |  | SECOND FLOOR,  SOUTH |  |       FOURTH FLOOR      | o----------------------o  o----------------------o  o-------------------------o |  TM05.........$1000  |  |  Great Ball....$600  |  |  Poke Doll.......$1000  | |  TM15.........$7500  |  |  Super Potion..$700  |  |  Retro Mail........$50  | |  TM28.........$2000  |  |  Revive.......$1500  |  |  Fire Stone......$2100  | |  TM31.........$3000  |  |  Antidote......$100  |  |  Thunderstone....$2100  | |  TM43.........$3000  |  |  Parlyz Heal...$200  |  |  Water Stone.....$2100  | o----------------------o  |  Awakening.....$250  |  |  Leaf Stone......$2100  |                           |  Burn Heal.....$250  |  o-------------------------o Move Tutor who teaches    |  Ice Heal......$250  | Counter is on Floor 3.    |  Super Repel...$500  |                           o----------------------o  o-------------------------o o----------------------o     Give the rooftop       |   FIFTH FLOOR,  SOUTH   | |  FIFTH FLOOR, NORTH  |  girl one of each drink    o-------------------------o o----------------------o     to get these TMs:      |  X Attack.........$500  | |  HP Up........$9800  |                            |  X Defend.........$550  | |  Protein......$9800  |   Fresh Water - TM16       |  X Speed..........$350  | |  Iron.........$9800  |      Soda Pop - TM20       |  X Special........$350  | |  Calcium......$9800  |      Lemonade - TM33       |  X Accuracy.......$950  | |  Zinc.........$9800  |                            |  Guard Spec.......$700  | |  Carbos.......$9800  |                            |  Dire Hit.........$650  | o----------------------o                            o-------------------------o  Buy things and get out. Enter the building to the right.  =================== 5h. Celadon Mansion ===================  Talk to the old lady on the first floor. She'll give you Tea, a Key Item.  Once you get five of Erika's entries in the Fame Checker, her last entry will be on the second floor's bookshelf.  Go behind the Pokemon Center found east of here, follow the path, and enter the mansion's back door. Go all the way up the stairs and into the door to find an Eevee of your very own sitting on a table. It's Lv.25, and evolves into one of five different things.  Water Stone: Vaporeon     Thunderstone: Jolteon      Fire Stone: Flareon  Since there's no time, you can't get Espeon or Umbreon without trading from Ruby, Sapphire, or Colosseum, and you can't do that yet.  Leave and go all the way to the left for an Ether. You're done here.  ====================== 5i. Rocket Game Corner ======================  While the Game Corner provides a few forms of entertainment (and Pokemon found only here), this will only deal with the dungeon aspect of Rocket Game Corner. For information on the slots and prizes you can win, please refer to the Extras section.  Also let it be noted that you are more than welcome to tackle the very sexy Erika (in battle) before coming here, I always wait until I complete this mission. If you want to beat the Gym first, refer to that section and then come back to this one.  The Game Corner is southwest of the Pokemon Center. Talk to the innocent Rocket Grunt standing next to the poster by the counter, and start a battle.  Team Rocket Grunt                  o-------------------------------------o Raticate, Lv.20; Zubat, Lv.20     / Finally, a Raticate of legit level! / Money: 640                       o-------------------------------------o  He will run into a wall and vanish. Examine the poster and stairs appear.  Gawk at the lovely FPV and head south. Go to the right and into the room. A surprised Grunt will commence attack.  Team Rocket Grunt Drowzee, Lv.21; Machop, Lv.21 Money: 672  Head to the left side of the room for another battle.  Team Rocket Grunt Raticate, Lv.21 (x2) Money: 672  Go into the room he was guarding and pick up the Escape Rope on the table. Go back to the entrance and go down the right staircase.  Follow the path to a battle.  Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.17 (x2); Koffing, Lv.17; Grimer, Lv.17; Raticate, Lv.17 Money: 544  Head down the stairs. Go into the room that's under there, and you're greeted by another Grunt.  Team Rocket Grunt Machop, Lv.21 (x2) Money: 672  If you head all the way south of him, you'll find a partially hidden item ball that contains TM21, Frustration. Get back into the open and head left. See the double arrow tiles? These are direction-forcers. Stepping on one of these will spin you in circles and move you (very quickly, to the relief of many, I'm sure) until you come across a yellow tile or another direction-forcer, which will spin you and force you in _that_ direction until you ultimately come across a yellow tile.  Step on the arrow pointing down and get Rare Candy #4.  Step on the up arrow, then circle around and step on the left arrow. Go down into the right arrow, then go all the way to the far left wall. Go all the way to the bottom and step on the top arrow (the middle of three pointing right). The battle that follows is optional (like most of these), but why waste exp.?  Team Rocket Grunt Rattata, Lv.20; Drowzee, Lv.20; Raticate, Lv.20 Money: 640  Follow the path, pick up the Blackglasses, and go down the stairs. A Max Ether sits on the table. Don't leave it there. Follow the path up to find a Grunt and TM49, Snatch. Take them in whichever order you like.  Team Rocket Grunt Koffing, Lv.21; Zubat, Lv.21 Money: 672  Upon defeat, the Grunt will drop the Lift Key. Take it and backtrack to the first room with direction-forcers. Step on the bottom arrow.  Pick up the Moon Stone (two left!), and weave around the blocks on the north path. An X Speed awaits you. Take the arrow directly below the one next to the far left yellow tile. Pick up TM12, Taunt, and be on your way.  Go south of the TM and step on the upper of the two arrows pointing right, or just step on the arrow pointing down. Step right, then left. Go down and step on the bottom arrow if you want a Super Potion. Otherwise, step on the top arrow, then the last arrow to complete this section. Go up the stairs.  A battle awaits you if you go left a little bit.  Team Rocket Grunt Rattata, Lv.19 (x2); Raticate, Lv.19 (x2) Money: 608  There's a Hyper Potion in the upper left corner, and a battle its right.  Team Rocket Grunt Grimer, Lv.20; Koffing, Lv.20 (x2) Money: 640  Go back downstairs and enter the elevator. Go to the floor select in the upper left corner and select B4F as your destination. Exit and go all the way left to find a lonely Calcium. Let's be its friend. Go north and find two Rockets guarding a door. Rough 'em up.  Team Rocket Grunt Sandshrew, Lv.23; Ekans, Lv.23; Sandslash, Lv.23 Money: 736  Team Rocket Grunt Ekans, Lv.23; Sandshrew, Lv.23; Arbok, Lv.23 Money: 736  After you defeat them both, the door will open. Save your game, head up, and confront the last enemy in this dungeon.  ======================================== 5j. Meet Him, Waste Him - It's Giovanni! ========================================  Giovanni is the leader of Team Rocket. He's not too thrilled about your having beaten his entire troupe of monkeys- er... loyal minions (yeah, that's it), and he plans on throttling you in battle as payment.  Of course, we're not going to let that happen.   My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  26 |   Machop   |  27 |   Grimer   |  25 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  26 |   Flareon  |  27 |  Mr. Mime  |  28 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Giovanni's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Onix    |  25 |  Rhyhorn   |  24 | Kangaskhan |  29 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 2900  Onix and Rhyhorn are Rock/Ground, and we know what to do with those. ;)  Kangaskhan's a Normal-type. Its Ability is Early Bird, which cuts sleep time in half. It's got good Attack power, but lacks the moves to make good use of it.  Pick up the Silph Scope and use the Escape Rope you found to exit this place.  If you haven't beaten Erika yet, get someone with Cut (Are you [still] using Farfetch'd?) and head to the southern part of Celadon City. Head all the way right and north to find a small tree to cut down. Stand to the right of it and take two steps right and one step up. Press A for a PP Up. Now go back to the south central part where you saw the first small tree. Cut the small tree and follow the path. Otherwise, skip to section 6.  ==================== 5k. Celadon City Gym ====================  A girls-only Gym... woohoo!  Don't forget to talk to the Gym sign to add Erika to the Fame Checker.  Erika has quite a few underlings, but you only have to fight two of them if you do it correctly (Tamia and Lori, far left and to Erika's right). But after you beat Erika, you can't fight them anymore, so why would you waste experience by not fighting them?  Beauty Tamia                        Talk to Tamia after defeating her to add Bellsprout, Lv.24; (x2)             her to Erika's section of the Fame Checker. Money: 1728  Lass Kay Bellsprout, Lv.23; Weepinbell, Lv.23 Money: 368  Beauty Bridget                                 Picnicker Tina Oddish, Lv.21 (x2); Bellsprout, Lv.21 (x2)     Bulbasaur, Lv.24; Ivysaur, Lv.24 Money: 1512                                    Money: 480  Cooltrainer Mary Bellsprout, Lv.22; Oddish, Lv.22; Weepinbell, Lv.22; Gloom, Lv.22; Ivysaur, Lv.22 Money: 792  Beauty Lori        Lisa's a part of Erika's    Lass Lisa Exeggcute, Lv.24     section, too, but it      Oddish, Lv.23; Gloom, Lv.23 Money: 1728          lists her as "Lola."      Money: 368  ====================================== 5l. Erika, the Nature-Loving Princess! ======================================  The lovely Erika is my favorite Gym Leader in the Kanto region, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to help you stomp the living crap out of her.  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Poliwag  |  30 |   Machop   |  30 |   Grimer   |  30 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgey   |  30 |   Flareon  |  30 |  Mr. Mime  |  30 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Erika's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o | Victreebel |  29 |  Tangela   |  24 | Vileplume  |  29 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 2900  You may be intimidated at first by Erika's Victreebel. It's the evolved form of the Weepinbell you may or may not have seen earlier, and has exceptional stats befitting a Stage 2 evolution. All of Erika's Pokemon are capable of inflicting Special Conditions, so you'll want to bring a few status healers. Erika's Tangela knows Ingrain, which will restore its HP between turns. Because of this, you'll have to be fast in destroying it. It should be noted that Tangela is the only pure Grass-type in the game, which means it gains a Poison weakness as well as one from Bug while losing a Psychic weakness. Since every other Grass-type is also part Poison, Victreebel and Vileplume both share a weakness to Psychic. Use that to your advantage and play accordingly, and you'll win in no time. If you don't have Psychic attacks, Flying or Fire will do the trick as well. Put Erika in her place for the Rainbowbadge, the ability to use Strength out of battle, and TM19, Giga Drain.  =============================================== 6. Paying Respects, Ninjas, and the Fifth Badge  ===============================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Put the soul of a dead Pokemon to rest. * Make your way to Fuchsia City. * Get two more HMs. * Earn your fifth Badge.  The next stop on our journey is Lavender Town. Before we leave, though, we need to pick up a new HM. Try to head west out of the city and you'll find that a second Snorlax blocks the path. There's a tree to Cut at the end of the fence, and your second 2-on-2 battle awaits to the northwest of it.  Young Couple Lea & Jed Rapidash/Ninetales, Lv.29 Money: 1624  Go left until you see a house. Enter and talk to the girl for HM02, Fly. You can use this to fly to any town or city you've previously visited, so Fly to Lavender Town.  Consider this further notice. If you have someone to teach Fly to, you can take Ch'ding off your team now (but you probably haven't been using him, huh...).  ======================== 6a. Ascend Pokemon Tower ========================  Gary's already come and gone, but we now have the item necessary to unveil the identities of the Ghosts and scale the tower without fail. First, ascend to the third floor, and the floor becomes foggy. From here on, wild Pokemon will jump you. Which ones, you ask?  o-------------------------------o Why, these ones, of course. When I list | POKEMON TOWER POKEMON LISTING | Cubone as rare, I meant it; We're talking o-------------------------------o 1 in 50 if you're lucky rare. Or maybe it's | Gastly   (Common)             | just my horrid luck acting up again. Either | Haunter  (Rare)               | way, they're only found here (unless you have | Cubone   (Rare)               | LeafGreen), so you _have_ to find one if you o-------------------------------o want to fill your Pokedex.  Let's get started. Go to the north of the room and battle one of many, _many_ Channelers inside the tower. Next to her is an Escape Rope.  Channeler Hope Gastly, Lv.23 Money: 736  Also, since all the Channelers use Ghost Pokemon, Gastly will be the only thing you see until you get up to the fifth floor.  Go back to the bottom and battle the Channeler on the bottom.  Channeler Patricia Gastly, Lv.22 Money: 704  North of her...  Channeler Carly Gastly, Lv.24 Money: 768  Head to the fourth floor and take a single step to your left.  Channeler Laurel Gastly, Lv.23 (x2) Money: 736  Take the Elixir, then fight the woman south of it.  Channeler Jody Gastly, Lv.22 Money: 704  Weave around the south side and pick up the Great Ball, then go up to find an Awakening. Make your way to the left side of the room and challenge the Channeler near the stairs.  Channeler Paula Gastly, Lv.24 Money: 768  Head to the fifth floor and you'll see an item ball surrounded by a big blue grid thingy of some kind. Ignore this for now and beat the old woman above it.  Channeler Ruth Gastly, Lv.22 Money: 704  Next victim is the woman by the east staircase.  Channeler Tammy Haunter, Lv.23 Money: 736  Now head into the grid thingy to be fully healed. Pick up the Cleanse Tag and go left.  Channeler Karina Gastly, Lv.24 Money: 768  Channeler Janae Gastly, Lv.22 Money: 704  Get the Nugget, re-heal and go up the stairs. Take two steps, and:  Channeler Angelica Gastly, Lv.22 (x3) Money: 704  Get the Awakening south of the stairs and follow the path.  Channeler Jennifer           Channeler Emilia Gastly, Lv.24                Gastly, Lv.24 Money: 768                   Money: 768  Pick up the fifth Rare Candy, head near the stairs, save, and walk to them. A Ghost will appear, but the Silph Scope will reveal it to be a Lv.30 uncatchable Marowak. You can flee, but you shouldn't waste the experience. End the battle, and you can go up to the sixth floor. Now, just head straight up.  Team Rocket Grunt                         Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.25 (x2); Golbat, Lv.25          Koffing, Lv.26; Drowzee, Lv.26 Money: 800                                Money: 832  Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.23 (x2); Rattata, Lv.23; Raticate, Lv.23 Money: 736  Defeat him and talk to Mr. Fuji. He will throw you into his house at the foot of the tower and give you the Poke Flute for your trouble. Any sleeping Pokemon will instantly wake up upon hearing the flute (even your foe's, so keep that in mind). This also works in battle, so you will never have to buy Awakenings ever again. If you have the Itemfinder, you can get the Soothe Bell if you use it on the spot where Mr. Fuji was standing in Pokemon Tower.  ===================== 6b. Wake Up, Snorlax! =====================  Alright... we're finally ready to get that half-ton giant out of our way, but wait a second. There are _two_ Snorlax. Which one do we wake up? Both paths lead to our destination, Fuchsia City.  Cycling Road covers Routes 16 through 18 and is the quicker of the two paths. There are a few patches of grass, but since you're required to have a Bicycle, it's much quicker than taking the other path. There are a few Trainers at the top and a couple scattered along the route.  Silence Bridge is really only Route 12, but I will use it to refer to this entire area, which encompasses Routes 12-15. There are more items, Trainers, and Pokemon on this route, and it takes a while to get to Fuchsia.  ================== 6c. Silence Bridge ==================  If this is your option, or you want to do this because you've completed Cycling Road, Fly to Lavender Town if you're not there already. Head out to Route 12. Go upstairs when you get into the building and talk to the girl for TM27, Return.  The path is almost 100% straightforward, with little to no breaks in the path.  o--------------------------------o Remember, I use the name Silence Bridge to | SILENCE BRIDGE POKEMON LISTING | refer to the path connecting Lavender and o--------------------------------o Fuchsia; if you can't find a Pokemon in one | Pidgey      (Common)           | Route, go to another one. And now, at long | Pidgeotto   (Rare)             | last... Ditto, the breeding master, is | Venonat     (Common)           | available for you to catch. Is your starter | Ditto       (Rare)             | a male? Want that baby Bulbasaur? Breed it | Oddish      (Common, FR)       | with Ditto! Catch one of these things as | Gloom       (Rare, FR)         | soon as you possibly can. It will become | Bellsprout  (Common, LG)       | your very best friend as far as breeding | Weepinbell  (Rare, LG)         | goes. In battle, it turns into the enemy o--------------------------------o and has 5 PP for all their moves. Whee.  Fisherman Ned                              Fisherman Chip Goldeen, Lv.22 (x2); Poliwag, Lv.22;       Tentacool, Lv.24; Goldeen, Lv.24 Money: 792                                 Money: 864  Fisherman Hank Goldeen, Lv.27 Money: 972  Fisherman Elliot Poliwag, Lv.21; Shellder, Lv.21; Goldeen, Lv.21; Horsea, Lv.21 Money: 756  Young Couple Gia & Jes NidoranM/NidoranF, Lv.24 Money: 1344  Snorlax lies ahead of Gia & Jes. Talk to it, and it will prompt you to use the Poke Flute. Do so, and hear the sounds of awakening. Snorlax will attack you for waking it up, and with good reason.  Snorlax is only Lv.30, but it has lots of HP. If you accidentally kill it, you can still catch the one by Celadon (if you haven't already). It has a Chesto Berry equipped and knows both Rest and Snore. It also has very high Special Defense, so stick with physical attacks. Once the battle is ended,  stand where Snorlax was and use the Itemfinder for a Leftovers. If you don't have the Itemfinder, just enter the house just past him.  Inside here is the Fishing Guru's younger brother. Tell him you like to fish, and he'll give you the Super Rod. He also wants you to use it to catch a Magikarp and show it to him. He just loves his giant Magikarp.  Now that you have the Super Rod, you can catch many Water Pokemon that you've never seen up to this point. Fish as much as you want, and then continue.  Rocker Luca Voltorb, Lv.29; Electrode, Lv.29 Money: 696  If you have a Cutter on your party, then use it and fight this dude.  Camper Justin NidoranM, Lv.29; Nidorino, Lv.29 Money: 580  Pick up the Iron and be on your way.

Then go back to the end of Silence Bridge.

Picnicker Becky                            Crush Kin Ron & Mya Pikachu, Lv.29; Raichu, Lv.29              Hitmonchan/Hitmonlee, Lv.29 Money: 580                                 Money: 1392  Picnicker Celia Clefairy, Lv.33 Money: 660  Then go back to the main path and continue.  Biker Ernest Koffing, Lv.25 (x3); Weezing, Lv.25; Grimer, Lv.25 Money: 500  Biker Alex Koffing, Lv.28; Grimer, Lv.28; Weezing, Lv.28 Money: 560  Beauty Grace                               Beauty Olivia Pidgeotto, Lv.29; Wigglytuff, Lv.29        Bulbasaur, Lv.29; Ivysaur, Lv.29 Money: 2088                                Money: 2088  Picnicker Kindra                           Bird Keeper Chester Gloom, Lv.28; Oddish, Lv.28 (x2)           Dodrio, Lv.28; Doduo, Lv.28 (x2) Money: 560                                 Money: 672  Bird Keeper Edwin Pidgeotto, Lv.26; Farfetch'd, Lv.26; Doduo, Lv.26; Pidgey, Lv.26 Money: 624  Picnicker Yazmin Bellsprout, Lv.29; Tangela, Lv.29; Oddish, Lv.29 Money: 580  That was fun, wasn't it? If you go upstairs when you enter the house, you'll find one of Professor Oak's Aides. If you have caught/owned at least 50 species of Pokemon, he'll give you the Experience Share, a very helpful item if you have weak Pokemon to raise. West of there is your destination, Fuchsia City.  Make sure you can Fly to Fuchsia. If you want to do the Cycling Road path, Fly to Celadon City and look below. Otherwise, skip to section 6e.  ================ 6d. Cycling Road ================  If you choose this path, or you want to do this because you've completed Silence Bridge, Fly to Celadon City.  Snorlax blocks the west exit. Talk to it, and it will prompt you to use the Poke Flute. Do so, and hear the sounds of awakening. Snorlax will attack you for waking it up, and with good reason.  Snorlax is only Lv.30, but it has lots of HP. If you accidentally kill it, you can still catch the one at Silence Bridge (if you haven't already). It has a Chesto Berry equipped and knows both Rest and Snore. It also has very high Special Defense, so stick with physical attacks. Once the battle is ended, stand where Snorlax was and use the Itemfinder for a Leftovers. If you don't have the Itemfinder, just enter the house just past Snorlax. If you go upstairs, you'll find yet another of Professor Oak's Aides who will give you the Amulet Coin if you have caught or owned at least 40 species of Pokemon. This item, when held by someone who takes part in a Trainer battle, will double the money earned. Quite helpful for those who are hard pressed for money (but like I said earlier, you'd have to go overboard purchasing items for that to happen; I had well over 100,000 money at this point, _without_ selling absolutely everything).  To pass the guard, you _must_ have a Bicycle. You will automatically mount it when you leave the guard house via the west exit.                o----------------------------------------------o              / Hold B while on the slope to stand in place. /             o----------------------------------------------o  Biker Lao                             Cue Ball Koji Grimer, Lv.29; Koffing, Lv.29         Machop, Lv.28 (x2); Mankey, Lv.28 Money: 580                            Money: 672  Cue Ball Luke                         Biker Hideo Mankey, Lv.29; Machop, Lv.29          Weezing, Lv.33 Money: 696                            Money: 660  Biker Ruben                           Cue Ball Camron Weezing, Lv.28 (x2); Koffing, Lv.28   Mankey, Lv.29; Machop, Lv.29 Money: 560                            Money: 696  Biker Virgil                          Cue Ball Isaiah Weezing, Lv.28 (x2); Koffing, Lv.28   Machop, Lv.29; Machamp, Lv.29 Money: 560                            Money: 696   o-------------------------------o     Cue Ball Raul | CYCLING ROAD  POKEMON LISTING |     Mankey, Lv.29; Primeape, Lv.29 o-------------------------------o     Money: 696 | Doduo       (Common)          | | Rattata     (Rare)            | I would tell you to go kill wild Raticate, | Raticate    (Common)          | but the VS Seeker owns all over that idea. | Spearow     (Uncommon)        | Go use that instead, but not before picking | Fearow      (Rare)            | up a Doduo before you go. o-------------------------------o  Take the right path for now; you can always go back and do the other side. When you see the yellow path start, start counting signs that are on the left side of the water. When you count three signs, position yourself level with that third sign. Go one square up and one to the right, hold B and press A for a hidden Rare Candy.  Biker Nikolas                         Cue Ball Zeek Voltorb, Lv.29 (x2)                   Machoke, Lv.33 Money: 580                            Money: 792  Cue Ball Corey                        Biker William Primeape, Lv.29; Machoke, Lv.29       Koffing, Lv.25 (x3); Weezing, Lv.25 (x2) Money: 696                            Money: 500  Now go back up the hill and take the left side.  Biker Billy Muk, Lv.33 Money: 660  Then the path'll split again. Of these, take the one on the right. There's a hidden Full Restore 2 spaces to the left of the "Watch out for discarded items." notice. Now go back and take the left path.  Cue Ball Jamal Mankey, Lv.26 (x2); Machamp, Lv.26; Machop, Lv.26 Money: 624  Biker Jaxon Weezing, Lv.29; Muk, Lv.29 Money: 580  There's a hidden PP Up in the middle of the path if your back wheel is at eye level with the light post that's right after Jamal. If that's a bit confusing, hug the water's edge so you can see the sign across from you. Make yourself one square up and one square left of that sign. Since you're holding B, you'll face down, which means all you have to do is just press A and the PP Up is yours.  When you get to the point where the path splits horizontally, make sure you're one step north of the sign that's there. Then position yourself in the middle of the left path and press A for a Max Revive.  It's smooth sailing until you get to a ledge you can jump. Get back up there and stand to the right of the "Cycling Road - Slope ends here!" sign. Go one step up and three steps right to find a Max Elixir.  Inside the house, there's a version-dependent trader in here. If you're playing FireRed, this guy wants a Golduck. If, like me, you're playing LeafGreen, he wants Slowbro instead. Either way, he will give you a Lickitung in exchange, a Pokemon you can find nowhere else. You can find both Golduck _and_ Slowbro in the wild, so don't worry about it too much. If you don't have one to spare, just come back later. Anyway, there are only 3 Trainers left who lie on the outskirts of Fuchsia, so let's whomp 'em and be done with this horrendous path.  Bird Keeper Jacob                     Bird Keeper Wilton Spearow, Lv.26 (x3); Fearow, Lv.26    Spearow, Lv.29; Fearow, Lv.29 Money: 624                            Money: 696  Bird Keeper Ramiro Dodrio, Lv.34 Money: 816  ============================================= 6e. Fuchsia City - Behold! It's Passion Pink! =============================================  The Pokemon Center's kind of hard to get to... it's on the western part of town, but you'll have to get off the path to get there. I thought having Cut was _required_ in order to get anywhere in Fuchsia, but I was wrong. Whew.  In the house next to the Gym, talk to the old guy. He's Bill's grandfather, and he's part of Bill's section of the Fame Checker.  Next to the Pokemon Center is the Move Deleter, who is capable of making your Pokemon forget their HM moves (Take that, Flash). You may be coming here often.  There are two houses to the right of the Pokemon Center. One of them is home to Safari Zone's Warden, and he is incapable of speaking in a coherent fashion because he's lost his teeth. Quite sad when the leader of a major Pokemon facility can't find his own false teeth...  Check the blue bookshelf for one of Koga's entries in the Fame Checker.  Next door is home to the Fishing Guru's older brother. Tell him you like fishing, and he'll give you a Good Rod. Of course, since you may or may not already have the Super Rod, there's really no point in using this item. If you don't have the Super Rod, go get it. It's at Silence Bridge.  If you go to the house near Fuchsia City's sign, you can either Cut your way through to get everywhere, or just follow the light grass path. If you do, you can't miss the PokeMart. Let's go check it out.  o---------------------------o |  FUCHSIA CITY  SHOP LIST  | Great Balls not doing the trick? Get yourself an o---------------------------o Ultra Ball! These are the best Pokemon-catchers |  Ultra Ball........$1200  | that money can buy, but that's not really saying |  Great Ball.........$600  | much. If you decide to catch any legendaries, |  Super Potion.......$700  | you'll be wondering to yourself why there isn't |  Revive............$1500  | a "Mega Ball" with a better catch rate than an |  Full Heal..........$600  | Ultra Ball... oh, and check out the Full Heals. |  Max Repel..........$700  | Now, _those_ are worth mentioning. Get several. o---------------------------o  Sell crap, stock up, and get out. Moving on!  Northwest of the Pokemon Center is a Move Tutor who teaches Substitute.  Continue following the path until you find a building at the far back of the city. This is the Safari Zone, and we're going to have to make a pit stop here before we advance.  =================== 6f. The Safari Zone ===================  You _have_ to come here, at least to get Surf and Strength.  It's also recommended that if you're not here to catch Pokemon, you come here with around 20 Max Repels; encounters are somewhat high.  The people at the Safari Zone have crafted their very own special Poke Ball called a Safari Ball to be used only in the Safari Zone. When you get in, you get 30 of them and six hundred steps to take. Once you run out of either, you "lose" and have to pay to get in again. It costs 500 money to get in each time, but it's a VERY small price to pay for the things you can get here. Some Pokemon can only be caught here, and you may be wanting to pull your hair out at how stubborn some Pokemon can be, but there are some pretty nice items here, too. So chin up, pay up, and head into the wilderness. Ooh, pretty picture!  What's different about the Safari Zone is the fact that for one, you can't hurt the Pokemon. Actually, you don't even send out a Pokemon. In fact, almost your entire battle menu changes. If you choose to bean 'em with a rock (Rock), they'll get mad and their flee rate will go up, but so does the catch rate (it makes them easier to catch). The opposite is true if you choose to feed them mysterious treats (Bait) that have just randomly appeared from nowhere land (flee rate down, catch rate down (harder to catch)). Oh, you can't save in here, either.  o-----------------------------o  o---------------------------o | CENTER AREA POKEMON LISTING |  |  AREA 1  POKEMON LISTING  | o-----------------------------o  o---------------------------o | Venonat     (Uncommon)      |  |  Exeggcute   (Common)     | | Rhyhorn     (Uncommon)      |  |  Doduo       (Common)     | | Exeggcute   (Uncommon)      |  |  Paras       (Uncommon)   | | Chansey     (Rare)          |  |  Parasect    (Rare)       | | NidoranM    (Common, FR)    |  |  Kangaskhan  (Rare)       | | Nidorino    (Common, FR)    |  |  NidoranM    (Common, FR) | | Nidorino    (Rare, LG)      |  |  NidoranM    (Rare, LG)   | | NidoranF    (Common, LG)    |  |  Nidorino    (Rare, FR)   | | Nidorina    (Common, LG)    |  |  Scyther     (Rare, FR)   | | Nidorina    (Rare, FR)      |  |  NidoranF    (Rare, FR)   | o-----------------------------o  |  NidoranF    (Common, LG) |                                  |  Nidorina    (Rare, LG)   | o---------------------------o    |  Pinsir      (Rare, LG)   | |  AREA 2  POKEMON LISTING  |    o---------------------------o o---------------------------o |  Rhyhorn   (Common)       |    o---------------------------o |  Paras     (Uncommon)     |    |  AREA 3  POKEMON LISTING  | |  Exeggcute (Uncommon)     |    o---------------------------o |  Venomoth  (Rare)         |    |  Exeggcute  (Common)      | |  Chansey   (Rare)         |    |  Doduo      (Common)      | |  Nidorino  (Rare)         |    |  Venonat    (Uncommon)    | |  Nidorina  (Rare)         |    |  Venomoth   (Rare)        | |  NidoranM  (Uncommon, FR) |    |  Tauros     (Rare)        | |  NidoranF  (Uncommon, LG) |    |  NidoranM   (Common, FR)  | o---------------------------o    |  NidoranM   (Rare, LG)    | |  Nidorino   (Rare, FR)    |                                  |  NidoranF   (Rare, FR)    |                                  |  NidoranF   (Common, LG)  |                                  |  Kangaskhan (Rare)        |                                  o---------------------------o  Explanation over. Time to get some items. There are none in the first area, so head northeast to the next area.  Head to the center, go up the stairs, and go up some more for a Leaf Stone.  Go down the far left stairs and pick up the hidden item ball in the grass that's a bit north of it. Inside is TM11, Sunny Day.  In the northwest corner of this little area is a Max Potion.  Can't really miss the Full Restore... there is nothing of importance in the  Rest House. All it does is waste steps; just completely ignore it.  Follow the path to the next area. Take the first steps you see and follow this path to a sandy area that has the Quick Claw. Go back to the beginning of this area (don't go south) and follow the path for TM47, Steel Wing. Enter the Rest House and talk to the man in the upper right corner; he's part of Koga's section of the Fame Checker.  You should be almost out of steps by now, if you've been following this. Just come back in and blaze through it, ignoring the parts where you go off the path for items.  Pick up the Protein and go into the next area. You'll see a notice that wants you to find the Warden's lost teeth, and that they're "around here somewhere." Four steps south, and lo and behold, it's the Gold Teeth. Get them as well as TM32, Double Team, then enter the house. Talk to the only guy there. This is the Secret House, and you've won a free HM03, Surf, as your prize.  You're done here, so you can leave if you want. Press Start and pick "Retire." Otherwise, just drain your steps or catch things until you're finished.  Take the Gold Teeth to the Warden. He'll give you HM04, Strength, as thanks. Teach it to someone and move the rock for a Rare Candy.  Well, we have nothing else to do, so let's take care of the Gym.  ==================== 6g. Fuchsia City Gym ====================  This place has invisible walls that block the seemingly direct path to Koga. If you look closely at each of the tiles, you'll see that some of them have white dots in each of the four corners. These tiles are the invisible walls. You'll have to work your way around from the right side to reach Koga, but there's a guy over on the left side who wants to try his luck against you. Defeat him, and then make a circle around the Gym, wasting Trainers as you go.  Juggler Nate                         Juggler Kayden Drowzee, Lv.34; Kadabra, Lv.34       Hypno, Lv.38 Money: 1360                          Money: 1520  Juggler Kirk                         Tamer Edgar Drowzee, Lv.31 (x3); Kadabra, Lv.31  Arbok, Lv.33 (x2) Sandslash, Lv.33 Money: 1240                          Money: 1320  Tamer Phil                           Juggler Shawn Sandslash, Lv.34; Arbok, Lv.34       Drowzee, Lv.34; Hypno, Lv.34 Money: 1360                          Money: 1360  Go back and heal. If you're not feeling lazy, Fly somewhere and get some Antidotes. Chances are, you'll be needing them.  ==================================== 6h. Koga, the Poisonous Ninja Master ====================================  Save before you attempt to battle Koga. Thanks to the fact that most of his Pokemon are immune to one of their only weaknesses because of their Ability, the fact that Poison now runs off of the Attack stat instead of Special (it was that way in RBY, changed in GSC), and the fact that Koga's signature move, Toxic, will never lose the double poison effect until the battle ends, he's a LOT HARDER than before. Of course, this is the only boss in which you might actually need to do some preparing for, so...  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Poliwhirl |  38 |   Machamp  |  39 |     Muk    |  39 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgeot  |  40 |   Flareon  |  38 |  Mr. Mime  |  40 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Koga's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Koffing   |  37 |     Muk    |  39 |  Koffing   |  37 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Weezing   |  43 | o------------o-----o  Money: 4300  Koffing and Weezing sport Levitate, which makes them immune to all direct Ground-type damage. This means that their only weakness is Psychic, and most Psychic-types have very low Defense, which means Sludge will eat them for breakfast. Luckily, Psychic-types are much faster than Poison-types, so you should hope that your speed will be enough to deliver a OHKO.  Muk has a Ground weakness, but it has very high Defense and knows Acid Armor (Defense +2) to boot, so stick with the above plan.  Remember: If you become poisoned by Toxic, its effect stays until the battle ends. However, the double damage counter starts over if you switch out. Heal it as soon as you possibly can. If you can't, frequently switch out so the poison doesn't do too much damage.  Beat Koga and you will earn the Soulbadge, the ability to use Surf out of battle, and TM06, Toxic.  ========================================================================== 7. Enter the Center, Even More Bad Guys, a Former Gym, and the Sixth Badge ==========================================================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * At long last, enter Saffron City. * Stop Team Rocket once again. * Defeat the master of Saffron's former Gym. * Earn your sixth Badge.  Now that you have Surf, Fly to Lavender Town. Head to Silence Bridge and go south until you see the item ball you couldn't get before. In it is TM48, Skill Swap.  =============== 7a. Tea For You ===============  We're finally ready to get into the one city we've been blocked out of until now: Saffron City. We have four entry points (Cerulean, Lavender, Vermilion, and Celadon). Vermilion's the easiest way to find everything, so fly there. Head north out of the city and continue until you get to the gate house. Try to go in and the guard will immediately steal the Tea from within your bag. He'll mentally teleport its goodness to the three other guards, so they will all let you pass freely into Saffron City.  =================================================== 7b. Saffron City - Shining, Golden Land of Commerce ===================================================  Team Rocket took over Saffron City, and you'll find Grunts walking freely in the streets. You'll have to dispose of them yourself, but... not yet.  The Pokemon Center is to your left if you entered from Vermilion. If you didn't, it's in the southwest corner of the city.  East of there is Mr. Psychic's house. Talk to him, and he'll give you (surprise, surprise) TM29, Psychic. Don't use it right away on your Psychic- type, as most (if not all) of them will learn it on their own if they haven't already.  As we head east and circle around, we come across Silph Corporation. There's a Grunt who's sleeping on the job next to the entrance. He won't be this way until you beat Koga, so if you haven't done that yet (which means you haven't been following my walkthrough, pseudo-shame on you), go do it now.  Stay out of there. We'll be going there very shortly, but not quite yet!  Take note of the Grunts blocking the doorways to the two houses in the northwest corner of the city.  Head around the buildings and you'll find the Fighting Dojo and Saffron's Gym. Also ignore these, as they are not important right now. The Pokemon Fan Club lies south of these. This is where Trainer fanboys gather and spill random, nonsensical babble about how totally freaking cool Trainer X is. Your job is to link up with your friends and beat the crap out of them several times over. This way, they'll move from the lower area to the desolate, barren area up top and rave about how awesome _you_ are. I'd rather have someone talk about how cool _I_ am than some other guy, so it sounds like a good deal to me.  West of there is the PokeMart. Let's see what they've got for sale.  o---------------------------o Wait, what? What happened to the Ultra Balls? |  SAFFRON CITY  SHOP LIST  | I suppose they figured that you'd come here first o---------------------------o and beat a couple things even though you're not |  Great Ball.........$600  | supposed to, so they provided a sucky item list. |  Hyper Potion......$1200  | It could be argued that they swapped it for the |  Revive............$1500  | Hyper Potion, which heals 200 HP when used. They |  Full Heal..........$600  | still don't hold a candle to the very cheap, very |  Escape Rope........$550  | effective Lemonade that heals 80 HP for a measly |  Max Repel..........$700  | 350 money. Besides, you won't even _need_ to use o---------------------------o a Hyper Potion until you're much higher level.  Well, that's all for the tour of Saffron. You can enter Silph Co. now.  ============= 7c. Silph Co. =============  Enter and view the spiffy FPV. The remixed music sounds awesome, no?  The goal of this dungeon is to get the Card Key, which will open any and all doors you may find throughout this dungeon, and save Silph Co.'s president from Team Rocket. The only problem is that this place is infested with Grunts and Scientists. Oh, and the fact that there are 10 floors to explore.  Lucky for you, you don't _have_ to explore them all. In reality, you only need to go to four of them. That's _such_ a waste of experience, money, and items, though. I have faith in you. You can handle it.  Team Rocket's not going to whoop themselves, so let's get going, shall we?  Go in the elevator and go to the 11th floor. You'll be able to see the President, but he's blocked off and you can't get to him. Head south and beat the Grunt in your path for some practice annihilating these clowns.  Team Rocket Grunt Rattata, Lv.25 (x3); Zubat, Lv.25; Ekans, Lv.25 Money: 800  Sigh... still jokes after all this time. You'd think they would have at least tried to raise their monotonous Pokemon, or at least use something different.  Keep going, get the Zinc, then head to the fifth floor. See that weird square thing? That's a teleporter, and it will take you to another teleporter. Most of the time it's on another floor, but that's not going to help much because most of the doors are locked. Don't step on them even _after_ you get the Card Key; it's still easier to manually ascend the building.  Team Rocket Grunt                Juggler Dalton                  ^_________^ <3 Hypno, Lv.33                     Kadabra, Lv.29; Mr. Mime, Lv.29 Money: 1056                      Money: 1160  Scientist Beau Magneton, Lv.26; Koffing, Lv.26; Weezing, Lv.26; Magnemite, Lv.26 Money: 1248  Team Rocket Grunt Arbok, Lv.33 Money: 1056  To get the Card Key, you'll have to take the teleporter, then take it back. Repeat this process to be able to leave.  Unlock the door to the left. Collect TM01, Focus Punch, and go back. Go up a bit and get the Protein behind the door.  The pacing guy's part of Giovanni's section of the Fame Checker.  Go to the second floor. Head right, and south.  Team Rocket Grunt Golbat, Lv.25; Zubat, Lv.25 (x3); Raticate, Lv.25 Money: 800  Team Rocket Grunt Cubone, Lv.29; Zubat, Lv.29 Money: 928  Unlock the top door. There's a Move Tutor here who will teach Thunder Wave.  Unlock the bottom door and beat on the faker.  Scientist Connor Grimer, Lv.26; Weezing, Lv.26 (x2); Koffing, Lv.26 Money: 1248  Then head all the way to the right.  Scientist Jerry Magnemite, Lv.28; Voltorb, Lv.28; Magneton, Lv.28 Money: 1344  Go to the fourth floor. Skip the third one, we'll come back later.  Straight down and find a Rocket.  Team Rocket Grunt Ekans, Lv.28; Zubat, Lv.28; Cubone, Lv.28 Money: 896  Get your new TM41, Torment, and go back. Follow the path and find battle #2.  Team Rocket Grunt Machop, Lv.29; Drowzee, Lv.29 Money: 928  Head all the way left and open the door for a Full Heal, Max Revive, and an Escape Rope. Go back to the Grunt and head north of him. Unlock the door and battle.  Scientist Rodney Electrode, Lv.33 Money: 1584  We've cleared the fifth floor already, so head to the sixth floor.  Team Rocket Grunt Machop, Lv.29; Machoke, Lv.29 Money: 928  Head all the way left and down.  Scientist Taylor Voltorb, Lv.25; Magneton, Lv.25; Magnemite, Lv.25; Koffing, Lv.25 (x2) Money: 1200  Surely you can see the HP Up and X Special. Get them, then take the low path.  Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.28 (x2); Golbat, Lv.28 Money: 896  Floor clear. Advance to the seventh floor.  Team Rocket Grunt Cubone, Lv.29 (x2) Money: 928  Team Rocket Grunt Raticate, Lv.26; Zubat, Lv.26; Golbat, Lv.26; Rattata, Lv.26 Money: 832  Aren't you already sick of this place? I am. Go to the path and follow it to the end for a Calcium and a battle.  Scientist Joshua Electrode, Lv.29; Muk, Lv.29 Money: 1392  Go back to near the stairs. Open the first door and pick up TM08, Bulk Up. Open door number two and have your eighteenth battle since entering (if you've been following this walkthrough).  Team Rocket Grunt Sandshrew, Lv.29; Sandslash, Lv.29 Money: 928  Floor clear. The eighth floor awaits. Hey, look down.  Team Rocket Grunt Raticate, Lv.26; Arbok, Lv.26; Golbat, Lv.26; Koffing, Lv.26 Money: 832  Follow the path, take a right. Unlock the door, get the Iron, talk to the Scientist (he's part of Giovanni's section of the Fame Checker), go back, go left.  Team Rocket Grunt Weezing, Lv.28; Koffing, Lv.28; Golbat, Lv.28 Money: 896  Go up for another battle.  Scientist Parker Grimer, Lv.29; Electrode, Lv.29 Money: 1392  Floor clear. Only three more left (9, 10, and 3 - what were you thinking?).  Unlock the doors or go all the way right and down for this guy.  Scientist Ed Voltorb, Lv.28; Koffing, Lv.28; Magneton, Lv.28 Money: 1344  Go up, left, and down.  Team Rocket Grunt Golbat, Lv.28; Drowzee, Lv.28; Hypno, Lv.28 Money: 896  Open the door and go left to a lady who will let you take nap (Pokemon Center). Then unlock the north door and waste another Grunt.  Team Rocket Grunt Drowzee, Lv.28; Grimer, Lv.28; Machop, Lv.28 Money: 896  Go back and heal, then go to the tenth floor. Head left.  Scientist Travis Magnemite, Lv.29; Koffing, Lv.29 Money: 1392  Head south for another battle. Gotta do it before you get the 3 rewards below.  Team Rocket Grunt Machoke, Lv.33 Money: 1056  Pick up the Carbos, Rare Candy, and Ultra Ball, and you're ready for the last floor. Go back to the ninth floor and heal, then take the elevator (or walk) to the third floor. Head south.  Team Rocket Grunt Raticate, Lv.28 (x2); Hypno, Lv.28 Money: 896  Open the two doors, pick up the Hyper Potion you probably still don't really need, and fight one of the last battles in this dungeon.  Scientist Jose Electrode, Lv.29; Weezing, Lv.29 Money: 1392  Take the teleporter to the right, in the room you just left.  Save your game. Enter Gary's line of sight, and he will challenge you... again.  ================= 7d. Gary Battle 6 =================  Aw, man...  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Poliwhirl |  41 |   Machamp  |  41 |     Muk    |  41 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgeot  |  41 |   Flareon  |  40 |  Mr. Mime  |  43 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeot......37|Pidgeot......37|Pidgeot......37| |Gyarados.....35|Exeggcute....38|Growlithe....38| |Alakazam.....35|Alakazam.....35|Alakazam.....35| |Exeggcute....38|Growlithe....35|Gyarados.....35| |Charizard....40|Blastoise....40|Venusaur.....40| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 1400  Pidgeotto has finally evolved into Pidgeot, and it still isn't very much of a  threat. Pidgeot never is, and will continue to suck throughout its career on Gary's team.  Being a basic, able-to-evolve Pokemon just doesn't cut it anymore, now that we're reaching the halfway point in levels. Both Growlithe and Exeggcute will fall very quickly to basic type matching.  Alakazam may be super fast and have super Special Attack to match, but it's still lacking in Defense. Snorlax would be ideal here, but if you don't have one handy, a good Ground type like Marowak or Dugtrio can get the job done with their high Attack.  Gyarados is still packed with a menacing Leer attack, which means use Electric. Seriously, you should either have an Electric-type or at least an Electric-type attack by now in use. Just because I don't doesn't mean you don't have to. v_v  And then there's the fully evolved starter. Venusaur's no threat, just type match and a winner is you. Blastoise can be treated the same way. Charizard's the only one you really have to look out for, unless you've got someone that knows Rock Throw/Slide to pick on that nifty double weakness to Rock. Flamethrower's quite strong, and will kill your weak Pokemon one-shot style.  Still, it shouldn't take a whole lot of strategy to send him packing.  Talk to the man and he'll give you a free Lv.25 Lapras. Unless you've gone ahead, this Lapras is the very first Ice-type you've seen IN THE ENTIRE GAME.  Took 'em long enough.

Ok, I lied. Nidoqueen isn't strong at all. Use Ground attacks for everyone but Rhyhorn. To use Grass or Water on that thing should be SOP by now.  Defeat him, and all traces of Team Rocket will vanish from Saffron City. Talk to the president and he'll give you the Master Ball as thanks for being a hero. This nifty little item will catch _any_ wild Pokemon without fail. Since depositing your Poke Balls for safe keeping is no longer an option, you have to be extra careful not to accidentally use it.  The Wierdo suggests that you attach the Master Ball to one of your Pokemon. I don’t know why I didn’t think of this before. It’s a good idea.   Remember those two blocked doors on the northwest side of town? You can go there now.  The one on top is Copycat's house. If you talk to Copycat with a Poke Doll in your inventory, she'll teach Mimic to your Pokemon. The one on bottom is a house with a boy who thinks that Copycat is cute and a girl writing a letter.  Yeah, sure. Go heal if you need to, then get to the Fighting Dojo.  ===================== 7f. The Fighting Dojo =====================  Long ago, the Fighting Dojo and the current Saffron City Gym shared Gym status. Then Sabrina and her Psychic posse came along and thoroughly spanked the holy gods out of everyone here and claimed Sabrina's Gym as the one true Gym.  That Gym is next door, and it's our next destination. First things first.  Black Belt Hitoshi                             Black Belt Hideki Machop, Lv.31; Mankey, Lv.31; Primeape, Lv.31  Machop, Lv.32; Machoke, Lv.32 Money: 744                                     Money: 768  Black Belt Mike                                Black Belt Aaron Mankey, Lv.31 (x2); Primeape, Lv.31            Primeape, Lv.36 Money: 744                                     Money: 864  Black Belt Koichi Hitmonlee, Lv.37; Hitmonchan, Lv.37 Money: 888  After defeating Koichi, he'll allow you to take either Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan as your prize since he can't give you a Badge (because Sabrina stomped him and took away the Gym status).  Hitmonlee has limited moves, but has much higher Attack than Hitmonchan. Both are Fighting-types, so Attack is important (but that's not always the case). Hitmonchan can learn a variety of elemental punches, making him very versatile, but if you take a look at his Special Attack (which they all run off of), it's very, very low. However, he makes up for this with his decent Speed and overall average stats (excepting Sp.Atk).  To the Gym!  ==================== 7g. Saffron City Gym ====================  There are nine rooms in this Gym. There are no doors - only teleporters. You must use them in the correct order if you want to challenge Sabrina. None of the Gym Trainers here are required; all are optional. And once again, here's some bad art to help you get around Saffron City Gym.  o----------o----------o----------o  Step on a teleporter, signified by letters | N      E |  L    E  | M      H |  A-O, to be taken to that same letter. As |     1    |    2     |     3    |  you can see, all you have to do is take the | O      D |  K    F  | N      G |  teleporter directly north or south of the o----------o----------o----------o  one you just came from and you'll make it. | C      K |          | M      B |  If not, just take the lower left teleporter |     4    |    5     |     6    |  once you get into the upper left corner. | D      J |        O | L      C |  Since the path to Sabrina is so indirect, o----------o----------o----------o  I've numbered the rooms from 1-9.

Use physical attacks. Mr. Mime isn't that difficult, either. Just beat on it and it'll fall. Venomoth, while not Psychic in type, knows Psychic-type moves. Fire, Flying, or Psychic will do the trick. Alakazam is her power Pokemon - Psychic (the attack) is very strong and, when combined with Calm Mind, can deliver quick KOs. Destroy Sabrina and her Psychic-types to earn the Marshbadge, the ability to use Rock Smash out of battle, and TM04, Calm Mind.  ============================================================================ 8. Water to Fire, Raising the Dead, Pointless Quizzes, and the Seventh Badge ============================================================================  Major Objectives ----------------  * Surf across the ocean to Cinnabar City. * Restore life to an ancient friend. * Explore Pokemon Mansion. * Unlock the Gym's doors and make your way to its Leader. * Earn your seventh Badge.  There are two paths you can take, but Route 21's the quickest. Besides, Seafoam Islands are in the way, so taking the path from Fuchsia just isn't worth it.  That path is covered in the Seafoam Islands section.  =============== 8a. Return Home ===============  Fly to Pallet Town. Go to your mom and heal if need be. Get in the water and head south. The grass here only contains Tangela, so pick one up and be on your way. There aren't many Trainers here, and it's really nothing you've never seen before. Free experience, I guess.

Cinnabar Island - The Fiery Town of Burning Desire ======================================================  Welcome. This is a small, compact city. Since it's on an island, it'd have to be, but hey. There are only three items on our Things To Do list, and number one happens to be "check out the PokeMart."  The girl near the town sign is part of Blaine's section of the Fame Checker.  o---------------------------o | CINNABAR ISLAND SHOP LIST | o---------------------------o |  Ultra Ball........$1200  | A Saffron and Fuchsia hybrid. |  Great Ball.........$600  | |  Hyper Potion......$1200  | |  Revive............$1500  | |  Full Heal..........$600  | |  Escape Rope........$550  | |  Max Repel..........$700  | o---------------------------o  ================== 8c. Raise the Dead ==================  Go to the building to the left of the Pokemon Center. This is the Pokemon Lab, where scientists study various aspects about Pokemon.  Each room has things of note. The first room, to the right, contains an old man who will trade his Electrode for your Raichu. The woman across from him will trade her Tangela for your Venonat. This is a bad deal, as you can find all the Tangela you want just south of Pallet Town. Do it only if you're a completionist, or if you have a spare Venonat, I guess. It comes with a Stardust, but that's not exactly the best item ever.  In the second room, there's a Move Tutor who will teach your Pokemon Metronome.  In the third room is a guy who will trade his Seel for your Ponyta. You haven't even _seen_ a Ponyta yet, so you'll have to come back later. Also here is the Resurrection Machine, which is run by a weird doctor. Give him either the Helix Fossil, Dome Fossil, or Old Amber. Leave the Lab and come back here for your new Lv.5 Omanyte, Kabuto, or Aerodactyl.  =================== 8d. Pokemon Mansion ===================  o---------------------------------o | POKEMON MANSION POKEMON LISTING | o---------------------------------o | Rattata       (Rare)            | As you can see, Poison- and Fire-types | Raticate      (Uncommon)        | thrive here. Ditto's back, so if you didn't | Ditto         (Rare)            | get one back by Fuchsia, be sure to get one | Koffing       (Common, FR)      | now. The goal of this place is to get the | Koffing       (Uncommon, LG)    | Secret Key, which will unlock the doors to | Weezing       (Rare, FR)        | Cinnabar's Gym. By turning various switches | Vulpix        (Rare, LG) | on and off, you can create a path that will | Growlithe     (Uncommon, FR)    | lead you right. There are also some items | Grimer        (Uncommon, FR)    | and Trainers for you to encounter, so enter | Grimer        (Common, LG)      | the mansion, check out the FPV, and start. | Muk           (Rare, LG)        | o---------------------------------o  Keep to the left side and go up. Stand next to the upper of the small rocks, face it, and press A to get a Moon Stone (only one more left!). Follow the path a bit (ignore the stairs for now) and go right for an Escape Rope.  Go all the way left for a Trainer.  Youngster Johnson Ekans, Lv.33 (x2); Raticate, Lv.34  Money: 544  The switches are all hidden inside statues you'll find throughout this dungeon. One of these statues are next to Johnson. Hit the switch and go back to where you got the Escape Rope; go through the now-opened door for a Protein. Go back to the main area and head up the stairs, then up the stairs in front of you.  Go down for a Max Potion and a battle.  Burglar Simon                            o------------------------o Ninetales, Lv.38                        / These guys are loaded! / Money: 3344                            o------------------------o  On the table is a book. Each of these contains out-of-order entries regarding the discovery of Mew and the story behind Mewtwo's birth. While it's not mandatory to completing the quest, I just think it's something fun to do.  Diary: Feb. 6 Mew gave birth. We named the newborn Mewtwo.  Go back downstairs. Straight south is another fight.  Burglar Arnie Charmander, Lv.34; Charmeleon, Lv.34 Money: 2992  Leave that room, go down, enter the gray area, and head up for a Zinc. In the room west of there is one of the diary entries about Mew.  Diary: July 10 We christened the newly discovered Pokemon, Mew.  Follow the path up and right. The path will split; the north room houses another diary entry.  Diary: July 5 Guyana, South America A new Pokemon was discovered deep in the jungle.  Go to the far right of this room for a Calcium. Leave, go back to the stairs, and hit the switch. Go right and up to a room that was previously locked, and go up the stairs there.  Head right as far as you can go for an Iron. Hit the switch and have a battle.  Scientist Braydon Magnemite, Lv.33; Magneton, Lv.33; Voltorb, Lv.33 Money: 1584  Go all the way right. Stand on the top row, one space from the wall. Face right and press A for a hidden Rare Candy. Go down and down the stairs for an HP Up. Go back upstairs and go to the broken floor. Fall down the _left_ side (the right side yields nothing but wasted time as you'll have to redo things).  Scientist Ted Electrode, Lv.29; Weezing, Lv.29 Money: 1392  Go right and get the Carbos. Don't follow the path anymore; if you leave through the door, you'll exit the building, and when you re-enter, you'll be at the entrance - not the exit you just left from. Instead, go downstairs.  Follow the path, ignoring the rooms and blocked doors. A Full Restore awaits. Go into the room that you passed and find another diary entry.  Diary: Sept. 1 Mewtwo is far too powerful. We have failed to curb its vicious tendencies...  Oh, and there's a battle, too.  Burglar Lewis Growlithe, Lv.34; Ponyta, Lv.34 Money: 2992  Press the switch and leave this room. Go left and enter the now-open corridor. If you enter through the middle, you'll get jumped from _really_ far away.  Scientist Ivan Magnemite, Lv.34; Electrode, Lv.34 Money: 1632  Go into the north room and stand in the southeast corner. Take one step up and two steps left. Face right and press A for an Elixir.  Hit the switch and enter the adjacent room. Pick up TM14, Blizzard, and continue. The Secret Key lies on a table in the next room, and TM22, Solarbeam, is on the ground just south of it.  This marks the end of Pokemon Mansion. Summary of the diary entries:  Very shortly after discovering Mew in South America, they impregnate it and it has a baby, which they call Mewtwo. Unfortunately for them, Mewtwo isn't as happy and lovey as they'd like, and he up and kills everyone. Now Mewtwo's gone, and no one really knows where (and the only people who do know are dead).  Something like that. Use the Escape Rope you found and get out of here.  ======================= 8e. Cinnabar Island Gym =======================  We're almost there. Blaine has tons of underlings for you to battle. Fortunately for you, you don't have to fight any of them. In the upper left corner of each room is a quiz machine that will ask you a question. If you get it right, the door will open (you can still battle the Trainer if you want). If  you get it wrong, the battle is forced, and the door opens on defeat. Ready?  Caterpie evolves into Metapod? - Yes  Burglar Quinn Growlithe, Lv.36; Vulpix, Lv.36; Ninetales, Lv.36 Money: 3168  Super Nerd Erik                                o-----------------------o Vulpix, Lv.36 (x2); Ninetales, Lv.36          / No quiz for this guy. / Money: 864                                   o-----------------------o  There are nine certified Pokemon League Badges? - No  Super Nerd Avery Ponyta, Lv.34; Charmander, Lv.34; Vulpix, Lv.34; Growlithe, Lv.34 Money: 816  Poliwag evolves three times? - No  Burglar Ramon             Poliwag evolves into Poliwhirl, which evolves into Ponyta, Lv.41             Poliwrath OR Politoed - not both.

Take the long path out of the gym and Heal. You may want to buy one or two Burn Heals for insurance against Blaine's fiery onslaught.  ====================================== 8f. Blaine, the Hotheaded Quiz Master! ======================================  Remember when I said it was important to talk to _everything_? Behind Blaine is a photograph of him and Mr. Fuji. This photograph is part of both Blaine's and Mr. Fuji's sections of the Fame Checker.

All his Pokemon know it, and it's the second most powerful Fire attack in existence. It's slightly inaccurate, but it will connect most of the time, and it hurts. If it burns you, it's a plus; you'll probably die from Fire Blast next turn. If you've got someone that knows Rain Dance, use it. It prevents you from being burned, and will severely hinder Blaine's Pokemon's Fire-based attacks. This is the first boss I actually had trouble with. Curse you, Fire Blast! Winning this [difficult] battle earns you the Volcanobadge, the ability to use Waterfall out of battle, and TM38, Fire Blast.  Leave the Gym and Bill will talk to you. He'll ask if you want to go to this place called One Island way down south. If you want to go there, say yes. If you'd rather keep going with your adventure, say no. He'll wait in the Pokemon Center here until you say yes. I'm going to continue on as if you said no.  If you leave, you won't be able to come back for a while.  =================== 9. The Eighth Badge ===================  There are no extra little tidbits, no people to save, Pokemon to catch, or anything like that in order to get the eighth Badge. There's only one Gym left, and it's in Viridian City. Onward!  ===================== 9a. Viridian City Gym =====================  The Leader's returned, but no one really knows who exactly he is. To make matters worse, he's holed himself in the far corner of his huge Gym. The direction-forcers are back, and Gym Trainers are scattered all over the place. It doesn't take a genius to figure out, but it can get a bit frustrating.  If you want, head left and beat the Trainer, then follow the path back to the beginning.  Tamer Cole                             Black Belt Kiyo Arbok, Lv.39; Tauros, Lv.39            Machoke, Lv.43 Money: 1560                            Money: 1032  Cooltrainer Samuel Sandslash, Lv.37 (x2); Rhyhorn, Lv.37; Nidorino, Lv.39; Nidoking, Lv.39 Money: 1404  More optional battles are in the middle.  Cooltrainer Yuji Sandslash, Lv.38; Graveler, Lv.38 (x2); Onix, Lv.38; Marowak, Lv.38 Money: 1368  Black Belt Atsushi                     Tamer Jason Machop, Lv.40; Machoke, Lv.40          Rhyhorn, Lv.43 Money: 960                             Money: 1720  Your first mandatory battle is the Trainer that lies north of the above three.  Cooltrainer Warren Marowak, Lv.37 (x2); Rhyhorn, Lv.38; Nidorina, Lv.39; Nidoqueen, Lv.39 Money: 1404  Go around him and battle.  Black Belt Takashi Machoke, Lv.38 (x2); Machop, Lv.38 Money: 912  Go back to the beginning and take the right side direction-forcer pointing up.  Then go around Takashi, past Samuel, and you'll be face-to-face with Viridian City's Gym Leader.  Note that if you leave at any time, all Trainers go back to their original spots, which means you'll have to go around Warren and under Takashi to get to the Gym Leader.  ========================== 9b. The Mystery Gym Leader ==========================  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Poliwhirl |  45 |   Machamp  |  46 |     Muk    |  44 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgeot  |  45 |   Flareon  |  44 |  Mr. Mime  |  46 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Giovanni's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Rhyhorn   |  45 |  Rhyhorn   |  50 | Nidoqueen  |  44 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Nidoking  |  45 |  Dugtrio   |  42 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 5000  Two words: Use Water. Giovanni's pathetic as far as Gym Leaders go. You'd think he'd have a bigger selection, or at the very least evolved both his Rhyhorn (which evolves at Lv.42). His signature attack is Earthquake, which has no added effects, but is very powerful and very accurate. Getting through the second of two yawner Gyms gets you the Earthbadge and TM26, Earthquake.  Talk to Giovanni after the battle to make him vanish forever. Use the Itemfinder where he stood to get the Macho Brace.  Talk to the entrance guy to add him to Giovanni's section of the Fame Checker.  ================== 10. The Elite Four ==================  Congratulations! With the Earthbadge in your possession, you're ready to take on the Elite Four. Go heal and leave west from the city to Route 22. Go north through the patch of grass and save your game.  ================== 10a. Gary Battle 7 ==================  Gary will appear if you try to travel west. He's had eight Badges for a while now, and he wants to warm up for the Pokemon League with a battle against you. His intentions are good, I suppose, but hey. Let's cream him anyway.  My Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Poliwhirl |  47 |   Machamp  |  46 |     Muk    |  44 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Pidgeot  |  45 |   Flareon  |  44 |  Mr. Mime  |  47 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeot......47|Pidgeot......47|Pidgeot......47| |Rhyhorn......45|Rhyhorn......45|Rhyhorn......45| |Gyarados.....45|Exeggcute....45|Growlithe....45| |Alakazam.....47|Alakazam.....47|Alakazam.....47| |Exeggcute....45|Growlithe....45|Gyarados.....45| |Charizard....53|Blastoise....53|Venusaur.....53| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Money: 1908  Ok, hold on. What's up with people and not evolving their Rhyhorn? Both he and Giovanni could have had mega-strong Rhydon (who are _still_ double weak to both Water and Grass, mind you), but no. They're just fine being weak.  Pidgeot's been eating what's left of Raticate's Poke-Wheaties. Can you tell? It may be ten levels higher than it was in our last encounter, but it's still weak as ever. It knows Featherdance, so keep your physical hitters away from it. By the time you're finished reading this sentence, Pidgeot should be dead. If not, go back and train, you're weak ;[  Surf Rhyhorn and be done with it. Thunder[bolt] Gyarados and make it die.  He should have evolved Growlithe and Exeggcute by now. Your Pokemon should have a huge advantage in power as well as speed, so type match and you'll do fine.  When battling against Alakazam, act is if you're under Torment (can't use the same move twice in a row). It's way fast and still knows Disable, so alternate your attacks so you don't lose a turn.  Rock-types will work the best against Charizard, as it defends against both Charizard's types and can deliver 4x damage to it. Water-types _will_ work, but doesn't defend and do as much damage as a Rock-type [attack]. For Blastoise and Venusaur, just type match. Use Electric for Blastoise and Fire for Venusaur.  After the win, Gary leaves, leaving you to head to Victory Road.  =================== 10b. Indigo Plateau ===================  To get through Victory Road, the only HM you'll need is Strength. It's also long, so it's suggested to restock before entering. You also might want to bring all those [Max] Ether/Elixir you've hopefully been saving.  Before you actually _get_ to Victory Road, you must first show off all your Badges so the guards will let you through.  After you show off the Thunderbadge, check for a dark green spot to the left of the wall for a Leppa Berry.  After showing the Soulbadge, you should see a square of land that sticks out like a sore thumb (it's quite large). Stand in the lower right corner and take two steps left and one step up. Press A for a Max Ether.  When you get to the grassy area, stand between the statues and press A for a hidden Ultra Ball.  o----------------------------o  After going up a little, you should see a 3x4 | ROUTE 23  POKEMON LISTING  |  rectangle patch of short grass. There is an o----------------------------o  Aspear Berry in there - search for the dark | Spearow      (Common)      |  spot (it sticks out). | Fearow       (Uncommon)    | | Mankey       (Common)      |  After showing the Volcanobadge, go up and to | Primeape     (Rare)        |  the right a little bit. There's a Full | Ekans        (Common, FR)  |  Restore hidden in the lone rock. | Arbok        (Rare, FR)    | | Sandshrew    (Common, LG)  |  Just before entering Victory Road, stand one | Sandslash    (Rare, LG)    |  square southwest of the left statue. Face up o----------------------------o  and press A for a Sitrus Berry.  ================= 10c. Victory Road =================  o--------------------------------o  Are you ready? This is a long dungeon that | VICTORY ROAD  POKEMON  LISTING |  is filled with strong Pokemon and the best o--------------------------------o  Trainers in all of Kanto, and if you want | Machop     (Common)            |  to have any chance of beating the Elite 4, | Machoke    (Uncommon)          |  you should have no problem at all beating | Onix       (Uncommon)          |  them. Enough babble, let's go already! | Golbat     (Uncommon)          | | Mankey     (Common)            |  Begin by using Strength on the boulder to | Primeape   (Rare)              |  your left. Push it down, then all the way | Marowak    (Rare) (later)      |  to your right. Push it up, then push it all | Arbok      (Uncommon, FR)      |  the way right. Push it two squares up so | Sandslash  (Uncommon, LG)      |  you're able to push it down after pushing o--------------------------------o  it one square right. Go back to the beginning, up the stairs, and to the right. If you go up from the left side, you'll be jumped.  Cooltrainer Naomi Persian, Lv.42; Ponyta, Lv.42; Rapidash, Lv.42; Vulpix, Lv.42; Ninetales, Lv.42 Money: 1512  Go to the right and follow the path to see two item balls. You can only get one at a time, so if you want the other one, leave the dungeon and come back for it. The left ball is a Rare Candy; the top one is TM02, Dragon Claw. Stand in the spot that's three squares to the right of the TM, face left, and press A for a Full Restore.  Now go left and down the stairs. Go right and press A on the rock for a hidden Ultra Ball. Continue on the path and you'll probably get jumped.  Cooltrainer Rolando Raticate, Lv.42; Ivysaur, Lv.42; Wartortle, Lv.42; Charmeleon, Lv.42; Charizard, Lv.42 Money: 1512  Go up the ladder and head down. You'll see a boulder, so push it two squares left, two squares down, and two squares left again. The blockade will vanish, so go up the stairs and head right to (maybe) get jumped.  Black Belt Daisuke Machoke, Lv.43 (x2); Machop, Lv.43 Money: 1032  Go down the first stairs and go left for TM37, Sandstorm. Follow the path right, then around the stairs and get the Full Heal.  Tamer Vincent Persian, Lv.44; Golduck, Lv.44 Money: 1760  Go north and then east for another battle.  Juggler Vincent Mr. Mime, Lv.48 Money: 1920  Pick up TM07, Hail, then go back to where Vincent was circling and go up the stairs. There's a boulder to push, but let's get that item first.  Cooltrainer George Exeggutor, Lv.42; Electrode, Lv.42; Cloyster, Lv.42; Arcanine, Lv.42; Sandslash, Lv.42 Money: 1512  The item is... a Max Revive. Spiffy! Okay, go back to the boulder and push it two steps up and all the way left. Go down a bit and get TM50, Overheat, then go back and push the boulder one square down. Push it four squares left. If you want a battle and a Guard Special, take the ladder (but you'll have to come back and push the boulder from its initial location).  Pokemaniac Dawson Charmeleon, Lv.40; Lapras, Lv.40; Lickitung, Lv.40 Money: 1920  Otherwise (or if you've already done it, push it three squares down and one right to make the obstacle vanish. Go back to where the boulder initially was, go left a bit and up the stairs for a fight.  Cooltrainer Alexa Clefairy, Lv.42; Jigglypuff, Lv.42; Persian, Lv.42; Dewgong, Lv.42; Chansey, Lv.42 Money: 1512  Now follow the path and go down the stairs for two more fights.  Cooltrainer Colby Kingler, Lv.41; Poliwhirl, Lv.42; Tentacruel, Lv.42; Seadra, Lv.42; Blastoise, Lv.43 Money: 1548  Cooltrainer Caroline Bellsprout, Lv.42; Weepinbell, Lv.42; Victreebel, Lv.42; Paras, Lv.42; Parasect, Lv.42 Money: 1512  Head to the right and you will see a boulder next to a hole. Push the boulder into the hole, then push yourself into it. Push the boulder all the way to the left. Go back to the right and go up the small stairs.  Juggler Nelson Drowzee, Lv.41; Hypno, Lv.41; Kadabra, Lv.41 (x2) Money: 1640  Now go right and up the ladder. Straight up is a double battle.  Cool Couple Ray & Tyra Nidoqueen/Nidoking, Lv.45 Money: 2160  Go down the ladder to find Victory Road's exit as well as a Move Tutor who will teach one of your Pokemon how to use the move Double-Edge.  Leave and follow the path until you're in the open. Go left. Stand in the lower left corner and take one step right. Face up and press A for a Lum Berry.  Stay on the left side and follow the path up (it's a dead end anyway). Eh... how to explain this? It will loop around the right side, and the rock things form a V shape. Go into this V, take a step up and face down. Press A for a Max Elixir. Use the Itemfinder for assistance if you can't find it.  One last thing of note: Each Pokemon with the highest level on each of the Elite Four's teams will be equipped with a Sitrus Berry, which will restore 30 HP when they drop below 1/3. It's not much, but if someone knows Thief or Covet, they can steal it. Berries are rare in this game! >_< ========================= 10d. Elite Four - Lorelei =========================  Lorelei is first in line, and she uses Ice-type Pokemon. One could argue that it's to make up for the extreme lack of Ice-types you've seen up to this point (Victory Road helped a little, but there aren't many Ice-types anyway).  Lorelei's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Dewgong   |  52 |  Slowbro   |  52 |  Cloyster  |  51 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Jynx    |  54 |   Lapras   |  54 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 5400  o---------o  Moveset: Surf, Hail, Safeguard, Ice Beam | Dewgong | o---------o  Ability: Thick Fat (Fire and Ice damage halved)  Lorelei should be thanking the future right about now, because the only way she could possibly be annoying is because of attacks that didn't exist in the old days. Unless you have a weakness in play, she'll lead with Hail, then Safeguard to protect her party from Special Conditions (including confusion) for five turns. If you wish to play defensive, use a Water-type to resist both Surf and Ice Beam. Make sure that if you do, have an attack that will damage Dewgong (A Lapras with Thunderbolt is a perfect example). You're going to want to put Special Conditions on the rest of Lorelei's team if your team isn't powerful enough to kill them in one or two shots, so try to stall with your Water-type until two turns before Safeguard drops. Switch out, then kill Dewgong. Then switch to whoever you want to inflict the Special Condition.  o---------o  Moveset: Amnesia, Yawn, Ice Beam, Surf | Slowbro | o---------o  Ability: Oblivious (Prevents attraction)  I don't know if it's just me, but Slowbro just does _not_ like to attack. It repeatedly alternated between Yawn and Amnesia for about 10 rounds before deciding to Ice Beam me. It took a while for me to figure out its fourth move (and even longer for Cloyster, and even _longer_ for Jynx, but that was due to silliness). Slowbro has lots of HP, very high Defense, and has the ability to raise its decent Special Defense to obscene levels with Amnesia. The key here is a fast kill with a quick Electric type. If you don't have one, try using Sleep Powder or some other disarming attack to stop Slowbro from powering up.  o----------o  Moveset: Hail, Spikes, Protect, Dive | Cloyster | o----------o  Ability: Shell Armor (Prevents critical hits)  Be careful here. Only stopping to refresh Hail, Cloyster will use Protect every round until it runs out of PP (he did against me, anyway). Put it to sleep or use weak attacks until it starts to use Dive. Power hit it when Hail runs out; Cloyster will waste a turn to get it going again. Cloyster's got phenomenal  Defense because of that hard shell, so special attacks are the key. Electricity quickly comes to mind. Gee, I wonder why?  o------o  Moveset: Lovely Kiss, Ice Punch, Doubleslap, Attract | Jynx | o------o  Ability: Oblivious (Prevents attraction)  Jynx follows a very simple attack pattern. Lovely Kiss, then Ice Punch you to death. Most of my Pokemon were female, so it took a _very_ long time for me to figure out her fourth attack was Attract. She avoided it like the Plague, and wouldn't even do it after I Tormented her. Anyway, the Psychic-type in her gets rid of the Fighting weakness, so I suggest having a strong Fire-type do the job here. Remember: The Poke Flute will wake your Pokemon up, so save your items!  o--------o  Moveset: Confuse Ray, Body Slam, Surf, Ice Beam | Lapras | o--------o  Ability: Water Absorb (Healed by Water-type attacks)  Lapras has lots and lots of HP. At its level, it has a bit over 200 HP. Most Pokemon in their mid-50s have around 120-170 HP, if that puts it in perspective for you at all. It can be a trifle annoying, especially if Lorelei hasn't used up her Full Restores yet. This is the only of Lorelei's Pokemon that can actually do something about it if you decide to throw a Water-type at her. Keep in mind that Body Slam has a high chance of paralyzing you (30%, which _is_ high when most effect percentages are 10) and Confuse Ray has 100% accuracy. Disabling is also the key here, and the same techniques you employed against Slowbro can be used here.  Once you defeat Lorelei, move on to the next room.  ======================= 10e. Elite Four - Bruno =======================  Next up is the mighty Bruno, Fighting-type extraordinaire.  Bruno's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Onix    |  51 |    Onix    |  54 | Hitmonchan |  53 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o | Hitmonlee  |  53 |  Machamp   |  56 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 5600  o---------o  Moveset: Rock Tomb, Earthquake, Iron Tail, Roar | Onix 51 | o---------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  Surf. If you're too stupid to keep someone with an awesome move like Surf constantly on your team or don't want to use it, use any damage-dealing Grass- type move that isn't called Bullet Seed, Absorb, or Mega Drain instead.  o---------o  Moveset: Earthquake, Double-Edge, Iron Tail, Sand Tomb | Onix 54 | o---------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  See previous Onix strategy.  o------------o  Moveset: Rock Tomb, Sky Uppercut, Counter, Mach Punch | Hitmonchan | o------------o  Ability: Keen Eye (Prevents accuracy loss)  Fighting is weak to Flying, but use a special hitter instead. If you try to use Fly against it, he can still hit you with Sky Uppercut, and then Counter it next turn for double damage, or pick on your weakness with Rock Tomb. Someone like Alakazam or Hypno would be nice here. Just make sure that if you're using Hypno, you're using Psychic-type attacks.  o-----------o  Moveset: Brick Break, Mega Kick, Facade, Foresight | Hitmonlee | o-----------o  Ability: Limber (Prevents paralysis)  Not like you've set it up, but Brick Break will get rid of your Light Screen and Reflect. Mega Kick is inaccurate and powerful, and it hurts when it connects. It's a good thing that Hitmonlee doesn't get STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for it. It only has 5 PP, though. Drain them and you're out of the deep woods. Facade will double in base power (it'll be as strong as Mega Kick with almost perfect accuracy) if you inflict poison or burn on him. In short... don't do it :) He'll only use Foresight when he either runs out of PP for everything else or you slap a Ghost-type in his face, which lets him perform normal attacks on them.  o---------o  Moveset: Rock Tomb, Cross Chop, Scary Face, Bulk Up | Machamp | o---------o  Ability: Guts (Attack doubles if poisoned, burned, or paralyzed)  Bruno's Pokemon are all about the power, and Machamp is no exception. Cross Chop is the most powerful Fighting-type attack, and it can deal some serious damage if Machamp uses Bulk Up (ATK+1, DEF+1). But, like most Fighting Pokemon, it lacks in Special Defense. Bring back whatever Psychic damage-dealing Pokemon you've been using and lay waste to this four-armed beast. Scary Face will be used to slow you down so he can get the first strike, so switch to something that resists Cross Chop (Poison, Bug, or Ghost). If you can drain Cross Chop's PP, you're in the clear unless he's been abusing Bulk Up to power up Rock Tomb.  Once you defeat Bruno, move on to the next room.  ======================== 10f. Elite Four - Agatha ========================  We're halfway done. Hang in there! Agatha wants deep down to be a Ghost-type master, but Gastly's evolution is the only Ghost-type in Kanto. Alas. Therefore, she must take advantage of Gastly's final form, Gengar, and its other type, Poison. She utilizes a strategy similar to Koga's; annoy and drain life slowly.  Agatha's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Gengar   |  54 |  Haunter   |  54 |   Golbat   |  54 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Arbok    |  56 |   Gengar   |  58 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 5800  o-----------o  Moveset: Confuse Ray, Double Team, Toxic, Shadow Punch | Gengar 54 | o-----------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  This particular Gengar can be annoying if you're slow. It will confuse you to reduce your chance of attacking, and use Double Team to reduce your chance of landing a hit when you manage to break through confusion. Toxic is there to eat your HP away while you're sitting there trying to attack and failing. Umbreon with Faint Attack is this Gengar's worst nightmare, but at this point, you can't have an Umbreon yet. Just keep those Full Heals handy and just hit it until it dies.  o---------o  Moveset: Curse, Hypnosis, Dream Eater, Mean Look | Haunter | o---------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  With Curse at its disposal, Haunter's not going to live very long. If you can't already tell what its strategy is, it will Curse you, put you to sleep, then restore its HP from Curse with Dream Eater. Sometimes it'll trap you, but it's a rare occurrence from me. Most of this can be avoided, though, if you power hit Haunter on the first turn and hope it does Curse. Switch out to avoid the effect. Also, if it puts you to sleep, you can guess that Dream Eater's coming, so use the Poke Flute to wake yourself up and have Agatha miss a turn.  o--------o  Moveset: Confuse Ray, Air Cutter, Poison Fang, Bite | Golbat | o--------o  Ability: Inner Focus (Prevents flinching)  If Golbat had better Attack to take advantage of its attacks, I'd be slightly worried; all its attacks have added effects that can totally ruin a Pokemon. Air Cutter has a high critical hit ratio, Poison Fang has as _50%_ of adding _Toxiclike_ poison, and Bite can make you flinch. It's pretty fast, too, but I'm just making it sound lethal. If you have Ice-type attacks at your disposal, save them. Rock-types resist both Air Cutter and Poison Fang, so play defensive for a bit if you're in trouble. Use that time to heal your wounded Pokemon.  o-------o  Moveset: Sludge Bomb, Iron Tail, Bite, Screech | Arbok | o-------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  I kind of wish that some of these Ekans and Arbok that Trainers use would have Shed Skin instead of Intimidate... oh well. Keep the Ground-types away at first so they won't be hindered by Intimidate. Screech won't be used much, but it can help get that OHKO. Sludge Bomb is the strongest Poison-type attack there is, and it's got a high chance of poisoning you. If you've got a Magneton, go ahead and put it up against Arbok if you're having trouble; it resists Bite, double resists Iron Tail, and has immunity to Sludge Bomb. Screech doesn't affect Bite's damage because Bite runs off of Special Attack now. Psychic-types should also do well, but keep in mind they will take _lots_ of damage from Arbok's physical attacks due to the standard low Defense.  o-----------o  Moveset: Hypnosis, Sludge Bomb, Nightmare, Shadow Ball | Gengar 58 | o-----------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  This Gengar is different from the previous one because it doesn't waste time trying to annoy; it straight up tries to murder you. It's especially important to immediately wake yourself up if you get put to sleep, because Nightmare drains a quarter of your maximum HP between turns as long as your Pokemon is still sleeping and only needs to be used once as long as it's asleep. If you can burn Gengar to reduce damage from Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball, that'll help. It will also get a little damage in when you're spending a turn waking yourself up.  Once you defeat Agatha, move on to the next room.  ======================= 10g. Elite Four - Lance =======================  Automatically walk through the corridor and you'll see Lance, a user of dragon Pokemon. If you can't kill each of his pokemon in at most two hits, you're going to have lots of trouble here.  Lance's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Gyarados  |  56 | Aerodactyl |  58 | Dragonair  |  54 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o | Dragonite  |  60 | Dragonair  |  54 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 6000  o----------o  Moveset: Dragon Rage, Bite, Hyper Beam, Twister | Gyarados | o----------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  Since there's a higher chance you don't have an Electric-type on your team (I don't) than a Water-type, I'll actually post something other than a one-word strategy. Dragon Rage will always do 40 damage no matter what. Bite's no big deal, but Hyper Beam is. Each of Lance's Pokemon have this technique, and thankfully its power will remain at 150. Lance will have each of his Pokemon use Hyper Beam when you're damaged somewhat so you will die. After performing Hyper Beam, his Pokemon need to recharge for a turn. Remember that this recharge comes _before_ he has a chance to use an item, so if you knock him into the red the turn he uses Hyper Beam, don't heal if you survive; kill him!  o------------o  Moveset: Ancientpower, Hyper Beam, Wing Attack, Scary Face | Aerodactyl | o------------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  Aerodactyl will probably be your toughest challenge yet. It's got sky high Attack power and monster Speed. Ancientpower only has 5 PP, but it's got a 10% chance to boost all stats by 1 level. If this happens, start worrying. The last thing Aerodactyl needs is more Attack and Speed. Why Scary Face is present is really unknown to me. Chances are that _all_ of your Pokemon are going to be much, _much_ slower than Aerodactyl, so he's not going to waste time using it. A non-Ice Water-type will do the trick here; Water/Ice Pokemon will be destroyed by Ancientpower.  o-----------o  Moveset: Thunder Wave, Safeguard, Outrage, Hyper Beam | Dragonair | o-----------o  Ability: Shed Skin (1/3 chance to cure a Special Condition)  Well, it's no Arbok, but Dragonair will do. Don't bother with Special Conditions; Shed Skin will get rid of it in a turn or two. Both Lance's Dragonair have very similar movesets. Outrage is a terrible Dragon-type attack that causes self-confusion in two or three turns, so it's really nothing to worry about. Dragon is only weak to itself (Dragon) and Ice, so bust out the Dewgong you shouldn't have if you've been following this walkthrough or Lapras and lay some Ice-type smackdown on Dragonair. Don't waste it all, though; you'll want to deliver some quadra-style damage on his most powerful Pokemon.  o-----------o  Moveset: Outrage, Wing Attack, Safeguard, Hyper Beam | Dragonite | o-----------o  Ability: Inner Focus (Prevents flinching)  To be honest, Lance's Dragonite isn't anything special. It carries attacks you've seen before (and bad ones at that). Dragonite's Dragon/Flying, so guess what that means? Ice Beam and Blizzard will more than likely OHKO it. It _is_ Lv.60, though, so it's got a bit of power behind those bad attacks.  o-----------o  Moveset:  Safeguard, Outrage, Dragon Rage, Hyper Beam | Dragonair | o-----------o  Ability: Shed Skin (1/3 chance to cure a Special Condition)  I don't feel as if there's a real need for a strategy here. It's just like the other Dragonair, except with Dragon Rage instead of Thunder Wave (a stupid trade, but good news for you).  Once you defeat Lance, move on to the next room.  ====================== 10h. The True Champion ======================  Walk through the door to find... Gary. He's always been one step ahead of you, and it seems as though the Pokemon League is no exception; he's already the Champion! I'm sick of his trash talking, so let's put him in his place once and for all. This is the final battle, so don't hold back!  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Pidgeot......59|Pidgeot......59|Pidgeot......59| |Rhydon.......59|Rhydon.......59|Rhydon.......59| |Alakazam.....57|Alakazam.....57|Alakazam.....57| |Gyarados.....61|Exeggutor....59|Gyarados.....59| |Exeggutor....59|Arcanine.....61|Arcanine.....61| |Charizard....63|Blastoise....63|Venusaur.....63| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Full Restores: 4 Money: 6300  o---------o  Moveset: Sand-Attack, Aerial Ace, Featherdance, Whirlwind | Pidgeot | o---------o  Ability: Keen Eye (Prevents accuracy loss)  Pidgeot will alternate between using Sand-Attack and Aerial Ace to steadily damage you while lowering your accuracy. You don't really have to worry about Whirlwind; there's no reason to waste time putting sand in your face only to have it all magically vanish. Rock-types should beware of Featherdance and the sharp Attack drop that comes with it. Use an Electric- or Ice-type instead.  o--------o  Moveset: Rock Tomb, Earthquake, Take Down, Scary Face | Rhydon | o--------o  Ability: Lightningrod (Electric-type attacks target this Pokemon)  Rhyhorn's types don't change when it evolves. Surf and be done with it.  o----------o  Moveset: Psychic, Reflect, Future Sight, Recover | Alakazam | o----------o  Ability: Synchronize (Mirrors BRN, PAR, and PSN on the foe)  Alakazam is cake now that Calm Mind is gone. He'll alternate between Psychic and Future Sight (like a moron), and will surprisingly rarely use Recover (he sat there and used Future Sight repeatedly when he was a Tackle away from defeat, and was so stubborn I had to Torment him to find out what his last move was, and I wanted to kill Gary when I knew it was Recover. What a loser!). At any rate, a strong Normal-type should do the trick here.  o----------o  Moveset: Dragon Rage, Bite, Thrash, Hydro Pump | Gyarados | o----------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  I see Hydro Pump on Gyarados and laugh. Set damage is easily get-aroundable, and Bite runs off of Special Attack now. That leaves only one real attack you should almost worry about - Thrash. Oh no, not self-induced confusion!  Zzzap says the Electric-type.  o-----------o  Moveset: Giga Drain, Sleep Powder, Egg Bomb, Light Screen | Exeggutor | o-----------o  Ability: Chlorophyll (Raises Speed when sunny)  Egg Bomb is pretty inaccurate... Giga Drain only has 5 PP. Poke Flute cures Sleep Powder. Exeggutor's double weak to Bug, but it's unlikely you have any strong Bug-type attacks to take advantage of it (Silver Wind?). Try to take advantage of its Flying weakness instead.  o----------o   Moveset: Extremespeed, Flamethrower, Bite, Roar | Arcanine | o----------o   Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  Extremespeed will always go first, and it's quite strong, but like all powerful attacks, it only has 5 PP. Bring out a Pokemon with high Defense to absorb the hit, and make sure it can survive Flamethrower. Keep those Full Restores handy in case you get Burned. Count out five uses of Extremespeed and it's smooth sailing from there on out.  o-----------o  Moveset: Fire Spin, Aerial Ace, Fire Blast, Slash | Charizard | o-----------o  Ability: Blaze (Fire damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Fire Blast is all you need to worry about. It's the most powerful Fire attack available to most Fire-types (everyone but Charizard, in fact), so your Pokemon will be feeling many pain-type things (i.e. death). Keep those Revives handy; if you're too slow, simply revive your fainted Pokemon and stall with items until he uses up all five Fire Blasts. That is your chance to attack.  o-----------o  Moveset: Rain Dance, Hydro Pump, Surf, Body Slam | Blastoise | o-----------o  Ability: Torrent (Water damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Hydro Pump is the most powerful Water attack a Water-type other than Blastoise can have, but it has no added effects. Rain Dance will enhance its destructive power even more, but it comes at a cost. When raining, Thunder will never miss. Blastoise is weak to Electric, so if he makes it rain, call a storm.  o----------o   Moveset: Growth, Sunny Day, Solarbeam, Synthesis | Venusaur | o----------o   Ability: Overgrow (Grass damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Venusaur will use Growth to raise its Special Attack and make Solarbeam, the most powerful Grass technique for everyone but Venusaur, stronger. In addition to that, Sunny Day makes it so Solarbeam doesn't require a charge, so Gary can fire them off five in a row. He seems to forget that Sunny Day powers up Fire- type moves as well, so use them to your advantage; Venusaur's weak to Fire.  Once you defeat Gary, you're done!  ============== 10i. Aftermath ==============  Professor Oak will take you into the next room and register your team into the Hall of Fame. Watch the brand new ending, then load your game.  If you haven't cleared Three Island yet, you'll have to go back and do that. If this is the case, you will be able to battle the Elite Four until you do and you meet the requirements for the National Pokedex. Go to Professor Oak's Lab and talk to him.  If you have cleared Three Island before the Elite Four's defeat, Professor Oak will tell you how many Pokemon you have in your Pokedex. If you have at least 60 species owned, he'll bring you to his lab. He'll ask you to go find Pokemon that have never been seen in Kanto, and Gary will come in, asking why Oak keeps asking _you_ for help when _he_ is obviously far superior for the job. Oak will once again tell him to shut up and he'll take both Pokedexes. He'll mess with them for a second, then return them to you, nationalized! Now you have the National Pokedex, which will record data on all species you meet from now on that aren't part of Kanto's first 151. Gary leaves, saying he'll go to One Island. You're free to do the same.  For more information about the Sevii Islands, please check section 12.  You won't be able to challenge the Elite Four again anytime soon, either. The reason? Lorelei isn't there. Where'd she go, I wonder? Oh well.  ================ 11. Kanto Extras ================  These are all side quests of some sort that are based in Kanto.  ================ 11a. Dog Catcher ================  After getting the National Pokedex, one of the three legendary "dogs" from Johto will roam Kanto. When you run into it, you'll hear the legendary music 'remix', so if the giant Lv.50 beast in front of you isn't a big enough hint, the music is sure to be. Which one of these "dogs" will you find? It all depends on your starter. If you chose Bulbasaur, you will be graced with Entei; if Charmander was the one you picked, Suicune will be your prize, and if you started with Squirtle, Raikou will await you.  One very important note is that it's much harder to catch them than in the metal games. The reason for this is they will flee even if you put them to sleep. When you encounter it, hit it hard so it will be weakened. It will retain all damage and Special Conditions from when you last ran into it.  To avoid the hassle, just use your Master Ball. You still have it... right?  ******************************************************************************* *                                   WARNING                                   * *******************************************************************************       IF A BEAST USES ROAR ON YOUR POKEMON, IT WILL VANISH FROM THE POKEDEX!

Rocket Game Corner =======================  Found in Celadon City, the Game Corner is much fun for everyone. Before we go here, there's just one thing we need to do. Head to the southern part of the city and you'll find a few buildings next to each other. Enter the leftmost one and talk to the guy in the upper left. He'll give you the Coin Case, an invaluable item to gamblers and perfectionists alike. Without this, you can't carry Coins for the slot machines.  Once inside the Game Corner, take three steps north and press A for 10 Coins. From there, 5 steps north. Face left and press A for 20 Coins.  Go all the way to the far left. Stand behind the bald man and take one step up. Press A for 10 coins. Five steps down and press A for 20 Coins.  Stand 2 steps under the second slot machine from the left, on the bottom. Take one step east and press A for 10 Coins. Six steps east from there: press A for 10 Coins.  Stand next to the upper right chair on the far right side. Face north and press A for 10 Coins.  Many, many people have told me about the fact that the free 100 coins are still there, but the reason I couldn't find them is because they've been moved. Find them by standing in front of the sticker machine. Face left and press A.  The two slot players on the far right will each give you 20 Coins. Stand above the northeasternmost chair, face right, and press A for 40 Coins. Four steps west and one step north gets you 10 more Coins if you press A. Two steps, is it? to the west (use the Itemfinder to make sure) and press A for 10 coins. The man on the right side of the far left column will give you 10 Coins. Stand behind him, face down, and press A for 10 coins, for a final total of 300 Coins. Do with them what you will.  If you want to buy Coins, you can buy them in sets of 50 or 500 (but still no 1000 or 5000, I'm afraid). Talk to the lady on the right side of the counter.  If you'd rather earn your Coins, all you can do is play the slot machines. I find it much easier to just mash A repeatedly than try to get something; you'll win quite often, and I've gotten 777 a lot using this 'method', more than if I had actually tried to line them up.  One more thing of note. There's a machine in the lower right corner that will stamp the sprites of your current party on the six Poke Balls found on the back of your Trainer Card. It has no use other than look pretty.  PRIZES ------  These games aren't for your health; you can get some pretty spiffy prizes next door. There are three lovely ladies who will be more than happy to take your Coins in exchange for their wares. Here's what you can get from each lady:  o------------------------o      o----------------------o     o---------------o |          LEFT          |      |        CENTER        |     |     RIGHT     | o------------------------o      o----------------------o     o---------------o | Smoke Ball.........800 |      | Abra.............120 |     | TM13.....4000 | | Miracle Seed......1000 |      | Clefairy.........750 |     | TM23.....3500 | | Charcoal..........1000 |      | Scyther (FR)....2500 |     | TM24.....4000 | | Mystic Water......1000 |      | Pinsir (LG).....2500 |     | TM30.....4500 | | Yellow Flute......1600 |      | Dratini.........4500 |     | TM35.....4000 | o------------------------o      | Porygon.........6500 |     o---------------o                                 o----------------------o  Smoke Balls let you escape from wild Pokemon, but it's much cheaper to pay 1000 moneys for a Poke Doll than 16,000 moneys for a Smoke Ball. And you don't have to walk that much farther from here, either. Miracle Seed, Charcoal, and Mystic Water are useless; the percentage they raise their respective type's power by isn't significant enough to cause a major change in damage. Don't waste your Coins on them. The Yellow Flute cures confusion, and never runs out; one is all you will ever need. More or less, these items suck; stay away from this lady.  The center lady has rare or hard-to-catch Pokemon that you may or may not have encountered in your journeys, with the exception of Porygon; that Pokemon can _only_ be found here, and you _must_ buy it if you want to complete the Pokedex and pleasure an old man.  The TMs, from top to bottom, are Ice Beam, Iron Tail, Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, and Flamethrower. Everything but Iron Tail is a dependable attack in battle, and you should be spending most of your Coins on these once you get your fill of Pokemon.  =============== 11c. Powder Guy ===============  In Cerulean City, there's a house to the left of the one that was robbed. In this house resides a man who will give you a Powder Jar for you to collect Berry Powder in. This powder can then be traded for some pretty sucky items.  How do we go about getting this Berry Powder? Why, from Berries, of course!  You'll need at least two people playing with the Wireless Adapter to crush Berries. Each of you selects a berry, and then you tap A repeatedly to crush the berry. The faster you do it, the more powder you'll get. If you all do it together, you'll get even more powder, so the basic idea is to be fast and accurate, which are two traits I personally lack. ^_^  o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |     ITEM     |                       EFFECT                        |  COST  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o | ENERGYPOWDER | A bitter powder that restores HP by 50 points.      |   50   | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |  ENERGY ROOT | A bitter root that restores HP by 200 points.       |   80   | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |  HEAL POWDER | A bitter powder that heals all status problems.     |   50   | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o | REVIVAL HERB | A very bitter herb that revives a fainted Pokemon.  |   300  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |    PROTEIN   | Increases ATK effort points by 10.                  |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |     IRON     | Increases DEF effort points by 10.                  |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |    CARBOS    | Increases SPD effort points by 10.                  |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |    CALCIUM   | Increases SP.ATK effort points by 10.               |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |     ZINC     | Increases SP.DEF effort points by 10.               |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |     HP UP    | Increases HP effort points by 10.                   |  1000  | o--------------o-----------------------------------------------------o--------o |     PP UP    | Increases PP of a move.

Seafoam Islands ====================  To complete this side quest, you will need Surf and Strength. Bring lots of Ultra Balls and someone who can inflict a Special Condition that isn't Poison or Burn. Fly to Fuchsia City and head south. Jump the ledges and have yourself two fights on land.  SwimmerM Richard Tentacool, Lv.30; Shellder, Lv.30 Money: 120  SwimmerM Reece Goldeen, Lv.29; Horsea, Lv.29; Staryu, Lv.29 Money: 115  Now start the long, water-filled journey to Seafoam Islands.  SwimmerM Tony                   SwimmerM David Horsea, Lv.30 (x2)              Goldeen, Lv.29; Shellder, Lv.29; Seaking, Lv.29 Money: 120                      Money: 116  SwimmerM Douglas Horsea, Lv.27; Tentacool, Lv.27 (x2); Goldeen, Lv.27 Money: 108  SwimmerM Matthew Poliwag, Lv.30; Poliwhirl, Lv.30 Money: 120  Sis and Bro Lia & Luc Goldeen/Seaking, Lv.30 Money: 240  SwimmerF Anya Poliwag, Lv.27 (x2); Goldeen, Lv.27 (x2); Seaking, Lv.27 Money: 108  SwimmerM Axle Tentacool, Lv.27 (x2); Horsea, Lv.27; Tentacruel, Lv.27; Staryu, Lv.27 Money: 108  SwimmerF Connie                 SwimmerF Alice Staryu, Lv.29 (x3)              Goldeen, Lv.30; Seaking, Lv.30 Money: 116                      Money: 120  SwimmerM Barry Shellder, Lv.31; Cloyster, Lv.31 Money: 124  SwimmerM Darrin Horsea, Lv.28 (x3); Seadra, Lv.28 Money: 112  SwimmerF Shirley Seadra, Lv.30 (x2); Horsea, Lv.30 Money: 120  Land ho! The guy here is part of Misty's section of the Fame Checker.  There's a lonely lady outside the cave. Since you won't be back in this part, let's fight her.  SwimmerF Tiffany Seaking, Lv.35 Money: 140  Alright, we're ready to tackle the cave. Did you remember Strength?  o------------------------------------o | SEAFOAM  ISLANDS  POKEMON  LISTING | o------------------------------------o | Zubat      (Common)                |  This dungeon can get really confusing. | Golbat     (Uncommon)              |  I've tried to separate my instructions | Seel       (Common) (later)        |  so they're not so hard to read. | Psyduck    (Uncommon, FR)          |  Hopefully, this will help you get | Golduck    (Uncommon, FR) (later)  |  through Seafoam Islands without you | Slowpoke   (Uncommon, LG)          |  taking confusion damage. | Slowbro    (Uncommon, LG) (later)  | o------------------------------------o  Start by going right and pushing the boulder north in the hole. Now go back and up the stairs. Pick up the Ice Heal and follow the path right. Push the boulder into the hole.  Go down the ladder and push the boulder in the hole.  Go back up the ladder and go left. Go down this ladder and go right and up the stairs. Pick up the Revive and go past the ladder and down the stairs. Push the boulder in the hole.  Now go all the way left and up. Go down the ladder and to the right. Push the boulder in the hole. Go up the ladder and back up the stairs to the right. Go down this ladder.  Go right and down the stairs. Pick up the Big Pearl and go up the right ladder. Pick up the Water Stone and go back. This time, go down the left ladder. Go right and follow the path to a boulder puzzle.  There are two boulders next to each other; push the right of these two squares up. Now push the left boulder one square down and one square left.  Go around the boulder you just pushed and push the boulder that's two squares above the hole all the way left. Push the boulder one square above the hole into the hole.  Now push the only pushable boulder two squares left and one square down, into the hole.  Backtrack to the ladder on this floor and go north a little and down the ladder you find there. Go south and pick up the Ultra Ball. Go all the way north and then east. Go up the ladder, then up the ladder again. Go down and push the boulder into the hole.  Fall into the hole; you'll end up in water. Take the left stairs and go south. You're back at the boulder puzzle. Fall into one of the holes and you'll end up in the water again. Go straight up to find Articuno staring you in the face.  If you want it, save your game.  Articuno is Lv.50 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Mist - Prevent stat reduction on your party. Mind Reader - Next attack performed will not miss if foe is on screen. Agility - Raise user's Speed by 2 levels. Ice Beam - 10% chance of freezing the foe.  Articuno is double weak to Rock. Be careful if you decide to use Rock attacks. If you've got Lapras, Dewgong, or any other Ice-type, bring it out against Articuno and you're safe. Whittle its HP away until you feel safe to catch it.  That's all for Seafoam Islands. If you brought an Escape Rope or can use Dig or Teleport, you can use that. Otherwise, get back on the water and go up the stairs. Stand to the left of the ladder and take a step left. Face up and press A for a Water Stone.  Go right, north, and right. Go up the ladder and fall in the hole. This time, take the right side and go up the ladder. Go up another ladder. Go up another ladder. Leave the cave. Ah, daylight.  If you want, you can Fly away. Otherwise, battle your way to Cinnabar Island.  Picnicker Irene Tentacool, Lv.30; Horsea, Lv.30; Seel, Lv.30 Money: 600  Bird Keeper Roger Fearow, Lv.30 (x2); Pidgeotto, Lv.30 Money: 720  SwimmerF Nora                                SwimmerM Dean Shellder, Lv.30 (x2); Cloyster, Lv.30        Staryu, Lv.35 Money: 120                                   Money: 140  Picnicker Missy                              SwimmerF Melissa Goldeen, Lv.31; Seaking, Lv.31               Poliwag, Lv.31; Seaking, Lv.31 Money: 620                                   Money: 124  Cinnabar lies to the west. That's all.  ================ 11e. Power Plant ================  To complete this side quest, you will need Surf. Bring lots of Ultra Balls and someone who can inflict a Special Condition that isn't Poison or Burn.  The earliest you can do this side quest is after you defeat Koga. Fly to the Pokemon Center near Rock Tunnel and go north. Continue north past the patch of grass and Surf to the right and south to get there. A single Trainer blocks the path, but if you go far enough left, you don't even have to fight him.  Pokemaniac Mark Rhyhorn, Lv.29; Lickitung, Lv.29 Money: 1392  o-----------------------------o Go north and pick up the item ball containing a | POWER PLANT POKEMON LISTING | Max Potion. Continue on and the path will split o-----------------------------o in two directions. Go right and follow the path | Pikachu     (Common)        | for TM17, Protect. Take the top path and get | Voltorb     (Common, FR)    | an Elixir. Now go back to the main path and go | Voltorb     (Uncommon, LG)  | south. The path splits again. Go south and | Magnemite   (Uncommon, FR)  | right to find a Lv.34 Electrode. Go back to the | Magnemite   (Common, LG)    | fork and head right to yet another fork. Take | Magneton    (Rare, FR)      | the south path and follow it for TM25, Thunder. | Magneton    (Uncommon, LG)  | Now continue on and you'll find a room on the | Electabuzz  (Rare, FR)      | north side with two item balls on either side. o-----------------------------o The one on the left is a Lv.34 Electrode; the one on the right is a Thunderstone. Continue on and head south to a small room that appears to have nothing in it; on further inspection, however, you can get a hidden item here. Stand in front of the machine on the right and take a step down. Face up and press A for a Max Elixir. Follow the path to Zapdos, but don't challenge it just yet; go in front of the center of the machine. Take one step away, face towards it, and press A for a second Thunderstone.  Okay, _now_ you can challenge Zapdos. Make sure to save first if you want it.  Zapdos is Lv.50 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Drill Peck - No added effects. Detect - Goes first and avoids an attack. May fail if used in succession. Agility - Raise user's Speed by 2 levels. Thunder Wave - Paralyze a foe.  There are no Electric-type moves for you to worry about, but Drill Peck's pretty strong. Golem or Rhydon would be perfect for this battle; resistance to its only damaging attack and immunity to Thunder Wave. You can also use Rock Blast/Throw/Slide to pick on weakness and inflict damage. If you can put it to sleep, do so and weaken it with attacks Zapdos resists. When its HP are too low for you to attack it any more without it dying, chuck Ultra Balls. Put it back to sleep if it wakes up. It shouldn't take too much more than that.  Exit via the door on the left. That's all for the Power Plant.  ================== 11f. Cerulean Cave ==================  To complete this dungeon, you will need Surf. To get all the items, you'll need Rock Smash as well. Bring lots of Ultra Balls and someone that can inflict a Special Condition other than Poison or Burn. You can't come in here until you've given Celio the Sapphire. See section 12e.  If you can enter, Fly to Cerulean City and head north to Nugget Bridge. Surf south and around to find the cave. Don't enter just yet; a wimpy and lonesome girl is a bit to the left.  Lass Crissy Paras, Lv.31 (x2); Parasect, Lv.31 Money: 496  Told you. Go back and enter the toughest dungeon in Kanto.  o-------------------------------o   Since you've met the requirements for going | CERULEAN CAVE POKEMON LISTING |   in this cave, you shouldn't have any real o-------------------------------o   trouble defeating the Pokemon here. This |  Magneton      (Common)       |   cave is home to the highest-level Pokemon |  Primeape      (Common)       |   anywhere (don't get too glad, it's ~40-70), |  Parasect      (Common)       |   and it'll have to be your new training |  Machoke       (Common)       |   ground if you can't defeat the Elite Four. |  Ditto         (Common)       | |  Golbat        (Common)       |   Ready? Start by going up and Surfing. If |  Kadabra       (Common)       |   you have Rock Smash, go up this ladder and |  Wobbuffet     (Common)       |   follow the path. Break the two rocks for a |  Electrode     (Rare)         |   Full Restore. Return to the water and Surf. o-------------------------------o Continue on and go south. Get the Full Restore. Go left and past the ladder and get the Nugget. Now go down. If you have Rock Smash, go up the ladder. Break the rock and get yourself a PP Up.  Then go right and follow the path and find a Max Elixir. If you have Rock Smash, go up the ladder that's a bit south of the item you just got and break the rock. Claim your Ultra Ball and go back to the ladder. Go around the bend and up the ladder that's on a platform.  There are two paths you can take. Both lead downward at first, but don't take the one on the far left. No items are there and it's just a waste of time. Instead, take the path closest to the ladder and follow this path to another ladder. Go down this one and the one that's in the next room.  Follow the path right and pick up the Max Revive. Keep going and get the Ultra Ball. When you reach the water, Surf a bit and you'll find... Mewtwo? What it's doing here, no one really knows, but hey. It's here, it's wild, and it's hard.  To catch, you sicko! o_< Mewtwo is Lv.70 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Psychic - 10% chance to lower foe's Special Defense by 1 level. Swift - Never misses as long as the foe is on screen. Recover - Restore 50% of user's maximum HP. Safeguard - Prevent Special Conditions + confusion on your party for 5 turns.  Mewtwo's Special Attack is _very_ high, and you'll likely be killed in one shot by Psychic if you're at low levels. Swift isn't anything to worry about. If you have someone that knows Taunt, continually use that (it wears off after two turns) to prevent it from using Safeguard and Recover. A Dark-type will work wonders here; immunity to its only painful attack and the ability to brush off Swift. If you don't have one, you can only rely on your own strengths - the only types that resists Psychic are Psychic and Steel. The only Psychic/Steel Pokemon are Jirachi and Beldum's line, and you have to trade them in from Ruby & Sapphire.  That's all for Cerulean Cave.  ========================== 11g. Elite Four, Round Two ==========================  This can first be done after completing Rocket Warehouse.  You'll notice that after getting the National Pokedex, you are no longer able to rematch them because Lorelei has gone somewhere. After reuniting with Celio on One Island, you are given the Rainbow Pass, which lets you travel to Four Island, Lorelei's place of birth. After helping Lorelei beat up some Team Rocket thugs and defeat them at Rocket Warehouse on Five Island, she will return to Indigo Plateau in Kanto.  Each member of the Elite Four (Gary, too) has raised each of their Pokemon 10+ levels, and they've even gone so far as to evolve or replace a few. If you thought they were hard before, just try them now.  Not everyone has Sitrus Berries, though. Some items have been changed.  ========================== 11g1. Elite Four - Lorelei ==========================  Lorelei's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Dewgong   |  64 | Piloswine  |  63 |  Cloyster  |  63 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Jynx    |  66 |   Lapras   |  66 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Money: 6600 Full Restores: 2  o---------o  Moveset: Double Team, Signal Beam, Surf, Ice Beam | Dewgong | o---------o  Ability: Thick Fat (Fire and Ice damage halved)  Signal Beam is a fairly strong Bug-type attack (second most powerful, actually, but don't let that fool you. Its power is only 75) that can confuse your Pokemon. Surf and Ice Beam are still here, and they still hurt. Double Team is the real problem. Evasion is incredibly annoying. If you find that you're not getting any damage in, try using Shock Wave to pick on Dewgong's weakness and get around those Double Teams.  o-----------o  Moveset: Earthquake, Blizzard, Rock Slide, Double-Edge | Piloswine | o-----------o  Ability: Oblivious (Prevents attraction)  Meet Slowbro's replacement. Piloswine is Ice/Ground in type, and rounds out Lorelei's Ice-type squad nicely, considering she can't really use Articuno. At any rate, Piloswine is still slow like Slowbro, but it's pretty strong. And, like most strong Pokemon, it likes to use strong attacks. Lorelei's Piloswine is the only one of her Pokemon that knows Blizzard instead of Ice Beam. Blizzard is less accurate than Fire Blast, but it's just as powerful, and it can also freeze. Rock Slide is for those Fire-types, as is the even more powerful Earthquake. Disability is the key here. Try to drop Piloswine's Attack or raise your own Defense. Putting it to sleep does fine as well.  o----------o  Moveset: Ice Beam, Rain Dance, Supersonic, Surf | Cloyster | o----------o  Ability: Shell Armor (Prevents critical hits)  Rain Dance begs Thunder. Any Electric-type sporting this move will be enough. If you're lacking the move Thunder (or an Electric-type), then use a Pokemon with high Special Defense to take hits.  o------o  Moveset: Ice Beam, Lovely Kiss, Psychic, Attract | Jynx | o------o  Ability: Oblivious (Prevents attraction)  Jynx is female, so keep the men at bay. The strategy here isn't too different than last time. Use the Poke Flute to wake yourself up from Lovely Kiss. It's somewhat inaccurate, and you can use the turn she may waste to your advantage.  o--------o  Moveset: Ice Beam, Surf, Thunder, Psychic | Lapras | o--------o  Ability: Water Absorb (Healed by Water-type attacks)  If you have a Pokemon with Toxic, use that. Lapras still has loads of HP, and the increasing damage will certainly help. Lapras is capable of inflicting super-effective damage to half the types in the game, so be careful about what you send out. Even if you get one of the types that gets normal damage, Surf and Ice Beam will still hurt because of STAB.  Once you defeat Lorelei, move on to the next room.  ======================== 11g2. Elite Four - Bruno ========================  Bruno's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Steelix   |  65 |  Steelix   |  66 | Hitmonchan |  65 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o | Hitmonlee  |  65 |  Machamp   |  68 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o   Full Restores: 2 Money: 6800  o------------o  Moveset: Rock Tomb, Iron Tail, Earthquake, Crunch | Steelix 65 | o------------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  Since Onix has evolved, it has removed its double weakness to Water. Still, Water is the way to go here. If your Fire-types fail to kill it, Earthquake and Rock Tomb will end their lives quickly.  o------------o  Moveset: Crunch, Iron Tail, Dragonbreath, Earthquake | Steelix 66 | o------------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  This Steelix has Dragonbreath (which can paralyze you) over Rock Tomb, but the strategy's no different. Use the same Water-type you used before.  o------------o  Moveset: Sky Uppercut, Counter, Rock Slide, Mach Punch | Hitmonchan | o------------o  Ability: Keen Eye (Prevents accuracy loss)  Hitmonchan's back with a slight change in his moveset. Other than the expected increase in stats, nothing else is different. Treat him like you did the first time around.  o-----------o  Moveset: Rock Slide, Mega Kick, Earthquake, Foresight | Hitmonlee | o-----------o  Ability: Limber (Prevents paralysis)  Hitmonlee has undergone a few changes. Over Facade is Earthquake, a much more reliable attack that still won't hit Ghost-types, even with Foresight. With Rock Slide at his disposal, Hitmonlee isn't totally helpless against Ghosts, and helps with his weakness to Flying. Be careful. Hitmonlee has high Attack power to back up his strong moves.  o---------o  Moveset: Rock Slide, Cross Chop, Brick Break, Earthquake | Machamp | o---------o  Ability: Guts (Attack doubles if Poisoned, Burned, or Paralyzed)  Bruno's Machamp has greatly improved; the only attack he retains is Cross Chop. Your best bet here would be a Ghost-type to negate 75% of Machamp's attacks. If you don't have one, Reflect will certainly come in handy to cut down all the physical damage you'll be taking. If you have a Psychic-type, be cautious. Most Psychic-types have low Defense, which means they'll be sure to get OHKOed.   Once you defeat Bruno, move on to the next room.  ========================= 11g3. Elite Four - Agatha =========================  Agatha's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Gengar   |  66 | Misdreavus |  65 |   Crobat   |  66 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |   Arbok    |  68 |   Gengar   |  70 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 7000  o-----------o  Moveset: Shadow Ball, Confuse Ray, Hypnosis, Psychic | Gengar 66 | o-----------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  Agatha has moved up from an annoy strategy to a still-sucky Gengar. Double Team is gone, and she now has Confuse Ray and Hypnosis in its place. Dream Eater's missing, thankfully. Psychic-type Pokemon get destroyed by Shadow Ball. Make sure your [Psychic-type] Pokemon is a high level to OHKO Gengar and the rest of Agatha's Pokemon.  o------------o  Moveset: Thunderbolt, Attract, Shadow Ball, Psychic | Misdreavus | o------------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  Three Gengar was way too much for Agatha, so she replaced Haunter with Misdreavus, Johto's only Ghost (and was, back then, the only pure Ghost-type). One thing to note is Agatha's Misdreavus is _male_, so keep the ladies out. Missy doesn't evolve into or from anything, and that usually means it's weak. It shouldn't take much to send this Pokemon back to its Poke Ball.  o--------o  Moveset: Air Cutter, Sludge Bomb, Shadow Ball, Confuse Ray | Crobat | o--------o  Ability: Inner Focus (Prevents flinching)  Agatha's Golbat has evolved into Crobat, a much faster and stronger Pokemon, and is no longer a joke. Crobat is one of the fastest Pokemon around, and has decent Attack power to take advantage of. Sludge Bomb is the most powerful Poison technique the series has to offer, and it comes with a 30% poison rate. What you want here is your Pokemon with the highest Defense. While Shadow Ball will rip apart your Psychic-types, it usually won't be needed because Sludge Bomb will do more damage anyway. Try using Ice or Electric.  o-------o  Moveset: Double Team, Sludge Bomb, Earthquake, Giga Drain | Arbok | o-------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  It seems like everyone and their dog knows Double Team these days. There are no Ground- or Psychic-type Swift attacks, so you're on your own as far as the evasion goes. You should only worry about Giga Drain if you're Rock/Ground. Earthquake is for your Poison-types, so keep that in mind. Psychic is still the way to go.  o-----------o  Moveset: Sludge Bomb, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt, Psychic | Gengar 70 | o-----------o  Ability: Levitate (Immune to Ground-type damage)  The unreliable-but-deadly Hypnosis and Nightmare have been replaced with Thunderbolt and Psychic, turning this Gengar into a mixed sweeper of sorts. Gengar has better Special Attack than Attack, so you should be more worried about the latter two moves. You can either choose to bring out Gengar's only weakness (Psychic), or just use powerful attacks. Either one works.  Once you defeat Agatha, move on to the next room.  ======================== 11g4. Elite Four - Lance ========================  Lance's Pokemon:  o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl |    Name    | Lvl | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o |  Gyarados  |  68 | Aerodactyl |  70 | Dragonite  |  66 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o------------o-----o | Dragonite  |  72 |  Kingdra   |  66 | o------------o-----o------------o-----o  Full Restores: 2 Money: 7200  o----------o  Moveset: Thunder Wave, Earthquake, Dragon Dance, Hyper Beam | Gyarados | o----------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  Take a look at that set, will ya? Simply amazing what one can do if one puts one's mind to it. Gyarados' plan is simple. Immobilize with Thunder Wave, then raise Attack and Speed each by 1 with a single Dragon Dance. Once it's been powered up enough, Gyarados is free to ruin your team via Earthquake (especially helpful for those Electric-types) and Hyper Beam.  Of course, by the time Lance can even think about setting this destruction up, Gyarados will be dead to the Electric-type attack you better have just used.  o------------o  Moveset: Earthquake, Aerial Ace, Ancientpower, Hyper Beam | Aerodactyl | o------------o  Ability: Rock Head (No recoil damage)  Wing Attack has been replaced with Aerial Ace, which never misses. The useless Scary Face was dropped for a much better Earthquake, which not only kills your Electric-types, but takes advantage of Aerodactyl's Attack. Think Crobat, only better. You can still Water-type him to death. Don't forget about the boost from Ancientpower.  o--------------o  Moveset: Flamethrower, Dragon Claw, Hyper Beam, Earthquake | Dragonite 66 | o--------------o  Ability: Inner Focus (Prevents flinching)  Ice Beam, thanks for playing.  o--------------o  Moveset: Outrage, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Hyper Beam | Dragonite 72 | o--------------o  Ability: Inner Focus (Prevents flinching)  See previous Dragonite strategy. It holds a Persim Berry.  o---------o  Moveset: Ice Beam, Dragon Dance, Hyper Beam, Surf | Kingdra | o---------o  Ability: Swift Swim (Speed increase while raining)  The lack of Dragon-types shows. Lance's would-be-third Dragonite has been replaced with Seadra's new Johto evolution, Kingdra. It is Water/Dragon in type, which eliminates all weaknesses except Dragon, and that's what Ice Beam's there for. The only thing you need to worry about is Dragon Dance's Speed boost. If Kingdra gets a lot of them in, it can spell disaster for your team, especially if he decides to use Hyper Beam, which takes care of any Water- or Ice-types you throw at him. Just continue using your most powerful attacks.  Once you defeat Lance, move on to the next room.  ======================= 11g5. The True Champion =======================  Gary's Pokemon:          Find your starter. Gary's team           is in the column below it.  o---------------o---------------o---------------o |   Bulbasaur   |   Charmander  |    Squirtle   | <- Which one's your starter? o---------------o---------------o---------------o |Heracross....72|Heracross....72|Heracross....72| |Tyranitar....72|Tyranitar....72|Tyranitar....72| |Gyarados.....73|Exeggutor....73|Arcanine.....73| |Alakazam.....73|Alakazam.....73|Alakazam.....73| |Exeggutor....73|Arcanine.....73|Gyarados.....73| |Charizard....75|Blastoise....75|Venusaur.....75| o---------------o---------------o---------------o  Full Restores: 4 Money: 7500  o-----------o  Moveset: Megahorn, Rock Tomb, Counter, Earthquake | Heracross | o-----------o  Ability: Swarm (Bug damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Heracross is double weak to Flying. Make sure that if you decide to pick on it, you're sure you'll kill it. Otherwise, you die from Counter. Megahorn used to be only learned by Heracross, and it's the strongest Bug-type move there is. Psychic-types get wasted, so be sure you can deliver that OHKO.  o----------o  Moveset: Shadow Ball, Calm Mind, Psychic, Reflect | Alakazam | o----------o  Ability: Synchronize (Mirrors BRN, PAR, and PSN on the foe)  Someone must have knocked some sense into Gary, because Calm Mind is back. 'Zam now sports Shadow Ball and Reflect, which will help it against Ghost-types. Reflect shouldn't be too much of a hinder, though. A couple of strong non- Fighting attacks should do the job.  o-----------o  Moveset: Aerial Ace, Earthquake, Crunch, Thunderbolt | Tyranitar | o-----------o  Ability: Sand Stream (Sandstorm begins and lasts forever)  Once Tyranitar comes into play, you need to change the weather as soon as you can. The Sandstorm effect from his Ability will never end as long as no other weather moves are used, and it's probable that the majority of your team isn't part Rock, Ground, or Steel. If it is, you need a team change. Tyranitar is Rock/Dark in type, and is therefore double weak to Fighting. Aerial Ace helps out with that. Thunderbolt is for Water-types.  o----------o  Moveset: Earthquake, Dragon Dance, Hydro Pump, Hyper Beam | Gyarados | o----------o  Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  Similar strategy to Lance, but keeps Hydro Pump. After a couple Dragon Dances, Earthquake will do _far_ more damage than Hydro Pump to your Fire-types, so it really isn't needed. Of course, if you're stupid enough to put a Fire-type up against any Gyarados, you deserve to lose.  Stop reading and Thunderbolt him.  o-----------o  Moveset: Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, Light Screen, Psychic | Exeggutor | o-----------o Ability: Chlorophyll (Speed increase while sunny)  While Exeggutor may be double weak to Bug, it's a very uncommon type. It's not likely that you'll have Signal Beam, Silver Wind, or Megahorn, but don't worry  about it too much. Don't forget your handy-dandy Poke Flute for the sleep move, and see what you can do about throwing a Flying-type in his face to pick on the weakness and get around Light Screen and Giga Drain.  o----------o   Moveset: Extremespeed, Iron Tail, Overheat, Aerial Ace | Arcanine | o----------o   Ability: Intimidate (Active Pokemon's ATK-1 upon entry)  A physical attacking Arcanine? No thanks. Overheat's deadly the first time it's used, but don't be intimidated (oops, too late (bad joke)) by the sheer destruction it causes. Gary's too stupid to switch out after effectively destroying his only real attack, so just wait until those are gone. One thing to mention is Extremespeed. It's only got 5 PP, and it has 80 power. What's so special about that? Nothing, except the fact that the user always goes first. It's capable of delivering sneak KOs, destroying your Pokemon from even half their max HP without you getting a chance to counter. Gary's Arcanine loves to do Extremespeed, and he'll waste the PP for it real quick.  o-----------o  Moveset: Aerial Ace, Fire Blast, Dragon Claw, Earthquake | Charizard | o-----------o  Ability: Blaze (Fire damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Dragon Claw doesn't really mean much on Charizard. I suppose it could be used as a Special technique if Fire Blast runs out of PP (which still is really the only threat here). Earthquake, like always, murders Electric-types. A Rain Dance/Thunder combo would work nicely here. Did you challenge Moltres? If so, you could employ a similar method here, since Charizard and Moltres share the same type. Just nix the part about catching the thing.  o----------o  Moveset: Earthquake, Solarbeam, Sludge Bomb, Sunny Day | Venusaur | o----------o  Ability: Overgrow (Grass damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Gary will avoid using Sunny Day like a straight man avoids a gay bar. Without it, though, you know when Solarbeam's coming. It's a bit easier that way. Earthquake rapes your Fire-types, and Sludge Bomb is just a powerful STAB attack. If Gary _does_ use Sunny Day, switch in to your Fire-type that should be faster than Venusaur and roast the sucker.  o-----------o Moveset: Rain Dance, Ice Beam, Hydro Pump, Earthquake | Blastoise | o-----------o Ability: Torrent (Water damage x1.5 when HP drop below 1/3)  Blastoise now comes with the ability to handle Electric-types. In a way, you can treat Gary's Blastoise like Lorelei's new Cloyster. Thunder doesn't have the greatest accuracy in the world, but it becomes perfect while raining. While this seems tempting, you've gotta be careful because Earthquake will put the hurt on all Electric-types except Zapdos, and Ice Beam's for that. It holds a Sitrus Berry.  ================= 12. Sevii Islands =================  This can first be done after defeating Blaine.  Bill will ask if you want to come to a place called One Island that isn't even on your map. Say yes, and you'll be whisked away.  Before you go, make sure your pokemon know Surf, Cut, and Strength.  Note that once you leave, you cannot come back for a while, so stock up!  =============================================== 12a. One Island - Friends Gather at Knot Island ===============================================  Bill will drag you to the Pokemon Net Center where his buddy, Celio, is waiting for him. After introductions are done, Celio will explain that he can't get his PC system and Bill's PC system to link up (this means that you can't use the PC until they get it done). Bill will ask you to take a Meteorite to this other guy on Two Island. Celio will then give you an extra page to your Town Map to include One, Two, and Three Islands and a Tri-Pass to let you travel between the three (if you never got the Town Map, you'll get it now, and it'll already have the extra page).  We've got things to do, though, before setting sail for Two Island. Go south and Surf around the ferry house to get to Treasure Beach. Only one Trainer here, unfortunately, and wild battles aren't the greatest, but meh.  o---------------------------------o    SwimmerF Amara | TREASURE BEACH  POKEMON LISTING |    Seel, Lv.36 (x2); Dewgong, Lv.36 o---------------------------------o    Money: 144 | Tangela       (Common)          | | Spearow       (Common)          | No new faces, but not bad for killing if | Fearow        (Common)          | you came here pre-Elite Four. | Persian       (Rare)            | o---------------------------------o  The guy here says that he comes here every so often because items get washed up on the beach. I don't know how often the items change, but you can use the Itemfinder to help you find various items. I've found Pearls, Stardusts, and Ultra Balls here. All of these can be sold for cash, but don't come here expecting to get rich off the items. There's a _much_ better spot for that.  That's all for this section. Fly back to One Island and leave east to Kindle Road. Surf east and then north.  o------------------------------o SwimmerF Abigail | KINDLE ROAD  POKEMON LISTING | Psyduck, Lv.35; Psyduck, Lv.36; Golduck, Lv.37 o------------------------------o Money: 148 | Meowth        (Uncommon)     | | Persian       (Rare)         | The only new Pokemon available for you is | Spearow       (Common)       | Ponyta. If you happen to catch its evolution, | Fearow        (Uncommon)     | Rapidash, good for you, although the Ponyta | Geodude       (Uncommon)     | here won't take much training to evolve (at | Graveler      (Rare)         | Lv.40). And there's those pesky rocks you saw | Ponyta        (Uncommon)     | in Rock Tunnel that you can't break that lace | Rapidash      (Rare)         | the path to Mt. Ember. Stupid rocks. Fret not; | Psyduck       (Uncommon, FR) | you'll be receiving the key to busting them | Slowpoke      (Rare, LG)     | very shortly. o------------------------------o  When you get to the mainland, continue to Surf up the east side. A Max Repel lies in wait. Then go back to the beginning and continue north.  Picnicker Claire Meowth, Lv.35 (x2); Pikachu, Lv.35; Clefairy, Lv.35 Money: 700  Camper Bryce Nidorino, Lv.36; Sandslash, Lv.36; Raticate, Lv.36 Money: 720  SwimmerM Garrett Shellder, Lv.35; Cloyster, Lv.35; Wartortle, Lv.38 Money: 152  Crush Kin Mik & Kia                 Black Belt Shea Machoke/Primeape, Lv.39             Machop, Lv.38; Machoke, Lv.38 Money: 1872                         Money: 912  Black Belt Hugh Machop, Lv.37; Machoke, Lv.37 Money: 888  Inside the cave is the Ember Spa, where you can use the hot springs to rest (Pokemon Center). If you're weary, just enter the middle of the hot springs to be fully restored. Talk to the old man on the north side standing in between the waterfalls for HM06, Rock Smash. This is what you need to break all those rocks you saw earlier in the game. Sometimes Pokemon will emerge from under the rocks that you smash, but they're weak. Just run. Go back and break the three vertical rocks and get an Ether. Keep going south and go up the stairs so you're on the plateau. Follow this path and break the two rocks for a Carbos.  Crush Girl Tanya Hitmonlee, Lv.38; Hitmonchan, Lv.38 Money: 912  Now continue north (heal if you need to) past the Ember Spa.  Crush Girl Sharon                   SwimmerM Finn Mankey, Lv.37; Primeape, Lv.37      Starmie, Lv.38 Money: 888                          Money: 152  SwimmerF Maria                      Fisherman Tommy Seadra, Lv.37 (x2)                  Goldeen, Lv.33 (x2); Seaking, Lv.35 (x3) Money: 148                          Money: 1260  A bit more and we finally arrive at our destination, Mt. Ember. Yay, FPV.  =============== 12a1. Mt. Ember ===============  The man you see is a Move Tutor who will teach Explosion to a lucky Pokemon.  Go to the right and you'll find two Rocket Grunts. If you've defeated the Elite Four and have the National Pokedex, they'll battle you. Otherwise, they just stand there. Either way, ignore them for now.  Use Strength and push the first rock only until you can pass and push the one to its left. Go on and battle the Trainer.  o---------------------------o  PKMN Ranger Beth | MT. EMBER POKEMON LISTING |  Bellsprout, Lv.38; Gloom, Lv.38 (x2) o---------------------------o  Money: 1368 | Machop        (Common)    | | Machoke       (Rare)      | Get Magmar and be on your way. | Magmar        (Rare)      | | Geodude       (Common)    | Continue to follow the path and you'll find two | Graveler      (Rare)      | sets of stairs, one you need to use Rock Smash | Ponyta        (Common)    | to access. Ignore that staircase for now and go | Rapidash      (Rare)      | up the "free" one and battle the Trainer that's o---------------------------o making circles.  Crush Girl Jocelyn Hitmonchan, Lv.38 (x2) Money: 912  Go up the stairs and to the right. Follow this path for a Dire Hit. Then come back to the stairs and go left instead to get jumped.  PKMN Ranger Logan Exeggcute, Lv.37; Exeggutor, Lv.37 Money: 1440  There's a hidden Ultra Ball on the last square in that small alcove by Logan.  After that, follow the very long, boring, Pokemon-filled path through Mt. Ember, and you'll emerge on the other side. Go up the stairs and follow a path left if you want an Ultra Ball. If you want a Fire Stone, first break the rock that's next to the boulder. Then go down and push the boulder, break the rock, then push the boulders out of the way. Go to the main area and up the stairs.  Push the right boulder north, and then the one next to it to the left. The rest is just pushing them out of the way. Oh, look, it's Moltres! It's been moved from its previous home in Victory Road, but it's still just as cool and just as hard to catch... bleh. If you want to capture it, be sure to save beforehand.  Moltres is Lv.50 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Endure - Survive a would-be-fatal attack with 1 HP. Fire Spin - Trap the foe for 2-5 turns. Agility - Raise user's Speed by 2 levels. Flamethrower - 10% chance of burning the foe.  You'll have to guess, but try to power hit it when it uses Endure. It might be helpful to use your power attack three or four turns after it last uses Endure, because Endure reduces in accuracy if used consecutively, and Moltres isn't stupid enough to use it twice in a row. If you can successfully trigger Endure, it'll be at 1 HP, which is ideal for capturing a legendary. Then slap a status effect other than Poison on it and start throwing anything but a Master Ball.  I did that (I chose Sleep), and all it took was one _Great_ Ball. After you catch or kill Moltres, that's the end unless you defeated the Elite Four. If you did, leave Mt. Ember, re-enter, and challenge the Grunts. Otherwise, Fly back to One Island and take the ferry to Two Island.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The rest of this section is for those who either came back after beating the Elite Four to whoop on the Grunts, or those who decided to ignore my advice to ignore these guys and get Moltres first, or whatever.  They will have finally opened up a cave on the side where they've been since who knows when. They agree to bring any treasure they find back to the Warehouse which is located somewhere, but one forgets the passwords required to get in. The other reveals that the first password is "Goldeen need log." As he's about to reveal the other code, he spots you and shuts his yap. Talk to each of them to start up a fight.  Team Rocket Grunt Cubone, Lv.37; Marowak, Lv.37 Money: 1184  Team Rocket Grunt Rattata, Lv.35; Sandshrew, Lv.35; Sandslash, Lv.35; Raticate, Lv.35 Money: 1120  They'll tell you not to go in the cave before conveniently leaving you, the enemy, unguarded. Yes, let's just listen to them and get out now...  ...nah. You'll need Strength to get through this cave.  o----------------------------o | MT. EMBER  POKEMON LISTING | o----------------------------o | Machop    (Common)         | Follow the path until you come to the boulders. | Machoke   (Rare)           | Push the boulder two squares right. Then go down | Geodude   (Common)         | and push the boulder one square right. Then go | Graveler  (Rare)           | and follow the path downwards. | Slugma    (Common) (later) | o----------------------------o  You'll come to another rock puzzle. Push the boulder one square right. Go to its north side and push the boulder down.  When you get to a fork, take the lower path. Push the boulder and go down the stairs. Follow this all the way down until you get to a room with many walls on it. On it is Braille. Each wall has three letters of the alphabet written in Braille (the single characters are the period on top and comma on bottom). If you wish to learn it, sit there and learn it. Otherwise, go down the stairs. A long Braille message and a Ruby wait for you. What does it say? Glad you asked.  EVERYTHING                  Now, what all this mumbo-jumbo _means_ is a whole HAS MEANING                 'nother story altogether.

HAS MEANING                 Push the top boulder to the right so you can push BEING ALIVE                 the bottom one left and pass downward. Follow this HAS MEANING                 and ascend the ladders to get out of the cave. HAVE DREAMS USE POWER.  Take the Ruby back to Celio. He'll ask you to go find the other gem that pairs up with the Ruby. He'll take the Tri-Pass from you and give you his own Rainbow Pass in return. This will let you visit all seven of the Sevii Islands. He'll also edit your Town Map to include Four Island through Seven Island.  Before you go anywhere else, go to Two Island and purchase a Lemonade. Don't use it; keep it in your inventory at all times.  ===================================== 12b.

He'll reteach your Pokemon's moves they've forgotten while leveling up, but only if you give him either two Tinymushrooms or one Big Mushroom. Tinymushrooms are commonly found on wild Paras, but not all the time; Big Mushrooms are a bit rarer. The easiest way to get them (Paras) is to search in Safari Zone's Center Area or Area 1. Catching around 10 of them yields 4-5 Tinymushrooms on average, from my experiences.  Next door is Two Island's Game Corner. Upon entering, a man will freak out about his daughter, Lostelle, who happens to be missing. He'll ask you to search Three Island, and a Biker barges in. Turns out he mistook this place for Three Island, and he goes peacefully on his way. You can't play any games yet, so there's nothing really to do here except leave... but wait!  o-----------------------------o | CAPE BRINK  POKEMON LISTING | o-----------------------------o | Spearow      (Common)       | | Fearow       (Uncommon)     | If you leave via the north exit, you'll end up | Meowth       (Uncommon)     | on Cape Brink.

Three Island - Kin Island of Family Bonding ================================================  Once you arrive here, you'll be able to access Bill's PC. I guess Celio and Bill got things done. Let's finish our business so we can get back.  If you haven't beaten the Elite Four yet, the cave at Three Isle Port will only contain a guy who's searching for gold. Otherwise, it'll be a long path. There's a hidden Nugget in the rock at the end of the path right before the stairs. Talk to the guy, and he'll give you another Nugget. Sweet, free money.  The patch of grass outside the door near this guy contains only Dunsparce. Go back to the main area; that's all for this little part.  Heal if you need to and try to go to the northern part of town. These dudes are being harassed by a bike gang, and you're gonna make something of it. Of course, you'll have to fight four battles in a row, but hey. They're nothing special.

He's part of Sabrina's section of the Fame Checker.  If you want a Zinc, Cut the tree and follow the path. When you're ready, head left. If you have Cut, you can cut the tree and follow the path. Press A when you're facing right one square from the edge to receive a PP Up (thanks to sizzlingq20042@gmail.com for pointing this out).  Go to Bond Bridge when ready.  o-----------------------------o Follow the path north for a double battle. | BOND BRIDGE POKEMON LISTING | o-----------------------------o  Twins Joy & Meg | Venonat    (Common)         |  Clefairy, Lv.37 (x2) | Venomoth   (Uncommon)       |  Money: 888 | Meowth     (Uncommon)       | | Persian    (Rare)           | Inside the rock is a hidden Max Repel.

When you o------------------------------o  get to the tree to Cut, stand next to the | Venonat    (Rare)            |  left of it and take two steps left, two steps | Venomoth   (Common)          |  down, and three steps left. Press A for a | Drowzee    (Rare)            |  Razz Berry. | Hypno      (Rare)            | | Pidgey     (Common)          |  Stand to the left of the tree and go straight | Pidgeotto  (Uncommon)        |  up until you're one square south of it. Press | Exeggcute  (Uncommon)        |  A for a hidden Oran Berry. | Oddish     (Uncommon, FR)    | | Gloom      (Rare, FR)        |  Cut the tree and go down all the way until | Psyduck    (Rare, FR)        |  you reach the ledge (don't Cut any trees). | Bellsprout (Rare, LG)        |  Loop around the trees and stand next to the | Weepinbell (Common, LG)      |  small, Cuttable one nearest the ledge. Take | Slowpoke   (Uncommon, LG)    |  one step right and two steps down and press A o------------------------------o  for a Persim Berry.  Now stand next to the small tree that's above the one nearest the ledge. Take seven steps up and one left. Press A for a Pinap Berry.  In the northeasternmost corner is a hidden Chesto Berry.  If you want a free Full Heal, jump the ledge here and go left. Then loop around and continue following this path until you find another tree you can Cut. Stand next to it, then take five steps right. Face up and press A for an Aspear Berry.  Go back and Cut the tree. A Max Ether sits in a corner, waiting for you.  There's a tree directly below the Max Ether. Stand below it, then take three steps down and two steps left. Press A for a Bluk Berry.  Follow the path south and you'll find a rectangle of water. Stand in the lower left corner and take two steps right. Face up and press A for a Wepear Berry.  From there, take three steps right and one up. Press A for a Cheri Berry.  Go right and go right until you hit some trees. Stand in the corner and take either one step left and face up or one step up and face left. Either way, press A for a Nanab Berry.  Continue following the path and you should see a patch of water below you. Surf across this and Cut all the trees there for a Max Elixir.  Go back to the main path. Stand below the sign and take one step down. Press A to find a Pecha Berry.  Now just follow the path north to find Lostelle. She's standing there scared because a Hypno has been, well, scaring her. She spots it coming again, and it plays Hypno's cry quite freakishly. Then a Lv.30 Hypno jumps you. Catch or kill it, and she gives you an Iapapa Berry as thanks. You'll both will then be transported to Lostelle's house back on Two Island. Talk to Lostelle's father and you'll deliver the Meteorite like Bill asked. He'll reward your valiant efforts with a Moon Stone.  Fly back to One Island and head to the Pokemon Net Center and Bill will take you back to Cinnabar. From now on, you can travel to either One, Two, or Three  Island from Vermilion Port, and you can play Pokemon Jump or Dodrio Berry- Picking on Two Island as long as you're playing with the Wireless Adapter in your GBA [SP], and you have at least one other person who has completed the Lostelle quest.  ============================================== 12d. Four Island - The Warm, Blue, Floe Island ==============================================  Metal music remix! Happiness...  Upon arriving here, Gary will talk to you. He's on his way out because he's already received a Pokemon Egg. There's also someone you both know here, and he invites you to find out who. Let's do that...  But first, we have things to do. If you have Rock Smash, then go up the western coast and smash the rock and get the Star Piece.  In the Pokemon Center, check the bookshelf for one of Daisy's entries in the Fame Checker.  Straight north and you'll find the Day-Care. This is similar to the one you found on Route 5, but they can take two Pokemon instead of one. The money cost is the same, but if your two Pokemon are in the same Egg Group, they will produce a baby of the lowest form of the female (unless a parent is Ditto; then you'll get whichever parent isn't Ditto, unless both parents are Ditto, in which case you'll get Ditto).  In the house to the right of the Day-Care are two fat guys. The man on the left is a Move Tutor who will teach a Pokemon the move Body Slam.  Head inside the PokeMart.  o-------------------------o  The old man here is part of Lorelei's section of |  FOUR ISLAND SHOP LIST  |  the Fame Checker. He'll also reveal that Four o-------------------------o  Island is Lorelei's home, and you'll be getting |  Ultra Ball......$1200  |  many entries for her while you're here. |  Full Restore....$3000  | |  Max Potion......$2500  |  Enter the house next to the PokeMart. There's a |  Revive..........$1500  |  guy with stickers who will put a sticker on your |  Ice Heal.........$250  |  Trainer card if you've got something worthy to |  Full Heal........$600  |  brag about. |  Escape Rope......$550  | |  Max Repel........$700  | o-------------------------o  To the right of the sticker house is a kid who is part of Lorelei's section of the Fame Checker. Lorelei's house contains only Poke Dolls. Go to the side of it and Surf north to find a Stardust. Then enter Icefall Cave.  Note: From now on, when you encounter a Pokemon from Johto, it will be at an extremely low level; your weakest team member will have trouble not delivering OHKOs left and right.  o------------------------------o  So _this_ is where all those Ice-types have | ICEFALL CAVE POKEMON LISTING |  been hiding... o------------------------------o | Zubat      (Uncommon)        |  Surf and enter the cave. Step over the ice. | Golbat     (Common)          |  It will crack. Step on it again and you'll | Swinub     (Uncommon)        |  fall. This is something we want to avoid | Seel       (Common)          |  (most of the time). Stand on the right side | Dewgong    (Rare)            |  and step over the ice. Pick up the Ultra Ball | Lapras     (Rare)            |  and advance using the uncracked ice. | Shellder   (Uncommon, FR)    | | Staryu     (Uncommon, LG)    |  You'll see two choices of tiles to step on. | Sneasel    (Rare, FR)        |  Fall through the top ice. Go up the ladder, | Delibird   (Rare, LG)        |  then fall through the top ice tile. Go down o------------------------------o  and right to get the Nevermeltice. Go back to the ladder and ascend it. This time, fall down the bottom hole. You'll slide on the ice until you hit a wall, so go up, right, down, left, then down to get off the ice. Go around the ladder and get the Full Restore. Go up the ladder and pick up HM07, Waterfall. Jump the ledge and go out the door.  You'll need to teach someone how to use Waterfall. If none of your Pokemon can learn it, catch someone here (Seel, Dewgong, or Lapras) or drag someone from your Box. Go up the waterfall and down the stairs.  The door is right above you! Don't jump the ledge! Go up a bit and you'll find Lorelei, who is fending off some poachers. She'll leave you to handle one, while she takes on the other two.  Team Rocket Grunt Zubat, Lv.38 (x2); Golbat, Lv.38 Money: 1216  After the fight, Lorelei threatens to freeze them unless they divulge where they've been holding the Pokemon they steal. He tries to hold out, but gives in at the last second when Lorelei's Lapras begins to use Ice Beam on him ^_^  Turns out that they're all in the Rocket Warehouse on Five Island.  We still need that second password to get in, though. Skip Five Island for now.  ================================================= 12e. Five Island - Chrono Island: Where Time Goes =================================================  If you don't have the second password for the Rocket Warehouse, leave!  Five Island is a dull, boring place. Make sure you have five Pokemon in your party and go along the west coast. Surf and maneuver your way west when you get to the Water Labyrinth. You'll end up on a spot of land with an old guy and a battle.  PKMN Breeder Alize Pikachu, Lv.48; Clefairy, Lv.48; Marill, Lv.48 Money: 1344  The guy will give you a Togepi egg if your lead Pokemon likes you.  Go back east, then north to wind up at Resort Gorgeous.  Painter Rayna                                    Lady Jacki Smeargle, Lv.50                                  Hoppip, Lv.48; Skiploom, Lv.50 Money: 800                                       Money: 10000  Youngster Destin                                 Painter Celina Raticate, Lv.48; Pidgeotto, Lv.48                Smeargle, Lv.50 Money: 768                                       Money: 800  Lady Gillian                                     Painter Daisy Mareep, Lv.47; Mareep, Lv.48; Flaaffy, Lv.49     Smeargle, Lv.50 Money: 9800                                      Money: 800  If you're hard up for cash, use the VS Seeker when Gillian, Destin, Celina, and Jacki are all on the same screen to use it to its full potential. Ten thousand money a fight, _without_ the Amulet Coin... yes please!  Enter Selphy's house and check the bookshelf for Blaine's last entry in the Fame Checker. Continue east.  SwimmerM Toby Poliwhirl, Lv.48; Tentacool, Lv.48; Tentacruel, Lv.48 Money: 192  Enter the cave.  o---------------------------o Go down the ladder and have yourself a battle. | LOST CAVE POKEMON LISTING | o---------------------------o  Ruin Maniac Lawson | Zubat      (Uncommon)     |  Onix, Lv.47; Graveler, Lv.48; Marowak, Lv.49 | Golbat     (Common)       |  Money: 2352 | Gastly     (Rare)         | | Haunter    (Rare)         | This dungeon can be very confusing because if | Murkrow    (Rare, FR)     | you take a wrong turn, you end up right back at | Misdreavus (Rare, LG)     | the beginning. Don't worry, though. o---------------------------o  Go right, then down to get a Lax Incense. Once at the entrance, go right, then up, down, up. Then you get a Sea Incense.  Go right, up, down.  Psychic Laura Natu, Lv.48 (x2); Xatu, Lv.49 Money: 980  From here, go down, right, right for a Max Revive.  From Laura's room, go down, right, left. Then go down, then right. Heal and go up. Selphy's here, and she must think you're going to rape her or something... she challenges you straight away.  Lady Selphy Persian, Lv.49 (x2) Money: 9800  She'll take you back to her house and reward you with the front door in your face, that ungrateful wench. Oh well. Run back through Lost Cave and go back to Selphy's room and steal her Silk Scarf.  If you re-enter Selphy's house, she'll ask you to show her a random Pokemon. Any Pokemon listed as ‘seen’ in your Pokedex is fair game; FireRed players may find her wanting a Vulpix, and those who picked Squirtle could end up needing a Bulbasaur (thanks to Seth Weissman for this additional information) You're also timed. I don't know how long you get, but if you waste too much time, you won't be rewarded. Show her what she wants for a Luxury Ball, Pearl, Big Pearl, Stardust, Star Piece, or Nugget (thanks to The Wierdo for additional items).    Fly back to Five Island. This time, leave east to Five Isle Meadow.  o----------------------------------o Cut the tree (see it?) and pick up the | FIVE ISLE MEADOW POKEMON LISTING | Max Potion. Continue for a battle. o----------------------------------o |  Pidgey       (Common)           |  Team Rocket Grunt |  Pidgeotto    (Uncommon)         |  Rattata, Lv.48; Grimer, Lv.48; Muk, Lv.48 |  Meowth       (Common)           |  Money: 1536 |  Persian      (Uncommon)         | |  Sentret      (Common)           | If you try to sneak past the Grunt that's |  Hoppip       (Common)           | turned the other way, she'll catch you |  Psyduck      (Rare, FR)         | anyway. |  Slowpoke     (Rare, LG)         | o----------------------------------o Also, female Rocket Grunts! Sexy!  Team Rocket Grunt Ekans, Lv.48; Gloom, Lv.48 (x2) Money: 1536   Surf east when you get to the water. Memorial Pillar isn't far off, and neither is your first battle there. Oh, and the only Pokemon here is Hoppip. Enjoy.  Bird Keeper Milo Pidgey, Lv.47; Pidgeotto, Lv.49 Money: 1176  From the upper right corner, take two steps down and press A for a Razz Berry.  Bird Keeper Chaz Spearow, Lv.47; Fearow, Lv.49 Money: 1176  Stand under Chaz. Take 4 steps down and two right. Press A for a Sitrus Berry. Stand where the berry was. Take three steps down and two left. Now press A again for a Bluk Berry.  Bird Keeper Harold Hoothoot, Lv.47; Noctowl, Lv.49 Money: 1176  Surf straight down from there and follow the path. Stand next to the man and examine the grave. If you take the Lemonade I told you to never use and place it next to the grave, he'll give you TM42, Facade. The item ball near him contains a Metal Coat, necessary for evolving your Onix or Scyther. Now backtrack all the way to Milo and return to the mainland. Surf when you get the chance and go around the left side for a PP Up. Then go back to the mainland.  Team Rocket Grunt Koffing, Lv.49; Weezing, Lv.49 Money: 1536  If you don't have the second password, you'll have to come back after completing Six Island's part of this quest.  Otherwise, you will enter the two passwords and be allowed access.  ====================== 12e1. Rocket Warehouse ======================  The monkey cage...  The direction-forcers are back. They switch directions on you mid-path, so it can get quite confusing, but take it easy. Take the only one you can take (middle top right). Step on the left arrow. Pick up the Up-Grade and fight!  Team Rocket Grunt (Female style, I love it) Houndour, Lv.49 (x2) Money: 1568  Step on the left arrow and head straight up.  Team Rocket Grunt Machop, Lv.48 (x2); Machoke, Lv.48 Money: 1536  There are three arrows pointing left. Step on the bottom of these. Follow the path for a Pearl, then make your way back to the fight you just did. Step on the arrow pointing down. Go left for a Big Pearl. Once again, go back to the fight you just did and step on the middle arrow. Maneuver around the arrows and go northeast, around the previous Grunt. Go up and claim TM36, Sludge Bomb. Now go south and fight.  Team Rocket Grunt Hypno, Lv.49 (x2) Money: 1568  Now go east and north a bit against the new enemy.  Team Rocket Admin Muk, Lv.52; Arbok, Lv.53; Vileplume, Lv.54 Money: 1728  After defeating her, she'll reverse one of the direction-forcers so if you leave, you can jump right back to this point. She says that the Admin that lies just past her far outranks her as far as Trainers go, and you'd do well to leave and come back when you're refreshed and restored. Advance when ready.  Team Rocket Admin Golbat, Lv.53; Weezing, Lv.54; Houndoom, Lv.55 Money: 1760  He'll see the Earthbadge and realize that the rumors about Team Rocket being disbanded were true. He'll vow to find Giovanni and resurrect Team Rocket, then he and all the monkeys will disperse. That just leaves one guy left; the guy who stole your Sapphire. It's pain time!  Scientist Gideon Voltorb, Lv.46; Porygon, Lv.46; Electrode, Lv.46; Magnemite, Lv.46; Magneton, Lv.46 Money: 2208  He'll fork over the Sapphire and let you go on your way. Finally, we're in possession of the other gem. Take the ferry to One Island and talk to Celio; he will install the Sapphire into the Network Machine.  Congratulations! You can now trade with Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire!  Leave and continue to re-enter and talk to Celio until he says three different things about Bill; each is an entry in Bill's section of the Fame Checker, and you should have all six after you get these three.  Cerulean Cave is now unlocked; have at it.  You can also challenge the Elite Four and their brand-new teams any time you like. Lorelei's lowest level Pokemon is Lv.64, so be prepared.  When you get time, revisit Rocket Warehouse and talk to Gideon for Giovanni's final entry in the Fame Checker.  =============================================== 12f. Six Island - Fortune Island of Aged Wisdom ===============================================  Ah, Olivine City. I miss Jasmine - she's sexy, too.  Enter the Pokemon Center and Gary will talk to you. He'll inquire how your Pokedex is doing, as always. He'll note how there's no way to fill up the Pokedex, and there must be a way to fill it with Pokemon from far away...  He decides to call it quits and heads for home.  In the PokeMart, the old lady is part of Agatha's section of the Fame Checker.  o-------------------------o  Hey, just like Four Island. |  SIX ISLAND  SHOP LIST  | o-------------------------o  Well, that's all for the actual town. Now go east |  Ultra Ball......$1200  |  to Water Path.

If you'd like to continue with this quest, head south. Because the path is shorter, I'll list the path to Altering Cave first. Pick a path and take it.

Stand behind the house so you're directly behind the door. Take two steps left and one step up. Press A for a free Oran Berry.  If you want an Elixir, go to the northeast corner and Surf the path.  Go west into Green Path when you're ready; Pattern Bush lies dead ahead.  o------------------------------o Straight up! | PATTERN BUSH POKEMON LISTING | o------------------------------o  Youngster Cordell | Caterpie     (Common)        |  Farfetch'd, Lv.48 (x2) | Metapod      (Uncommon)      |  Money: 768 | Weedle       (Common)        | | Kakuna       (Uncommon)      | There really is no linear path, so I'm going | Spinarak     (Common)        | to list the Trainers starting from the right | Ledyba       (Common)        | and going left... | Heracross    (Rare)          | o------------------------------o if you can't follow it, too bad!

SwimmerM Mymo Kingler, Lv.49; Wartortle, Lv.49 Money: 196  After fighting that guy, surf to the right and follow that path for a PP Up, as well as another battle.  Fisherman Tylor Qwilfish, Lv.49 (x2) Money: 1764  Now go left instead. You'll see a Grunt (waste him) and Altering Cave.  Team Rocket Grunt Muk, Lv.48; Golbat, Lv.48; Raticate, Lv.48 Money: 1536  In this cave resides millions upon millions of Zubat. Why? See section 13e.  When you've had your fill of Zubat, Fly back to the island. Make sure you bring someone that knows Cut. When you get to Edward, go south instead. See the dark patch in the middle of the short grass in the middle of the tall grass? Press A while facing it for a Pinap Berry.  o----------------------------o | WATER PATH POKEMON LISTING | o----------------------------o | Spearow      (Common)      | | Fearow       (Uncommon)    | | Oddish       (Common, FR)  | | Gloom        (Rare, FR)    | | Psyduck      (Rare, FR)    | | Bellsprout   (Common, LG)  | | Weepinbell   (Rare, LG)    | | Slowpoke     (Rare, LG)    | o----------------------------o  Right before the stairs, there's another dark patch.

Go back and see that the path splits in two. On the left side is an HP Up that some boulders are guarding. Move them out of the way. Then take the path on the right. It's pretty straightforward, so just keep following this path.  Pokemaniac Hector                     Ruin Maniac Stanly Rhyhorn, Lv.49; Kangaskhan, Lv.49     Graveler, Lv.48 (x2); Onix, Lv.48 Money: 2352                           Money: 2304  Ruin Maniac Foster                    Ruin Maniac Larry Golem, Lv.50                          Machoke, Lv.49 (x2) Money: 2400                           Money: 2352  You will wind up at a door if you go left. You can't open it, but there's a Braille inscription on it. It reads:  CUT  Simple, huh? Use Cut and enter Dotted Hole.  The only Pokemon in this cave is Zubat!  Fall down the hole and you'll see four holes. Like Lost Cave before it, you'll wind up at the beginning if you take the wrong path. The Braille in the center is "UP," so take the top hole.  Braille says "LEFT." Guess which hole you take? Left.  Braille in this room says "RIGHT." Do what it says and take the right hole.  And we come to a room that says "DOWN." Go down. You'll end up in a room with the Sapphire and a long Braille message that reads:  LET THE TWO GLITTERING STONES ONE IS RED ONE IS BLUE CONNECT THE PAST. TWO FRIENDS SHARING POWER OPEN A WINDOW TO A NEW WORLD THAT GLOWS. THE NEXT WORLD WAITS FOR YOU.  Examine the Sapphire and a Rocket Scientist will drop from above and take it. He'll tell you the other password to the Rocket Warehouse: "Yes, nah, Chansey."  Palindromes. <3  That's all for Six Island. Let's chase us some monkeys. To Five Island!  ============================================ 12g. Seven Island - Quest Island of Infinity ============================================  This is the last of the Sevii Islands.

This is |   Graveler     (Rare)          | Tanoby Key, and you need to complete the |   Marowak      (Rare)          | rock puzzle in order to gain access to the |   Onix         (Rare)          | Tanoby Ruins. The object is simple, but the |   Sentret      (Common)        | process is not; push the boulders into the |   Phanpy       (Common)        | little indents that look like holes. You can |   Larvitar     (Uncommon)      | walk over them, so don't think they're holes |   Skarmory     (Rare, FR)      | (you won't fall through). Okay, this is how |   Cubone       (Rare)          | you do it: o--------------------------------o  Go around the four boulders at the beginning. Activate Strength and push the boulder in the middle straight up. Next, loop around and push one of the boulders next to the indent so it's in the middle under the first boulder you just pushed. Push this boulder up and all the way to one side so it falls in an indent. Repeat this process with the boulder across from the second one you pushed. Now go in between the four boulders at the entrance and push the bottom two off to the side. Jump the ledge and push those two up into the indents. Now push one of the two remaining boulders to the middle, up, and into a hole; do the same with the final one. You'll hear a rumble sound - leave the cave.  If you've got Rock Smash, you can skip this next battle.  Tamer Evan Sandslash, Lv.48; Ursaring, Lv.49; Lickitung, Lv.48 Money: 1960  Do you see the Max Elixir lying on the ground?

Cooltrainer Michelle Persian, Lv.47; Dewgong, Lv.47; Girafarig, Lv.50; Rapidash, Lv.48; Ninetales, Lv.48 Money: 1800  You'll wind up at the Tanoby Ruins after this.

If you did the islands in order (excepting Five and Six), you can do the Trainer Tower if you haven't done it already, go rechallenge the Elite Four again (new Pokemon, higher levels, new movesets), fill the Pokedex, or catch Mewtwo if you haven't already.  ================ 13. Sevii Extras ================  These are all side quests of some sort that are based in the Sevii Islands.  =========================== 13a. Two Island Game Corner ===========================  You can play games here only if you have at least two people who have completed the Lostelle quest (section 12b for more info), and those two people _must_ have the Wireless Adapter that came with the game connected.  There are only two games here for you to play; Pokemon Jump and Dodrio Berry- Picking. In Pokemon Jump, each player selects a Pokemon that qualifies and jumps a vine rope connected by two Venusaur. First person to trip up loses.  What Pokemon qualify? Anything that is 28 inches or less (2'4") and can actually jump easily (so nothing that can't jump (Diglett) or swims (Seel)).

If they suck, so will you.  To my dismay, I have found out that you need three people to play Dodrio Berry- Picking. Since I do not have two other people to play this with, I cannot write a section on it. I appeal to you, the reader, for assistance.  ====================== 13b. Heracross Fangirl ======================  She's on Water Path just north of Six Island's mainland... she wants you to show her any Heracross that you catch so she can measure them. Every time you beat your current length (show her a bigger Heracross than last time), you will receive a Nest Ball. There is no way to figure out Heracross' length. You'll just have to guess.  ================== 13c. Trainer Tower ==================  Found north of Seven Island, the Trainer Tower is a disappointing Battle Tower.  But first we have to get there! You'll need Surf (not a problem, right?).  Psychic Rodette Natu, Lv.48; Drowzee, Lv.48; Hypno, Lv.50 Money: 1000  Stand to the left of the sign and take one step left. Press A for a Pearl.  Psychic Dario Girafarig, Lv.52 Money: 1040  o--------------------------o The Trainer Tower is a bit different from the | TRAINER TOWER SHOP LIST  | Battle Tower that you may or may not be familiar o--------------------------o with. In the old Battle Tower, you would fight a |  Ultra Ball.......$1200  | series of seven consecutive battles, each fight |  Great Ball........$600  | (sometimes) being more difficult than the last, |  Full Restore.....$3000  | and your Pokemon would be healed after each fight. |  Max Potion.......$2500  | If you defeat the seven Trainers, you would be |  Hyper Potion.....$1200  | rewarded with an item that you usually couldn't |  Revive...........$1500  | find anywhere else. You would then continue to |  Full Heal.........$600  | battle Trainers, seven at a time, until you lost, |  Escape Rope.......$550  | with the prizes getting better after a while. |  Max Repel.........$700  | o--------------------------o Not so with the Trainer Tower.  The goal here is to make it through eight floors of Trainers to the owner who waits at the top. There are four modes for you to play; Single, Double, Knockout, and Mixed.  In Single mode, you will each bring out one Pokemon, just like you've been doing the entire game.  Double mode means you participate in double battles (2-on-2).  In Knockout mode, you will fight three Trainers on each floor who each have one Pokemon. The catch is that you can't heal between the three fights.  Mixed mode holds single, double, and knockout battles.  Each Pokemon you battle here will have the level of your strongest Pokemon, so if you have an unbalanced team, it's not recommended to fight here.  If you make it to the top, you'll have to exit and re-enter to challenge again.  Also, a * after a Pokemon's name means that it's Shining. Why the programmers made them Shining, I'll never know.  You can only get each item once!

Sticker Dude =================  Found on Four Island, this guy will put stickers on the back of your Trainer Card based on you completing certain events a certain number of times. There are only three stickers: one for beating the Elite Four, one for hatching an Egg, and one for battling in the Direct Corner (linkplay).  The stickers can be upgraded to different colors after you do each task a certain number of times:  o--------------------o---o-----o-----o-----o | ELITE FOUR DEFEATS | 1 |  40 | 100 | 200 | o--------------------o---o-----o-----o-----o    (thanks to The Wierdo |    EGGS HATCHED    | 1 | 100 | 200 | 300 |     for this information) o--------------------o---o-----o-----o-----o |  LINK BATTLES WON  | 1 |  20 |  50 | 100 | o--------------------o---o-----o-----o-----o  To rack up defeats of the Elite Four, simply bring in a bunch of Lv.100s for quick wins.  Magikarp Eggs only take 1,280 steps to hatch. Get breeding ;)  For linkplay, have one person bring in one low-level, weak Pokemon; the other should use their normal team. This makes for fast and easy points towards your goal.   ================== 13e. Altering Cave ==================  Found north of Six Island, this cave is somewhat of a mystery. At first glance, it seems that the only Pokemon to be found here is Zubat. However, a closer look reveals that there are many Pokemon that are only found here, including Pineco, Stantler, and Smeargle.  How does one access these hidden Pokemon?  You don't.  Altering Cave is the end result of a cave that probably would have had the Pokemon in it change each time you used Mystery Gift. They scrapped the idea because all the Pokemon you can find there you can either get from Colosseum or the upcoming Pokemon Emerald. Since there would be no point to Mystery Gift if you could just get the Pokemon elsewhere, they hid the data, filled the cave with Zubat, and just left it there to look pretty.  ================= 14. Miscellaneous =================  The area for those misfits that just can't go anywhere else.  ================== 14a. Effort Values ==================  To be a serious battler, one must know about the sometimes-not-so-wonderful world of effort values, or "EVs" for short. In a nutshell, EVs are part of what make your Pokemon unique. Each and every Pokemon that you capture starts with 0 effort points. At maximum, a Pokemon can earn 512 effort points. You can allocate these 512 points in almost any way you choose in each stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense), with the max points for one stat being 252. The more you put into one stat, the stronger it will be. You don't have very much control over effort values at the start of the game, but once you've earned the National Pokedex and gained access to the Day- Care on Four Island, a whole slew of possibilities open up. I'll go step-by- step with you and help you create a Pokemon that's perfect for your style.  The first thing you must do is decide on a good nature for your Pokemon. Some Pokemon have several good options for natures, and others are what one would call "duh" natures because there's usually only one decent choice.  Each of the 25 natures can be found in section 1j, but for the sake of this section, I'll post them again:    Hardy: (no change)        Bold: +DEF, -ATK            Timid: +SPD, -ATK  Lonely: +ATK, -DEF       Docile: (no change)           Hasty: +SPD, -DEF   Brave: +ATK, -SPD      Relaxed: +DEF, -SPD          Serious: (no change) Adamant: +ATK, -SP.ATK    Impish: +DEF, -SP.ATK         Jolly: +SPD, -SP.ATK Naughty: +ATK, -SP.DEF       Lax: +DEF, -SP.DEF         Naive: +SPD, -SP.DEF               Modest: +SP.ATK, -ATK          Calm: +SP.DEF, -ATK                Mild: +SP.ATK, -DEF        Gentle: +SP.DEF, -DEF               Quiet: +SP.ATK, -SPD         Sassy: +SP.DEF, -SPD             Bashful: (no change)         Careful: +SP.DEF, -SP.ATK                Rash: +SP.ATK, -SP.DEF     Quirky: (no change)  Let's use a Growlithe as an example. We caught a Growlithe, but it has a Quirky nature. Quirky is neutral Special Defense. That isn't too bad, but we can probably do better than that. Keep in mind that a neutral nature isn't always a bad thing; it's a good choice for those without a lot of patience (like me).  My personal breeding method is to drop off all Pokemon in the Box and then carry five Eggs with me. After they all hatch, I choose the best nature of the five and then release the rest (unless one's Shining).  So we hatch five Growlithe eggs and get Impish, Naughty, Brave, Serious, and Modest for natures. Let's see what they do. Impish is +Def, -Sp.Atk. Growlithe is weak to two physical types and one special type. The increase in Defense could be useful, but it hinders Growlithe's ability to use its Fire-type attacks to their fullest because of the decrease in Special Attack. We'll set that one aside and take a look at the next nature, Naughty. Growlithe is a Fire-type, so it doesn't need the +Attack bonus. The Special Defense drop can hurt Growlithe, as it would increase damage done from its special weakness. This one's trash, so release it. A look at Brave shows that it is +Atk, -Speed. Speed is very, _very_ important in battling, so unless your name is Golem, Magcargo, Torkoal, Camerupt, or Whiscash, don't ever have a -Speed nature. Release this monstrosity at once. Take a gander at the fourth baby, Serious in nature. Serious is neutral Speed. A neutral-natured Pokemon is good to have if you just can't get the one you want. We'll keep this one, too. On to the last Growlithe, which is Modest. Modest is +Sp.Atk, -Atk. This is the opposite of Adamant, and might be the best nature you can use of the five example eggs we just hatched.  We eliminated two of the five eggs. We're left with Impish (+DEF, -SP.ATK), Serious (+SPD, -SPD), and Modest (+SP.ATK, -ATK). Now you have to think ahead as to what your Growlithe's moveset is going to be. If it's going to play on its type and burn the competition down with Fire-type attacks, you'll want to go with Modest. If you're going to use her as an annoyer of sorts, and not so much straight damage, Impish may be your best bet. Keep in mind that these are just examples: Growlithe is one of those Pokemon that have several different possibilities as far as natures go. We'll do a basic special sweeper Arcanine, and that involves Special Attack. Modest it is.  Alright, we finally have our Growlithe, and we know its nature. All that's left is to level it up to get ready for battle. But wait! You can't just go around defeating any Pokemon you want. This is the difficult part, and it takes a long time to do if you're unlucky.  Each Pokemon, when killed, gives the Pokemon that killed it one, two, or three points in one stat. These are effort points, the things you're looking for. For example, killing a Pidgey (at any level) will give 1 Speed point. Four Pidgey  killed, four Speed points. Get it? Okay. The spots below offer the best training (in my opinion) for any given stat; feel free to utilize them or you can e-mail me a spot of your own.  HIT POINTS (HP) ---------------  You must have the National Pokedex. Go through the cave at Three Isle Port. The patch of grass there only contains Dunsparce, which gives 1 point.  Average level: 15  ATTACK ------  Enter Mt. Moon and go down the first ladder. Stay here to only encounter Paras, which gives 1 point.  Average level: 8  DEFENSE -------  Metapod and Kakuna in Viridian Forest or Pattern Bush both give 2 points, but they're pretty uncommon. If that doesn't suit your fancy, try Geodude in Mt. Moon, which gives 1 point. At higher levels, you can kill Tangela south of Pallet Town, one point each.  Average level: 5 (Viridian Forest), 9 (Pattern Bush), 11 (Mt. Moon),                21 (Route 21)  SPEED -----  If your Pokemon are weak, you can fight Pidgey and Rattata on Route 1. Each gives 1 point. When you're a bit higher in level, you can take on Diglett's Cave if you want. Diglett gives 1 point, Dugtrio gives 2 points.  Average level: 3 (Route 1), 24 (Diglett's Cave)  SPECIAL ATTACK --------------  Pokemon Tower. Gastly gives 1, Haunter gives 2. Cubone gives 1 Defense point, but you don't have to worry about them much, as they are quite rare. Just flee.  Average level: 19  SPECIAL DEFENSE ---------------  Surf in just about any body of water to find Tentacool (1 point).   Average level: Varies  But wait! There's more!  There are two ways to make EV training easier. The first is with the Macho Brace. This hold item doubles the effort points you get, but lowers the Speed of the Pokemon holding it for as long as the Pokemon holds it. Use the Itemfinder while standing on the exact spot where Giovanni stood in Viridian City Gym to get the Macho Brace. That's the easy part.  And then there's the Pokemon virus, or Pokerus for short. Pokerus is shown as PKRS on the Summary Screen (and only there), and you can find it where a status effect would normally be shown (it'll only appear if there is no status). This will also double effort points gained from a battle. For example, for every Diglett your Pokemon slaughters, it gets 1 point in Speed. If the slaughterer is infected with PKRS, it would receive double the points, or 2. Now let's say that this certain Pokemon is equipped with the Macho Brace for double points again, or 4. This means that Diglett will give you 4 Speed points every time you kill it, instead of one. Assuming all you run into is Diglett, and you always kill it in one shot, it would take you about 20-30 minutes to complete Speed EV training.  So... how to get it?  It's very hard to catch Pokerus (you have better chances of seeing a Shining Pokemon). Nurse Joy will tell you that your Pokemon have been infected after healing at a Pokemon Center, and it should go away shortly. YOU DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. Here's how to preserve it.  When initially told you've been infected, your entire party will be infected. Catch a Pokemon you don't care about (henceforth referred to as Pichu). Let Pichu sit on your team for a while. Participate in a few battles and wait for Pichu to become infected. Then all you do is deposit Pichu in the box (if you have more than one Pichu, mark the infected Pichu with all four marks so you know that's the one you want) and wait until you need to EV train someone else. As long as Pichu sits in the box, PKRS will never go away. You might want to infect multiple Pichu in the event your PKRS mysteriously vanishes from one before you get a chance to put it back, as a safeguard of sorts.  Like I said, it's _extremely_ rare to get Pokerus. Some people are just lucky, though, and get it almost right away. Others can have a box full of Shining Pokemon and still not have Pokerus. Don't waste your time trying to get it.  That should do it. Any questions, comments, anything at all, e-mail me.  ======================= 14a1. Individual Values =======================  I had once thought the world of individual values (IVs) to be complex and reserved only for the best, but according to Andy Huynh, it's quite simple:  "Each stat has a hidden value (not EVs) from 0-31. At level 100 each IV is equal to 1 extra stat point. IVs are created when the pokemon is generated and can not be changed"  How to figure out your Pokemon's IVs? It's a lengthy process. See the section below to see how, as well as finding Hidden Power's type and base power.  ====================================== 14a2. Calculating IVs and Hidden Power ======================================  Andy Huynh is a smart guy. This section is all him, with minor things added by me to make it fit and to possibly make it a bit more user-friendly. I am taking credit for this in no way; this information was given to me by him.  The formula to calculate IVs is  Hit Points ( ( Stat - level - 10) x 100 / level ) - 2 x base stat ( EVs / 4* )  Other Stats ( ( ( Stat / Nature Value** ) - 5 ) x 100 / Level ) - 2 x Base Stat             - ( EVs / 4*)  * means to remove the remainder ** replace with: if the nature adds 10% to the stat (or multiply by 1.1) if the nature has no effect to the stat (1) if the nature subtracts 10% to the stat (0.9)  Round the answer (to the nearest whole number)  o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o  Hidden power type and power depends on IVs. The type can be anything but normal, and power can be between 30 and 70 including 30 and 70. The formula is:  For Type  ( A + B + C + D + E + F ) x 15 / 63  A=( Hp IV if = odd)1                        even)0 B=( Atk IV if = odd)2                        even)0 C=( Def IV if = odd)4                        even)0 D=( Spd IV if = odd)8                        even)0 E=( S.A IV if = odd)16                        even)0 F=( S.D IV if = odd)32                        even)0  Round the answer (to the nearest whole number)  if the answer is: 0, then the type is Fighting 1, then the type is Flying 2, then the type is Poison 3, then the type is Ground 4, then the type is Rock 5, then the type is Bug 6, then the type is Ghost 7, then the type is Steel 8, then the type is Fire 9, then the type is Water 10, then the type is Grass 11, then the type is Electric 12, then the type is Psychic 13, then the type is Ice 14, then the type is Dragon 15, then the type is Dark.  For Base Power  ( A + B + C + D + E + F ) * 40 / 63 + 30  A=( Hp IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )1                                                        0 or 1 )0  (in other words, if when you divide the IV by 4, the remainder is 2 or 3, substitute A with 1 in this case; otherwise, use 0)  B=( Atk IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )2                                                        0 or 1 )0 C=( Def IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )4                                                        0 or 1 )0 D=( Spd IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )8                                                        0 or 1 )0 E=( S.A IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )16                                                        0 or 1 )0 F=( S.D IV if divided by 4 remainder equals 2 or 3 )32                                                        0 or 1 )0 Round the answer and thats the base power o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o  Simply amazing. Thanks, Andy.  Extra note: Andy suggests that you find out IVs at higher levels (Lv.100 is optimal, since stats can no longer be increased) because at lower levels, your IVs can be inaccurate.  ================ 14b.

The Trainer Card =====================  The Trainer Card is an item of sorts that has lots of things on it. Its main use is to keep track of the things that you've done. Open the menu and select your name to bring up the front of your Trainer Card.  In the upper right corner, you'll see your Trainer ID Number. This number will be assigned to all Pokemon that you catch, and any Pokemon that's _given_ to you (like Eevee), not _traded_, will have this number as well, even though it shouldn't. While you're getting it for nothing, someone had to catch that Eevee, and it certainly wasn't you if you're being presented with one.  Colosseum had the right idea (Duking's Plusle).  Below that, you will find your name. Below that is the amount of money you currently have, and below that is your Pokedex completion level. Below that is the time you've spent on your current adventure in the format hours:minutes.  On the very bottom, you'll find pictures of each of the Badges you've earned.  Press A to flip it over.  At the beginning, this entire side is blank. However, at the end of the game, you can fill it with lots of things.  In the upper left hand corner, there is room for three Stickers. These Stickers can be obtained at Four Island in a house next to the PokeMart. There are three Stickers for you to get: one for defeating the Elite Four, one for hatching an Egg, and one for battling in the Direct Corner against a friend.  There are five blanks below that. The top one is for your initial Hall of Fame induction time, in the format hours:minutes:seconds. The one below that is your linkplay record. Next is the number of trades you've made with friends in the Direct Corner, and after that is the amount of times you've traded and battled in the Union Room. The last line contains how many times you've crushed berries with friends.  Below all that you see six Poke Ball prints. If you go to the Celadon City Game Corner and examine the machine in the lower right corner, you'll be able to get the sprites of your current team planted on the card in each of those spots. There are four different styles to choose from: Normal, Black, Pink, and Sepia.  Save before you pick. There's no way to remove the prints. You can save over them with a new method, but there's no way to simply get rid of them.  Normal will get you the normal sprites for each of your Pokemon. Normal colors are used. Black means the whole sprite will be black, which looks like a silhouette of your Pokemon's sprite. If you choose pink, your Pokemon's sprite will be colored in pink tones instead of normal. Sepia gets you a picture similar to old-fashioned real-life photos that have that dull-looking brownish color to it, know what I mean?  All this can be yours for the low, low price of 50 money per print.  That about wraps it up for the Trainer Card.  ================= 14e. Fame Checker =================  You get the Fame Checker after defeating Gary at Nugget Bridge. What this thing does is let you recall things that have been said about famous people. Anything that talks about a certain person will add that thing to the Fame Checker, whether it be a sign, a person, or a piece of paper on the wall. If you get all six entries for anyone, you can read a message directed at you from the person you completed. Read this by pressing Start instead of A on the person's name.  Here's the format.     Location: Where this entry is located      Person: Doesn't always mean a person, but what exactly gives it to you    Checking: Subject of the entry Information: What the entry says  How to get: How to put this entry into the Fame Checker  Special Message: The message you get after completing a section  (after Elite Four) means you must defeat the Elite Four at least once before this entry will become available.

For completing the Fame Checker, you don't get anything. Hooray.  ================= 14f. Mystery Gift =================  Go to any PokeMart and examine the sheet of paper on the counter. Enter "LINK TOGETHER" on the top and "WITH ALL" on the bottom, in that order. Save your game and you'll be able to access Mystery Gift on the file select screen.  However, it's quite different than we all remember in the metal games. What you do is take your game and Wireless Adapter to a "Wonderspot." This is not in the game; it is an actual machine in real life.  Wonderspots were at the various Pokemon Rocks America locations. They may be adding them to various stores (across the country?), but nothing is known.  Once at a Wonderspot. turn your game on (make sure the Wireless Adapter is connected correctly) and access Mystery Gift. There are two options: Wonder Cards and Wonder News. Select Wonder Cards. If you don't have the Auroraticket yet, it will let you get one. Select Wireless Communication and the Wonderspot machine will give you an Auroraticket of your very own.  Here's the best part. Chances are high that a good number of Pokemon players do not have the real-life means to actually _get_ to a Wonderspot and obtain the Auroraticket. If you can, it gives you that option. Just select "Wireless Communication" and there you go. If you're one of those unlucky folks who can't get to one (like me), the second option, "Friend," is, well... your friend. If you choose this, you can get an Auroraticket from a friend who either has gotten one from a friend him/herself or has visited a Wonderspot and obtained one. Isn't that neat? Yeah, it is.  So what to do with this Auroraticket? Well, check section 14h.  I believe the Mysticticket, the key to Navel Rock, works in the same way.  Bear in mind that this is all speculation; I'm pretty much guessing how the Wonderspots would work. If I'm wrong, by all means, correct me.  =============== 14g. Navel Rock ===============  When the Mysticticket is yours, you can go to Navel Rock, where _both_ Lugia and Ho-oh are waiting for you. Pokemon of at least Lv.60 is recommended. Bring the usual Special Condition inflicter and your bottomless sack of Ultra Balls. Fly to Vermilion City, head to the port, and talk to the guy. He'll acknowledge the Mysticticket and will allow you to go to Navel Rock.  Enter the cave. There are no items or other Pokemon here.  Go down the two ladders. The path is very long and leads to a fork which will take you to another path that takes you to Lugia and Ho-oh. The initial path splits twice to more long paths that ultimately net you a wall in the face (dead end), so stay on the main path and go straight up until you get to the left-right split.  If you want Ho-oh, go left. If you want Lugia, go right.  For Ho-oh, go up 5 ladders and head up. Ho-oh commences attack.  Ho-oh is Lv.70 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Sunny Day - Fire-type damage is multiplied by 150% for 5 turns. Swift - Never misses as long as the foe is on screen. Fire Blast - 10% chance of burning the foe. Recover - Restore 50% of user's maximum HP.  Double weak to Rock damage. Sunny Day puts Thunder's accuracy down the tubes, so avoid using that move. Fire Blast is going to put the hurt on your Pokemon when combined with Sunny Day and Ho-oh's already fantastic Special Attack. Bust out a powerful Rock-type and perform weak attacks. Taunt will be very helpful here, as it prevents the use of Sunny Day and more importantly, Recover.  Upon capture or defeat, stand where Ho-oh attacked and use the Itemfinder to receive the Sacred Ash, which is a Max Revive for your entire party. It's the only one in the game, so don't ever use it. If you manage to defeat or capture Ho-oh without getting the crap kicked out of you, should shouldn't ever need to.  For Lugia, go down an annoying 12 ladders. Lugia sits in front of you.  Lugia is Lv.70 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  Rain Dance - Water-type damage is multiplied by 150% for 5 turns. Swift - Never misses as long as the foe is on screen. Hydro Pump - No added effects. Recover - Restore 50% of user's maximum HP.  Lugia is Psychic/Flying in type, so it has no double weaknesses. Luckily, it doesn't get STAB for its only powerful attack, so it will hurt less. Don't take it lightly, though. Rain Dance powers it up and it gains even more strength from Lugia's Special Attack. Anything that resists Water will do fine here.  That's all for Navel Rock.  ================= 14h. Birth Island =================  Once you have the Auroraticket, you can go to Birth Island where the "never- before-seen" Pokemon Deoxys makes its home. As always, make sure you have a Pokemon that can inflict a Special Condition other than Burn and Poison and you're in possession of lots of Ultra Balls. Fly to Vermilion City and go to the port. The guy will notice your Auroraticket and offer to take you to Birth Island. Contrary to popular belief, you can visit this place an infinite number of times. The real nifty thing about Deoxys is that it has four different forms, depending on which game you're playing (Ruby & Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, or Emerald).  The Ruby & Sapphire-flavored Deoxys is average, for the most part. No stat is too greater than any other. You can't catch Deoxys in these games, though. You'll have to trade it from the three games listed below.  FireRed players are blessed with a Deoxys that's built for a quick assault. Its Attack and Special Attack stats are through the roof, while it leaves both defense stats in the crapper. Its Speed is decent.  Those with LeafGreen get a Deoxys with the armor of a thousand soldiers. This particular version has extremely high Defense and Special Defense, but its attack stats leave something to be desired. Like the FireRed one, this Deoxys' Speed isn't too shabby.  And then there's Emerald. Yet to be released in America (5/1/05!), Pokemon Emerald has its very own version of Deoxys. This one excels in Speed, making it the fastest Pokemon ever. What about Ninjask, you say? Well, after one turn, Speed Boost will still make Ninjask faster than Deoxys. All other stats are balanced, for the most part.  And if you trade Deoxys between versions, its stats will change to match the version you traded it to! I bet that took a while to script.  Unlike most legendaries, it's not exactly that easy to fight anymore.  If you're playing FireRed, Pokemon of above Lv.40 is recommended. If you're playing LeafGreen, Pokemon of at least Lv.30 will do fine.  When you get to the island, you will first notice that there is no music. Your GBA [SP] isn't broken, so don't dismantle it or anything to try and fix it.  You'll also see a triangle-shaped plot of land and a black triangle in dead center. Your job is to manipulate the movements of this triangle so it ends up one square above center, but red instead of black. As long as you don't turn unnecessarily (you have to start over if you turn even once out of line), you can simply walk to the triangle as it moves. When you touch the triangle, press A to move it to another location.  Start at the bottom of the triangle. One step down and all the way left. Three steps right and all the way up. Five steps down and all the way right. Three steps up and all the way left. All the way right. Two steps left and all the way down. One step down and all the way left. All the way right. Three steps left and face down.  This will make the triangle red and one square above center. Now you can save. If you step on the dock, you'll have to start over. Examine the triangle one more time. The ground will shake and the triangle explodes. Deoxys will attack.  Deoxys is Lv.30 when you attack it. Here's its moveset:  FireRed -------  Taunt - Foe can only use moves that cause direct damage for two turns. Psychic - 10% chance of lowering the foe's Special Defense by 1 level. Superpower - Lowers user's Attack and Defense by 1 level. Pursuit - Doubles in base power if used on a foe that's switching out.  LeafGreen ---------  Spikes - Each new foe's entry takes 3-4% HP in damage. Can be used three times. Snatch - Steal the foe's recovery or stat-boosting attack. Psychic - 10% chance of lowering the foe's Special Defense by 1 level. Knock Off - Foe drops held item. This item is returned after the battle.  You'll notice that no matter which version you have, Deoxys has its Ruby & Sapphire battle sprite when you encounter it. This isn't a glitch. It was intentional, and it will change to the appropriate sprite upon capture. In fact, Deoxys already has the stats of your respective version, so battle it with that in mind.  Assuming your levels are around 40, FireRed's Deoxys can rip you apart in seconds with Psychic. Don't forget: there's _monster_ Special Attack backing it up. It puts Dark-types to shame with Superpower, one of the most powerful Fighting-type attacks. If your Pokemon are below Lv.50, it's suggested to get out and train until you pass that mark or get very close to it so you'll have less trouble. Otherwise, you can get a high-level Xatu. Catch Natu, its pre- evolution, in Ruin Valley. Inflict your condition and throw, throw, throw. Not much else to say.  When compared to FireRed's Deoxys, the one in LeafGreen seems wimpy. Its only threat is Psychic, and doesn't have the raw power that the FireRed one has to inflict massive damage. However, Deoxys is still a legendary Pokemon, and Psychic is still capable of hurting. Pursuit, oh no. No STAB means weak damage. At any rate, you can easily beat its HP into the red and toss until it's yours.  That's all for Birth Island.  ========================== 14i. Solution to Lost Cave ==========================  Count the number of rocks in the room you're in. Treat them as clock numbers.  Three rocks, right; six rocks, down; nine rocks, left; twelve rocks, up.  ================ 15. Matt's Moves ================  The following attacks are various moves I've created, or moves I'd like to see in future games. NONE OF THESE ATTACKS EXIST. I feel like I have to say this, because there will probably be someone who thinks that Venonat will learn the move Annoyance at some point and will write me hate mail because I lied to them and was just oh-so-confused as to why their Venonat didn't learn Annoyance.  If you'd like to contribute an attack to this list, you must e-mail me with all criteria present for all the moves already listed here. If you miss any of it, your attack will not be posted. Also, keep in mind that I won't post every single attack you may send me, but ones I think have thought put into them. If the attack does something out of battle, be sure to include that, too, but if I think it's a stupid effect (like if you created a move that would let you fly over all terrain for a certain amount of time), I'll just ignore it.  Again, they're listed in alphabetical order, for future reference.  Name: Annoyance Type: Bug Power: --- Accuracy: 90 Effect: Poisons both foes. 20% chance the poison will be deadly (Toxic).

Version History ===================  Version 0.1 - November 3, 2004 Initial release. I hate relying on other people, but I must, and so this walkthrough isn't "complete" yet. I need Gary's Lv.75 Blastoise's moveset, as well as information on Dodrio Berry-Picking. Help is appreciated.  Version 0.2 - December 17, 2004 Lots of changes...the Scyther/Pinsir thing has been fixed. Two new sites have been added. People have submitted a few attacks. I've found and added the 100 Coins in the Game Corner. Information on individual values has been added. Information on calculating IVs and Hidden Power's type and base power has been added. Gary's Lv.75 Blastoise moveset has been given and added. I can't think of anything else. I could use some information regarding Dodrio Berry-Picking, as I will never be able to play it myself.  Version 0.3 - January 13, 2005 A couple moves have been added, some stupid errors have been fixed.  Version 0.4 - February 2, 2005 Added some moves... that might be all. Go check. If you’ve submitted an error to me, I might have fixed it, unless I forgot. Just thought I could use an update.  Version 0.5 – April 18, 2005 Right, thought it was time for an update. Lots of submissions and changes.  ==================== 17. Acknowledgements ====================  Me - I made this thing. I should think I deserve a substantial amount of credit.
