Why are the leaves on my Nellie Stevens Holly lime green?
In April I planted 8 Nellie Stevens holly. All are growing well. However, 1 has leaves that are a much lighter shade of green than the others. Seven have the typical dark green leaves.  This one is almost lime green throughout. No leaf spotting or other damage. Just a uniform light green shade. What would cause this?  The leaves of all 8 plants were dark green when I bought them -- all in 3 gallon containers.
