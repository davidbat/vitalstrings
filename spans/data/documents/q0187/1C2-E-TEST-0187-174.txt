Photosynthesis
Plants use Photosynthesis to create food from sunlight and         carbon dioxide. This reaction occurs because of the         chlorophyll within plants, and is what gives them their         green color. This experiment will answer twos question: Why         are plants green? Why do plants need sunlight to remain         green?
These         are the materials needed to see how important sunlight is         to leaves:
-Plant with broad leaves (may be inside or outside)
-Black construction paper
-Transparent material (such as a plastic         bag)          
-Scissors ADULT         NEEDED
-Tape
Methods:
Cut a piece of         black construction paper large enough to cover a broad         leaf. HAVE AN ADULT HELP         YOU!
Now wrap the construction paper around the leaf and use the         tape to secure it.
Wait at least a week before removing the construction paper         from the leaf. When the experiment is finished compare your         leaf to the other leaves on the plant. You should be able         to see a distinct difference between the leaves.
The leaf that had been under the cover of the construction         paper should have begun to lose its green color and wilt.         This is because the leaf is unable to continue to make food         with out the help of sunlight. Below are another set of         pictures using a very different plant then the one above.         Plants grown without any light at all will be pale and         spindly; botanists call these plants etiolated. You have         probably seen similar etiolated plants when onions or         potatoes sprout in your pantry or refrigerator.
