Why questions are often difficult to answer but you seem to have a very  reasonable answer to explain your observation. To really confirm that the  nongreen parts of your variegated leaves do not photosynthesize as much as the  green parts, you would need to do one of the following:    1. Starch test the leaves to show that there is little or no starch in nongreen  areas and lots of starch in green areas. This may not work on all leaves  because some plants do not accumulate starch in their leaves but export  photosynthates as sucrose.  2. Extract chlorophyll from green and nongreen areas to show the nongreen areas  have little or no chlorophyll while green areas have lots of chlorophyll. Just  because a leaf is nongreen does not mean that there is not chlorophyll there.  In some nongreen leaves, other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins,  simply mask the green chlorophyll.  3. Measure photosynthesis in leaf disks cut from green and nongreen areas of  the leaf to show that photosynthesis occurs in green but not nongreen parts.   References  Hershey, D.R. 1995.
