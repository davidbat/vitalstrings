Why Aren't Leaves Green in the Fall?
Leaves are small solar panels that collect the sun's energy that makes food production possible.
The leaves of deciduous trees lose their green color in the fall primarily because the nights are getting longer. Longer nights mean less sunlight during the day, and increasingly cool temperatures trigger the process that shows the leaves' true colors. Does this Spark an idea?

Features
During the warm summer months, leaves produce large amounts of chlorophyll, the substance that gives them their bright green color. Chlorophyll is a major ingredient in the formula plants use to manufacture their own food during the process known as photosynthesis, which enables leaves to use sunlight to produce and store sugars for the winter months.
Significance
Leaf cells also contain carotenoids during the growing season, a substance that produces orange, brown and yellow colors, and anthocyanins, that provide the color for such fruits as apples, grapes and strawberries. As chlorophyll production declines during the longer cooler nights, a leaf's true color is exposed.
Considerations
A leaf's true colors are essentially hidden by the large amounts of green chlorophyll it contains during most of its growth cycle. This process occurs mainly in areas of the world that experience the extremes of all four seasons, such as parts of eastern North America, some sections of western North America, eastern Asia and southwestern Europe.
