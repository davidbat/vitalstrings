Re: why can't i save on pokemon fire red and leaf green??????
Hiya guys, I'm new to the forums and did a nice search for my request first... And it lead me here.
Now, I kinda have the same problem. I'm not a hardcore pok√©mon fan, I simply like the games. The problem is, in-game saving. The game saves automatically when finishing the so-called league, however, my VBA doesn't show any saves at startup. How do I fix this problem? Because, if there's no way around, I'm stuck, in every game...
I think it's quite commonly used in some games, so I think there must be a way around this. If you guys know how to solve my problem... Please notify me, by replying to this thread for example.
Oh yeah, my VBA's version is v1.7.2 and it's not a beta...
Thanks in Advance all!
