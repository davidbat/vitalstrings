A night out in Barcelona is a long-distance race. Be sure to start slowly so that you are able to face the exuberant party-scene until the early morning. As everything else in Barcelona, also nightlife sets off a few hours later. Start your evening out in one of the numerous bars or cafes in Barcelona before going to a club. Be aware that bars generally close at 3:00 am. It also does not make any sense to go to a club in Barcelona before 12:00 pm. Or why not spend time on the beach during the evening? Enjoy the relaxed atmosphere while drinking a cold beer on the -still crowded- but much cooler beach of Barcelona during summer nights.
