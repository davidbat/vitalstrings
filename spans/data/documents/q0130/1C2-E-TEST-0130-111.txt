The Loft
South Norwalk, CT 06850
Very, very very cool bar! If you're looking to drink some beverages in a great atmosphere, then this is the place for you. It's more than an ordinary bar. The loft has two-levels, and it has great decor. The music keeps the crowd lively. Expect to hear everything from Motown hits, to Rock classics while there. Ages vary from college to whatever. Guys, be sure to wear slacks and a collared shirt because the big bouncer dude might not let you in. Don't show up dressed like a bum. Drinks are standard prices for a bar ($3 domestic, $3.50 imported).
