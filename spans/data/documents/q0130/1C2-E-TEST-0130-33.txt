Or plan for tinnitus and ear damage. Sound is far too loud and not always equalized well in the RAZZ. However the rooms upstairs (Lolita and Loft) have much better sound and not so unbearable. (Also better line ups i.m.o) Rex and Pop are fun too and when you need a break to breath there's always the roof. It's like 5 clubs for the price of one. They just really need to work on the ear torture in the RAZZ room (when there aren't concerts it's painful.)
Raz of course
