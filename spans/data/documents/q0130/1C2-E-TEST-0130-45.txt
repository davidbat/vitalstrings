What?
Otto Zutz is a large uptown club that spans three floors and is located in an old textiles factory. It is popular amongst a more 'bling' crowd who come for the hip hip, R&B, funky and house. It is one of the few clubs in town where you will find these music genres, so people here have made the effort to come for the music.
Otto Zutz Club has a capacity of about 1000 people across three different dancefloors, all with their own DJs and music. The DJs at Otto Zutz are all locals and known to be experts in their genres.
Who?
