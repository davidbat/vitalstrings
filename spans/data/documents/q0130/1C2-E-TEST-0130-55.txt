Ladies- I word of advice if you go here, don't bring a purse! I went here about a week ago with some friends and some guy unzipped my purse without me noticing grabbed my wallet then ran off. I noticed what was happening right as he was pulling his hand out and tried to stop him and go after him but I lost him in the crowed. I told security and they told me, a female, to check the garbage in the mens bathroom because they see wallets in there all the time. Luckly I didnt have any cash in my wallet but I did have cards that he tried to use the next day but was declined. Before this night I liked the music at this club but found a majority of the guys that go their to be very immature. Needless to say I definitely wont be going back there.
