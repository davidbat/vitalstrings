Ok, Razzmattaz is very alternative.... it is mostly for indie or rock, although there is a cheese music room and a house/techno kind of room. I don´t recall an RnB or hip hop room...
Jamboree I haven´t been to, so i can´t comment...
Other clubs: ok, Pacha, Shoko, Opium Mar.... = house music
Mirabe (on Mount Tibidabo) = has a hip hop / RnB room, and downstairs it has a house room
Up n down, Otto Zutz = more on the RnB/hip hop side. Otto Zutz has 3 different rooms, and definately has some RnB hip hop.
Catwalk = some RnB/hip hop
Hopefully that´ll keep you going for a while. . . .
