Email Capers Eat & Drink
Supplying sports, cocktails and palatable food to Campbell and San Jose folks for a number of years, Caper's Eat and Drink is just the upscale-casual kind of sports bar that you would expect to find in well-heeled Silicon Valley. Instead of unkempt, near toothless gents gettin' rowdy over their team at the bar, you'll find a clean and stylish setting where you can sip martinis or good brews and catch the game from almost any seat. If you're hungry, their anything-but-pub-grub menu is bound to have something you can enjoy, be it carpaccio, slow cooked lamb shanks or a grilled porterhouse.
