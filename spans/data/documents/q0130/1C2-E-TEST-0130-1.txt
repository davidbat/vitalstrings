While Barcelona bars are concentrated in zonas, or clusters of streets, clubs are a whole different story. Barcelona night clubs, or "discotecas," are scattered throughout the city. Likewise, while bars in a single area tend toward a similar vibe, discotecas change music and DJs nightly. One night of the week might be entirely dedicated to hip-hop, another to techno, another to house, and the same locale can even take on different names as themes change.
Since the vast majority of Barcelona night clubs charge a cover of €8-18 and jack up drink prices, partiers stick to bars until closing and head to the discoteca around 2am at the earliest. Cover charges normally include consumición - any drink of your choice - but going to a club inevitably burns quite a whole in your wallet. Most Barcelona night clubs close at 5 or 6am, and some afters even welcome night owls from 5am til breakfast time!
House music far and away dominates the club scene in Spain, though Barcelona discotecas are beginning to warm up to hip hop, funk and latin grooves as well.
