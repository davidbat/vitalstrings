Where to begin... This club is horrendous! It looks big on the outside but the layout of the place makes it look small. So they have two main sections. As soon as you enter you walk into the bar/cumbia music area... Which mainly consists of the middle aged people. You won't see a whole lot of younger folks just because they do have a bar and the security will card you. But if you want more up to date music (top 40's, rap, dance) then you have to walk to the back room. Which I find is a pain to get to because you have to push through all those people swinging each other around, shuffling their feets like there is no tomorrow. They should have some sort of clear walk way to the other room. But like I was saying, the back room is mainly for teenie boppers and dirty dirty old men. So ladies please do yourself a favor and watch your back!
I have gone to this place four or five times just because my friends wanted to go (horrible selection!). The last time I was there I was attacked with a swarm of nasty, sweaty, short men. I started off dancing with one guy... one turned to two... two turned to three... Before I know it I am surrounded and I obviously called for help because I could not break free on my own. It was like kind of like being mobbed by a group of psychotic apes. It was not fun at all! And to make matters worse, they always have fights on the dance floor. Its ridiculous! People should leave their petty issues at home and just dance! I mean, it is a club and that's what you are primarily there for.
This place that people call a "club" is completely ghetto and disgusting. There are guys stuck to the wall watching girls dance and there is barely any places to sit. The security doesn't do their job because they take forever to break up fights and help when you need them to. Spend your hard earned $20 bucks elsewhere because it simply isn't worth it.
