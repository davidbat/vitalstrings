square is named, like the neighbourhood itself, for its monastic church, whose high walls and Gothic portal tower above the paved square’s castiron drinking fountain.The church was rebuilt in 1147 on even older foundations, but has been restored inside over the centuries almost beyond interest. However, the three medieval streets that converge at the church, carrers de Sant Pere Més Alt (upper), Mitja (middle) and Baix (lower), contain the bulk of the district’s finest buildings and the nicest shops – a mixture of small boutiques and old family businesses.

cities can boast a museum dedicated entirely to chocolate. Barcelona’s is housed in the former Convent de Sant Agusti, whose thirteenth-century cloister, rediscovered when the building was renovated, can still be viewed.The museum itself recounts the history of chocolate, from its origins as a sacred and medicinal product of prehistoric Central America through to its introduction to Europe as a confection in the sixteenth century. As you might expect, the museum café serves a fine cup of hot chocolate – and the choccie counter is something to behold too – while at the adjacent Escola de Patisseria, glass windows allow you to look onto the students learning their craft in the kitchens.

his best-known works, Barcelona’s Picasso Museum provides a unique opportunity to trace the artist’s development from his paintings as a young boy to the mature works of later years.The early drawings, particularly, are fascinating, in which Picasso – still signing with his full name, Pablo Ruiz Picasso – attempted to copy the nature paintings in which his father specialized. Some works in the style of Toulouse-Lautrec, like the menu Picasso did for Els Quatre Gats tavern in 1900, reflect his interest in Parisian art; while other selected works are from the famous Blue Period (1901–04) and Pink Period (1904–06), and from his Cubist (1907–20) and Neoclassical (1920–25) stages. The large gaps in the main collection only underline Picasso’s extraordinary changes of style and mood, best illustrated by the large jump to 1957, a year represented by his fifty-odd interpretations of Velázquez’s masterpiece Las Meninas.The museum’s minor works – sketches, drawings and prints – cover in detail most phases of the artist’s career up

Picasso in Barcelona
Although born in Málaga, Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) spent much of his youth – from the age of 14 to 23 – in Barcelona. The time Picasso spent here encompassed the whole of his Blue Period (1901–04) and provided many of the formative influences on his art. Not far from the Museu Picasso you can still see many of the buildings in which Picasso lived and worked, notably the Escola de Belles Arts de Llotja (c/Consolat del Mar, near Estació de França), where his father taught drawing and where Picasso himself absorbed an academic training. The apartments where the family lived when they first arrived in Barcelona – Pg. d’Isabel II 4 and c/Reina Cristina 3, both near the Escola – can also be seen, though only from the outside, while Picasso’s first real studio (in 1896) was located over on c/de la Plata at no.4. A few years later, many of his Blue Period works were finished at a studio at c/del Comerç 28. His first public exhibition was in 1901 at Els Quatre Gats tavern (c/Montsió 3, Barri Gòtic; wwww.4gats.com); you can still have a meal there today.

church was begun on the order of King Jaume II in 1324, and finished in only five years. Built on what was the seashore in the fourteenth century, Santa María was at the heart of the medieval city’s maritime and trading district (c/Argentería, named after the silversmiths who worked there, still runs from the church square to the city walls of the Barri Gòtic), and it came to embody the commercial supremacy of the Crown of Aragon (of which Barcelona was capital). It’s an exquisite example of Catalan-Gothic architecture, with a wide nave and high, narrow aisles, and for all its restrained exterior decoration is still much dearer to the heart of the average local than the cathedral, the only other church in the city with which it compares.The Baroque trappings were destroyed during the Civil War, which is probably all to the good since the longterm restoration work has concentrated on showing off the simple spaces of the interior; the stained glass, especially, is beautiful.

Parc de la Ciutadella
For time out from the old town’s historic intrigues and labyrinthine alleys, retreat to the city’s favourite green space, Parc de la Ciutadella, on the eastern edge of La Ribera. It holds a full set of attractions – the Catalan parliament building (not open to the public), plant houses, museums and a zoo – though on lazy summer days there’s little incentive to do any more than stroll the shady garden paths and pilot rowboats across the placid ornamental lake. The park dates from the demolition in 1869 of a Bourbon citadel, erected here in the mid-eighteenth century after Barcelona’s resistance during the War of the Spanish Succession. Ciutadella was subsequently chosen as the site of the 1888 Universal Exhibition – from which period dates a series of buildings and monuments by the city’s pioneering modernista architects. The park’s main gates are on Passeig de Picasso (a short walk from La Ribera), and there’s also an entrance on Passeig de Pujades (Metro Arc de Triomf); for direct access to the zoo, use Metro Ciutadella-Vila Olímpica.
