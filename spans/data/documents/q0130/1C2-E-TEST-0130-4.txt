Barcelona’s nightlife is renowned for its many night clubs and discos that attract party-goers and clubbers every night of the week.  From international house and electro DJs, to big name hip-hop acts and live music, Barcelona has an agenda to suit all tastes.
Latin clubs with salsa dancing, Brazilian grooves, and world music are popular, as well as drum ‘n bass, indie, pop, rock, and lounge clubs that offer a more chilled out ambience for those preferring to chat rather than gurn to the beats.
The Barcelona summer really gets going when the beach bars and open-air clubs open towards the middle of May.  Check individual club listings for special nights organized by promoters from all over the world, student parties and Erasmus nights with cheaper drinks and an international party atmosphere, as well as the clubs’ own regular sessions.
