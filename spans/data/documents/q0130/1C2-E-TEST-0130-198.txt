EXCLUSIV THE NEW ALBU E M
FROM THE GLIMMERS!
Mo and Dave guide us through the tracks on this issue’s covermount — ‘The Glimmers are Gee Gee Fazii’ — part two of their long-awaited artist album.
460 NOT FOR RESALE FREE with DJ MAGAZINE ISSUE
1. ‘Galactic Prism’
Dave: “This is a track made with Prins Thomas. We asked him to do a remix for one of our tracks and it took more than a year to get it from him! And now we’ve re-edited it and made a total new track out of it — and he doesn’t know it yet! We love those situations!”

been autographing the CDs, and the reaction is already really different, it’s way more enthusiastic than it would be otherwise. A few days after the gigs we’ve had emails, people like it. I’m looking forward to seeing what more of the reactions are gonna be like.” What was your aim in deciding to give ‘… Gee Gee Fazzii Part Two’ away with DJmag? Mo: “Because we liked the idea of DJmag being an internationally known magazine. It’s known all over the world. It’s nice sometimes to try another way to get your music around, spread it globally. And also, it’s going to enthusiastic people, those who read the magazine. They’re people who are into music, and it’s bringing it to them in a few steps, to the fans and also maybe some new fans.” How does ‘…Gee Gee Fazzii Part Two’ differ from ‘Part One’, then? Dave: “It’s more like a continuation. Both CDs contain tracks, mixes and remixes we’ve made during the last two years. We had a lot of tracks and we searched for the ones that worked together. If you listen to ‘Part One’ and then ‘Part Two’ directly after, it will make a lot of sense, it’s a double feature.” What kind of musical ﬂavours will listeners find on ‘Part Two?’ Dave: “We’ve done a last-minute cover version because we wanted to have a full vocal track on there. So we’ve done something that’s never been done before. We’re big Prince fans and he has a lot of material that’s been unreleased, but you can get hold of bootlegs. We found a track from the ‘Dirty Mind’ period, recorded around 1980, called ‘Lisa’, which we have on a tape. We’ve covered that one. It’s sounding nice. “Overall, there’s a bigger disco feeling than on the ﬁrst part. It’s in the same direction as the ﬁrst one, with so many of the tracks ﬁtting together. My idea was, why should we have to make a CD with 16 tracks and then have to drop three or four of them? To listen to 70 minutes together, that’s a bit too much. So
now fans have two parts, which they can listen to separately. It’s really old skool in a way, like an old double album. “If you listen to our DJ sets, we try to go straighter and more uptempo after an hour, so this one has a bit more of a dancefloor feel.” What do you think the future is for record labels now, with free music, downloads and so forth? Dave: “I think it’s a mixture. A lot of people still buy music if they want it. For us, ﬁrst of all, we needed to do something with the music because we started Diskimo Recordings and then the last two years we didn’t really get so involved. We wanted to do something a bit more challenging. We didn’t believe any more in the record company, especially for artists like Mo and I who are underground DJs who have existed for a long time. We don’t have the hype factor like Justice or Digitalism, who are fresh on the scene. We’ve been doing it for years now. “We had to ﬁnd something that would ﬁt how we are and the way that we work. And for us this was a great idea because we own all the rights to the music that we give away, we own the masters, we don’t have a record company who are going to say, ‘We don’t want this track on here, that track on there’. If you’re signed to a record label you can’t do anything with that music. We’ve built up a reputation now where we can draw an audience in Berlin, in France, in Spain, in Japan, and at those gigs we can distribute our music and go in a different direction. “I don’t know what will happen but we really feel it’s working. People like it, nobody’s complained!” What’s next for The Glimmers after ‘…Gee Gee Fazzii’? Dave: “We plan to keep making music and releasing it like this. We have a project for next year called Disco Drunkards. We’re going to do a whole album with the band, which will be all original material. There’s gonna be a live thing, with three people on stage, which we’ll be directing and producing.”
2. ‘Ever Been II Venus?’
Mo: “One of our tracks produced with Ray Mang, a long-time partner in crime.”
3. ‘Lisa’
Dave: “A cover of an unreleased Prince song from the ‘Dirty Mind’ era. It has never been released ofﬁcially. On a bootleg and thanks to the internet this song came into our hands. About four months ago we didn’t even know it existed. Now we’ve made our own version.”
4. ‘Not Donna’
Dave: “Another collaboration with Ray Mang. A cross between Moroder and DJ Pierre from Strictly Rhythm fame — hi-energy!”
5. ‘Codek Funk’
Dave: “Another example of a typical Glimmers track. Some sounds and parts sent via internet to Sasa from In Flagranti, a track came back, some re-edits from our side and here you go!”
6. ‘Tape’
Mo: “A remake of our 2005 track ‘Cassette’, which we made exclusively for our contribution to ‘DJ Kicks’. This version is more stripped down, dropping all the acidic elements, and we added disco synths and percussion to give it a totally different twist.”
7. ‘Theme From Atlantis’
Dave: “Our collaboration with Prins Thomas and Hans Peter Lindstrom in its original version. An eight-minute crazy up-north kinda vibe. Made in Oslo.”
8. ‘Space Woman’
Mo: “Made with Ray Mang in our studio in Ghent, during our Shirley Bassey sessions, whilst we were making our remix of her adaptation of ‘Slave To The Rhythm.’”
9. ‘Esta Si, Esta No (Asi Me Gusta A Mi) pt. II’
Dave: “The second half of our cover of Spanish hero Chimo Bayo’s classic early-’90s rave tune. Some crazy organ and percussion madness.”
10. ‘Love & Happiness’
Dave: “A cover version of ‘Love Trax’, one of our favourite DJ Pierre tracks of all time, which came out on Strictly Rhythm. There have been a lot of 12”s on that label, but none of them came even close to this monster. Wild pitching with repetitive live drums, crazy synths and a hypnotizing vocal… it’s a nice one to end our ‘Gee Gee Fazzi’ adventure. Love and happiness!”

Time for change
French DJ and producer Shonky is the latest in a long line of music types to move to Berlin. With his new album ‘Time Zero’ about to drop, we catch up with the Frenchman in his adopted home.

Shonky
T
he proud natives of East Berlin weren’t always the contented bunch they are today. In the days of ‘the wall’ many had an impoverished existence, with much time spent green-eyed, longing for life on the other side — or of escaping Germany altogether. The lifestyle there today, however, is a different kettle of fish. The regions of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshein and Kreuzberg, which lie just to the East of the capital’s centre, are now bona fide hotspots — twenty and thirtysomethings the world over scrambling to get their slice. And if you happen to be into electronic music then you’re laughing, with ludicrously cheap accommodation, more than reasonable living costs and a close-knit music community slap-bang on your doorstep. When Ewan Pearson bought his one-way EasyJet flight never to return, many thought it a big old flash in the pan, but several years on and it seems every fucker’s making the jump, as Berlin’s magnetism pulls more like-minded people towards it. “So, this is me,” says 25-year-old French DJ and producer Shonky, opening the door to his new Berlin apartment, the latest music producer to move to the city. His 70 square metre Kreuzberg pad features slick wooden floors, plush, cool-as-fuck décor and a stunning sound set-up, instantly ramming home the cheaper cost of living in this part of Europe. Shonky — or Olivier Ducreux to his mum — moved to the German capital back in October, after getting that ‘gotta get out of this place’ itch back home in Paris. “It just felt like it was the right time. I needed a change and it’s definitely been the right move, I love it here,” he grins, a rampant advocate of the city’s charms already. So much so that he’s campaigning to get his Parisian cohorts to follow his lead. “I’ve been speaking to Dan [Ghenacia] and Dyed [Soundorom] and they’re thinking about it!” he reveals. “Actually, they were here just the other week; we had a great little after-party in my flat. Until the neighbour interfered, that is.”
dripping with style and oozing extremity. A far cry from the haunts he was used to. “There was always this crazy mix of people, wearing weird clothes and costumes. I fell in love with the club straight away, with the atmosphere, everything. The first night I went there I was like, ‘What the fuck!?’” recalls Shonky. Each week Shonky invited his friends and newly-made Les Bains acquaintances back to his pad for pre and after-parties, fully embroiling himself in the scene. “It was like a ritual, every Friday and every Saturday night,” he grins. A shrill ring brings Shonky back to the present. It’s Freak ‘N’ Chic head honcho Dan Ghenacia on the phone and Shonky ambles over to his swish looking home studio to take the call. He opens a file to reveal sleeve designs for his forthcoming single, ‘Time Zero’ — also the title track from his forthcoming album, out 5th April on Freak ‘N’ Chic. During the phone call the sleeve design is given the thumbs up — and Shonky is pretty chuffed.
City Charms
Business aside, we venture out onto the streets to discover why Berlin has captured Shonky’s heart. Just five minutes stroll from his flat and we stumble across legendary German record shop Hardwax after meandering through a series of archways into a graffiti smothered stairwell. With its deep cavernous character and hidden position, it has a truly underground feel. “For ages I didn’t know how close this place was,” says Shonky. “I really like coming here, it’s just a shame that I don’t actually buy that much vinyl these days!” A plastic obsessive for some time, Shonky’s now made the switch to Serato. “It’s great,” he enthuses. “As everything’s on the computer, you have music for any kind of gig, which is really important for me. So if I’m playing warm-up I can go deep; peak-time, I can go peak-time, and if I play the after-party then I can go psychedelic.” Downstairs from the racks of records sits the mastering plant where Shonky’s debut longplayer ‘Time Zero’ was put to bed, along with a recording studio that local residents can take advantage of.
“The great thing about Berlin is that it’s so free. You don’t need a lot of money to live so you can be more comfortable in your art.”
Delinquent Liberty
Playing party host comes naturally to Shonky. Growing up in Paris with his folks, he was granted the dream teenage scenario of separate quarters in their house, a space totally devoid of parental control, affording him a rather generous amount of delinquent liberty. “Yeah, it was great, I could do anything I liked,” he remembers. At 15 or 16-years-old Shonky was into a mixed bag musically, mostly going out to hip-hop and trip-hop clubs. He remembers that one day in 1997, “I just decided to go to the right club.” Les Bains Douches was a firm favourite amongst the city’s faces and local glitterati —

Shonky
“There are many buildings here where producers share studio space,” Shonky explains. “So as well as being able to indulge their craft individually, being neighbours means ideas can easily be shared, tunes swapped and collaborations forged.” After a good bout of vinyl reminiscing, we leave Hardwax and navigate back towards civilisation proper. As we approach the River Spree, Shonky tells DJmag how he hooked up with Dan and the Freak ‘N’ Chic crew in the first place. “My friend was working for Les Bains Douches as a PR, he was doing parties, and all the time was telling me, ‘We’ve got to go to this club called Batofar,’” he remembers. When he did, Les Bains Douches quickly became a distant memory. “It was like a… (motions a slap in the face), you know? I really, really enjoyed it. It was a totally different atmosphere from Les Bains. At Batofar everything was orientated around the music. People who came to Batofar knew about music.” The club was a fertile hub for DJs and producers to hang out on both a social and professional level, with many of the relationships ignited there standing the test of time. “I met Dan Ghenacia there, Ivan [Smagghe], even Sebastien Bouchet who is younger than us. Oh, and David K. I know so many people who, since going to Batofar, have made their life in music.” A fledgling producer at the time, Shonky asked Dan round to his place to lend an ear to some works in progress. “He’d listen to my tracks and say, ‘Well, I think you need to do this or you need to do that.’ Then one time he had nothing to say other than, ‘I really like it, I want to sign it.’”
“The idea was to do what I know, do what I do the best and try to take that as far as I can.”
No-nonsense Rules
Stomachs rumbling, we start searching for somewhere to eat. “They’re really not bad, you know,” he says, motioning towards a typical Kreuzberg Turkish take-away. “Only €1.50 for a whole pizza! I mean, seriously, how can they make any money?” This kind of observation is quite typical of the Ducreaux make up. Everything is calculated and deconstructed so Shonky can make both head and tail of it. His mind operates with a no-nonsense set of rules. And debut album ‘Time Zero’ follows a similar code of conduct. No messing about, it’s 10 tracks of straight-up dancefloor business. There are no forays into the realms of downtempo or shorter three-minute numbers — just pure club ammunition. But this is by no means an emission to his lack of breadth or interest in experimenting, it’s just that Shonky is keen to perfect his current sound before moving on. Shonky’s hunger rampant, we cave in and settle for the nearest eatery. After a brief struggle communicating our orders with the waiter — with DJmag’s German non-existent and Shonky’s still in the novice stages — we get the full beef on ‘Time Zero’. “I wanted to do something that was quite simple,” says Shonky. “The idea was to do what I know, do what I do the best and try to take that as far as I can.” Indeed, the album stays on the deep, hypnotic path he’s trodden before. Many of the tracks share similar instruments, atmospherics and rhythms, with Shonky tweaking, re-jigging and re-shaping along the way. But this is exactly how he intended the album to emerge. “Of course, I want to take my sound in different directions, but step by step. I don’t want to do something just to be able to say I’ve done it. If can’t do it with your own personality, your own style, I don’t see the interest in it.” And this is where the album’s title resonates. ‘Time Zero’ is intended as a snapshot, a sonic statement illustrating exactly what Shonky is about right now. Musically, while the album harbours its own unique sound, Shonky admits to being influenced greatly by two distinct scenes. Firstly, there are the Detroit overtones with steely kinetic percussion dominating and robotic flickers simmering throughout. Then, on standout tracks ‘Eclipse’ and ‘Odyssey’, the Motor City flavours can further be felt, each tune cradled by warm expansive keys. There is also a defiant nod to the psychedelic end of US house, especially the dark entrancing funk of the San Franciscan scene, with oscillating synths, swirling sirens and other mind-bending tricks driving many of the album’s tracks. “I like the rhythm of the album, the way it moves,” reflects Shonky. “And for my first one, I’m pretty happy because I didn’t lie to myself. It marks the end of a chapter.” As we continue our trek towards Alexanderplatz, the tall TV tower now beckoning, Shonky points out the city’s many clubbing haunts — a side of Berlin he’s already got pegged. Impassioned about his new hometown, it’s pretty obvious that Shonky will be here for some time to come. “The great thing about Berlin is that it’s so free,” he imparts. “The arts and nightlife are kept big because they know it’s important for the city. You don’t need a lot of money to live so you can be more comfortable in your art. I feel relaxed here, which has made me more confident with myself and with the computer!”
