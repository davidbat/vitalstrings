Open 7 nights a week, Le Baron is a small and exclusive club home to a select clientele. Due to the small size of the club, the door policy is strict. Once inside however, the atmosphere is good and the music is solid. Located off the Champs-Elysées, Le Baron is occupies a space that used to serve as a brothel and spot for escorts. However, the venue was refurbished and now the clubs attracts A-list patrons and stars. Le Baron is one of the hardest places to get into especially when big events are occurring in the city, such as festivals and fashion week.
The inside is cosy, with red velvet acting as the dominant theme, and consists of a bar, a small dance floor, and approximately 15 tables equipped with lush couches. The music policy varies and includes house, club anthems, rock, and hip hop. Le Baron is open from 23:00 until late every night of the week. A typical weeknight might commence with a rock concert, followed by a DJ. Dress nice and arrive early as the small space can fill up fast.
