La Rambla is the most famous street in Barcelona.                            The wide boulevard connects the Plaça de Catalunya ,                            a busy square, with the Columbus Monument and the city's waterfront.
The Rambla
The often crowded street is popular with tourists                            and locals alike. The middle part of the Rambla is pedestrianized                            and bordered by trees. Kiosks, flower stalls and street artists are                            in abundance here. Traffic passes on either side of                            the pedestrian area.
History
Font de Canaletes
The Rambla was originally a small stream                            flowing just outside the city walls. In the 16th century                            convents and a university were built along the river.                            In the 19th century the city wall was torn down and                            buildings were erected along the now dried up river.                            The original buildings were demolished but they are remembered                            in some of the names of the five different parts of                            the Rambla. Even though it is one continuous street, the Rambla actually consists of five 'ramblas'. That's why the street is also called Las Ramblas (Spanish) or Les Rambles (Catalan).
Rambla de Canaletes
Plaça de Catalunya
The first Rambla, starting from the Plaça de Catalunya , is the Rambla de                            Canaletes. The name originates from the 19th                            century Canaleta fountain. The expression 'he drinks                            water from Canaletes' means that person comes from Barcelona.                            And according to local legend, once you drink from the                            fountain, you will keep coming back to Barcelona.
Rambla dels Estudis
The second Rambla is the Rambla                            dels Estudis. It is named after the 16th century                            university, the Estudis Generals. The building was demolished                            in 1843. Several important buildings are still in this                            area, among them the 18th century Reial Acadèmia de Ciènces i Arts, since 1910 a theater. The                            building contains the first public clock of the city.
Rambla de Sant Josep
Plaça de la Boqueria
The next Rambla is the Rambla                            de Sant Josep, named after a convent which                            was demolished in the mid 1900s and replaced by the Mercat de la Boqueria , a colorful market place. Since this                            part of the Rambla has many flower stalls, it is now                            better known as the Rambla de les Flors, or 'Flower                            Rambla'. At the end of this part of the Rambla is a                            small square, the Plaça de la Boqueria. The pavement here features a mosaic by Joan Miró and a nearby shop is decorated with an Art Deco dragon.
Rambla dels Caputxins
Plaça Reial
The fourth Rambla counting towards                            the Columbus Monument is the Rambla dels Caputxins,                            yet again named after a now demolished building: a Capuchin                            monastery.
The most interesting building on this rambla                            is the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona's opera                            house. The theater building, decorated in modernista style, was twice destroyed by fire; in 1861 and in 1994, but it was rebuilt each time, most recently reopening in 1999.
Teatre del Liceu
Further down the rambla on the left hand side is the entrance                            to the Plaça Reial, a 19th century lively square                            with tall palm trees and street lamps designed by Antoni                            Gaudí. Opposite the Plaça Reial, in the                            Carrer Nou de la Rambla is the Palau Guëll or Guëll                            Palace, one of Gaudí's first residential buildings.                            The parabolic shapes at the entrance and the rooftop                            chimneys are signs of things to come in his later works                            at the Güell Park and                            the Casa Milà , just to name two of the most famous works by the renowned Catalan architect.
Rambla de Santa Mònica
Centre d'Art Santa Mònica
The last Rambla is the Rambla    de Santa Monica, named after a convent, now    converted into a museum, the Centre d'Art Santa Mònica.    The rambla leads to a roundabout with a 60m tall column,    the Columbus Monument .    It was built in 1888 for the Universal Exposition.
Rambla de Mar
Rambla de Mar
If you continue to walk in the direction                            of the Port Vell a wooden                            walkway, now known as the Rambla de Mar or Rambla of the Sea, leads you to Maremàgnum, a complex with shops, movie theaters - including an IMAX theater - and a large aquarium .
The Rambla de Mar was designed by Viaplana & Piñon, who created a wooden suspension bridge with a wavy pattern, symbolizing the connection of the city with the Mediterranean. For decades, Barcelona had turned its back towards the sea and the extension of the Rambla, completed in 1994, symbolizes Barcelona's renewed opening towards the sea.
