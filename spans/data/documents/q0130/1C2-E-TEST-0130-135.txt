Travel's internet space is a good place to ask and talk with other people visiting the city. Has a quiet terrace. Very much a backpackers bar, this is a staple hang-out for many travellers. The Travel Bar has a barcrawl every evening (although it is poorly advertised in the bar - staff 'invite' people they would like to join, otherwise you have to ask), as well as a mean Catalan cooking course. This is a good place to hang out and meet other English speaking people. It does have some decent perks - notably, the one euro meals (again, you have to be in with the bar staff to get this) and the free Wi-Fi plus free internet computers (again, ask the barstaff - its rather haphazard if you'll get it offered to you, depending on whether you look like a part of the backpacker crowd).   edit

Watch out for purse snatchers along the seafront, and never leave anything valuable unattended while going for a swim. On busy days there will usually be patrolling police along the beach. Thieves tend to steal peoples bags on the beach (they even attempt to do so while you are there with your bag).
