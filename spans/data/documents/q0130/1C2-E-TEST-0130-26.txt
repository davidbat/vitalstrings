Located in one of Barcelona's most beautiful areas, Marina Village at the seaside, right beside Hotel Arts and Barcelona's Gran Casino, this renowned club has two floors offering very different ambiances.
One of the few night spots in Barcelona, providing two very clearly differentiated musical offerings. On the lower level the emphasis is on House and the best of Hip Hop and R 'n' B on the upper level.
We've had the pleasure to host international Djs like Bob Sinclair, Roger SÃ¡nchez, Martin Solveig,  Axwell, Joaquim Garraud, Ron Carroll, and more. We recommend a visit to both floors to keep up with emerging music trends.
