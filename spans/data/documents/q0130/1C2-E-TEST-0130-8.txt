If you're a college student or young adult looking for a great time, the BCN club scene delivers. The "beach clubs" like Shoko, Opium Mar, Catwalk, and Sotavento are all great places for dancing and partying. You'll find people from all over the world, usually a young crowd of international students and locals mixed in. Drinks at these places are expensive and there's usually a cover charge (both around 7-12Euros), so I'd recommend drinking at a bar before hand. They clubs don't get busy until after 2AM anyway.
I would definitely check Barcelona facebook groups for students studying abroad, or local club promotions, because you can usually find a group that can get you into the clubs without paying the cover before a certain time.
IMPORTANT: These places are overrun with guys that will steal wallets or purses from tourists without anyone noticing. They usually pick them up when someone's not looking or they reach into pockets to pull out valuables, once again without being noticed. I would definitely recommend bags with zippers or hidden pockets. Keep an eye out for your friends if you're planning on getting drunk, because these thieves are professionals and they are very very good at stealing from non-locals. I wouldn't say they're anything to be scared of, but just be aware of it.
Dress Code: Girls usually have no problems getting in as long as you look over 18 and are wearing something a step above casual. Guys on the other hand should wear collared shirts or button downs, because they're sometimes strict about that.
