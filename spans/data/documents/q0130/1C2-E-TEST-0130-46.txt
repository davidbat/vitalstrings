 
Night clubs
Adults head to night clubs to meet up with friends, dance and have a drink or two. These clubs may feature live music, but most offer music from DJs who play the latest hits. Some clubs are for those 18 and older, but most are for 21 and older. Each night club is different in terms of music and style. Whereas one may specialize in techno or house music, another plays popular or retro music.   Whether you like jazz or hip hop, nightclubs are the perfect place to kick back, relax dance and have fun. You’ll find nightclubs in vacation destinations, or in your own city or town. Major cities have lively club event scenes. Other popular cities have great live band and entertainment offerings. Some have a strong gay presence, while others offer a strong teen scene.  Most nightclubs serve alcohol, from beer to cocktails. Some clubs are martini bars, for instance, and serve a wide variety of martini flavors to please patrons. Many do have a dress code, banning shorts and T-shirts but allowing dress and formal clothing.  You can find nightclubs in hotels, casinos or in other venues. You can also find them as independent venues. Lounges are a more low-key version of hopping nightclubs, with plenty of seating and more of a focus on live bands than DJs. Many clubs feature bouncers at the door, who check guests’ ID and accept the cover charge. Karaoke bars are another entertainment alternative, where you can sing to your favorite tunes.  Popular nightclubs boast exclusive lines for VIPs and celebrities. In the summer months, many clubs feature outdoor veranda areas where guests such as VIPs can sit outside and enjoy their drinks and entertainment. Friday nights are big nights for dance clubs, drawing large crowds looking to have fun.
