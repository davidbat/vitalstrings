IP Locator Object can be used to identify problematic IP addresses or ranges – those that have shown a propensity for spam abuse, etc. For example, you can integrate IP Locator Object into your custom programming to determine your user’s location. When you identify that one potential customer is located in a high-risk area, such as Russia or West Africa, you can deny or block that IP address from even accessing your site.
