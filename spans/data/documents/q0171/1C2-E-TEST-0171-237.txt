Fixed it!
The solution was simple in the end and didn't require messing with all the settings under the sun that I had been doing. I had many problems including not being able to allocate an IP address, not seeing the server name, DNS error you name it I had it.
The way we sorted it was a process of elimination - ie is it your ISP, your hardware or you settings. If 1 and 2 are in shape the Ps3 should automatically detect everything.
My problem was my gateway (ie I had a 3Com ADSL modem / router in one) which was about 3 years old. I got hold of a new device - a Netgear DG834PN and replaced the 3Com one. I set up the router but changed the internet settings on the router from PPPoPE to PPPoPA and entered all the login credentials as normal. I disabled wireless security and then rebooted everything.
Powered up the Ps3 and it worked first time. Then I enabled WPA wireless security and away we go.
In summary, check your router and use PPPoPA. I'm on AOL. My brother has Sky Broadband and it worked on that too using a Netgear Modem/Router and PPPoPA
