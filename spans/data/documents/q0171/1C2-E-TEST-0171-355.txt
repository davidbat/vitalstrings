Hide IP Address in Windows XP
A "how to" provided by iPrivacyTools.com
The easiest way to hide your IP address in Windows XP is simply to            change it, and this page will describe a fast and free method of doing            just that. You will still be using your real ISP-issued IP address,            but the "hiding" of the old IP address will occur when you            update it to a new number.
Reasons for wanting to perform this process may include privacy issues,            such as a desire to visit websites without your IP being connected to            a previous visit. Or perhaps you'd like to clear any connection that            your IP has with a marketing database that tracks surfing behavor. If            privacy is your concern, be sure to also clear your browser cookies            before AND after updating your IP as well.
*Please be aware that some ISP's may have limitations on the number            of times you're allowed to get a new IP. Therefore, to avoid extra charges            or service issues, you should probably not use this process more than            a few times. If you require a more flexible and fullproof means of hiding            your IP address, please check out our homepage.
STEP #1 to hide your IP address in Windows XP
UNPLUG your modem from the electrical              outlet.
If you're using a router, UNPLUG it from the electrical outlet.
Temporarily remove the cables between your computer, router, and              modem.
Plug the cable from your modem directly into your computer.
Restart both your modem and computer.
Once restarted, proceed to step #2 to confirm that your connection              is back online. If it's not, you may need to restart your computer              again.
STEP #2: Check your current IP address
Go to iPrivacyTools.com/my-ip-address/ and write down your IP address for comparison later.

Again, after performing the steps above, it's important to delete your            cookies, as they are another means by which websites and marketers can            follow your surfing patterns.
And as mentioned above, you should probably not use this technique            more than a few times, as it may possibly conflict with your ISP's policies.            If you're interested in something more flexible, please check out our IP Hiding Software .
