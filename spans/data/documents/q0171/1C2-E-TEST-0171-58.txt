How to find the IP address of your computer
An IP Address is like a telephone number for your computer.  Each time you connect to the Internet you may be assigned a different IP address, or you may always have the same IP address.  Your IP address is the way other computers contact you.   In some situations it is helpful to know what your IP address is.  For example, when doing teleconferencing, other people can call you up if they know what your IP address is.  In office situations, other devices such as printers and file servers may have their own IP numbers. An IP address consists of a series of four numbers, connected by dots.  An example would be: 123.99.45.67
How to look up your IP address depends on what operating system you are using.
Windows XP, Windows 2000, or Windows NT
