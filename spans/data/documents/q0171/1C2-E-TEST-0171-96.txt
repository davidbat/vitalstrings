How does TraceMyIP.org compare to other website statistics systems such as Google Analytics, Webalizer Stats & AWstats for example?
TraceMyIP.org is a completely different platform with features not available anywhere else. Try it out!
My website serves content to European Union member states and is subject to the EU Cookie Law. What can I do to achieve a better compliance that requires me to get each visitor's consent for cookie usage?
TraceMyIP.org has a cookieless tracking mode that allows you to get traffic information about your website without utilizing tracking cookies. Although the cookie free tracking solution makes it easier to achieve the goal, you may still need to give your website visitors and option to opt-out. Please refer to your local EU cookie law directive.
Currently, the EU Cookie Law affects the following European Union member states to an individual extent:
Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Slovenia, Latvia, Malta, Spain, Sweden, France, Netherlands, Estonia, Romania, Austria, Hungary, Finland, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Slovakia, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Ireland, Italy, Czech and websites that target their content or do business with individuals that reside in European Union. The required cookie law solution would be to discontinue using cookies that are stored in the visitor's browser.
Does TraceMyIP.org affect the bandwidth usage with my web hosting provider?
Just like a "green car" technology approved by the US  Environmental Protection Agency's, TraceMyIP.org does not substantially increase  the bandwidth usage of your web hosting provider since the actual website  statistics analysis software and computer data storage is hosted on TraceMyIP.org dedicated servers.  Therefore the entire web traffic analysis is performed by the CPU power  available within TraceMyIP.org computer infrastructure. Furthermore, by utilizing  TraceMyIP.org and disabling your own dedicated server's built in statistics  software, such as the webalizer or cpanel's awstats statistics software, it is possible to save  bandwidth and CPU processing resources, thus speeding up the web page loading.
Would TraceMyIP.org code trigger anti-spam and antivirus security or privacy alerts on my webite visitors' computers?
TraceMyIP.org is strictly a website visitor IP checker and tracker software which does not utilize any malicious code base that may trigger online security or privacy alerts anti-spam or antivirus software. Anti-spam and antivirus software looks for certain virus or malicious digital code signatures and patterns and intercepts them before they're downloaded onto end-user's computer hard drive or placed in the dedicated space range of the random access memory. TraceMyIP.org does not contain such code patterns, therefore the anti-spam and antivirus security alerts are not triggered.
What is an IP?
An IP is an abbreviation of Internet Protocol. IP serves a role of a    digital computer identification number that is assigned by a network it's connected to. Without an IP address networking and IP tracking would not be possible.
Why does a computer's IP address change from time to time?
Every time people establish a new connection with their Internet Service    Provider account either using a wired home / business connection or a wireless connection, the ISP's network assigns an individual IP    number to your computer in order to provide you with the data your computer    requests from web servers. This is not associated with an account privacy matters but rather a technical aspect of user account digital id distribution.
How is IPv4 different from IPv6?I
Pv6 IP address format is the successor to IPv4 which is the initial IP address format standard. The main difference with IPv6 address is its availability. It also contains additional features, such as simplified IP address assignment, network renumbering and IP announcements for the router nodes. While the 32bit IPv4 address pool is virtually exhausted and allowed somewhere around 4.3 billion addresses to be assigned, IPv6 is 128bits and can produce 3.4W1038 unique IP addresses.
Currently, most of the web servers are not configured to handle IPv6 connections, meaning an IPv6 client cannot connect to an IPv4 server. Thus, an implementation called IPv4-6 tunneling is created mostly on an ISP level to allow an IPv6 client to connect to an IPv4 host.
What about people's privacy when it comes to using Internet?
When people connect to their ISP's network using a desktop computer, mobile sattelite phone or mobile cellular phone or an  Internet appliance, their IP's physical location is    associated with an account owner's financial information digitally stored on a server used to issue the service bills, thus making it possible for authorities to easily trace their legal  physical location.  Furthermore, even without having a legal warrant to request an owner's account address information from an ISP, using  tools like    TraceMyIP.org, it's possible for virtually anyone to approximate their IP's physical location. TraceMyIP.org website analytics and visitor's computer tracking functionality does just that.
Who can see and track my IP address?
When you send emails, post on web forums, use instant messengers or access any online accounts - your computer's IP is logged by the network receiving communication requests. This is an essential step that cannot be avoided and contributes to various technical, security and privacy aspects.
Which digital computer devices utilize an IP address and can be detected by TraceMyIP.org ?
Any digital computer device that has a capability to connect to world wide web. These IP devices include but not limited to mobile cellular phones such as iphone, iphone 3G, iphone 3S, iPad and all iPad 2  and iPad 3 revisions, Motorola Moto Q, Nexus One Android, Samsung Tab & Galaxy, Blackberry, Nokia, HTC, certain Verizon LG mobile cellular internet phones, Google Nexus, Sprint Internet phones, AT&T smartphones, Nokia smartphones, latest Palm-One Treo mobile phones, T-Mobile smartphones, Samsung and Sony smartphones, iphone clones, digital WiFi appliances, laptops with WiFi connectivity and virtually all desktop computers. TraceMyIP.org' IP Website Tracking feature allows tracking the mobile cell phone devices and delivering the captured data via an easy to understand interface.
However, the mobile devices  that utilize an IP address identification are not limited to the phone and laptop applications. The new   GPS navigation (global positioning systems) and Vehicle tracking systems are the new era of the Internet connected devices. From ordinary cars that utilize GPS voice guidance to automated train  GPS systems feedback devices to Airplane GPS autopilot navigation. Whether connected via a proprietary protocols or internal networks - all of them are identified by a unique IP address. As the network deployment emerges, all devices - from personal computers to autopilot GPS navigation systems eventually become a part of the same global network.
What can be done to protect my IP's security and privacy?
It is possible to hide an IP address by using a private Proxy server. This helps to conceal your private IP information to a certain extent, however it is not considered a good practice. Read below.
What is a Proxy Server?
A Proxy server is a network service which utilizes a dedicated computer    on a remote network allowing internet users such as yourself to make indirect    connections to other computers / websites using its own network connection. When using a proxy server, the recipient of your communications    will see an IP address of the proxy server and not yours. There are plenty of proxy servers establishments on the world wide web that offer free online user accounts to hide your online identity. This, however, is    not a bullet-proof method.
Is there a risk using a Proxy Server?
(!) Definitely. Using an anonymous proxy server computer to hide your  IP  actually presents a more serious threat that contributes to the digital information leak. Since  the digital data has  to pass through a third party proxy server, any information you transmit through that  server can be intercepted and searched, including messsages you sent, your account login and password information that you may utilize for any online services. In attempt to search a better privacy on Internet, people search and find the tools like the proxy servers, not realizing that the danger is actually greater using the proxy servers. Furthermore, in order to trace and check on people's illegal activity, some governments setup free proxy servers to monitor activity of those people who are most likely to have something to hide.
Never access any of your digitally stored financial account information,  including online credit card banking systems, initiate transfer of funds, pay your bills or mortgages online or register any  online  banking accounts that contain a  secure information  while using a free proxy server. As a  matter of fact, most of the electronic identity theft cases targeted at financial sectors and being investigated  worldwide are the direct result of digital information theft via utilization of so  called free proxy servers that offer free online user accounts.
If someone possesses my private IP information, what type of security risk does it present?
First of all, every single Internet user has an IP number, therefore a  chance of you becoming a victim of a malicious attack is minimized by the overwhelming  pool of IP addresses available to those who exercise this type of activity.  Second of all, to protect your privacy, the Internet Service Providers do not  release any digitally stored legal or financial bank information to anyone but legal  authorities. Therefore your private information connected to your ISP provider  generally remains very secure.
There is still a chance though that you may become a target of an  internet hacker attack. The IP address attack spoofs your local Internet  connection by trying to forge your computer's IP via software vulnerabilities. If have  your computer connected directly to a DSL or Cable Modem without a router or a  firewall, a hacker may be able to access the private data on your computer,  especially if you use file sharing. In this situation, it would not be a bad  idea to get a good Firewall software along with an Antivirus software commonly used by people such as Antivir or Avast!, or a  hardware router with a built in digital firewall. There is a definite advantage of  having a hardware firewall built-in into a router. While a software firewall is  good and gives you full control, it may be susceptible to viruses, misconfigurations  and crashes, while a hardware firewall always runs in the background, allowing  only outgoing traffic, giving you somewhat a limited control of your inbound  traffic while providing you with the best possible protection from a dangerous  inbound traffic.
