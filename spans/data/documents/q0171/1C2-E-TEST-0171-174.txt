by Elena Santos about Hide Your IP Address
Your IP address is like your personal identification number on the web. But sometimes it's necessary to hide it â€“ to access a certain IP-restricted web service, see a website in another language or for security reasons.
With Hide Your IP Address you can easily mask your real IP address and replace it with a 'fake' IP address located somewhere else on the planet. In order to achieve this, the program makes use of proxy servers scattered all over the globe, from China to the United States. Proxy servers tend to slow down your connection, but I have to say that Hide Your IP Address showed a high degree of reliability and excellent speed rates during our tests.
Contrary to what you may think, Hide Your IP Address is really easy to use and doesn't require any technical skills. Whenever you need to hide your real IP, simply click the Start button on the program's interface. That's all! You can then minimize it to the system tray.
Hide Your IP Address includes an Options menu where you can set the program to change the proxy according to a certain period of time, as well as make it erase all traces of your internet browsing (temporary files, cookies, history and so on) when you start the program. On the downside, Hide Your IP Address works only with Internet Explorer and Firefox, and its design could be clearly improved.
Hide Your IP Address enables you to hide your real IP address under a different one, thanks to proxy servers scattered all over the globe.
