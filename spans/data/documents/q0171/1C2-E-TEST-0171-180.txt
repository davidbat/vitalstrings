IP addresses
Your computerâ€™s IP address is used by the Internet to send the webpage           you want to view to the right computer (and not one halfway round the world). Your IP           address often includes some information about your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and           your location so websites can use it to guess roughly where you are (normally to city           level, a bit like your zipcode). This is useful as it allows them to guess in what           language you want to read the page or to give you content that is relevant to your           location.
