IP Address Converter
This converter requires the use of Javascript enabled and capable browsers. The following utility converts the IP (TCP/IP) address to other browser URL addressable forms. The calculations are based on RFC 1219 compliant addresses. A maximum of three decimal characters (0-9) per box with a decimal value of between 0 (zero) and 255 is required as entry for conversion. All 4 boxes must have an entry but if the value is 0, please put in a 0. YOUR current (these can change each session if they are dynamic, and most are) IP address is displayed in the status bar. Fill in an IP address manually and click on Convert, or to insert YOUR IP address for conversion, click on Post My IP. All the forms displayed are legal IP uses.
