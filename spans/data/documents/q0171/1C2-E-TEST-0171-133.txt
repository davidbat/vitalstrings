I am certain that the question ‘What Is My IP Address?’ has cropped up in your mind just like anybody else who operates internet. As a matter of fact in today’s world when almost everyone living in a city or even in a remote suburb has access to internet, it is strange to observe that when they are asked about their IP address the most common reply is ‘I do not have any idea what my IP address is’ or ‘can I find out my IP address?’. Here are some of the facts that you must know if you are using an internet connection.
What Is My IP Address?
In simple terms, IP which stands for Internet Protocol is the method with which two computers are connected via internet and the IP address is the unique code which is used to identify your internet connection and network.
What Are The Details That Form My IP Address?
An IP Address normally has all the information about the user and the internet connection he or she uses. Primarily it contains the information about the internet connection’s server, the proxy servers if any, the location of the servers, the country, city and zip code where the user or the internet connection is registered and the details of the Internet Service Provider.
It is also possible to find out the exact longitude and latitude of the geographical location of a certain IP address.
Why Is It Important To Know My IP Address?
It is almost imperative that you know every detail about everything that you use or connect with. The reason is similar to why you use some antivirus software. The antivirus software is responsible to let you know and block the site that can be potentially harmful for your computer and personal data stored on the system. Knowing your IP address will keep you informed about the slightest of details about your internet connection.
Also, the exercises through which you can find out your IP address, in the same manner you can check out someone else’s IP address and further details. This is very important for companies, professionals and even individuals. The online world is susceptible to numerous hazards including hacking, theft, frauds and is subject to various misuses.
Suppose you are doing business with someone on a remote offsite system. In today’s globalised world in most cases you do not know who you are talking or chatting to on the other end of the internet connection hence there are virtually no means to determine the genuineness of the individual or about what he says or does. Checking out his IP address may help you to find out if some of the basic information about him is in sync with what you have been supplied with.
Let us take an example to establish the same. A man you are about to do business with says that he is based in Philippines and you are based in Ohio. You can run a check on his IP address to find out if he actually is based in Manila or elsewhere in Philippines and that would at least ensure that he has been true about the basics.
Checking IP addresses and finding out server information is more important for organizations that run real time websites and those who are in ecommerce business.
