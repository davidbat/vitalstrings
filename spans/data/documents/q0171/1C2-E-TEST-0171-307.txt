What is an IP Address
An IP address (or Internet Protocol address) is a unique address that                      certain electronic devices use in order to identify and communicate with                      each other on a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol standard                      (IP)—in simpler terms, a computer address. Any participating network                      device—including routers, switches, computers, infrastructure servers (e.g.,                      NTP, DNS, DHCP, SNMP, etc.), printers, Internet fax machines, and some                      telephones—can have its own address that is unique within the scope of the                      specific network. Some IP addresses are intended to be unique within the                      scope of the global Internet, while others need to be unique only within the                      scope of an enterprise.
The IP address acts as a locator for one IP device to find another and                      interact with it. It is not intended, however, to act as an identifier that                      always uniquely identifies a particular device. In current practice, an IP                      address is not always a unique identifier, due to technologies such as                      dynamic assignment and network address translation.
