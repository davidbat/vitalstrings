Finding Your External IP Address
Each connection to the internet is assigned its own unique IP address which defines it as a part of the global network.
Websites such as WhatisMyIP , myIPddress.com and IP Chicken provide a quick and easy way to determine your external IP address.

Troubleshooting IP Addresses
If you're behind a network, your IP address will probably begin with 192 or 10. These are valid numbers. However, if it begins with 169, or is 0.0.0.0, then there is a problem with your network configuration.

Routers
If you connect through a router, you often need to connect directly to the router itself. Routers usually have IP addresses of 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.
