IP Address Management (IPAM)
Infoblox IPAM Automation Solutions for Better Network Performance
Soon, Internet Protocol (IP) networks will mediate all business and everyday activitiesâ€”from gaining access to a building to making a phone call. As networks grow more complex, IP address management (IPAM) becomes increasingly difficult. Today, network engineers at many organizations spend hundreds of hours on manual efforts to manage IP addresses: manual IP address assignment may involve numerous complex and time-consuming steps spanning several departments, and can result in increased network operating costs, configuration errors, network outages and long troubleshooting times. IPAM automation is now a competitive advantage, and will soon become a necessity.

IPAM automation yields up significant savings in IP management and monitoring related activities. Tasks that took hours or days to complete can now be accomplished in minutes, freeing IT staff to focus on strategic initiatives like virtualization and cloud and mobile computing.
