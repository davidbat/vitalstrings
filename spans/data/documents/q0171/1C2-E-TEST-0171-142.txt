What is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is the unique numeric address of a computer on the Internet. IP addresses are usually written as four numbers separated by periods.
A computer may have a static IP address which is permanently assigned to it, or a dynamic IP address which is assigned to it each session and may change from session to session.
