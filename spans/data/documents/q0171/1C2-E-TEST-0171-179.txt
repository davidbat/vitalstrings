What is an IP           address?
 
An Internet               Protocol (IP) address is unique number, similar to a phone number, which is               used to identify a device on a TCP/IP network. A Wide Area Network (WAN) IP               address is the used to identify a device, usually your PC on the Internet. The               current version of IP displays your address as 4 groups of decimal numbers               separated by decimal points, called octets. The format is ###.###.###.###. Each               group of numbers ranges from 0 to 255 (i.e., 123.23.54.23).
Many Internet users may want to know what their WAN IP address is so that they                can access their computer from their office, or perhaps they are running an FTP                or game server on their PC and would like others to be able to connect to these                services. In order to make this possible, remote users must know what the                correct WAN IP address is.
Since an IP address is a relatively large number, it’s difficult for people to                remember. To get around this problem, an IP address can be assigned to a host                name such as ezdns.com. In order for an IP address to be assigned a host name,                it must remain relatively constant. Since there are a limited number of                possible IP address combinations, most residential Internet customers are assigned a dynamic IP address from their Internet Provider. The lease on this                address can be released and sent back to the address pool after months, weeks                or even after several hours.
It is this dynamic behavior that makes hosting Internet services on your home                or office PC so difficult. EzDNS attempts to alleviate this frustration by                detecting these changes in your address and publishing your PC’s new WAN IP                address to a static web page of your choice via FTP or it can even send an                e-mail to you and your remote users notifying them of the address change. EzDNS                can even monitor if your favorite programs are still running on your PC, even                if you are in a remote location.
