Why does it say I'm several miles from where I really am?
Your IP address may be represented by your ISPs physical location (e.g. AOL, NetZero, etc.). We are constantly updating our location database but are by no means perfect, if you receive an incorrect location it may indicate that your IP range is new or has recently moved.
