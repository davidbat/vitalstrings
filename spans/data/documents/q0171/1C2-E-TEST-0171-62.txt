Class A addresses are used for very large networks, while class C addresses are for example allocated to small company networks.
Reserved IP addresses
It frequently happens that in a company or organisation only one computer is linked to the Internet and it is through this that other computers on the network access the Internet (generally we talk of a proxy or gateway).
In such a case, only the computer linked to the network needs to reserve an IP address with ICANN. However, the other computers still need an IP address to be able to communicate with each other internally.
So, ICANN has reserved a handful of addresses in each class to enable an IP address to be allocated to computers on a local network linked to the Internet without the risk of creating IP address conflicts on the network of networks. These are the following addresses:
Private class A IP addresses: 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254, enabling the creation of large private networks comprising of thousands of computers.
Private class B IP addresses: 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254, making it possible to create medium sized private networks.
Private class C IP addresses: 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254, for putting in place small private networks.
Subnet masks
Subnet masks
In short, a mask is produced containing 1s with the location of bits that you want to keep and 0s for those you want to cancel. Once this mask is created, you simply put a logical AND between the value you want to mask and the mask in order to keep the part you wish to cancel separate from the rest.
So a netmask is presented in the form of 4 bytes separated by dots (like an IP address), it comprises (in its binary notation) zeros at the level of the bits from the IP address that you wish to cancel (and ones at the level of those you want to keep).
Importance of subnet masks
The primary importance of a subnet mask is to enable the simple identification of the network associated to an IP address.
Indeed, the network is determined by a certain number of bytes in the IP address (1 byte for class A addresses, 2 for class B and 3 bytes for class C). However, a network is written by taking the number of bytes which characterise it, then completing it with zeros.  For example, the network linked to the address 34.56.123.12 is 34.0.0.0, because it is a class A type IP address.
To find out the network address linked to the IP address 34.56.123.12, you simply need to apply a mask where the first byte is only made up of 1s (which is 255 in decimal), then 0s in the following bytes.
The mask is: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
The mask associated with the IP address 34.208.123.12 is therefore 255.0.0.0.
The binary value of 34.208.123.12 is: 00100010.11010000.01111011.00001100
So an AND logic between the IP address and the mask gives the following result:
00100010.11010000.01111011.00001100 AND 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 = 00100010.00000000.00000000.00000000
Which is 34.0.0.0. It is the network linked to the address 34.208.123.12
By generalising, it is possible to obtain masks relating to each class of address:
For a Class A address, only the first byte must be retained. The mask has the following format 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000, i.e. 255.0.0.0 in decimal;
For a Class B address, the first two bytes must be retained, which gives the following mask 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000, relating to 255.255.0.0 in decimal;
For a Class C address, by the same reasoning, the mask will have the following format 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000, i.e. 255.255.255.0 in decimal;
Creation of subnets
Let us re-examine the example of the network 34.0.0.0, and assume that we want the first two bits of the second byte to make it possible to indicate the network.
The mask to be applied will then be:
11111111.11000000.00000000.00000000
If we apply this mask to the address 34.208.123.12 we get:
34.192.0.0
In reality there are 4 possible scenarios for the result of the masking of an IP address of a computer on the network 34.0.0.0
When the first two bits of the second byte are 00, in which case the result of the masking is 34.0.0.0
When the first two bits of the second byte are 01, in which case the result of the masking is 34.64.0.0
When the first two bits of the second byte are 10, in which case the result of the masking is 34.128.0.0
When the first two bits of the second byte are 11, in which case the result of the masking is 34.192.0.0
Therefore, this masking divides a class A network (able to allow 16,777,214 computers) into 4 subnets - from where the name of subnet mask - can allow 222 computers or 4,194,304 computers.
It may be interesting to note that in these two cases, the total number of computers is the same, which is 16,777,214 computers (4 x 4,194,304 - 2 = 16,777,214).
The number of subnets depends on the number of additional bits allocated to the network (here 2). The number of subnets is therefore:
