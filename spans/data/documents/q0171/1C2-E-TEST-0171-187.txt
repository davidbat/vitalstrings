Tools included in this category are:
 
IP                    Address Manager  Using this tool, network engineers                    can identify whether an IP Address is currently available or                    not. The tool helps manage the IP addresses in a static DNS                    environment, using pre-defined user policy. The tool scans a                    subnet and provides the availability status of IP addresses                    in that subnet. One can check whether a particular IP is reserved                    or available. The tool accept multiple subnet inputs, which                    helps in scanning your entire network to get the status of the                    IP Addresses.
During a restructuring of our facility we put OpUtils to the test verifying all our IP"s. It worked perfectly at pinpointing old addresses not used and saved us serious time organizing our approach. Many Thanks!

Rogue         Detection  When OpUtils detects a new MAC Address         in the network either through periodic or manual scanning of         subnets, the device gets added to this result as a rogue device.         Initially, all the discovered MAC addresses will be shown here.         The administrator has to verify the list and delete the valid         devices. This is a one time configuration after scanning the         entire network. Later on, if any new MAC address is found during         the scanning process, it gets listed here.
MAC Address Resolver  The tool can fetch the MAC Address for any SNMP-enabled                      node, with the provided IP Address. This tool also discovers                      the physical address of a device and maps it with the corresponding                      IP address. In addition to showing the MAC address, the tool                      also shows the SNMP availability, IP address, DNS name, port                      number, community, system type, and system description.
MAC Address Scan  This tool scans a given range of IP Addresses and displays                      the MAC addresses for various devices available in the given                      range. The tool also displays the IP address, port number,                      community, MAC address, DNS name, system name, and system                      type.
DHCP Scope Monitor  The tool fetches all the scopes that are defined in                      the DHCP Server and displays the total, used, and available                      IP Addresses in each scope. When the number of available IP                      addresses falls below a defined value, the display turns red                      to indicate the criticality.
DNS Resolver  Network                      engineers can use this tool to quickly get the host name of                      any node whose IP Address is known and vice versa. It also                      shows details like the default netmask, network type, and                      the status for the forward and reverse lookups.
DNS Scan  Using this                      tool one can scan a range of IP addresses to see whether the                      forward and reverse lookup actions are working fine for the                      devices. It also shows the response time. In cases where an                      IP is not used in the network, the tool prompts that the system                      does not exist in the network.
MAC IP List - Provides a list           of MAC Addresses and its corresponding IP Addresses and DNS           names that are collected over a period.
