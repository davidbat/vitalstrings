IP Address
Know Which Is Right For Your Business
If your business is online, then you should have a Static or Dynamic IP address. This explains the differences between the two, so you can decide which is right for your business?
About IP
IP addresses are used to locate other computers on the web and help them speak to each other. Static IP is a permanent address given to your computer, while Dynamic IP is temporary one.
Dynamic IP
For basic usage, such as surfing the web, uploading and downloading files, or checking email you can use a dynamic IP.
Static IP
For more involved usage, like running one or more servers, utilizing applications that require external access, or allowing a service to run incoming audio or video, you will need a static IP address. Depending how many of these you plan to use for your business will determine how many static IPs you will need.
