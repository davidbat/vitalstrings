About
Hostip.info is a community-based project to geolocate IP addresses, making the database freely available (see below) but it needs you to put in your city to make it work. It only takes 10 seconds, and you'll get a warm fuzzy feeling of 'doing the right thing' :-)
Try the example to the right for an IP Trace, or to Lookup IP Addresses.
We now have ~9,133,137 entries in the database!
