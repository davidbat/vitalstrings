Notes about the Subnet Calculator
The subnet calculator implements a classful / classed IP addressing scheme where the following rules are adhered to:
Class A addresses have their first octet in the range 1 to 126 (binary address begins with 0).
Class B addresses have their first octet in the range 128 to 191 (binary address begins with 10).
Class C addresses have their first octet in the range 192 to 223 (binary address begins with 110).
The subnet calculator allows the use of a single subnet bit - for example, a class C address with a subnet      mask of 255.255.255.128 is permitted.
The subnet calculator allows a subnet ID to have its final octet equal to the final octet of its subnet mask -      for example, a class C network address of 192.168.0.192 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 is permitted.
The above is generally accepted as being 'normal', however, certification students should keep in mind that, in some     certification programs, the final two points are regarded as inacceptible.
For classless subnetting, you can use the CIDR calculator .
