I get this question a lot, so let me explain.
â€¢
As I've discussed in previous articles , there are common services on the internet that will return information about an IP address. Services like ARIN , PlotIP and others will return information about the ISP or hosting company that owns the block that the IP is a part of. Typically that will include the name, address, phone number of the ISP.
"... if you're a regular person just trying to track something down on your own, you simply cannot get the information."
At that point your only option is to contact the ISP and ask them. They do know which of their customers the IP is assigned to. The problem is that ISPs will not give this information out to just anyone. Typically it will require legal actions, as part of some kind of police or court proceeding, to get the ISP to release the information.
So can you get a name an address from an IP? Yes ... if you have the legal backing to go get it. Otherwise, if you're a regular person just trying to track something down on your own, you simply cannot get the information.

What can people tell from my IP address? People can tell very little from your IP address. They cannot, for example, tell who or where you are. How much they can tell varies a great deal.
