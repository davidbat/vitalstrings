Lookup IP address ,      IP registries
 
 
When a computer      is online it gets assigned an IP address. Lookup City, State,      Country, general longitude, latitude associated with the IP,      including name and      address of owner of IP address. Owners are not always the users      and to lookup possible address of      user add the Address option . Internet Protocol (IP) Address lookups help deduce possible Addresses sources or      locations through your search criteria.
What is an IP address?
The "IP" in IP Address stands for "Internet Protocol and is a numeric identifier assigned to a computer which is connected to the internet. It      is a unique number that devices use in order to identify and      communicate with each other on a network utilizing the Internet      Protocol standard. Any participating device on the network such      as routers, computers, time-servers, printers, internet fax      machines, telephones, webcams, servers etc., must have its own      unique numeric identifier. This allows transmission of data      packets on behalf of the sender to indicate where to send them      next and for the receiver of the data packets to know that it is      the intended destination. The numbers currently used in IP      addresses range from 1.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 and some of      these values are reserved for specific purposes. This does not      provide enough possibilities for every internet device to have      its own permanent number. Subnet routing, Network Address      Translation and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)      server all allow local networks to use the same IP addresses as      other networks elsewhere though both are connected to the      Internet. IP addresses used locally within the confines of a      local area network are called local IP addresses and those used      over the internet are called public IP addresses. There are two      types of IP addresses (1) Static IP address and (2) Dynamic IP      address. Static IP addresses are assigned to a specific device      and the assignment does not change while Dynamic IP addresses      can be shared or rotated amongst many devices although not at      the same time. IP addresses are conceptually similar to phone      numbers, except they are used in LANs (Local Area Network), WANs      (Wide Area Network), or the Internet.
The above,      Internet Protocol (IP) Address, Instant Messenger Name,      Username, document or file searches lookup public resources and return whatever      is available, associated with full or partial IP, email, Username or      file.

What is the difference between a                  Domain Name, an IP Address and a Computer host Name?
 
Domain names are similar to vanity phone numbers where words are      assigned to represent the phone number.                 Domain name is a text name that a computer network registers for      the numerical ID of the computers in the network. The domain name is used to give                  computers text names rather than using the numeric IP addresses.                  Domain name examples are Abika.com,                  cnn.com, usatoday.com. Computer (host) name are names given to                  individual computers. Each host name corresponds to an IP                  address. Host names and domain names are optional and everything                  can work fine with using just IP Addresses. Examples of host                  names: www.cnn.com,  mail.people.com, Cust149.tnt3.sfo3.da.UU.net  and so on.
 
Can you locate a computer by pinging      it?
 
By pinging another computer on the internet you can tell if it      is currently active and how long it takes to get information                  from the originating computer to the destination and back.                 Ping sends signals (packets) to another computer on the Internet                  or a network to see if they send a return or an 'echo.' If all                  the signals 'timeout' the computer may be disconnected from the                  Internet or is unreachable. This feature only checks if a                  computer is connected. It cannot verify the validity of an                  e-mail address. It also cannot check a specific web page.
