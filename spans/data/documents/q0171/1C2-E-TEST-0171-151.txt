Only a small percentage of internet users know the benefits of having access to multiple IP addresses and just how easy they are to use. The vast majority of people have only one IP that was provided to them by their service provider or cable company. This numerical address may change on occasion depending on your internet provider but this is something you have no control over as most people have their computer set up to automatically detect their IP address. Your current IP is displayed in the IP Address Tracker to the left of this page.
This website will cover three topics. First, I will go through some of the benefits of having a second IP address such as being able to surf the net anonymously and unblock websites and then I will answer the question: how do I change my IP address? I made a brief tutorial to show you two of the simplest ways to make the necessary changes on your computer for both Windows and Mac users. Finally I will recommend sources where you can buy proxies. Use the top ten list of the best proxy sites and read the reviews. Once you buy a proxy a whole new internet world will open up to you and free you of restrictions that you might not of even known you had!
