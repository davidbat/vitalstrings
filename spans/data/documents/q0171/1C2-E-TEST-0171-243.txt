What is IP address?
An ip-address (Internet Protocol Address) -  is the unique identifier of the device connected to the Internet or a local area network.
To put this another way,  the identifier means address, and the device means computer. IP - the address consists of four numbers registered through a point, for instance 211.108.161.140 or 11.92.25.3.
To add, the ip-address has length of 4 bytes. The first and second bytes define the network address, the third defines subnets address, the fourth one - subnet address of the computer.
If the computer is connected to a local area network, its IP-address is given through the network manager, but if the computer has the access to the Internet as well, the IP-address is given by the Internet provider.
Every IP is unique. However, there are networks which connect to the Internet through the same IP address.
In such case, several computers have one IP simultaneously . To add, such network is an Internet connection through a server which has external IP, computers which incorporate with the Internet through this server always have an ip-address identical with the server.
Ip-addresses are subdivided into dynamic and static. Static IP-addresses are addresses which stand out the provider, and do not change with Internet connections. Dynamic IPs are usually used in Dial-up (modems) connections, being changed every time computer connects to Internet.
