What is an IP address?
According to the wikipedia:
"An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number that devices use in order to identify and          communicate with each other on a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol standard (IP).          Any participating network device including routers, computers, time-servers, printers, Internet fax          machines, and some telephones must have its own unique address. An IP address can also be thought          of as the equivalent of a street address or a phone number (compare: VoIP) for a computer or other          network device on the internet. Just as each street address and phone number uniquely identifies a          building or telephone, an IP address can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device          on a network.
An IP address can appear to be shared by multiple client devices either because they are         part of a shared hosting web server environment or because a proxy server (e.g. an ISP or          anonymizer service) acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of its customers, in which case          the real originating IP addresses might be hidden from the server receiving a request. The          analogy to telephone systems would be the use of predial numbers (proxy) and extensions (shared).
IP addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. IANA generally assigns          super-blocks to Regional Internet Registries, who in turn allocate smaller blocks to Internet          Service Providers and enterprises."
