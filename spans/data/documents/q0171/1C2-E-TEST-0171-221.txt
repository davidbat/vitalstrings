Unix-like OS
In many Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu, RHEL, OS X, BSD), a shared system administration utility known as ifconfig is available to configure, control, and query TCP/IP network interface parameters from a command line interface (CLI). Typically, ifconfig can only be used under a superuser account in your terminal.
To obtain your IP Address from ifconfig, enter the following command:
ifconfig
A list of all your network interfaces will appear. Following the heading of the interface whose IP address you're searching for, you will see a "inet addr:" section containing your IP address.
More information can usually be obtained through initiating the command:
man ifconfig

Via the web
If you are connected to the Internet, visit WhatIsMyIP.com . The site will display your IP address and other information about your system. If the page does not appear, you may not have a working Internet connection and should try one of the above methods.
Note: This IP address is known as your external IP address; it may differ from those mentioned in different sections of this article.
