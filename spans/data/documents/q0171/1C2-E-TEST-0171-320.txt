Dreamhost.com DNS zone troubles cause 350,000 dreamhost sites to go down for 8 hrs.
There is a temporary fix to get your site working again below
The dreamhost.com DNS zone is currently having troubles, so most hostnames within this zone are not resolving. This shouldn't have any effect on customer sites' DNS, only central DreamHost services that use the dreamhost.com domain (wiki, panel, etc).
We're looking into the cause and getting things fixed up.
Update Thu Feb 22 03:18:44 PST 2007: The authoritative DNS servers are returning records correctly again, and things are returning to normal as cached answers expire.
