Easily hide or change your IP address anytime with the IP Changer!
Are you concerned                  about Internet privacy?
Do you want                  to hide your IP address (157.55.17.198) from websites?
Would you like to            change your IP address to another location?
Do you need                  an IP address in your home country?
Our easy-to-use software          lets you change your IP address anytime by routing your Internet traffic          through private and secure servers worldwide. A small dropdown box will          appear on your web browser toolbar (Internet Explorer or Firefox) with          a list of several countries. Select one and your IP address will change          so that you appear to be located in that country. You can quickly jump          back and forth between IP's around the world!
IP address options are arranged                alphabetically by country. Just click the box to instantly get an                IP address in the location of your choice. When surfing websites                where you are not concerned about displaying your IP, you can select "Clear" for your regular Internet connection (see images                below).
    
It's a very simple                matter for website operators, ISP's, spammers, hackers, and others                to determine your IP address, your ISP location, and more.
Your IP Address:   157.55.17.198
Using such information,                a hacker could attempt to break into your computer, websites could                keep records of your visits, and tracking software could map a path                to your geographic location. Some bulletin board type websites even                display your IP address for public view when you post a message.
However, when you use          the IP Changer, the information available to websites that you visit is          altered (IP address, ISP server, and country location). Your IP address          can appear to be located in any of the countries listed below.
Change your IP address          to any of these locations:    (As          of July 1, 2012)
