Each of the four numbers uses eight bits of storage, and so can               represent any of the 256 numbers in the range between zero (binary               00000000) and 255 (binary 11111111). Therefore, there are more               than 4 billion               possible different IP addresses in all:
4,294,967,296   =   256               * 256 * 256 * 256
Allocations. The Internet                   Assigned Numbers Authority manages the allocation of                   IP addresses to different organizations in various sized blocks.                   The IANA IP                   Address Allocations page provides a focal point for this                   world wide IP address management. An official list of the allocations                   of IP address blocks can be found at the Internet                   Protocol Address Space site, and related information can                   be found at the IP                   Index Encyclopedia .
Most of the address blocks have been allocated to research, education,               government, corporations, and Internet Service Providers, who in               turn assign them to the individual computers under their control.               A few addresses are reserved for future or special use. The historical               top-level allocations of these blocks of IP addresses are described               in Request               For Comments 1466 .
If you connect to the Internet over a phone line, then your IP               address is probably assigned dynamically               by your Internet service provider from an available pool of addresses               each time you log on. If your computer is permanently connected               to an               Internet               network,               such               as at the office or on a high speed home connection, then your               IP address could be permanently assigned, or could be reassigned               each time you reboot your computer.
Lookup databases. You can find out more information   on any particular IP number by searching one of the following databases. Since   each address is generally kept in only one database, you might have to try   more than one to find the database that has the information on any particular   address:
