[ edit ] Finding Your Local IP Address (broadband) or Global IP Address (dialup)
[ edit ] Windows 98 And Above
Go to Start

Type ipconfig and hit enter
It will say something like
Windows IP Configuration  Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection Network Connection:  Connection-specific DNS Suffix . :  IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.102 <-your IP address  Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0  Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1 <-your system Gateway
If you are on broadband, or use a network modem or your internet connection is not through your current PC, that IP is a local ip. Meaning, that is the IP my router gave me, not the IP the world sees. This means that the address is only specific to me in my local network.
If you use dialup with a modem on your current computer, that will be your external IP.
