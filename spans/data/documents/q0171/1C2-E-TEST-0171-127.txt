What is my IP
An IP address is defined as the numerical representation of a device's location in a network. A device is a computer, a printer, a switch, a cell phone, or an iPad©. The letters IP stand for Internet Protocol.
The most widely used IP addresses are IPv4 which consist of four groups of numbers named octets. The common format to display an IPv4 address is: NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN, where NNN is a number between 0 and 255.
Public and private IP addresses
An IP address is either private or public. Private IP addresses are primarily used in office settings to identify devices in a department, to group employees by function, or to restrict access to certain resources in a network.
The three designated private IP address ranges are: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. Private IP addresses cannot be accessed remotely, without special network settings.
Public IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on the Internet or a remote network. Public IP address ranges are much more numerous. This Web site shows the IP address assigned to your location by an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
IPv4 or IPv6
Since the number of IPv4 addresses are limited, an updated specification protocol was needed. A larger pool of numbers is required to meet current and future demand. The IPv6 specification uses additional octets which allows IPv6 to represent trillions of unique IP addresses.
