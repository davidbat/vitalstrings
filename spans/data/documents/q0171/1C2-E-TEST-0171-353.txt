I am thinking about getting FIOS Internet/TV. I have been using Comcast with my own router. My issue is that I use my home computer to connect to my work server via Netextender. In order to prevent my home router/computer from conflicting with the IP address of my work server (192.168.1.1), I had to change my home router's ip address to 192.168.75.1. Before I get FIOS internet and their router, I want to make sure that I can change the ip address of their router.  Does anyone know if this is possible?
