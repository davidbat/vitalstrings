What does an IP Address look like?
IP numbers take the form of four groups of a maximum of three digits each (called octets) separated by periods (full stops). The periods are usually verbalized as "dot".
Example: 199.045.145.123
What is the difference between static and dynamic IP Addresses?
There are actually two ways of assigning IP numbers, static and dynamic. Static IP numbers are permanently assigned to a computer. Dynamic IP numbers are only assigned to a computer at the time it connects with the Internet. Dynamic IP numbers can change every time the computer reconnects to the Internet. Dynamic IP numbers are used to maximize the use of the numbers available to an organization or an Internet Provider.
What are private and public IP Addresses?
A computer on the Internet is identified by its IP Address. In order to avoid Address conflicts, IP Addresses are publicly registered with the Network Information Centre (NIC). An IP Address can be private, for use on a LAN, or public, for use on the Internet or other WAN. Computers on private TCP/IP LANs however do not need public Addresses, since they do not need to be accessed by the public. For this reason, the NIC has reserved certain Addresses that will never be registered publicly. These are known as private IP Addresses, and are found in the following ranges:
From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Why should I concern about anonymous surfing?
IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is your Internet identification number. Everyone has an IP Address to communicate on the Internet. Your computer's IP Address is comparable to your home Address or your Social Security number. If someone can match your IP Address to your ISP's customer list, they can use the information to identify your country, city, internet provider and even physical address. When you surf the web, your IP Address is left in logs all around the Internet: in the logs at your ISP, at the routers of your requests and finally the destination of your request. Hackers and identity thieves can use this information to infiltrate your system and steal personal information, use it in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, spy upon you or cause damage to your PC. It is possible to restrict accessing any information or provide customized content to specific IP.
