Softpedia Editor's Review for Hide My IP
EDITOR'S RATING:
Conceal your online identity by hiding your IP address on websites and programs
Written by Elena Opris on November 10th, 2011
A smart move to make while you're surfing the web is to hide your real IP. There are a lot of people out there who will attempt to hack into your system, and they could easily find and use your personal information, based on the IP of your computer.
Unfortunately, a simple change of IP is sometimes not enough, so you must have an application like Hide My IP that will automatically change the IP address every given number or minutes.
Hide My IP is a simple software designed to offer you the luxury of anonymity over the internet.
The interface is pretty standard in trial mode, and quick settings include changing your IP every few minutes, clearing cookies when the IP changes, or launching the program on startup.
In Advanced Settings you can select to always use a US-based IP (although this option was not selected, our changed IPs were exclusively US-based), use SmartSwitch, use a premium service, or use open-network IP addresses.
In addition, there is a list of Discarded IPs, where you can add IPs you don't wish to be used as your fake addresses, after assigning a hotkey shortcut.
Hotkey shortcuts can be assigned to various commands - hide IP, change IP, stop hiding IP, discard current IP, or bring up the Hide My IP Window.
CPU and memory are moderately used. Too bad there isn't a help file around.
So, if you want a program that changes your IP, therefore protecting your identity over the internet, try Hide My IP.
