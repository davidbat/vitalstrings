How to change IP address using proxy servers
When you visit a web site directly, your IP address is visible. However, if you visit a web site using anonymous proxy servers, your real IP is hidden from the web sites you visit.
You can create proxy services with any number of proxy servers in the chain (supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5, CGI proxies) to change IP address and provide IP address security and tunnel Internet activity through proxy servers.
IP changing software lets you change proxy services per time, per connection to ensure the absolute security; automatically stop or change service if the current service is marked as bad/slow; automatically determine and remove bad proxy servers, specify proxies to be used in proxy chains and much more...
Why you need IP Changer software (change IP address software)
Everyone has an IP address to communicate on the Internet. Your computer's IP address is comparable to your home address or your Social Security number. If someone knows your IP address, they know your ISP, they can detect your country, city and even street address. When you surf the web, your IP address is left in logs all around the Internet: in your ISP logs and in logs of all sites you visit, so anyone who has access to the logs can see what sites you've visited, what files you've downloaded, what videos you've watched. Hackers and identity thieves can use this information to infiltrate your system and steal personal information, use it in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, spy upon you or cause damage to your PC. If you concerned about your Internet privacy and want to change IP address, you can use special change IP address software (IP changer).

Proxy Question
Â• What anonymity levels of HTTP proxy servers exist?
Transparent proxies are not anonymous. They don't hide IP-address of a client and let a web server know that you are surfing through a proxy server. The task of such proxies, as a rule, is information caching and/or support of Internet access for several computers via single connection. Such proxies are not applicable for security and privacy while surfing on the Internet. You can use them only for network speed improvement.
Anonymous - these proxies don't show your real IP but change the request fields so it is very easy to detect that you are using proxy.
High Anonymous - these proxy servers do not pass an IP-address of a client and don't send any variables indicating that you are using proxy server to web site you visit and look like your real IP.
