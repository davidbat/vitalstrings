IP address
broadcast (IP; Default: 255.255.255.255)
roadcasting IP address, calculated by default from an IP address and a network mask. Starting from v5RC6 this parameter is removed
interface (name; Default: )
Interface name the IP address is assigned to
netmask (IP; Default: 0.0.0.0)
Delimits network address part of the IP address from the host part
network (IP; Default: 0.0.0.0)
IP address for the network. For point-to-point links it should be the address of the remote end. Starting from v5RC6 this parameter is configurable only for addresses with /32 netmask (point to point links)

Description
actual-interface (name)
Name of the actual interface the logical one is bound to. For example, if the physical interface you assigned the address to, is included in a bridge, the actual interface will show that bridge
Two IP addresses from the same network assigned to routers different interfaces are not valid unless VRF is used. For example, the combination of IP address 10.0.0.1/24 on the ether1 interface and IP address 10.0.0.132/24 on the ether2 interface is invalid, because both addresses belong to the same network 10.0.0.0/24. Use addresses from different networks on different interfaces, or enable proxy-arp on ether1 or ether2.
Example
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> add address=10.10.10.1/24 interface=ether2 [admin@MikroTik] ip address> print Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic   #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         BROADCAST       INTERFACE   0   2.2.2.1/24         2.2.2.0         2.2.2.255       ether2   1   10.5.7.244/24      10.5.7.0        10.5.7.255      ether1   2   10.10.10.1/24      10.10.10.0      10.10.10.255    ether2  [admin@MikroTik] ip address>
