Details about your IP address:
This is the IP address of the machine                  that requested the page. Typically this is your own IP address.                  If you used a router/proxy you will not get the correct IP address. If you use a home router  to connect to the Internet (or your company has a proxy), the IP address shown will be address of your router or proxy. If you use a router and you want to run a server on your computer, you may need to place your computer in the DMZ settings of your router, or enable port forwarding on your router.                         If you have a network connection that gets a dynamic IP address and you want to give it a domain name so people can reach it easier, you might be interested in Dynamic DNS .
If you would like to look up a domain name and get information about the host, you may look it up by doing a whois search .
To see if your IP address has a Domain Name associated with it, you can do a reverse lookup .

A little bit about your IP address (Internet Protocol address).                      When you connect to the internet, either via your internet                      service provider (Verizon, Cable Vision, etc.), or your office LAN                      connection, you are assigned an IP address. This address identifies                      your computer from the other computers on the internet. Your                      IP address can be either static, meaning it never changes,                      or dynamic, meaning each time you connect online you are                      assigned a new address for that session. Check with your internet                      service provider or network administrator to find out if your                      computer uses static or dynamic IP addressing.
