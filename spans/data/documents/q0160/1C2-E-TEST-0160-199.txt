Easy high scores with Batman in Combat Challenges

Easy high scores with Batman in Combat Challenges
Alternate throwing the Batarang and evading or jumping over the heads of enemies until you get to do a special move (combo 5x or 8x). You can do this five times before it will not add to your multiplier. If it gets blocked, it should not break your combo. It seems throwing Batarangs in succession also works well, as you can throw at least two at a time, and it will not break a combo. Additionally, jump into the middle of enemies, and perform the Bat Swarm.
