Instructions
1
Buy a black hooded sweatsuit. You can find one in most thrift shops. The hood should fit tightly for best effect.
2
Cut some felt triangles to make Batman's ears. Sew them to the hood.
3
Make a small black bat out of foam and stick it to the front of the sweatshirt.
4
Attach the blanket to the shoulders of the sweat suit to make Batman's cape. A soft, silky material is best for this Halloween costume.
5
Put on the sweatsuit and the black boots. Tape felt or fake leather around the tops of the boots to make them taller.
6
Paint around your eyes with black face paint. Cover your nose with face paint, too.
7
Extend the gloves with some strips of felt so they go up to your elbows. Put them on. You are now ready for Halloween.
Tips & Warnings
For the blue and gray version of Batman, use a gray sweatsuit instead of black. Pull on some blue briefs or swim trunks over the pants.
Fake leather is a good alternative to felt, for extending Batman's boots and gloves.
A ready made Batman mask is a good alternative to face paint.
