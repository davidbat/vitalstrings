Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
Alfred Pennyworth: [smiles]
Oh, you have no idea.
[from trailer]
Bruce Wayne:
I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight. But this is different. They crossed the line.
Alfred Pennyworth:
You crossed the line first, sir. You hammered them. And in their desperation they turned to a man they didn't fully understand. Some men aren't looking for anything logical. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
Batman: [to The Joker]
You wanted me, here I am.
The Joker:
Wanna know how I got these scars?
The Joker: [holding a knife inside Gambol's mouth]
Wanna know how I got these scars? My father was....a drinker. And a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. Turns to me and he says "Why so serious?" Comes at me with the knife,"Why so serious?" He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Letâ€™s put a smile on that face!" And..... Why so serious?
Lt. James Gordon:
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now...and so we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector...a dark knight.
