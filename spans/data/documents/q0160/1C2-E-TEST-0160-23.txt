Batman (1989) - Batman Returns - Batman Forever - Batman & Robin - Batman Begins - The Dark Knight - Batman 3
The Batman movie franchise actually began in 1943 with serialized matinees in glorious black and white. Then, the more colorful and cornball 60's Batman TV series spawned a movie that wasted valuable theater time as well. But in modern times, Tim Burton's goth Batman (1989) truly started to see the vision--even with the choice of comedic actor Michael Keaton in the lead role, and Jack Nicholson as "The Joker". While still a bit over-the-top, the flick made enough money to get sequels started and Burton returned with villains Catwoman and The Penguin for 1992's Batman Returns. But then Warner Bros left us with Joel Schumacher and replacement Batmen Val Kilmer (Batman Forever - 1995) and George Clooney (Batman & Robin - 1997). With a "flamboyant" director at the helm, the focus became neon and nipples, and too many villains mixed in. A perverted desecration of the batsuit, complete with nipples and codpiece finally killed the franchise. After an 8-year hiatus, Warner Bros rebooted the Bat-films with 2005's Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan took a more serious take with Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The re-energized franchise led to the biggest comic book movie of all time (currently) with 2008's The Dark Knight. As of this writing, the franchise is secure, and several more sequels are guaranteed.
