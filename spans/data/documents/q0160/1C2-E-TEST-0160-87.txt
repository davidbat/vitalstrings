As            1964 rolled around, National Periodical Publications (also known as            DC Comics) was poised to make a momentous decision. The venerable comic            book publisher had been in business for decades, pumping out the comics kids loved best. Superman. Wonder Woman. The Flash. Justice League            of America. Batman.
Batman,            see, that was the problem. That comic book line ceased making a profit            some years earlier, Batman and Detective Comics (where            the character debuted in 1939) were going to get canned after thirty            years on the stands.
As a last-ditch            effort, the books were assigned to the editor of DC’s science            fiction line, Julius Schwartz. His mission - move Batman into            profitability within six months or else. The team he assembled did the            trick, turning the Caped Crusader into more of a high-tech sleuth and            less of a costumed clown. Colorful villains like Catwoman and The Joker            were resurrected and given new life in stories by John Broome and Gardner            Fox, illustrated by Carmine Infantino and various artists under the “Bob Kane” byline.
That            same year, 1964, Shindig! debuted on ABC-TV. A prime-time rock            music show that featured live (not lip-synced) performances by the biggest            acts, Shindig! was a sensation at attracting the youthful crowd the            network was courting. The show did so well, it was expanded to an hour            midseason and in the fall of 1965, split into two half-hour shows a            week. This two episodes a week format was not unheard of; ABC had been            doing it for a few years as a way of milking their hottest shows. Peyton            Place was broadcast two nights a week in 1964 and three nights            in 1965.
Unfortunately,            the audience unexpectedly deserted Shindig! after that first            season leaving two gaping holes in ABC’s already desolate schedule.            In an act of sheer desperation, they rushed one of their most promising            shows forward for a midseason debut. This was a risky move because,            while there had been other shows that premiered in the winter, they            were never terribly successful.
None of            them.
Ever.
Batman starred Adam West as the Caped Crusader and Burt Ward as his youthful            sidekick, Robin. West was last seen on The Detectives (1961–62),            Burt Ward an unknown. Proving to youngsters at an early age that life            isn’t fair, Batman was scheduled opposite Lost in            Space on CBS.

Together            with screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr., executive producer William Dozier            crafted a show that could be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. Batman debuted on January 12, 1966. Within the first few weeks, the telecast            was attracting fifty-five percent of the viewing audience, with a surprising            two-thirds over the age of eighteen.
They            called it "Camp," ironic comic perfection. The key to Batman was in the lead actors playing outlandishly fantastic situations with            a straight face, and the stunt-casting of hot TV personalities like            Julie Newmar (as the Catwoman) along with aging movie icons like Cesar            Romero (as the Joker) and Frank Gorshin (as the Riddler). Before long,            every star in Hollywood lined up for an opportunity to be the costumed            kook-of-the-week on the top show in the nation. "These people (stars)            would call up, or send their agents around, saying, can’t so and            so be on?"
William            Dozier bragged to a reporter, "Gloria Swanson, I remember, called            me from New York, but we couldn’t find the right part for her.            Everybody came out of the woodwork; we never had to go after those people.            A lot of them I had known personally, and they would call and say that            they would love to do one of those because 'my kids want me to do it.'
"Up            to twelve years old, they take Batman seriously. From thirteen on, we've            got them chuckling in their beer." Indeed, Dozier (who was also            the show's announcer) instinctively knew this pop-art froth had a short            shelf life, just how short? Network rivals were betting Batman was another            hula hoop craze. "They gave it only ninety days. I gave it two            years."
At the            end of just six months, Bat-mania was in full flower. $75,000,000 worth            of Batman books, capes, toys, coloring books, bubble gum cards, and            weaponry had been sold, with Batman's face plastered on every conceivable            product whether it had any relevant practicality or not. Never before            had the world been bombarded by such a ridiculous assault of loosely            branded products. Batman candy. Batman bicycles. Batman lunch boxes.            Batman bath soap. Batman race cars. Batman lamps. Batman every-damn-thing-you-can-think-of!
And            those Batman comic books DC almost stopped publishing two years            earlier? They could barely keep up with demand, any comic book with            Batman on the cover could be counted on to sell up to a million copies            a month. Editor Schwartz had done his job well since many of the plots            for the TV program were taken directly from his four-color stories.
Batman changed the course of television in a profound way by proving that a            program could debut midseason and still be a hit. From 1966 forward,            all three networks began seriously programming a second season.
"Batman will fade, of course," Dozier correctly predicted in the Saturday            Evening Post, at the height of the show's popularity. "We            won't keep all the adults we have now. We have to think ahead."
Dozier            was right to be concerned about audience erosion, he reasoned that adults            would soon defect once the novelty wore off. By the fall of '66, Batman was the number-one show in the nation but adult ratings had dropped            to half what they once were. Not surprisingly, ABC was more than willing            to give the producer another slot on their fall schedule, Batman was the biggest hit in the network's history.
To recapture            lost adult viewers, Dozier decided to try the super-hero genre without            playing it for laughs. To achieve this, he revived one of the most successful            super-heroes from the radio era - The Green Hornet.
