Smallville on DVD!
This        is a Batman's fan dream! Never mind that the documentaries have some footage        in common. And yes, they could have included more. But with four documentaries        plus an extra DVD full of TV spots and tidbits that only a real fan could        appreciate, who's complaining? This is a 5-in-1 package no fan of the television        series should be without, with three specific documentaries about the actors        (Adam West, Julie Newmar and Cesar Romero), one about the series as a whole        and a second disc full of extras.

Season          3 introduces a young Barbara Gordon, who becomes Batgirl and plays a major          role along with her father, James Gordon. In these 13 action-packed episodes          from the hit TV series more villains are added to the series, such as          Poison Ivy - who is originally Barbara's best friend, Gearhead, and a          more threatening version of Maxie Zeus. Several brand new villains for          the series are introduced this season: Cosmo Krank/Toymaker, Prank Joker's          response to Batgirl's addition to Batman's family, Temblor and D.A.V.E.,          a H.A.R.D.A.C.-like super computer created by Hugo Strange to emulate          the worst villain minds in Gotham. Swoop onto this Deluxe 2-Disc Edition.
