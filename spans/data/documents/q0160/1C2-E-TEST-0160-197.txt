Show Description
Step into the world of The Batman,     a high-tech crime fighter in Gotham City, every Saturday morning on Kids WB!
The series, featuring a continuity unrelated to the classic Batman:      The Animated Series, is about a young Batman in the third year of his      crime-fighting career as he struggles to establish himself as the protector      of Gotham City while balancing his crime-fighting role with his public      persona as billionaire bachelor Bruce Wayne. Such classic Rogue's Gallery      villains as the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, the Riddler and      the Man-Bat appear in stories that detail Batman's first encounters      with them.
Batman himself, in his mid-twenties, lives beneath elevated      train tracks and within a 150-year-old drainage system, battling adversaries      with experimental Bat-gadgets and amped-up Batmobiles. His arsenal of      equipment are all operated and linked by an advanced remote-controlled      invention he dubs the "Bat-Wave."
