The trigger point is extremely awkward, took me several attempts!
make sure your on foot before going anywhere near it ad walk towards it, no flying, and fingers crossed I'm afrraid, refer to the guide for an actual location

Just started going through all the challenge maps and campaigns and my god the combat handles perfectly... it's just so fluid
So glad I bought Nightwing because his electrified batons kick ass!

so i finished the game yesterday. but all the audio cut out in the final cut scene and there was no sound at all. it wasn't my tv cuz when i hit the xbox guide it made noise still....that made me so mad. is my game messed up? and did this happen to anyone else?
