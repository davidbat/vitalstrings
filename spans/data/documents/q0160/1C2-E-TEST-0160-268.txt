As we ponder who the final line up of villains in the Dark Knight sequel (Batman 3) will be, here’s a picture gallery of the options, with a short explanation of who they are.
Leave the combination you think they’ll pick in the comments, and we’ll give a prize to one reader who gets it right when the movie is released. Update June 2011: We now know it’ll be Bane and Catwoman with a touch of Ra’s al Ghul, but who else is going to make a cameo? The winner will be the one who gets closest on all fronts, with an obvious advantage to anyone who guessed Bane and Catwoman before they were announced (if anyone did…).
Which villains would you like them to choose for the Dark Knight sequel?
