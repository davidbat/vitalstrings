Why should you buy a used cake pan on eBay?
- On eBay you'll find almost every cake pan that has ever existed
- You know exactly what you're getting (and you know it'll work... ;-)
- You'll probably use it only once, so why even think about buying a new one?!

I rented a batman cake pan from a local store. The icing I made using Wilton's buttercream icing recipe. I tinted it using Wilton's pastes. This Batman birthday cake took me five hours to decorate. I followed the instructions on the cake pan which is also available on Wilton's website.
This is my sixth birthday cake and it was my hardest one. I found it hard to place Batman's eyes and mouth. The small areas that were iced smooth were tough. The birthday boy loved it, that's the main thing!
