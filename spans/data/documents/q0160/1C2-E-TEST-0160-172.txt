Shut up, Dick!  You, stay here!  Me, to the Batcave!
Dick
Why can't I come?  Aren't I your partner?  Don't you trust me?
Bruce
Yeah, uh, sure I trust you...but listen, I'm Alfred's sponsor and with me away, who's going to keep him on the wagon?
Dick
On the...Alfred hasn't even SEEN the wagon, Bruce!  You don't trust me!
Bruce
Of course I trust you.  That's why you have the most important job in the world--watching the cave while I'm away.
Bruce walks away.
INT. POLICE HQ - COMMISSIONER GORDON'S OFFICE
COMMISSIONER GORDON is sitting at his desk fiddling with some pencils.  His secretary's voice is heard over the intercom.
Secretary
Commissioner, Batman is here to see you.
Gordon
(sounding very much like Droopy Dog)
Does he have an appointment?
Batman walks in.
I think that signal in the sky is appointment enough.
Gordon
Signal?  Oh yeah!  Batman, we received a video tape from the Joker.  But then we taped over it by accident.  But luckily, Blockbuster Video had several copies.  I think you should see this.
He turns on the TV and the tape begins to play.  The Joker appears on the set.
Joker
Joker here.  Before I go on with this ransom demand, I'd like to thank our sponsors.  Texaco, star of the American road, and Budweiser, the King of Beers, who proudly gives the Budweiser Villain of the Week award to Lex Luthor for unleashing a mutant cockroach on Metropolis. Great going, Lex.
Now let's get down to business.  We have abducted Leggy Supermodel.  She is being held in our secret hideout, located in downtown Gotham, 13...
Voice off Camera
Shut up you idiot!
Joker
Right.  We will force feed Leggy until she is grotesquely obese, thus ruining Gotham's fashion advertising industry, unless our demands are met.
Batman
What are their demands?
Joker
Our demands are simple.  We want Batman, where ever he is, to come forward and reveal his secret identity.  Do you hear me Batman? Find  us, if you can, and save Miss Supermodel, or else the joke will be on her.
He laughs maniacally.
This doesn't make any sense.
Gordon
Joker gives clowns a bad name.
Batman
If they wanted me to find them, why would they make their hideout a secret?
Gordon
Bozo, now there was a clown.
Batman
It's just common sense that if you're going to lure a man to his death, you should at least tell him where he's being lured.
Gordon
Always making balloon animals for the children, throwing pies in his face.
Batman
I've got to save Leggy.
Gordon
He was so much fun...until the drinking started.
Batman
