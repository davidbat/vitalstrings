I love Super Heroes. So this Halloween I decided go for a Batman costume.
While the costume cost around $35, $20 of it was spent on the mask. I decided to get the mask from the Batman and Robin movie, not Batman Begins. It fits me better and was $12 cheaper. The grey material I purchased at Wal-Mart for $1 dollar a yard and the black material for $1 a yard.
In order to get a pattern for my body suit, I took some old tights that I had from my football years and cut them in half. Those I traced and sewed together. The gloves and boot covers I made from regular black material. I just measured with a measuring tape and cut them out. I sew, so that's how I put them together. If you don't, they do have fabric glue. And they have some good ones out there that really do work.
The symbol on the chest I just made from seeing Batman Begins and the comic book Batman. The belt I made out of passport holders from the $1 store. I bought 5 and painted 4 of them yellow. The fifth one I turned right side out and drew a Batman symbol and put it inside the pocket. The belt I used was an old cargo belt. I cut slits into each passport holder and put them on as seen.
The under pants are just a pair that I found around the house. The final part was the cape. I got 3 individually cut pieces of 2yd fabric. I sewed the 3 together. I tapered the top to fit around my neck and let the bottoms be wide. I could actually fit 3 people under it. That's how wide I got it to be. I wanted my Batman costume as close to the comic book version as I could get.
It cost so much because of trial and error. I made two tops. But it really was dirt cheap compared to how it feels to say I actually made it from scratch. And I was the only person with that style of Batman costume. That made me happy and the costume didn't take long at all to make. Once you have the pattern it goes by pretty easy.
Total Spent: $35
