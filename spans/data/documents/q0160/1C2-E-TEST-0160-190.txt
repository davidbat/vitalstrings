Comics
No true, Batman fan site would be complete without a hearty devotion to Comics. The Dark Knight Detective has endured over sixty-five years of publication in the industry, overseeing literally thousands of Batman Comics, and a great deal of fandom is thanks to the medium. Before the cartoon shows, before the action figures, and before the whacky, ABC series, there were Batman Comics.
The Comics section is one of our site's proudest monuments. A flagship of Batman: YTB, it contains information on every Batman Comic Book, including panel scans as well as detailed summaries and reviews by some of our most knowledgeable and devoted Comic enthusiasts. With constant updates and improvements, BYTB features one of, if not the, most thorough and very best Batman Comic sections in existence. And I may be wrong... But I doubt it.
