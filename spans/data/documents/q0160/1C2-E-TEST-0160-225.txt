The World's Finest Presents
In 1992, the birth of Warner Bros. Batman: The Animated Series changed the Batman Universe forever. The dynamic series
spawned    a new technique in animation using black backgrounds that would    eventually be dubbed "Dark Deco." Dark Deco gave every scene within    Gotham an extraordinary look, redefining the image of the city. The    series also revamped the classic characters, casting a unique    perspective on their origins and personalities. The series included all    the popular characters and even created some new ones. The most    significant change was the transformation of the Dick Grayson/Robin    character in the "new" 90's costume, resulting in a hipper more adult    representation which the character has never seen. The Batman character    continued to embody the dark image fans have come to love while    maintaining the heroic qualities identified with the character.
Another significant change was the transformation of the Rogues Gallery    of Villains. From the ever-popular Joker to the more obscure Clock King,    the series displayed each villain's unique personality to perfection and    introduced new characters, including the popular Ms. Harley Quinn.    Although she wasn't born into the Batman universe until the seventh    episode of the series, Harley quickly overshadowed such long time    favorites as Catwoman and Poison Ivy. Thanks to Batman: TAS,    Harley Quinn will be a staple in the Batman genre forever.
In Fall 1995, the final five episodes aired (85 total episodes were    produced) and the curtain closed on Batman: The Animated Series.
