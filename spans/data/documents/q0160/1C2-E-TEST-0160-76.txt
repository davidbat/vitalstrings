Weï»¿ were damn lucky to grow up in the 90's. it was such a great decade for animation. You had Batman, The simpsons in thier prime, Bevis and Butthead, south park, king of the hill, kids wb, fox kids, abc's one saturday morning, nickoldeon's nick toons, cartoon network's cartooon cartoons, toonami and the start of the anime boom with pokemon and dragon ball z. WOW! Future generations will look back at the 90's and put it in the same leauge as other golden age of animation (the 1940's and 1950's).
