Batman is an infamous comic book superhero that first came on the scene in the 1930’s.  Since that time, Batman has appeared in many DC Comics over the years and has become one of the most popular comic book super heroes.  Batman, also known as the “Caped Crusader” or “The Dark Knight,” doesn’t really have any traditional superhero powers, but has learned to fight masterfully using his great martial arts skills.   Batman is highly intellectual, and uses his wits to outsmart evil villains that come into his path.
Batman’s true identity is that of Bruce Wayne, an American man that is single, handsome and very wealthy.  When Bruce was a child, he had the very traumatic experience of witnessing the murder of his parents.  This event led him to pledge his life to fight against evil and crime.
Bruce Wayne lives in a mansion and beneath it is Batman’s secret headquarters, affectionately known as the “Bat Cave.” Batman lives in a fictional city known as Gotham City, where he and several of his infamous cohorts work together to battle against crime and criminals.   Robin, Batman’s most noted partner, is usually with him on most of his crime-fighting adventures.  Another character that sometimes helps Batman is Batgirl.
Some of the more notorious villains that Batman has come toe to toe with are The Joker, Penguin, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and the very sexy and sultry Cat Woman.  Batman and his cast of characters have also been brought to life in several very memorable feature films.
Batman, along with any of his friends or foes, would make a great coordinated group Halloween costume theme.  You and your friends can decide who will be the evil villains and who will don the mask and cape in order to fight against the evil forces.  Holy Costume Party, Batman!
