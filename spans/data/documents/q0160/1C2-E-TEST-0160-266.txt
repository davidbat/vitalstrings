The darkness and tortured soul of Bruce Wayne are brought to life on Blu-ray.
Reviewed by Greg Maltz , July 10, 2008
Many actors have donned the mask and cape and stepped in front of the camera to fight  criminals  in Gotham City--from  Adam West to Michael Keaton to Val Kilmer to George Clooney. But it was the director-actor  tandem of  Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale that finally hit upon the true essence of Batman in their  2005  blockbuster that reset the series. Batman Begins focuses on the darkest side of society  and one man's drive to fight evil without compromise. True to his comic book roots, the Bruce  Wayne (Christian Bale) of Batman Begins is motived more by revenge than by justice,  and  learns important lessons from his faithful guardian Alfred (Michael Caine), criminal prosecutor  Rachel  Dawes (Katie Holmes) and his mysterious martial arts trainer Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). But  lessons alone will not be enough to save Gotham City from certain destruction at the hands of Dr.  Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) and the evil boss who employed him.
Batman Begins resets the caped crusader series, bringing Bruce Wayne where he belongs: on a  spiritual journey to overcome fear and fight crime in its darkest places.
The story begins as Bruce finds himself in the far east after suffering a series of traumas as a  child  and young adult. The first of these experiences is his fall down a dry well on the grounds of  Wayne  Manor. Alone and injured, the boy is terrified to find himself in the midst of a swarm of bats.  Shortly  thereafter, Dr. and Mrs Wayne (Linus Roache and Sara Stewart) are murdered right in front of  their  son, compounding his fears and establishing patterns of loss, identity crisis and vengeance. After  years of struggling with these issues, having left behind his parents' wealth and his college  education, Bruce resorts to petty theft to try to survive in anonymity and understand the  criminal mind. He is caught and incarcerated in a rough Asian prison. While in solitary  confinement, he gets a visit from Ducard, who is aware of his identity and his past. Ducard invites  Bruce to the mountain estate of Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) to join a gang of vigilantes and  strike fear into those who thrive on the fear of others.
Back in Gotham City, the criminal element is thriving. Mobster Carmine Falkone (Tom Wilkinson)  controls half the city through his influence and underworld connections. Meanwhile, Alfred has  declared Bruce dead, and Wayne Enterprises falls into the hands of its unscrupulous CEO, Earle  (Rutger Hauer), who is taking the company public in an attempt to break all ties with the Wayne  ideals of social outreach and fiscal responsibility. And a criminal mind is at work in the form of Dr.  Crane, who is working with Falkone and a mysterious foreign boss to taint Gotham City's water  supply with a dangerous contaminant. It is against this backdrop that a more confident, assured  Bruce Wayne returns home. As the final step in establishing his identity, Bruce decides to make  himself into a crime fighting symbol using the bat to strike fear into his opponents. With the help  of Alfred and Wayne Enterprises scientist Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Batman is born in a way  far more vivid, hard-hitting and accessible than previous incarnations.
Batman Begins Blu-ray, Video Quality
 
One of the flagship Warner releases on HD DVD, Batman Begins was delayed on BD to  better capitalize on interactive features. Unfortunately, Warner appeared to make no effort to  capitalize on Blu-ray's overarching feature: superior capacity. The bitrates of the BD are no better  than that of the HD DVD. That means the picture and sound are also held back by the HD DVD,  and  appear to have been sourced from the same transfer. The video and audio are not bad at all, but Batman Begins is not up to reference quality by any accurate assessment. The most  frustrating part of this observation is not just waiting more than a year for no significant  bitrate improvement over the HD DVD, but in comparing Batman Begins to a six-minute  prologue of The Dark  Knight, which is included on the BD. Every frame of the prologue is truly reference quality,  generating a stark contrast to the comparably veiled and constricted dynamics of the main  feature.
Watch the scene on the frozen lake, where Bruce spars with Ducard. The color and detail is a  touch muted, although the resolution is actually quite good. The tonal balance, from light to dark,  appears lifelike, but definition is subdued as if a thin layer of plastic is placed over the  screen. It is this "veiling" from the low bitrate transfer that hinders the picture and separates it  from reference quality BDs like No Country for Old Men. Night scenes show good black  level and adequate 1080p detail, far surpassing the DVD version. Since darkness and gradients of  black are featured so prominently in the film and in Batman's accouterments, it becomes a  necessity to resolve objects in night scenes. Here again, the BD does an adequate job, and many  night scenes show good depth. Unfortunately, some life appears sucked out of the picture.
Batman Begins Blu-ray, Audio Quality
 
Like the video, the audio appears to be a straight port from the HD DVD, presented in Dolby TrueHD  5.1 at 16-bit, 48 kHz. While this isn't bad or offensive (there is no audible distortion) it is similar to  CD resolution. Warner again does not capitalize on the capacity or capability of Blu-ray's advantages.  Still, dialog orchestral sound and some effects and explosions are adequate and resolve well, if not  the greatest in definition. LFE content is deep and significantly improves action sequences. In a  word, the TrueHD track is polite. And that's a problem.
Watch the scene where Batman eludes the police in the Batmobile, jumping from rooftop to  rooftop. At one point, as the tumbler cruises along a sloped roof, the wheels rip off ceramic tiles in  rapid succession, like machine gun fire. When I saw the film in the theater, the wheels made a  distinct sound as the Batmobile drove over each of these tiles, but the detail, impact and dynamic  punch of this audio sequence was a bit lost on the Blu-ray. The sonics are not badly muddied, but  they lack the  punch, realism and extension of the best BD content. This is a prime example of how HD DVD held  back the HD formats. Hopefully, Warner's days of using low bitrate content on BD are coming to an  end.
Batman Begins Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras
 
� Prologue: The best supplementary material by far is the six-minute prologue of The  Dark Knight presented in a 1.80:1 aspect ratio at 1080p resolution. Rarely has video quality  this good been achieved in home video. The scene shows a bank heist orchestrated by The Joker  (Heath Ledger) and his cohorts--each with a clown-face mask. The scene is shot, acted  and produced impeccably for IMAX. In addition to whetting viewers' appetites for the sequel, the  reference quality of the prologue shows the shortcomings (both video and audio) of Batman  Begins.
� Picture-in-Picture: This is why we had to wait so long for the title to appear on BD? The  interviews, behind-the-scenes sequences, and commentary are all quite interesting, but I would  have much preferred that Warner focused its efforts on delivering the feature film in the best  possible quality. The PiP material showcases director Christopher Nolan and all the major actors of Batman Begins. Much of the content is very instructive; however, there are lags in which  no picture or commentary is included for a couple minutes at a time, which hurts the  pacing.
� Genesis of the Bat: Clocking in at 15 minutes, this featurette is in standard definition  like all remaining supplementary material (aside from the theatrical trailer). Genesis of the  Bat is an amalgam of several on-set interviews--mostly from Nolan and screenwriter David S.  Goyer--to explain the conception of Batman Begins to reset the Batman saga.
� Batman: The Journey Begins: At 14 minutes, this featurette is among the least  rewarding supplementary features on the BD. It focuses on the film's casting of such stars as  Christian Bale, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy, among the other actors that helped Batman  Begins achieve success.
� Path to Discovery: Another 14-minute, standard definition featurette, Path to  Discovery documents the film's opening footage shot in Iceland and the challenges of  shooting in a cold climate.
� Saving Gotham City: Clocking in at 13 minutes, this featurette focuses on the film's  action sequences. Nolan sought to minimize computer-generated graphics and developed better  ways to shoot the scenes. This not only makes Batman Begins impressive from a  technical standpoint, but it eliminated the need to integrate CGI into the film, which can  dynamically squash the image.
� Shaping Mind and Body: At 13 minutes, this documentary shows why Bale, a  questionable candidate for a superhero, is actually the most successful actor to try on the Batsuit.  The behind-the-scenes footage and interview commentary document the way Bale worked hard  at his role while effortlessly latching on to the concepts laid out by Nolan and Goyer. Easily one of  the best  featurettes on the BD.
� Gotham City Rises: Another fascinating featurette clocking in at 13 minutes showcases  the design team that put together the most elaborate incarnation of Gotham City. By combining  designed sets with existing structures, the film achieved an amazing metropolitan look, ranging  from the luxurious sets of Wayne Manor to the precarious elevated train to the slums of  Gotham's "The Narrows" district.
� Cape and Cowl: This eight-minute documentary focuses on the Batsuit from a  conceptual, technical and practical perspective. It shows how much work went into every detail of  Batman's outfit.
� Batman: The Tumbler: Clocking in at 14 minutes, this featurette showcases the  Batmobile, from Nolan's original vision as a cross between a Hummer and a Lamborghini to Katie  Holmes' take on the vehicle. Some interesting technical details, but mostly fluff.
Rounding out the supplementary content is a still gallery from standard definition PR campaigns,  a set of SD confidential files showing conceptual animated text pages, an MTV spoof entitled Tankman Begins, from the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, and the high definition theatrical  trailer (abbreviated version).
Batman Begins Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation
 
Part of what makes Batman Begins succeed is the way it  focuses on Bruce Wayne's psychology and motivations. The film carefully and chronologically  documents how he goes from frightened and orphaned child to the ruthless caped crusader.  While Bale is excellent in his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, he seems tentative in becoming Batman.  Bale admitted struggling to get Batman's voice and other mannerisms, and this seems apparent,  but this just makes the caped crusader more endearing and believable. Unlike other superheroes,  Batman does not have any superhuman powers. He relies on manmade technologies and his own  martial arts training to outwit, overpower and defeat his enemies. So it makes sense that the  confidence and character to become Batman should build more gradually. Bale's vulnerabilities are in-character. That is why his approach works.
There are a few  amateur moments in the film--Dr. Crane's delivery was sometimes off, as was Dawes'--but with  Bale's  solid portrayal of Bruce  and Nolan's ability to pull the entire story together, the new saga of Batman is off to a riveting  start. Throw in some fine effects, excellent sets of Gotham City and dark cinematography, and Batman  Begins may be the best superhero film ever. Even though there are some negative vestigial  effects of Warner playing both sides of the fence with BD and HD DVD, this is an easy BD to  recommend, and an important addition to any Blu-ray collection.
