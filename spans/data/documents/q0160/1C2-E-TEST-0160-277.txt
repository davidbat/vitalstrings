Krusty's skin-coloured make-up comes off to reveal a completely white complexion underneath. The same happened to the Joker in Batman.

In Simpsons Comics and Stories #1, in the story "Lo, There Shall Come a Bartman," Bart says the following line when trying to choose a theme for his new superhero alias: "If there's one thing I've learned from comic books, it's that criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot. To strike terror into their hearts, maybe all you need is a disguise. A creature of the night -- dark -- terrible --". This line is a direct parody of Bruce Wayne's (Batman), back in 1938 -- "Criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, so I must wear a disguise that will strike terror into their hearts! I must be a creature of the night, like a... a... a bat!"
This Bartman business continued. After "Simpsons Comics and Stories," Bongo released several issues of "Bartman", which parodied various parts of Batman, including the Batsignal (Bartman's version was a silhouette of Bart's spiky hair). There were also some video game appearances of Bartman, in games such as "Bartman Meets Radioactive Man" and "Bart's Nightmare".
On a personal note, in Simpsons Comics #6 (UK version), a picture I drew called "Bartman Forever" was printed. It was a parody of the Batman Forever video box art. I was 12 years old at the time.
