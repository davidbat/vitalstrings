Batman,               like Robin and Superman were the first WGSH figures produced and never left                the assortment. Batman also has the distinction of being one of                the few figures to make it into every Mego Superhero line, no               matter  the format, Mego put a Batman into the mix.
One of the more fondly remembered features of the Mego Batman               figure are the "oven mitt" style gloves that the early               WGSH characters had. The "oven mitt' gloves had a relatively short tenure at Mego, by 1974 the Green               Arrow had painted hands with a cloth cuff. In 1975, characters               like Iron Man began appearing with               a solid plastic glove. Despite the fact that the company kept improving               the gloves, Mego never thought to go back and fix the oven mitts               from previous releases. "If it ain't broke don't fix it", seems to be the motto               here.
The character of Batman has always been appealing to toy manufacturers               because of the many vehicles and gadgets the character uses. Mego               was quick to exploit Batman with many Bat               related playsets and vehicles.
The character, still made popular by afternoon reruns of it's               60's  smash TV Series, was a standout seller for Mego. The early               figures  had a removable cowl that allowed children to go from               Batman to  his alter ego Bruce               Wayne .
Variations
Return to Top
The first Batman by Mego is perhaps the quintessential Mego Action            Figure. The Removable Cowl Batman came in the initial Solid Box offering,            as well as early window boxes and Kresge cards.  After a relatively            short time (somewhere in 1974 by    any guess) Mego switched to a molded head, or "Painted Cowl" Batman.    The sculpt was a very light-hearted and kid-friendly approach. Note    the small stubby ears on the Caped Crusader. It's not known whether    this was caused by consumer complaints (kids would lose the cowl    in a heartbeat) or a cost- cutting, production-simplifying decision.

Because Batman was produced from 1973 until 1982 by Mego, there                are a staggering amount of variations both subtle and obvious               to  the figure. Here, Tom has provided a dramatic group shot of               various  Mego Batman figures all in some way different from each               other.
Solid Box

The first Batman (Removable cowl) were sold in solid boxes for               a short period of time in 1973. While the graphic is the same on               the back of all Mego Batman boxes, this is in fact a solid box               from the very first wave of Heroes. The solid Batman box is one               of the hardest to find items of all, because it was in circulation               for a very short period of time. Retailer's complained that kids               ripped the solid boxes open to see the doll, so window boxes and               bubble cards were quickly introduced.

As           illustrated in the Mego Museum Library's Comic           Origins of Mego Art the Mego Batman box art was a Mego trace-job           of a now-classic Batman Carmine Infantino image that was sold           on posters advertised in comic books.
