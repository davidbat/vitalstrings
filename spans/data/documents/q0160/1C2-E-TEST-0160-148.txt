There has always been a huge              amount of Bat stuff to buy since the days Adam West and Burt Ward              took over TV screens armed with Bat shark repellant, Bat computers,              Batarangs, and Bat everything else in the 60's . In 1989's              Batman , Tim Burton brought Batman back with a vengeance along              with the Bat merchandise frenzy. Batman stuff has pretty much been              in abundance ever since but probably nowhere near as much as the              last year or so since the release of the Dark Knight which has become one of the biggest movie hits ever.
