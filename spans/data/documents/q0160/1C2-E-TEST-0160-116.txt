Go batman, great movie. Great for the Burg!
The big show would of been the steelers/superbowl. Its a shame all the steelers didn’t show up. At least the movie being filmed here is a win win for the city.
One thing all you hockey fans, even Mario wants to get out of the hockey business. Maybe he will take over the Pirates some day and bring back a world series. At least baseball players aren’t taking their bats to opposing players heads.

Are you really as dumb as your comment would have us believe? I feel more stupid now for having read it. Wow.

This is great news for aspiring entertainment industry professionals! I wonder what else is thinking of filming here other than the Perks movie with Emma Watson..

The new Batman movies with Christian Bale are very well done. It’d be great to have Pittsburgh as the backdrop for the newest film. Also, the film crew brings in a lot of revenue for the area, thus keeping the tax base resilient. A no brainer.

Those of us who work here are hoping PPG Place will be turned into the Wayne Enterprises building.

Hi,
I am interested in the information I heard on KDKA news today.  Are you looking for 40year old and over to sign up for the local movie?  I am interested.  Please let me know.
Thank you,
