Great on a tight budget!
Nov 30, 2009
A Batman Costume is a Batman costume I always say. The costume was great. I was on a tight budget and I was only going to wear it a couple of times and it was definitely fun while it lasted. I am 5'9 145 lbs and the medium fit great. There are just two things that could be better the points on the mask are soft and don't stay up on their own but some pins quickly fixed that problem and the other bad thing is the belt which is just a kind of foam/plastic material and has no actual use whatsoever (not even to hold your jumpsuit up), though overall it was a great costume.
