Batman and Bedtime
Let's face it. Getting your kids to go to bed is not always easy. My son always loved to make excuses and drag his feet. There was always something else that he wanted to do. He never wanted to listen when it came time to settle down at night.
We remained firm. We established a routine and stuck to it. It was the only way to get him to go to bed at a decent hour. But, that doesn't mean that we didn't allow some fun into that routine. When he was little the two ways that we let fun into his bedtime routine were with cartoon pajamas and fun books.
Superhero pajamas such as these Batman pajamas are a hit with little boys. The versions with the capes are especially popular. What little boy doesn't want to pretend to be a real crime fighter? My son always did.
Books are a great thing to incorporate into your child's bedtime routine. It is great to instill a love of reading into your child at a young age. You can borrow books from your local library at no cost, so you always have an unlimited supply of free books available to you.

Tips for selecting the perfect pair of Batman pajamas for boys
Boys just love Batman pajamas with the cape. This is a great option for young boys and toddlers. The cape attaches at the shoulders with Velcro. Lego Batman is popular with toddlers and older boys. (Little boys know about Lego Batman from the toys. Older boys play the video games.)
Loose fitting Batman pajamas, pajama pants, footed pajamas, and bathrobes are made of flame resistant polyester. Our 100% cotton Batman pajamas are meant to be snug fitting. Batman pajamas are available in infant, toddler and boys sizes.
