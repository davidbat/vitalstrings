Batman and Robin done went and did it again. Batman Gift Stores are open for those who enjoy watching Batman and Robin in action. At the online store, you will find hats, apparel, wallpaper, sporting supplies, jewels, watches, baby products, kitchen accessories and much more. My interest is on the Batman Gadgets. If you enjoy playing games, you will enjoy the JAKKS Pacific ToyMax. This is for TV games. It features over 25 great episodes, including where Batman depends the City of Gotham. You have five super villains who challenge Batman, and the goal is to take out the Joker, as well as Bane, the Penguin, Firefly and Mr. Freeze. There are five different styles, which include detective duties, vehicular combat, driving, platform adventures, and hands on combat. Go Batman!
