Batman Archives 1 (Detective Comics 27-50; w Bill Finger; a Bob        Kane). [From DC Comics: For over 50 years he has        been apart of the American mythos. He was a sensation from the moment of        his first appearance, and today he has archived an even more phenomenal        level of popularity. In that uniquely American contribution to popular fiction,        the comics book, only one other creation has rivaled the celebrity of Batman:        that being the archetype of all comic book heroes, Superman. In fact, the        heroes represent two sides of the same coin. Superman, a super-powered alien        sent to earth to become our greatest champion. And Batman, whose brutal        origin on the dark streets of Gotham City results in comics' most grim avengers.        His earliest stories reveal Batman as he was initially conceived: a mysterious        dark nemesis of crime, a non-nonsense vigilante driven by some inner demon        to eliminate society's malefactors. Later, with the introduction of Robin,        we are presented with the more human side of our protagonist. Not so fierce        perhaps, but every bit as resolute. DC Comics is proud to present this definitive        collection of Batman's earliest adventures. Assembled here are the first        two years of his appearances in his first home. For fans both new and old        of The Dark Knight (or of popular culture in general) THE BATMAN ARCHIVES        will be an indispensable addition to their library. In this volume lie the        seeds of a true American folk legend.]

Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee are one such        team, and their fresh approach to the monthly adventures of the legendary        Batman elicited unanimous praise and unparalleled sales success. But it        was not just two Big Names working together. It was the story they chose        to tell. In Volume One of Batman: Hush, the Dark Knight Detective is challenged        by several of his familiar rogues (such as the monstrous Killer Croc), but        something's amiss. As he pieces together the clues, he learns of Poison        Ivy's latest gambit. Suddenly, he finds himself paired with the morally        ambiguous Catwoman and pitted against his old ally Superman. And someone        is watching all the events unfold. The five chapters reprinted here tell        a story of friendship and betrayal that spans both Bruce Wayne's life and        Batman's career. As individual comics, they were best-sellers. Now, collected        for the first time, they form the first act in a year-long epic.]

Batman: Illustrated by Neal Adams, Volume 2 (Detective Comics 394*,        395, 396*, 397, 398-399*, 400, 401*, 402, 403*, 404, 405-406*, 407-408,        409*, 410, 411*; Batman 217*, 219, 220-222*, 224-227*, 229-230*; The Brave        and The Bold 86, 88-90*, 93, 95*; World's Finest Comics 199-200*, 202* [*=cover        only]). [From DC Comics: By 1968 Neal Adams had completely        reinterpreted Batman's look, and way of being. People were allowed to forget        the short-lived pop art sensibilities and the art helped to rescue the character        from oblivion. Originally gaining experience through covers for Batman and        Detective and stories for The Brave and the Bold, Adams was poised to finally        earn a spot in one of the flagship Bat-titles. Editor Julius Schwartz paired        Adams with writer Denny O'Neil, then a rising star in his revitalized stable        of talent. Their first story, "A Vow from the Grave," established a new voice for Batman, one that harked back to his pulp fiction roots.        The reaction was so positive that Schwartz continued to pair O'Neil and        Adams on Batman stories as schedules permitted. This led to well-regarded        adventures including the Enemy Ace tribute, contained in this volume. Additionally,        Adams worked with writer Frank Robbins to help introduce the first major        new addition to Batman's rogues gallery in years - Man-Bat. Unlike the twisted        Joker and pompous Penguin, Man-Bat was a tragic character who was immediately        popular with fans - so much so, the duo rapidly produced several stories        in response. As the decade came to an end, it was clear that Batman was        once again a vital force to reckon with. O'Neil, Robbins, Adams and inker        Dick Giordano all contributed to that "backward" evolution, revitalizing        not only the character but also his sales. Indeed, the Adams look became        the template that artists have been inspired by ever since. Now, in this        second volume of Batman: Illustrated by Neal Adams, readers can see the        continued evolution of both an artist and an American icon.]

It was a decade in which the caped crusader was to boldly go where no Batman        had gone before. With the success of new technologies, and American children        looking up towards the limitless possibilities of space, science-fiction        entertainment was the talk of the times. As a result, the World's Greatest        Detective was destined for newer and wackier adventures than ever before,        fighting giant robots, kooky aliens and talking apes, to name just a few.        And while it may have left the Dynamic Duo's heads spinning, it was ten        years of unparalleled fun for kids of all ages. The sixteen tales collected        here exemplify this lighthearted time of sci-fi crime-fighting. So please        join our hero, along with Robin, Batwoman, Bat-Mite and Ace the Bat-Hound,        as we time travel back to... Batman in the Fifties!]

In comics, it was also a period of rapid transition,        which saw Batman grow from camp icon to shadowy figure of mystery. The 17        stories collected here mirror the optimism of the first half of the decade        and some of the grim realities of the sixties' latter half.

From the meanest of Gotham City's streets to the heart of its theater district to its seediest harborside docks, the young Dick Grayson must elude Batman from sundown to sunrise. But before the test even begins, Robin saves a man who is being brutally attacked, unaware that he's just interfered with Gotham's powerful underworld. Suddenly, Dick must evade not only the Batman, but hired guns who plan to keep the kid quiet - permanently! Will Batman be able to find his ward in time for a last-minute rescue, or will Robin have to run this gauntlet on his own?]

With the        birth of the labor movements, women's rights and the downfall of capitalist "robber barons" as its backdrop, THE GOLDEN STREETS OF GOTHAM        is a tale that finds true-life events shaping a very different kind of hero.
