INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A            Commissioner Gordon and an officer enter the interrogation           room.                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                          (reading from file)                     Wiggles the Clown, brought in for                     for drunk and disorderly at a                     child's birthday party. Disgusting.                     What do you have to say to                     yourself?            Reveal that the suspect is THE JOKER.                                THE JOKER                     Evening, Commissioner...                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     What the hell?                                POLICE OFFICER                     Sir, that's...                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     I know who it is.                                THE JOKER                     Do you want to know how I got these                     scars?                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     That means Batman... Oh my God.            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM B            We see WIGGLES THE CLOWN sitting in the dark.            The lights come on revealing BATMAN standing behind Wiggles.            Batman SLAMS Wiggles' head on the table.                                WIGGLES                     What the shit?! God!                          (then)                     My head feels fuzzy...            Batman PUNCHES Wiggles' hand. Wiggles SCREAMS. Batman sits           down. BATMAN                     You wanted me, here I am.                                WIGGLES                     I don't want you! Who are you?!                                BATMAN                     Where's Dent?                                WIGGLES                     My head. I can't see color.                          (then)                     I think you broke my balloon-tying                     hand.            INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS            We see Gordon and the officer scrambling for the KEYS to           Interrogation A.                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     C'mon... c'mon...            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - CONTINUOUS                                BATMAN                     You're garbage who kills for money.                                WIGGLES                     What? I'm Wiggles! My name is                     Wiggles!            Batman PULLS WIGGLES ACROSS THE TABLE by the collar.                                BATMAN                     Where's Dent?                                WIGGLES                     I don't know! I was hired by Leo                     Bonner. For his son's birthday. I                     do close-up magic!            Batman throws Wiggles against the wall.            INT. TWO-WAY GLASS ROOM - CONTINUOUS            Enter Gordon and Police Officer. They see Batman throwing           Wiggles.                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     We're too late. We gotta get in                     there.            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM B - CONTINUOUS                                BATMAN                     I have one rule.                                WIGGLES                     I'm sorry! It was two beers and a                     glass of sherry!! I'll never do it                     again!            Batman FLIPS Wiggles and throws his back onto the table.           Batman rushes over and puts a chair under the door to the           room, blocking it.            We see Gordon unable to get in the room.                                WIGGLES                     Jesus! My back. Oh my God, my back.            Batman picks up Wiggles by the head and SMASHES it into the glass.                                BATMAN                     WHERE ARE THEY?!                                WIGGLES                     Who? Oh my god, who?            Batman PUNCHES Wiggles, hard.                                BATMAN                     WHERE ARE THEY?!                                WIGGLES                     I don't know! I just don't know!            Batman PUNCHES Wiggles, again. Finally Gordon gets the door           open.                                COMMISSIONER GORDON                     Batman! Wait! This is a birthday                     clown. The Joker is in the other                     room.            A long, awkward beat.                                WIGGLES                     My face... I think you broke my                     face. I can't feel my arm.                                BATMAN                     Oh...sorry.            INT.
