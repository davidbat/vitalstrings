Everyone makes Batman comics sometime.  And I said not long ago, because of this, "you will never see me do a Batman comic."
But, dear readers, a fact:  Batman is fun.  Batman is so much fun, and that is why everyone makes comics about him.  Case closed, everyone make Batman comics and feel good about it.  Plus, is this not where you go for cartoon butt drawings?  A marriage of two fine things, like wine and more wine.
Now, Sexy Batman came from a particular place, an NYC visit from Olly and Mike, and old friends Scott , Meredith and Nathan .  I won't take all the credit for Sexy Batman, I shan't. PS: enjoy those links won't you?  There are many fine things within.
Related, I met some of the fine folks of Tumblr on the weekend, and what nice ladies and gents they are!  It reminded me, did you know I have a tumblr feed?
I do. It's quite bare bones but it is mine, my tumblr baby.
Now here is some exciting news. I'm going to be published in the fall by Drawn and Quarterly. D&Q makes beautiful books, and I am very happy to be with them.  I'll be working on extra material for the next while, so updates will probably remain about once a week here as before.  But for a worthy cause my friends, as you will see, in the fall!
