Batman: Arkham Asylum Guide
Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane:  An unprecedented repository for Gotham's most infamous nut jobs. Its stone walls resound with the wails and cackles of killers, freaks, villains and a few geniuses -- most of them put there by one man.  But Batman's war on Gotham's worst can't be won by simply locking the loonies away, out of sight and out of their minds.  In the process of hiding Gotham's seamy underbelly, Arkham Asylum has become one of the most dangerous places on earth.  This has piqued the interest of Batman's greatest nemesis, The Joker.
The Joker has turned the asylum's vengeful occupants into his own personal army, and has transformed Arkham into the perfect weapon against Batman.  Facing hundreds of his mortal enemies, Batman still chooses to go it alone.  But that doesn't mean you have to.  Let IGN Guides be your faithful sidekick -- don't worry, we'll leave the tights at home.
