Welcome to Collins Reinforcements.
We are specialist rebar fabricators and offer competitive rates for both cut and bent bar and mesh reinforcement. We also stock a comprehensive range of standard mesh sheets, reinforcement accessories, spacers and tie wire. All our reinforcement is to the relevant British Standards and we have been third party quality assured since 1st February 1991 by UK CARES. We are a family business established in 1983 offering a friendly service, complete with crane-off-load (where possible) primarily around the North West, servicing a range of contracts however small, large or urgent the requirement.
