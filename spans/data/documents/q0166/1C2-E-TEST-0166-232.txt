Rebar 
Our Dubai-based Rebar business is a dedicated operation supplying steel reinforcement to the region’s construction market. Its component set includes the full range of rebar-related products and is backed by a complete design, detailing and processing service.
From its inception as an in-house supplier, Rebar has become a trusted provider to some of the region’s leading contractors - valued for its reliability and flexibility in responding to clients’ needs. Through long-term relationships with key suppliers, it is able to offer highly competitive prices.
Applying lean manufacturing practices and the latest automated equipment, Rebar’s production capacity is twice that of its closest competitors - capable of meeting a third of the United Arab Emirates’ total reinforcement needs.
The business operates to the highest international standards of safety and quality at its Jebel Ali facility, where it manufactures a range of products including pile cages, welded chairs, threaded bars with couplers and concrete spacer blocks.
