Price of Rebar Can Be a Guessing Game
By Mike Domonchuk
When researching the price of rebar from one year to the next, consideration of the price of steel is not the only thing one needs to consider. Year by year market values for just about everything is fluctuating, and with steel pricing up and down, it is difficult to keep track of surveys and standards versus the individual price of rebar per kilogram, or concrete per ton. Itâ€™s partially because of these factors the price is unpredictable.

Now factor in things apart from raw material expenses, specialty items that can lead to future cost cuts. Consider things such as epoxy coated rebar instead of conventional steel. While the price of rebar coated with epoxy is nearly double in price per kg, it will last twice as long as conventional rebar, and save in the long run on erosion from such sources as salt, moisture, and oxygen.
Since 2000, the average price of rebar made with conventional steel has been falling. A good sign no doubt, but all the while, better forms of rebar have been developed, and pricing of concrete has been steadily rising in the last three years per ton.
Consider the cost of concrete, down in 2004 per kilo, but rising again in 2006. Now add in new safety features like newly designed and updated harnesses and the price of rebar caps.
The overall cost of the job, while expensive now, might be dipping in price next year. What is the reason for a seemingly random game of financial chairs each year? Steel, like any other resource is uneasy to guess each year for pricing. The price of rebar itself is just as susceptible to market fluctuation as any other resource in the world.
