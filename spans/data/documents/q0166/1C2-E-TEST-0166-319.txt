Rebar Safety need not cost our Earth
Carnie Caps are now 100% Biodegradable
Most of us agree that our planets resources are worth saving. We at Carnie Cap have refined our product to ensure that once disposed of in landfill, they will cause the minimum impact to the environment by fully biodegrading over time to help ensure that we pass on a cleaner planet to future generations.
With many private and municipal clients awarding contracts based not just on price, but also on the green practices and materials that contractors use, isn't it nice that Carnie Cap can now assist you with both?
Watch how easily they are fitted!

Correctly installed, the Carnie Cap system will withstand a 250-pound weight dropped from 10ft without the rebar protruding, thus considerably reducing the possibility of impalement.
