Demo & Combo
I purchased a Hitachi DH38YE combination rotary/demolition hammer on eBay for $250.  It delivers             5.2 ft-lbs impact at 2800 BPM with an optional 380 RPM rotation.  It rocks.
I found that the best keywords to search for on eBay are "demolition hammer -cd" (the "-cd" filters out CDs by the band with the same name), "rotary hammer" ,              and occasionally "jack hammer" .
Also, look for a supplied carrying case as these things are
heavy
and you want to keep             them out of the dust as much as possible.
Another criteria to look for when selecting the hammer is the rating of the motor - make sure             that you can run it with the generator you plan to use.  The hammer I bought has an 8A motor,              which means it runs great on my 1kW Honda EU1000i (highly              recommended!) generator.  More about this later .
If you don't want to bother with eBay and would prefer to buy new (and get warranty protection), Amazon has the DeWalt D25500K on sale for just $399 (MSRP $880) which is a really great deal - wish it had been available when I              was shopping!  Note that the nominal             current rating of 11A is over the EU1000i generator's output, but also that the D25500K has an             adjustable output and the maximum setting gives 7.3ft-lbs, well over the 5ft-lbs we used last year.             Between lowering the speed/power and not using the rotation for hammering rebar, you should be OK.  Ground Rod Driver Bit
This bit attaches to the hammer and allows it to be used to drive ground rods.  It will             cost you about $50 and it is important that you buy the bit
after
the              hammer as there are several different attachment standards (spline, SDS-Max etc.).
The tool is a hardened steel cup that fits over the end of a straight rod - you'll need              a special adpater for bent rebar.
If you live near a White Cap you              can pick one up at the counter, otherwise you can shop their website or alternatively             purchase a bit at Coastal Tool .
The ground rod driver bit will fit over rebar up to ¾" in diameter.  Bell Coupling Adapter for Bent Rebar
Bending rebar into a peg shape means you don't have to cover exposed ends and also makes             it easier to remove.  However, if you bend the rebar you can't use the ground rod driver bit             on it, you'll need to make an adapter.
I tried several adapters before I hit on bell couplings.  They are used to couple different             diameter pipes with NPT threads.  Attaching a short length of pipe to the coupling gives an             adapter which will fit into the rod driver bit and also fit over bent rebar.  Make sure the              pipe is shorter than the interior depth of the driver bit, about 3" should be fine.
The largest diameter pipe that will fit into the driver is ½" NPT.  I found that the ½" to              1½" bell coupling was perfect for rebar sharply bent to 60° but you may want to find the              best coupling for your rebar.
Attaching the adapter using duct-tape seemed to work well; as long as the pipe is short enough             that the shoulder of the bell coupling is resting on the driver bit then the force is transmitted             efficiently and the duct-tape is only necessary to prevent the adapter from falling off when             you're finished hammering...
A word of warning - the couplings are made from cast iron so are somewhat brittle and will              eventually break, though the one I broke at BM last year must have hammered several hundred             stakes.  I recommend that you bring several adapters with you just in case...  Angle Guide Rebar Starter Tool
Holding the rebar stake steady while starting to hammer it in with the tool turned out to              be a major problem - if the stake is not held steady when you turn on the hammer at 50 cycles              per second, it jumps around alarmingly.  To prevent this I built an angle guide starter tool              that holds the rebar securely at either 90°, 60° or 45° while it is hammered down.
The starter tool is made from several pieces of wood (actually left over from building the              LiteBrite) stacked and screwed together. I drilled the resulting block out at different angles              and then sawed straight down the middle of the holes.  The two halves are attached with a hinge              so that I could open one side of the block after the rebar is in a foot or so to allow me to              remove it from bent rebar.  The bottom piece of wood extends about three feet to give something             to stand on to hold the whole thing steady.
I added L-brackets, one on the static side to strengthen the stack, and the other              on the swinging side with a corresponding hole on the spine into which a bolt is inserted to              hold the assembly closed while hammering. The starter tool really makes the whole setup easy to use, and with it hammering rebar is a simple             one-person job.  The procedure for hammering a stake using the starter tool is as follows:
1. Close angle guide and place on ground
2. Insert stake at desired angle
3. Pull the trigger, hammer away!
4. Once firmly in, open, remove and finish
You can see video clips of the tool in action here .  Generator
The rebar hammer is of course electric so you'll need a generator.  I              found it particularly useful to have a small portable generator that can be moved with the hammer,             especially if you want to lend it to your neighbours (and believe me, they will ask!) - a great             way to meet new friends.
The important thing to look for when matching a generator and hammer is that the power rating              is high enough to run the hammer's motor.  For instance, I already had a generator, a 1kW Honda EU1000i which             can nominally output up to 8.3A at 120V (to get the Amperage, divide the power in Watts by the              AC output in Volts - 1000/120 = 8.3A).  Therefore, I narrowed my search to a demolition hammer             rated at 8.3A or less.  The Hitachi DH38YE I bought has an 8A motor and it runs really smoothly              hooked up to my generator.
As an aside, I highly recommend the Honda EU1000i for the playa - it's a great little generator if you have low power requirements.  In 2001, it              powered the LiteBrite and lights and boombox for our camp, and it runs for about 6-8 hours on ½ gallon of gas.  It's also really quiet (57dB) and light (30lbs).  Ear Defenders or Plugs
Save your ears!  These tools are
L-O-U-D!
.  I found that ours was painfully loud             trying to use it without ear protection, so I keep a pair of ear defenders (muffs) in the              case with the tool.  Ear plugs will also work, but are probably not too sanitary on the Playa.
The loud clattering noise will almost certainly get your rebar hammer noticed and you'll get             to make lots of new friends - thanks to all our fun neighbours who gave us so much cool swag              as thank-yous for us lending them the hammer last year!  Rebar Removal Maid Marian warns:
"
If you don't pull up your friggin' tent stakes             and rebar outta the playa, I promise the DPW will GPS your site,             track you down, and tar and feather you. Save a tire - pull your             stakes.
"
As mentioned before, bending the rebar makes it easier to remove, as all it takes is             a long piece of pipe or bar slid under the hook to give enough leverage to pull it out.
 UPDATE 
When I originally posted this page I was designing a rebar removal tool based on a fairly simple hinged head puller                using angled grip lock in the upwards direction and quick release downwards.  Well, it turns out that there are a number of stake removers on the market using the same                 basic mechanism - I received many emails from burners with tips on tools available so I just went out and bought                 one...
Amazon has the Tolman Stake                Puller for $48 that looks identical to the one we now own.
The DPW have apparently also used The Weed Wrench ,                designed by fellow Burner CabinBoy...  this one is available in several sizes from mini ($82) to heavy ($189) which looks like it can handle really big stakes.
Thanks to Jeff for pointing out the Stake Puller , available in a small size for rebar at $115 or a heavy duty version for $300.
I have received a number of tips from fellow burners on other methods for removing rebar and stakes...
Captain Jack of Picasso Camp writes:
I wanted to pass on a tip for pulling rebar that we've used for several years at Picasso Camp - works well                    if you don’t have the specialized tools!  You don’t push rebar in, you use impact.  It comes out easily the                    same way.  Only equipment required is a loop of nylon webbing (or similar material) about 18-24" long, and                    a small sledge hammer - we usually use a 3-5 pound 'single jack' type short handled one.  To remove rebar,                    simply make a 'clove hitch' loop in the nylon (takes 1 second once you leanr how), and with the sledge hammer                    'pound' the stake OUT of the ground by moving the hammer upwards in the opposite direction that the stake is                    driven in.  Usually only 3-5 strokes are required to remove a typical 18-24" piece of rebar.  Very easy once                    you get the hang of it!
Glen from Disorient has a good tip for larger stakes (thanks to several other burners who also sent me this tip!):
Here's another tip to remove large stakes: I've bolted a 2' piece of                   chain to the bottom of a hi-lift jack. Hooked rebar can be removed solo by                   slipping the rebar through a link on the chain, or a loop can be made in                   the chain with an extra bolt. If the rebar is straight, a second person                   wraps the chain around the rebar three to four times and pulls the chain                   taught. Even large stakes pull like buttah! Pulling your neighbors stakes                   at the end of the burn is almost as popular as driving them in!
 Questions?  Comments? Well, that's it.  I hope that this page is useful to you and that the Playa echos with the              clatter of rebar hammers this year.  It's all about power tools, baby, it's hard enough               building in that heat, let's not break our bodies any more than we need to!
If you have any questions or comments please send me             an email !
cheers,
P.S.
