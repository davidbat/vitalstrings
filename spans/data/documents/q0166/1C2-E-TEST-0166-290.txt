Relton Rebar Cutters
Relton Rebar Cutters
At last, the answer to drilling through concrete-embedded rebar! No more broken or shattered hammer bits- now you can drill through the rebar and not have to relocate the hole to avoid the rebar!
How To Use the Relton Rotary-Only Rebar Cutter. . .
1. When rebar is encountered while drilling with a rotary hammer and a carbide hammer bit, immediately stop the hammer and remove the bit from the hole (failure to stop will severely damage a cabide hammer bit - regardless of  manufacturer's claim).
 
2. Mount a rotary rebar cutter in a standard 1/2" drill motor or 1/2" hammer drill (with the selector in the rotary-only position); insert the rotary rebar cutter into the hole and drill through the embedded rebar.
 
3. Remove the rotary rebar cutter after the rebar has been drilled completely through and finish drilling the hole with the rotary hammer and hammer bit.
NOTE:  The Relton carbide-tipped rotary rebar cutter is designed for use in a standard 1/2" drill motor, but a hammer drill with a standard 3-jaw chuck may be used provided the selector mechanism on the hammer drill is kept in the rotary-only position. The Relton carbide-tipped rotary rebar cutter is intended for rotary drilling only; percussion (hammering) will damage the tool.
