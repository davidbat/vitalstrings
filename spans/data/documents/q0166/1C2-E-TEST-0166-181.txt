Basalt Rebar
Basalt Rebar is an alternative to steel and fiberglass for reinforcing concrete.
Made from volcanic rock it is tough, stronger than steel and has a higher tensile strength.
Much lighter than steel, 89% percent in fact! One man can easily lift a 500 foot coil of 10 mm rebar.
Rebar  is naturally resistant to alkali, rust and acids. Moisture penetration from concrete does not spall. Needs no special coating like fiberglass rods.
The same thermal coefficient expansion as concrete!
Allowing thinner, lighter panels and decks, basalt rebar reduces the thickness and spacing between the rods and the concrete and surface. Much more flexible design! Smaller rods allow for more critical spacing and designs.
Rebar is easily cut to length with regular tools.
Basalt rebar does not conduct electricity or induce fields when exposed to RF energy, great for MRI or data buildings.
Rebar is perfect for Marine enviroments and Chemical plants where corrosion is a continuous concern.
