ABOUT US
 
RMS                      was founded over two decades ago by many of the same key players                      responsible for
introducing the first “automated” table top bender                      to the industry as far back as the early
1960’s. This machine was known as the Arnold Bender.                      Today, RMS technology incorporates
the same rugged and robust qualities as the original Arnold                      equipment, together with
cutting-edge micro technology, resulting in products that                      are long lasting, safe, and unmatched
in terms of productivity.
RMS offers a complete line of Micro-Controlled Rebar Benders,                      including the Model #11, the
Model #14, the Model #18, and the renowned Stirrupmaster which                      is a specialty machine for
bending ties and stirrups.
The RMS Model 611 Hydraulic Guillotine Shear, pioneered by                      RMS over 20 years ago
continues to be the choice of hundreds of rebar fabrication                      companies around the world. In
addition to the Model 611, we also offer an intermediate shear, the Model 311, and the
Mini-Shear, which is designed especially for smaller rebar                      shops, precasters, and masonry
companies.
The RMS Automatic Shearline, coupled with the RMS Guillotine                      Shear represents a truly
efficient, safe, and productive method of shearing rebar.                      RMS Shearlines can be found at
work in shops throughout the world, some producing day in                      and day out after more than 20
years of service. The RMS Shearline was designed using the                      heaviest components, state of
the art electronic and pneumatic technology, and a rugged                      structural steel design. It can be
efficiently operated by its own Micro Controller, by Direct                      Link, by Memory Boxes, or by various
software programs.
Among the other products offered by RMS are a Micro-Controlled                      Spiral Machine, known as
the Spiral-fab and a Micro-Controlled Radius Bender, known                      as the Radial-fab, both of which
have received much acclaim in the rebar fabrication industry.
RMS has recently introduced the next generation of shakeout                      and bar counting for the
Shearline Preload Table. Known as the Shake ‘n Count,                      the system is designed to reduce the
traditional labor involved in shaking out the rebar, while                      accurately counting the number of bars
being preloaded. The result is more shearline output, less                      risk of injury, and a much more
accurate bar/bundle count.
The RMS sales department is headed by Fred Kerr, with more                      than 35 years of rebar
fabrication experience and by Brett Kerr, V.P. of sales, with                      over ten years of hands-on
experience.
The manufacturing facility, located in Las Vegas, NV, is led                      by Skip Brown as its president,
Dave Green as its vice president, and by Tom Green, vice president                      of manufacturing. Many
of the RMS employees have been with the company since its                      inception over 20 years ago.
This invaluable experience assures that each machine built                      and shipped by RMS is of the
highest quality and workmanship.
The RMS research and development department has maintained                      a “state of the art” level of
expertise in the design and development of control systems                      for all equipment, utilizing
advanced Micro Technology. The RMS control systems are considered                      the most advanced,
yet user friendly systems available in the industry.
