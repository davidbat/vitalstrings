Band styles
The band is on a new line.
childedge
The band has an edge at the top and bottom of the child window.
fixedbmp
The background bitmap does not move when the band is resized.
fixedsize
The band can’t be sized.  With this style, the sizing grip is not displayed on the band.
gripperalways
The band will always have a sizing grip, even if it is the only band in the rebar.
hidden
The band will not be visible.  Don’t use this flag in Insert function.  Instead, insert the band without this flag, then use SetBand to hide it.  To restore it afterwards, use SetBand with “S show” parameter.
nogripper
The band will never have a sizing grip, even if there is more than one band in the rebar.
usechevron
Show a chevron button if the band is smaller than ideal.
novert
Don’t show when vertical.

Keep band title hidden.
*
Default styles for the band.  For instance “* break” will set band style to default plus “break” style.
Returns
ID of the newly created band or 0 if it fails.
Remarks
For some reason, using the Gui, Font to change font size before adding ComboBox child to the band will make it buggy in a sense that ComboBox list will not be able to show (although you can still select items using arrows).
