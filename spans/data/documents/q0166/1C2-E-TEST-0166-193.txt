Nighthawks
Nighthawk =
1)  a: any of a genus (Chordeiles) of American nightjars    related to the whippoorwill  b: a common European nightjar    (Caprimulgus europaeus) 
2) a: person who habitually is active late at night
3) another dictionary that I have states: "1. any of several long-winged    American goatsuckers..."    I had to throw that one in...    I've been known as a lot of things, but never as a ' goatsucker '. 
 
Why Nighthawks?
Okay, so perhaps some of the definitions apply; some of you may think    it all applies.  If you're anything like me, you're saying "what    the hell is a nightjar? My grandma talked about a slop jar, but..."
Actually, I decided on the name Nighthawks because I liked Edward    Hopper's painting " Nighthawks "
