“
Over the last three months we have added 7 new scouts.  One sign of a healthy troop is the ability to attract new members.  The troop is the largest it has ever been.  As we continue to grow and attract new members, it challenges us to continue to stick to our program and meet the needs of our scouts and parents.  As I said in my last message, the troop has gotten great parent participation to go with our great scouts.  I know our boy leaders will do their best to meet this challenge.  I look forward to this growth.  Remember Scouting's birthday, Feb 7 (102 years).
