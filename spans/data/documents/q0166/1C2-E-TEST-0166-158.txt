Nighthawks
Nighthawk = 1 a : any of a genus (Chordeiles) of American           nightjars related to the whippoorwill b : a common           European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus)
2 : a person who habitually is active late at night
another dictionary that I have states: "1. any of several long-winged American           goatsuckers..." 
- I had to throw that one in... I've been known as a lot of things,           but never as a 'goatsucker' .
OK - So perhaps some           of the definitions above apply... Some of you           may think it all applies - If you are anything like me, you           are saying "what the hell is a nightjar?           - My grandma talked about a slop jar, but..."
Actually,           I decided on the name Nighthawks because           I liked Edward Hopper's painting " Nighthawks ". 
My         services consist of the following:
   Rebar Detailing - not a long list :-)  Pretty         much like all detailers, I will provide placing drawings, in accordance         with all the acronyms (i.e. - CRSI, ACI, SPECS, DWGS).  The         drawings will include bent bar details (like         they're any good without em..), mesh, and bar supports.  Of course, along with this smorgasbord, you will get full support (good         tech word) via phone, email, fax, and any other way you can         think (tried telepathy but my mind only makes         contact within a 12'-0" radius).  I will (as         you direct) deal directly with you or the contractor         concerning questions etc. during the course of the project.
I         provide placing         drawings in one of         three ways depending on your desire and or the job's usability for the         three: (wait let me get my calculator - 1+1... yup, three!) 
   Manually - 'give that ole time         D-tailing'...  The drafting board, parallel bar etc...         Drawings are forwarded to you via Airborne         Express (or one of the other overnight         couriers).
   aSa - Applied Systems Associates ( aSa )         interactive detailing... which actually requires the combination of         manual and/or cad drafting with computer generated placing lists. (some         folks love it, some folks ain't so fond of it... and aSa doesn't upgrade         it anymore)  Drawings are forwarded to you via Airborne         Express (or one of the other overnight         couriers).
   AutoCAD - If I can get copies of the         structural drawing cad files, I am able to provide placing drawings in AutoCAD format.  If we have compatible software in common, drawings can be         forwarded to you via the Internet (you would         plot and/or transmit for approval -- or maybe call be back and tell me         to Fed-Ex you some hard         copies, "cause the damn things won't plot") or (to         be redundant) hard copies can be forwarded via Airborne         Express (or one of the other overnight         couriers).
I         can provide material         list in one of two         formats... (three, if'n I hav-ta).
   aSa - Applied Systems Associates ( aSa )         Bar Listing...  When used in conjunction with the Interactive         Detailing software, it greatly speeds up the takeoff process.  Bar         List can be forwarded to you via the Internet or faxed (if         you don't use aSa). 
   Staz Software - This material list         can be forwarded to you via fax.
   Excel - (If'n I hav-ta)...  I         can provide you a material list that can be transmitted via the internet         or faxed using Microsoft 's         Excel.
I am           always interested in boosting production (no cost of living raises in the detailing business) - so if you have some suggestions or recommendations for other           software, please let me know.
In all seriousness, in the         event that I might be of service to you, please contact me.  I enjoy long term relationships with many of my         customers, and would enjoy the same opportunity with         you.
