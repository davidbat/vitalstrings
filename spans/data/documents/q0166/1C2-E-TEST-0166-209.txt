Rebar Fabrication Facility
Southern Structural Steel’s Rebar Division, located in Newport News, bids, fabricates and ships projects all over Virginia and into North Carolina. With inhouse detailers we are capable of producing Approvals for fast track projects.
We have our estimators and production managers working hand in hand with concrete and masonry subcontractors as well as General Contractors to provide competitive pricing and quick delivery.
We keep #3 through #11 in stock at all times; and our array of computerized coil benders, table benders, and shear line allow us to fabricate almost any size or shape of rebar.
Many of our customers also appreciate our runner service, Steel Plans Express, that can pick-up or deliver your drawings for quote or detail at any time.
