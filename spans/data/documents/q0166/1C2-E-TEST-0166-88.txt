Not just rebar ... PJ's Rebar
Independent Rebar Fabricator & Preassembled Rebar Products
PJ's Rebar, Inc. is a Veteran Owned Small Business that opened its doors in 1985 providing concrete building materials and rebar supply in the Bay Area. PJ's moved to its present 6 acre facility in Fremont California back in 2004 and has remained family owned for over four decades. This has enabled us to give our customers the products they need and increase our rebar fabrication efforts for concrete, masonry, precast, drilling, and rebar installation contractors throughout the West Coast. PJ's Rebar offers the highest quality rebar products and the most competitive pricing of any rebar fabricator. Don't settle for the "too big to care" fabricators owned by the mills, PJ's is one of the few independent fabricators in California with the ability to supply rebar throughout the thirteen western states. We also use our own fleet of tractor trailers and Bobtail trucks to deliver your products while the competition hires their trucks.
