1000 Solid Metal Rebar Chairs These rebar chairs are constructed out of solid metal rods that wont bend or brake under normal use, unlike most plastic ones, as soon as someone steps on the rebar during a pour they brake and become useless. You can use these with any size rebar, simply put them under the rebar and wire tie them. The have a solid 2" metal base that gives them stability on any surface. These are far superior to the plastic chairs and very versatile. They come in 2", 2 1/2", and 3" - this is measured from the bottom of the base to the center of a half inch rebar. This puts the rebar perfectly in the center of the slab.
