Rebar Protection
Understanding Rebar Protection
OSHA mandates that rebar caps be used to cover rebar and protect against accidental impalement but not all rebar protection is adequate.
 
Rebar such as these ones DO NOT meet the OSHA requirement.
They are not reinforced with steel and a fall may actually push the rebar through the cap.
 
Only rebar caps that are reinforced with steel should be used.
 
 Carnie Caps that position a 2 x 4 over the exposed rebar have also been approved in some instances.
