   Rebar Caps OSHA Approved
Rebar Caps
In the last fifty years safety standards in the workplace have made enormous steps to better protect workers on-site and improve overall conditions, and in the case of concrete reinforcement and impalement injury, rebar caps have been made a part of these standards.
Rebar Caps
Rebar reinforcement is a major part of concrete construction, helping strength and time perseverance issues, and concrete remains one of the most widely utilized building materials in the world today. Subsequently, rebar safety is an extremely important issue on construction sites. Rebar caps represent worker protection where rebar is concerned.
In addition to rebar caps there are other safety measures to protect workers on a construction site. Many of the same outlets that offer rebar caps also offer harnesses and clamps, as well as hard hats, gloves, and all other protection equipment needed to keep safe and complete the job. The OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) has been put in place to oversee the inspection of worksite operation for safety measures for over thirty years.
Rebar caps come in many forms, and their function is to protect workers and pedestrians from protruding or falling rebar injury. They are a small price to pay in the total construction site materials cost estimate, and can go a long way towards making a worksite safe and less stressful. Alternate methods of rebar protection can be implemented, such as bending bars downward until proper usage is required, or placing wooden plank sheets over groups of protruding rebar.

Proper safety measures must be taken where rebar steel is concerned, and rebar caps are a good place to start.
