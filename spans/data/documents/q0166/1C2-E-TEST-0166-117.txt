 Rebar Suppliers
The Ingenuity Of Steel Rebar Suppliers
The deterioration of reinforced concrete  caused by corrosion of carbon steel rebar led to the invent of a non-corrosive  steel bar that was impregnable by chlorides and salt. Chlorides are an  unintentional presence in the sand, aggregate or water in some parts of the  world, penetrating the concrete once it mixes with enough moisture and oxygen  to initiate corrosion. 
Steel rebar suppliers  attempted to employ several methods of resistance against this corrosion  including various rebar coatings (fusion-bonded epoxy, galvanizing); increased  concrete cover; reduced water/cement ratios; corrosion inhibitors added to the  concrete mix, concrete sealers, cathodic protection; and concrete coatings or  membranes.
Rebar Suppliers
After much research and  development, reinforcing bars fashioned from stainless steel were introduced by  steel rebar suppliers nearly 30 years ago, replacing run-of-the-mill carbon  steel in marine applications or areas that were subject to excessive salt and  moisture, successfully extending the lifetime of concrete structures in corrosive environments.
Are you looking for a conveyor manufacturer that can help deal with the warehouse machinery?
Stainless steel rebar  suppliers have contributed this ingenuity to highway bridges, parking garages  and coastal facilities, improving corrosion resistance and reducing the amount  of necessary maintenance. Several grades of stainless steel rebar are  available, including non-magnetic austenitic stainless steel for certain  military, medical and scientific applications, and mechanical properties  advantageous for fluctuations in temperature, resistance to earthquakes.
Most stainless steel  rebar suppliers manufacture or distribute five distinct alloy groups:  austenitic, ferritic, duplex (a blend of ferritic-austenitic, hence the clever  name), martensitic and precipitation-hardened. These groups have different  microstructures, which are determined by the selected chemical compositions and  the production steps involved, upon which steel rebar suppliers will be able to  provide more information.
