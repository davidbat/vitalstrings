Laid back atmosphere, good food.
I had the sweet potato pepita quesadillas and a carrot and ginger soup.
I really liked both but the soup made me warm and happy inside.
Which is why I was a little put off when I asked the waitress what else was in the soup and was basically told the chef isn't saying and to go look online ...I sort of just wanted a general idea of what other veggies were in it and not a breakdown of the entire secret recipe...but that's fine -
The food was still great.
PS - an even bigger kudos goes out to the chef at the Harbour House who wasn't scared to give an entire table his recipe from beginning to end. WOOT WOOT

Tried it again and I'm super impressed
This time I had the almond burger and my husband had the enchiladas and both plates were incredible. And the soup was excellent yet again!
I've been to Relish, I've been to Devour and even though they were okay, I just don't feel like I need to go back to either of them...I will definitely be going back to Rebar.
So so good.
