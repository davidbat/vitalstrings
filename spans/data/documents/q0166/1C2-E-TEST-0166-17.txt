Nashville, TN
2/7/2011 3 Check-ins Here
So Rebar is right there in the strip of bars in Midtown beside Winner's and Loser's.  If you had asked me a couple of weeks ago I would have said that it was closed or was close to closing because, from the outside, it seemed desolate.
So imagine my surprise when I walked in late on a Friday night to find that the place was absolutely JAMMED with people on the inside.  Really, how come I have never talked to a single person who has been here yet it was so packed it seemed like everyone in Nashville was there?  Mystery.  Despite the crowd, we managed to score a seat at the bar.  We managed to get a drink from one of the friendly lady bartenders and the drinks were made the way I like them - strong!  
The crowd was really all over the board but it seemed like there was a reasonable contingent of above-college age persons there.  While I hate to admit it, that's the age bracket I should probably be hanging with....and while I don't normally hang with my age bracket, it was a pleasant change of pace.  Plus I felt as though I was getting checked out by numerous guys as soon as I walked in.  Either that or I had something in my teeth.  But whatever, I felt like they were checking me out so I liked it a lot!  haha
It seems that there are a few nooks and crannies here for your party needs.  There has to be a stage somewhere because I hear they have karaoke on Friday nights.  The front patio is large so maybe if it ever fucking stops snowing I can sit out there and tell you how it is.  
Overall I was pleasantly surprised and I plan to give it another couple of visits in the future.  At the very least we can put it on our Midtown barhop rotation.
