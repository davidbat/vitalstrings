PARK(ing) Day 2011 – Official PARK Count!
The numbers are tallied for PARK(ing) Day 2011! We know you’ve all been waiting patiently to discover the size of the playful and imaginative mark we collectively made on the world this year. And while these numbers make 2011 the biggest PARK(ing) Day ever, it is important to remember that it is the quality of the interventions that matters most. Part of the mission of PARK(ing) Day is to improve the quality of urban human habitat (at least until the meter runs out!). Having lots of PARKs is really cool, but having great PARKs is even better; PARKs that propose an alternate vision for the use of urban space, PARKs that convince others to join the cause, PARKs that change minds, PARKs that make you smile. Without further ado:
975 PARKs / 162 Cities / 35 Countries / 6 Continents
Help us confirm the accuracy of these numbers! Visit the 2011 PARK data page and if you don’t see your city listed, please email us at participate@parkingday.org
See you next year!
