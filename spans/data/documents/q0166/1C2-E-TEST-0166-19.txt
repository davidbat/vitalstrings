I bought this cookbook on a whim, hoping that the food would be as good as it sounded. I first tried the bagel with brie, toasted almonds, and a smidgen of honey, and I added a dried apricots and tried it on bread and crackers instead of a bagel--divine!
The wild mushroom ravioli (with squash and leeks in a citrus, white wine, sage and cranberry sauce) wowed all my roomates and we spent hours at this meal savoring every bite. We tried the Greek Red Lentil Soup with Feta, and it was savory but we made it with a bit too much water. I have had better red lentil soups.
Finally, the best recipe of all is the Roasted Yam and Garlic Soup. Yams, tomatoes, garlic and peppers are roasted in the oven for the base of the soup, and it was made heavenly by the chipotle puree, maple syrup and lime juice. This soup has made everyone who has tried it drop their jaw in amazement.
The recipes can be time consuming; the soup took a few hours to prepare (because all the veggies had to be roasted), but everything is well worth it. Using the freshest ingredients will make the meals even better.
This cookbook is such a gem and is my absolute favorite.
