Advantages                      of the "STEEL-WICH METHOD"®:
Increases a Mason's Productivity and Reduces Labor costs,                          with NO overrun costs whatsoever!
No Overhead lifting of heavy block over Rebar, "No                          Rebar in your face"!
Ability to install reinforcing steel with limited overhead                          clearance through the use of "Telescoping Rod Action".
Eliminates Rebar Waste, by accurate and secure placement                          method.
Provides superior structural strength in masonry wall                          construction by precise location of vertical reinforcing                          steel.
Full tensile strength of rebar may be realized, thus                          meeting specified building codes and designs.
Eliminates the need to grout block wall cores in sections                          and allows for a monolithic pour of grout.
Block integrity preserved, no waste of grout, controls                          the flow of grout, and provides containment within the                          vertical core.
Selective vertical and horizontal positioning of rebar                          possible, ensuring natural and mechanical bonds with grout.
Allows vertical Rebar to "cross" horizontal                          bond beam rebar at the top of masonry walls.
No problems with mechanical systems interfering with                          reinforcing steel.
Customize Rebar reinforcement on every job, without                          the extra cost.
