FS-600 Rebar Cutter  Bender  
Cut and bend rebar with one  machine!  Here is a portable rebar cutter and rebar bender combination  machine that contractors can take to the jobsite.  Both cut and bend up to  and including 3/4" (#6) grade 60 rebar.  Weighing just 180 pounds,  the unit can be picked up and carried by two people.  Just plug it into a  standard 110-volt outlet or 5000 watt generator.

Set the FS-600 Rebar Cutter Bender on the  ground next to your pile of rebar or up on a bench or table.  Push button  control on the machine is easy and safe to use.  If you wish, an optional  foot pedal can be plugged in so both hands are free to guide the rebar.  A  simple control knob adjusts the bending angle.  Once set, bends will be  uniform and accurate.  Add the optional length guide attachment for an  easy to use adjustable reference fence up to 4 feet.
FR-800-C Rebar Bender  Cutter
The convenience of a rotary table bender  combined with an open jaw shear places the FR-800-C Rebar Bender Cutter apart  from the competition.  Up to 190° bends can be made while one end of the  rebar remains stationary.  This compact electric/hydraulic machine plugs  into a standard 110-volt outlet and will both cut and bend up to and including  1" (#8) grade 60 rebar.  2" high bending dies and cutting blades  let you stack 3 - 1/2" (#4) bars and bend or cut them at once!

Create uniform bends by setting an  infinitely variable angle control that accurately controls the rotation of the  table.  Two separate angles can be preset.  A foot pedal control and  complete bending die set comes standard with the FR-800-C Rebar Cutter  Bender.  Add the optional length guide attachment for an easy to use  adjustable reference fence up to 4 feet.
