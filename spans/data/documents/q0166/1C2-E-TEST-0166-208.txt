Specializing in the preparation of architectural specifications.
Rebar splicing specifications require that any rebar lengths more than the standard 18 m will need to be spliced. This splicing can be done with either lap splices or butt splices. Butt splices will be by welding or by mechanical coupling. Design engineers have the main responsibility to specify where splicing occurs. These splices must conform to service splice or ultimate splice specifications. .
