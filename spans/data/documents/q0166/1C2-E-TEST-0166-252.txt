Rebar Tier
Is a Rebar Tier worth the money?
When you look at the cost of a rebar tier , that truly is a fair question.  But any piece of equipment that claims it can save you money is worth a look.  Consider just a few things including the video  that may convince you that you need a rebar tier.
Time equals money
Okay, you know that.  Well then, how much time can a rebar tier save you?  A Max rebar tier can tie wire 3-5 times faster than by hand.   You know it costs you a dollar a minute to run a man with insurance and benefits.  So if you have eight hours of tying to do this week, it will cost you around $500 in labor.  Now if a rebar tier can do it 3 times faster, you just saved $160 this week.  Do that every week this year and you will save over $8,000, not so bad.
Morale
Some of your guys might like tying wire.  I have done it, I don't like it.  If I know there is a faster way, I obviously want to do it the easy way.  Look at the pictures below.  Note all the rebar to be tied.   Now consider the guy with the smile.  He may be an actor or at least a foreman, but he is smiling.  He is tying rebar the easy way.
Injury and fatigue
This relates both to time and morale.  Less time tying wire by hand means less fatigue, and less repetitive injuries like carpal tunnel.  Not only is it expensive for the health care, buy can you afford to be without a good man on a huge project?  I linked to this  NIOSH report for you consideration of the benefits of a rebar tier.
