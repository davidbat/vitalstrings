Announcements!
At our custom metal fabrication plant in Paola, Kansas we make Vent Pipe. After we have produced the corrugated metal culvert, on our pipe mill, We perforate the pipe in engineered patterns with various size holes depending on the customer's requirements. The perforated pipe is then sold to the large farming operations such as potatoes, beets, etc. This farmer blows forced air through the pipe to Ventilate their crops in order to keep them fresh after the harvest. Please inquire with Dave Robison at 800-817-1599
