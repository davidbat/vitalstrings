Profile
Whatever low expectations you have of a bar located on the second floor of a DIY-minded art gallery and shops facility, leave them at this elegant drinkery’s iron gates. A barrel-vaulted terra-cotta ceiling, Art Deco lamps over tables of elegantly warped wood, stained-glass windows, and even a trellis pitched over the snug in back make this former factory feel just a little bit like one of the abbeys that produce the Belgian brews on the beer list. Just how outstanding is that list? Let’s just say there are more triples and doubles here than in your average Little League game, starting with Kasteel Triple, one of the fifteen tap offerings. The less pious can opt for unholy-sounding American drafts like Rogue’s Brutal Bitter and Arrogant Bastard Ale, which rotate seasonally. Also on offer are organic, mostly European wines, several of them Spanish. It’s just enough to make you forget you’re a starving artist. — Daniel Maurer
