Which Rebar Cutter Bender Will Do?
There are many different kinds of rebar cutter bender machines out there, and finding the right one for the task at hand might be a touch difficult. As with just about every other task, there are lots of different products, one for each level of objective. Finding the one best suited is the difficult part. However, to ensure structural stability, rebar must be correctly installed.
Rebar Cutter Bender
First of all, there are machines that simply cut or bend rebar, such as bolt cutters or hand benders, which primarily cut smaller sized bars (#10, #13, and #16), or bend up to 180 degrees. These can be easily transported and used by hand. Most are run by an electrically driven hydraulic system, and their diameter capacities range from 10mm to 30mm. Not necessarily the multi-tasking rebar cutter bender goliaths used for big jobs, but certainly adequate for smaller tasks.
For increased productivity and wider performance margins, rebar cutter benders can do the same work, but on a grander scale. These machines can generate 10 tons of cutting pressure, and bend 180 degrees much faster. However, rebar cutter benders are less mobile, some being permanently mounted to a shop’s floor. They have much more power in areas, and are faster in others, but when it comes to maximum radius bending, there is not much difference. Most rebar cutter benders can handle up to 25mm.
Another advantage of a rebar cutter bender is its ability to operate in areas where there is no power supply. Running on diesel, they can operate for long periods of time, and their durability and size enables them to do so.
Whether bending or cutting, on a larger scale, rebar bender cutters will get the job done.
