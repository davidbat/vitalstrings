Paragon's Rebar Support Chairs
have been tested and approved by the Iowa Department of Transportation, office of materials division, and either meet or exceed the load carrying capacity of steel supports and can therefore be used at the same spacing as wire supports.
  
  
Installation:
Only laborers who are experienced with steel reinforcement placement, should install rebar support chairs. Maximum spacing of chairs should not exceed 48 inches. Comply with applicable codes and design criteria for minimum spacing of reinforcement from edges of forms.
Testing Procedure:
This testing procedure involves determining a point load limit for all supports. The point load is determined by placing a piece of #4 rebar on the support. the support is then placed on a 3/4" thick piece of fir plywood. A load is applied to the 1/2" deflection per minute until the support fails. Point loads are determined at the weakest point on continuous supports.
