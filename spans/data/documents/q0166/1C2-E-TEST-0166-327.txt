The Most Efficient Way To Vibrate grout In A Blockwall Cell or     Wall
 
...Turn Your Rebar Into A Vibrator  
 
(For rebar up to 7/8 inch     diameter in most applications)
 
Eliminate the time and mess of lowering     a concrete vibrator into a cell containing a rebar and filled with     grout. The splashes caused by the withdrawal of the vibrator are     slippery, dangerous and time consuming to cleanup.
The Rebar ShakerTM simply slipped over the top of the rebar,     vibrates and consolidates grout in 5 to 7 seconds.
Tremendous savings in man-hours, from filling and refilling cells,     clean-up and lost time due to injury from slips and falls are     realized through the use of the Rebar ShakerTM.
No human errors such as skipping cells and poor vibrating     techniques (i.e. not letting vibrator touch the bottom or     withdrawing to fast), which result in poor consolidation and a weak     bond between the rebar and the grout.

1. One person centers rebar with the Rebar ShakerTM, while another      person fills the cell with grout as the rebar shaker is turned      on. When the cell is filled with grout, it's DONE! 
 
No Mess! No Clean up! Two man      operation not three!
