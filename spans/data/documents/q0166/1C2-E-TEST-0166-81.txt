Rebar Linguine
I often see pasta as an easy out when it comes to meal time – cook some pasta, throw on some sauce from a jar, and you’re good to go. However, while it’s good for a lazy meal at home, the tomato-sauce-on-spaghetti trick doesn’t exactly impress dinner guests.
The Rebar Linguine recipe took a bit longer than canned sauce, but it’s a dish that you won’t hesitate to serve to company. The roasted vegetables, especially the fennel, really gave an earthy element to the dish, and the texture could easily be varied based on how finely the vegetables are chopped. Balsamic vinegar added a tangy finish to the dish.
Although our usual fare is dry pasta, we went with fresh spinach linguine for this recipe. This further enhanced the earthy taste and was definitely a good choice. Other types of flavoured pasta would put a different spin on things – next time we’ll be going with sun-dried tomato – but the assorted vegetables and generous amount of basil ensures that the Rebar Linguine would be excellent even with a relatively plain dried whole-wheat pasta.
