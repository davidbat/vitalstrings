GeoModel, Inc. can conduct a real-time concrete inspection survey using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to locate rebar, pipes, tension bars, dowels, and plastic and fiber optic conduits.  Our concrete inspection survey can also detect voids within concrete slabs and under concrete slabs. Our radar survey professionals can conduct a concrete inspection survey of concrete block walls, concrete floors, concrete slabs, airport runways, tunnels, abutments, dams, and garages. Asphalt roads and surfaces can also be scanned.
Concrete as thick as 12 to 18 inches can be scanned.  The condition of concrete slabs can be inspected including relative thickness, deterioration, and structure problems. Our concrete inspector pulls the radar antenna along the concrete surface and simultaneously records the radar data on a computer.  The image of the concrete is immediately seen on the computer screen and can be interpreted in real time.
