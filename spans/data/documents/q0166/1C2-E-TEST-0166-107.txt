CONTROL CONSOLES
SHEARS
We can produce any kind of rebar conveyor equipment you need, from standard sizes to custom lengths, and from complete lines down to individual components. Custom-made rebar equipment designed and built to customer needs are what we specialize in.
Time tested and customer approved our SHEARLINES are 100% hand made with the greatest attention to detail and precision.
Home Grown, American-Made Excellence…
Rebar processing equipment may come and go, but a Michigan Rebar Equipment (MRE) Shearline is made to last. Our machines are extremely durable and tested “in house” prior to delivery and installation, to ensure that our customers remain “up & running” and avoid losing valuable down time.
Delivery with a Smile…
We understand that when you place an order for a shearline that you expect to have it delivered in a timely manner. Michigan Rebar strives to maintain a short turn around in the production of our equipment, so you get your equipment when you need it.
The Customer Comes First…
We at Michigan Rebar Equipment, Inc. believe that the customer always comes first. From consultation to installation we will take the time to meet with you and help you to consider all of your rebar equipment needs. Not sure of what you want? Or do you need something to fit your budget and/or space? We can provide options that make sense for you.
Making the safe choice…
