Reinforced Concrete Detailing and Scheduling
Bentley Rebar is Bentley's premier concrete reinforcing design application for MicroStation. This 2D/3D software can save you hundreds of hours in the detailing office.
Bentley Rebar makes full use of the MicroStation platform to deliver a powerful concrete detailing and scheduling system. It lets you retrieve standard reinforcement details dynamically, automatically produce 3D reinforcement models from plan, section and elevation views, and respond quickly and efficiently to last-minute design changes with intelligent parametric detailing.
Bentley PowerRebar offers the same powerful detailing and scheduling tools in a standalone product.
