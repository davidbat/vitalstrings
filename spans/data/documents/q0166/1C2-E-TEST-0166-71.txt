Shop Rebar
Rebar sticks, a blend word for reinforcing bar sticks,  is a common steel bar, an important component of reinforced concrete  and reinforced masonry structures. It is created from mild steel, and  is given ridges for better stickiness to concrete.
Masonry structures and the mortar holding them together closely relate  to the properties of concrete, and as well have limited ability to  carry a stress load. Some masonry blocks and bricks are made with  intentionally placed spaces to allow for placing rebar sticks, which is then grouted into place. This  is what is known as reinforced masonry.
Concrete is very strong in compression, but has almost no strength in  tension. To compensate for this inequity in concrete's behavior, rebar sticks are placed into it to support the heavy loads.
Stainless steel reinforcing bars and like products are able to broaden  the shelf life of concrete structures in corrosive areas.
