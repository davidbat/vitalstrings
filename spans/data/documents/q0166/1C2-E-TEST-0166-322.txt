The RMS                Shearline is the most robust and heavy duty shearline on                the market today.
The RMS Mini-Shearline is a heavy duty, yet economical                shearline designed for smaller rebar fabricators and the precasting                industry.
Easily                adaptable to most shearlines, the RMS Bar-Prep is specifically designed to reduce much of the exhausting labor                of shaking out rebar from the stock table while reducing the risk                of injuries.
Used                in conjunction with the RMS Shake-n-Count is a                system that incorporates a digital scale to accurately count bars                that are loaded into the preload cradle. This will effectively reduce                or eliminate expensive rebar shortages and overages.
 
RMS                    Hydraulic Guillotine Rebar Shears are the highest capacity                    shears on the market. Three models are available: 611 shear,                    311 shear, and the Mini-Shear. The 611 and 311 shears can be                    used in conjunction with our shearlines, while the Mini-Shear                    can be used with the Mini-Shearline.
RMS                    Micro Controlled Rebar Benders are the descendant of                    the Arnold bender, and will offer the same rugged durability.                    Three models are available: #18 Bender, #14 Bender, and #11                    Bender.
The RMS Stirrupmaster is a machine specifically                designed for bending ties and stirrups, accurately and efficiently.
 
The RMS Spiral Machine bends Spirals and Hoops efficiently                and accurately. The Spiral machine is equipped with an integrated                shear, all driven rolls and a micro control that eliminates traditional                trial-and-error set-ups.
 
The RMS Radius Machine bends hoops and circles up to                #11 rebar. It also offers variable speed operation and a micro control                capable of storing bend diameters for recall at any time.
