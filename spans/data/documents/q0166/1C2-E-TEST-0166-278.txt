When it comes to structural integrity, concrete alone won’t  cut it without the help of embedded rebar sticks.
Rebar sticks are steel bars that form the backbone of  reinforced concrete structures by accounting for the tensile strength missing  from concrete. Concrete alone, though very strong in compression, would be  structurally flawed without rebar sticks formed into it.
Rebar is commonly used to form a tied beam cage that will be  embedded inside of concrete. The ends of rebar sticks are tied over each other  to increase structural integrity of the cage, and also to reduce risk.
Safety is an obvious concern for any construction site, both  for workers and everyday pedestrians. When rebar sticks out of the side or top  of an unfinished structure it presents a danger of impalement or other injury.  To prevent this, the bars are often either bent over on themselves to form a  rounded edge, or fitted with a reinforced plastic plate cap.
Because these reinforced bars are often made of unfinished  steel they are susceptible to rust which can cause internal pressure and cause  damage and structural failure. While it may be initially more expensive to use  fiber reinforced epoxy polymer coated rebar sticks or stainless steel bars, it  will pay off in the long run with the increased damage-free lifespan of the  structure.
Rebar sticks also make an appearance in reinforced masonry  structures. When bricks are fabricated with a specialized void, rebar can be  grouted into place to increase the bricks’ ability to support a tensile load.
