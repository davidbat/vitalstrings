"A friendly atmosphere with a unique design. Twisted metal and a lounge like feel make this place a favorite of the Alamo Heights crowd. The Rebar bar is almost always packed and has a great outdoor patio where one can sit back with a cold beer and enjoy the crowd. Whether you are inside or out you will not be disappointed."
