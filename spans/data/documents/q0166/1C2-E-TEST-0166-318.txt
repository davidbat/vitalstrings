Repair work
Epoxy coated rebar is used instead of conventional reinforcing bars to strengthen the concrete and protect against corrosion. The epoxy coating is applied in a factory to the steel prior to shipping.  Epoxy-Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars (rebar) may be used in any concrete subjected to corrosive conditions. These may include exposure to deicing salts or marine waters.
