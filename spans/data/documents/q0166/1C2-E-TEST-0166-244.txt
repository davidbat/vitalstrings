Click here for an excellent article by pool engineer Ron Lacher about gunite workmanship   issues.
Customers frequently ask  if resurfacing the pool will solve the problem. No, it will not.
If the pool is replastered without removing the corroding rebar, the  stain will work its way through the new plaster causing a new stain on your new plaster. The corrosion must be removed!
