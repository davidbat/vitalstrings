The DC-25X portable heavy-duty rebar cutter         will safely, efficiently, and cleanly cut rebar up to #8 (1”) diameter         grade 60.  The DC-25X cutter is ideal for a small fabrication shop,         especially if used with our CWS-2025 WorkStation.  Because our rebar         cutters feature a locking trigger switch, the cutter can be operated         with a foot pedal switch and our GFI protected electrical outlet.  There         are no sparks or flame so it also works great on epoxy-coated rebar.  It’s         the fastest, safest, and most economical way to cut rebar on the job.  A         safety relief valve for retracting the piston and a cutting guard are         standard features.  Ships complete in a steel carrying case with         hydraulic oil and a tool kit.
