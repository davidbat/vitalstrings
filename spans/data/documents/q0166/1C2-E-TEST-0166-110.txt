i found out about this cookbook when i went to the actual rebar restaurant in victoria, bc (canada). i looked through the cookbook there, and with so many unique dishes, i had to buy it!
this cookbook has NEVER disappointed me. i read the two really negative reviews on here and have to wonder what the people were doing wrong, or whether they just don't like all the flavours that are combined in the recipes. these recipes are usually very time consuming (but worth it and SO tasty), and call for a lot of ingredients (sometimes ones that are a bit more rare like szechuan peppercorns or thai basil), but for the most part i haven't had problems finding the ingredients. sometimes i've substituted things like spaghetti instead of soba noodles, if i didn't feel like going out to find soba noodles. some of the recipes may seem complicated, but if you take your time with them and read through, you should have no problems. i'm not an expert chef, but i'm comfortable in a kitchen.
this is the cookbook that i tell everybody about - including people that don't care about cookbooks. it is truly truly amazing and is not only the best vegetarian cookbook out there, but is by far the best cookbook out there. the recipes are so unique, and always bring many different flavours together (such as the roasted potato pizza with lemon-rosemary potatoes, artichoke hearts and feta cheese).
i cannot say enough good things about this cookbook. i plan to try every single recipe in it. i wish they would put out a second one. the cookbook also covers a wide range of things, and is broken up into: salads, basics (vegetable stock, tortilla shells, etc), starters, brunch, lunch, soup, sides, entrees, sweets, and drinks. my favourite recipes are, well, every recipe i've ever tried. ;) such as:
-szechuan noodle salad with soba, avocado and cashews
-rosemary garlic foccacia bread
-peanut sauce with ginger, lime and cilantro
-shiitake tofu potstickers with scallions, ginger, and cilantro
-white bean hummous with roasted garlic, sage and pine nuts
-vegan french toast with coconut milk and banana
-eggs kurosawa with tofu, brown riec and soy-chile sauce
-migas for two (tortilla-egg scramble with cilantro and cheddar)
-brie bagel melt with honey and almonds
-yam and pepita quesadilla with honey-chipotle sauce and jack cheese
-mushroom pecan burger with grilled onions
-creamy broccoli soup
-audrey's deluxe mac & cheese with crispy pine nut-herb crust
-pad thai with tofu, bean sprouts and roasted peanuts
-spring fettucine with asparagus and lemon-vodka cream
-roasted vegetable strudel with bocconcini cheese, olives and fresh thyme
-chocolate chip cookies with apricots and walnuts
-raspberry oat bars with walnuts and cinnamon
-lime sugar cookies with pumpkin seeds
