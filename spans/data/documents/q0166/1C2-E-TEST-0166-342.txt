The Steel Dog® RH-6 Rebar Hook is a multipurpose coupler for making a fast field connection between 1/2" coil rod and rebar up to #6 in size. A simple "push and twist" action is all that is needed to make the connection; the coil rod itself keeps the Rebar Hook in place on the rebar.
One of the most common uses, shown below, is using the RH with a Steel Dog® Transition Tie ™ to make a low-cost, adjustable-length tie for forming Stay-Form® blindside walls with a variety of different handset form panels.
