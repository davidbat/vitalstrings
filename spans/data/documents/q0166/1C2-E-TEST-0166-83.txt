rebar
step synthesizer v1.4
rebar is a drawn waveform monosynth using mark andrews' step oscillator. simply draw your waveform using the sliders, create your envelope, and adjust the effects. both warp and delay effects have handy x/y based panels for live tweaking and automation crazyness. version 1.2 adds a truly drawable waveform panel (just drag your mouse across it), improved cpu performance, new patches, and better stability.
