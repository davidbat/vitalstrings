CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT -                  FRP REBAR (Part 1)
 
Introduction
Reinforced                  concrete is a common building material for the construction of                  facilities and structures.  While concrete has a high                  compressive strength, it has a very limited tensile strength.  To overcome these tensile limitations, reinforcing bars are used                  in the tension side of concrete structures.  Steel rebars have                  been and are an effective and cost-efficient concrete                  reinforcement, but are susceptible to oxidation when exposed to                  chlorides.  Examples of such exposure include marine areas,                  regions where road salts are used for deicing, and locations                  where salt contaminated aggregates are used in the concrete                  mixture.
When                  properly protected from ion attack, steel reinforcement can last                  for decades without exhibiting any visible signs of                  deterioration.  However, it is not always possible to provide                  this kind of corrosion protection.  Insufficient concrete cover,                  poor design or workmanship, poor concrete mix, and presence of                  large amounts of aggressive agents all can lead to corrosion of the steel rebar and cracking of the concrete.  
Fiber                  reinforced polymer (FRP) composite rebar have the potential to                  address this corrosion deficiency.  FRP rebar can be used as                  non-prestressed reinforcement in concrete for members subjected                  to flexure, shear, and compression loadings.  FRP Composite                  rebar are totally resistant to chloride ion attack, offer a                  tensile strength of 1½ - 2 times that of steel, weigh only 25%                  of the weight of equivalent size steel rebar, and are highly                  effective electromagnetic and thermal insulators.
Features and Benefits
Non-Corrosive - will not corrode exposed to a wide variety of corrosive                    elements including chloride ions.
High                    Strength-to-Weight Ratio - provides good reinforcement in weight sensitive                    applications.
Non-Conductive - provide excellent electrical and thermal insulation.
Excellent Fatigue Resistance - performs very well in cyclic loading situations.
Good                    Impact Resistance - resists sudden and severe point loading.
Magnetic                    Transparency - not affected by electromagnetic fields; excellent for use in                    MRI and other types of electronic testing facilities.
Lightweight - easily transported in the field without need for expensive                    heavy lifting equipment.
