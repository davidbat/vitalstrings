You can find Barker Steel rebar embedded inside the nation’s bridges, tunnels and parking garages. It adds strength and structure to high-rise buildings, warehouses, commercial facilities, churches and shopping centers. And it’s the backbone of critical structures like waste-water treatment facilities and power plants.
Since 1922, Barker Steel has been serving the needs of the region’s contractors—large and small. Over those years we’ve developed a proven track record for handling projects ranging from one ton to several thousand tons of fabricated rebar, covering every imaginable project that calls for reinforcing steel. Today, we have the largest capacity of any rebar fabricator in the region.
A holistic approach.
We take a holistic approach to every project—estimating, detailing, and fabricating rebar to meet your most demanding specifications. Our dedicated project coordinators manage the entire process to ensure you get the products you need on time and within budget.
If you’re a contractor in northern New Jersey/New York, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, or New England, we invite you to take advantage of our deep experience in the construction industry and finest manufacturing equipment available.
