Guarantee & Terms of Sale
All radios are              guaranteed for 30 days. If a radio fails within that time, we will              work together to make a fix. A buyer SHALL NOT attempt to make any              repairs to the radio without my approval.
My Restoration Philosophy
Vacuum tubes are              tested and any weak/defective tubes are replaced.  Electrolytic              and wax capacitors are replaced.  NO exceptions!!  I              consider this to be mandatory.  Resistors are tested and              replaced if needed.  If the speaker cone is torn and cannot be              repaired with a simple fix, it is replaced.  The tuning              capacitor is cleaned and lubricated.  All controls/switches are              cleaned with DETOXIT D5 electronic cleaner.  The radio is              aligned to play at peak performance using a signal generator.  The cases/knobs are hand polished to a bright shine.  Cracked/worn/frayed wires are replaced.  The power cord is              replaced.  My goal is to provide you with a radio that is safe              to use on a daily basis.  I DO NOT take any shortcuts.  I              take personal pride in my workmanship!  All radios that I sell              will be restored as per my restoration philosophy.
About me...
I began repairing              radios in 1958.  I was an Aviation Electronics Technician              (Nuclear Weapons) in the U.S. Navy and a Senior Electronic              Technician for the Bendix Aviation Company repairing/calibrating              electronic equipment used by NASA/Space Program.  After              retirement, I began restoring vintage radios as a hobby and have              sold many to local antique shops and to friends.
