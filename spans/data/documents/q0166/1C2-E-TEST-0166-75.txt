Rebar Connect is proud to introduce the Kodi Klip™ Rebar Connection System, making rebar steel fixing faster, better and safer than ever before.  Kodi Klip™ offers a unique connection system for reinforcing steel, providing steel fixers with a superior way to make stable connections. Designed to secure intersections in less than a second, the system leaves the time-consuming, dangerous and less than rigid wire tying method in the stone age. The innovative Kodi Klip™ system saves time and effort by enabling the work to be done directly on the surface it's placed on, eliminating the need for lifting and propping up the rebar while fastening it. The robust klips produce far more rigid connections than traditional methods do, allowing for pre-assembled units to be built and handled safely. Moulded from durable, recycled polycarbonate resin, the klips are applied by an automatic rebar connecting tool. The tool is ergonomically friendly, lightweight and easy to handle. Built with simplicity and low maintenance in mind. Its use can be mastered in minutes.  The Kodi Klip™ system is ideal for site-pour, precast, pre-stressed and tilt-up concrete applications. The klips can be used with radiant heating tubes, FRP or epoxy coated rebar, in flat, curved or cage assemblies, high density mats in bridges, road work or slabs.
