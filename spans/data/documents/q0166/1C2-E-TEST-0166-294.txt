The Pag-asa Rebar
What is a rebar?
In the design of reinforced concrete structures, steel bars embedded in the concrete reinforce the composite structure to better withstand bending, shear, and/or tensile loads.   Such bars for such purpose are usually called ‘rebars.’
To ensure a good bond, the ‘rebars’ are provided with surface protrusions known as ‘deformations’ in the form of radial lugs and also axial fins to prevent slippage between steel and concrete - provided that concreting work was properly done.
How do we distinguish a Pag-asa Steel rebar?
Pag-asa Steel rebar products are identifiable as shown in the box.  Each bar contains the company logo which is hot-rolled and embossed onto each bar at specified intervals.  The rebar size mark, which is the nominal diameter of the rebar, is also hot-rolled adjacent to the company logo.
