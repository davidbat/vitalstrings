Welcome   to the Galvanized Rebar Resource Center! This web site has   been created by the International Zinc Association (IZA) to provide   construction engineers and architects with relevant information on the   properties and performance of hot dip galvanized reinforcing steel.
IZA's global mandate to support and develop zinc end                              uses is accomplished through regional partners located                              around the world . We encourage you to contact your                              regional representatives with any questions that you                              have on hot dip galvanized rebar or how to locate                              a local galvanizing company.
