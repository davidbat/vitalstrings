Serving Central California
The management at Johasee Rebar,             Inc. believes there is a need in the             community for a company that will             emphasize customer service as its             highest priority. We will strive to             achieve total customer satisfaction             with dependable on time deliveries,             accurate billing, a knowledgeable,             well-trained and trustworthy staff.
We began doing business in 1979             as Cal State Steel and changed our             name to Johasee Rebar Inc. in 1999.             We are a reinforcing steel (rebar)             subcontractor and carry a license             class C-50. The majority of our work             is in Kern and the surrounding             counties of Tulare, Fresno, Kings             and San Luis Obispo. We have,             however, worked throughout the state             of California and will go wherever             our customers request. We supply and             fabricate Rebar for our field             placing crews, as well as rebar, per             customer specification, on FOB             orders. We carry a full line of             rebar supports and wire mesh.
We are an open shop, non-union             organization. We believe if we can             provide our employees with fair             wages, comparable fringe benefits,             incentives, and steady work, we can             minimize employee turnover and are             able to bring experienced and             competent crews to the jobsites.
In 2001 we implemented a drug-free             work zone. The program is             administered by Contraband Control             Specialist and provides random and             suspicion testing. This creates a             positive, productive, and safe             environment for our employees and             customers.
Safety First! In 2005 we kicked             our safety program up a notch by             providing comprehensive training and             incident investigation in an effort             to maintain the safest work place             possible and keep our workers             compensation insurance to a minimum.
Johasee Rebar, Inc. believes in             community involvement and supports             organizations that focus on the             future goals and education of our             youth.
The following are just a few              that we currently support:

- Kern County Builder’s               Exchange
