Description:
Basalt fiber reinforced rebar made of basalt fiber and epoxy resin offers significant advantages over steel rebar in a variety of applications.
• Better mechanical and chemical performance against steel rebar
• 89% lighter in weight: according to normal specification calculation, one ton of basalt rebar provides the performance of 9.6 tons of steel rebar
Properties and advantages
• Resistant to corrosion and deterioration of natural elements
• Resistant to alkali and acid
• Same coefficient of thermal expansion as concrete
• No permanent deformation when bent
• Chemically inert, basalt rebars are compatible with concretes having different Ph values
When used to reinforce concrete, basalt rebars are an advanced alternative to steel rebar.
