UPDATE 18:55 UTC : A lot of people will be waken up by this very strong aftershock. Although NO damage is expected it is always a scary event while occurring in the middle of the night. People never know where the the epicenter is located (unless they consult media). In this particular case people do know that the quake will be probably an aftershock from the M 7.3 mainshock from this morning.

UPDATE 15:45 UTC : 40 out of the 42 lifts in the Tokyo government buildings (240 meters high !)  stopped as a result of the swaying and went automatically to the next available floor. Everybody could evacuate the lifts safely. Tall building sway a lot and lifts are equipped with automatic safety gear. And … it worked well.
UPDATE 15:45 UTC : Some Oyster rafts (Aquaculture) in one of the Kesennuma Bay dropped to the sea floor.
UPDATE 15:30 UTC : Teachers have reported that children in all type of the schools dropped immediately on the floor and did hide under their desk until the shaking was over. Japan is an example in integrating earthquake drills in education.
UPDATE 15:10 UTC : The quake lasted rather long (see live seismograph)
UPDATE 14:16 UTC : Testimony of the 31st floor in Akasaka - the building moved for about 10 minutes… (creaking wall panels and funky drunk-like feeling
UPDATE 8:42 UTC : Japanese seismologists are predicting moderate aftershocks for at least 1 week. Since the mainshock,Â  14 aftershocks ranging in between 4.7 and 5.7 have hit the same area.
UPDATE 8:35 UTC : Some very light damage was recorded in the elementary school of GozyoumeÂ  and in the city of Yazawa. Yazama is located inland in a mountainous area.
UPDATE 8:31 UTC : In Ofunato, Hudai and Hiroshi Matino, 2,339 faimlies were evacuated to higher grounds.Â  In Rikuzentakata 117 people did evacuate to higher grounds voluntarily.
UPDATE 8:08 UTC : Underground water pipes broke in Akita as  a result of the earthquake. There is however NO damage related to this incident.
UPDATE 7:30 UTC : A video from Japanese ANN station reporting on the Tsunami – You cant see a lot, but keep in mind that although tsunami waves can be predicted, the tension remains high until the tsunami alarm is canceled. Tsunami alarm is a main media item in Japan and elsewhere in the world.
Japan JMA tsunami equipment is among the best in the world. The JMA predicted waves were very accurate. You will not be able to see the 30 to 50 cm wave on the video, but due to the continuous force of the wave, even small tsunamis can make some damage.

UPDATE 7:13 UTC : At 14:50 local time (the earthquake occurred at 11:45 local time) ALL JMA tsunami warnings and advisories were canceled in Japan.
UPDATE 7:03 UTC : Based on all recordings so far max. tsunami waves were 0.6 m in Ofunato and 0.5 m in Kuji-ko and Ayukawa.  This are all JMA observation station measurements. At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites.
UPDATE 6:58 UTC : JMA only published limited tsunami waves of up to 0.5 meter (in accordance with reality).
UPDATE 6:57 UTC : JMA Tsunami information as published 4 minutes after the earthquake. Click here to view the detailed map
UPDATE 6:41 UTC : The Japanese JMA seismic scale (JMA stands for Japan Meteorological Agency) is has a scale with max. 7 (compared to XII for the MMI scale).Â  4 or -5 JMA is a considerable shaking.
UPDATE 6:38 UTC : Japanese Police has reported that NO damage or injuries have been recorded by their different stations.
UPDATE 6:37 UTC : Japanese “bullet trains” on the route from Shiraishi-Zao to Shin-Aomori were stopped as a precautionary measure, but could resume their normal service shortly after inspection.
UPDATE 6:33 UTC : Most strong aftershocks are located in the area than the mainshock at a safe distance out of the coast.
UPDATE 6:26 UTC :According to According to JapanToday,Â  the Tohoku Electric Power Co. reprted that  there were no quake-induced   abnormalities detected at its Onagwawa nuclear power plant in Miyagi Prefecture. Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said no damages were reported at its   Aomori nuclear fuel facilities.
UPDATE 6:23 UTC : A 60cm-high tsunami wave was reported at Ofunato port in Iwate Prefecture, local authorities said, which is still in line with JMA expectations.
UPDATE 6:22 UTC : JMA did calculate that the maximum height of the tsunami waves would reach 0.5 meter.
UPDATE 6:20 UTC : Although a widespread Pacific Tsunami was not expected by NOAA, the Japenese seismological services did publish a TSUNAMI ALERT for the Japanese Pacific Coast.
UPDATE 6:11 UTC : Contrary to the theoretically calculated Felt V MMI values of USG, the local people have experienced this earthquake a lot more severe. A strong JMA 4 shaking (comparable to MMI VI) has been experienced by people in the Myiagi, Iwati and Aomori prefectures.
UPDATE 6:11 UTC : The Japanese people are among the BEST earthquake prepared people in the world.
UPDATE 6:10 UTC : A -5 JMA felt value has been recorded for the following stations : Kurihara-shi Kannari, Tome-shi Yoneyamacho, Tome-shi Hasamacho, Miyagi Misato-machi Kimatsuka. This value can be compared to MMI as a VI to VII value.
UPDATE 6:07 UTC : A lot of moderate magnitude aftershocks (+5)  are continuing to strike the epicenter area.
UPDATE 5:54 UTC : A similar earthquake (magnitude and depth)  below the coastal towns would have been devastating.
UPDATE 5:52 UTC : All theoretical damage and casualty systems have been conclusive  with the same result : NO casualties and NO injured
UPDATE 5:48 UTC : Following the GDACS index table, the earthquake was felt by 3,418,561 people within a 200 km radius from the epicenter. There were however NO people living within a 100 km radius.
UPDATE 5:41 UTC : Based on the Felt reports from the Japanese seismological Service, the massive earthquake was felt over 2/3 of Honshu and also on Hokkaido, the island to the north of Honshu
UPDATE 5:37 UTC : A V MMI shaking will not provoke important damage on the coast.
UPDATE 5:35 UTC : The max. calculated MMI value for the coastal areas is a moderate V = moderate shaking. Following USGS, this will have been felt by approx. 5,900,000 people !
UPDATE 5:27 UTC : 8 powerful aftershocks have been recorded since the mainshock 2:40 ago. The strongest aftershock was a M 5.7
A massive earthquake struck around noon (local time)  at a safe distance out of the Honshu coast.
GDACS soon issued a GREEN tsunami alert, making clear that a huge tsunami was not expected.
Due to the shallow depth of the hypocenter the main shaking impact will be limited on the coastal towns.
The epicenter of the earthquake was on top of the subduction slope.
The subduction faulting zone along the Honshu coast generates regular very strong earthquakes. Most of the earthquakes are however located in the sea at a safe distance out of the coast.
NOAA published a statement that a tsunami was NOT expected along the pacific coastal areas.
