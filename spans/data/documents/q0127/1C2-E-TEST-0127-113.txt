FLASH NEWS! Sendai Airport Hit By Tsunami Triggered By Japan Earthquake
Sendai Airport Hit By Tsunami Triggered By Japan Earthquake: According to reports from the Kyodo news agency, Sendai Airport, on Japan’s eastern coast, has already been completely flooded by a ten-metre tsunami. A massive 8.9 magnitude quake hit northeast Japan on Friday, causing  many injuries, fires and a four-metre (13-ft) tsunami along parts of the  country’s coastline, NHK television and witnesses reported. There were several strong aftershocks and a warning of a 10-metre  tsunami following the quake, which also caused buildings to shake  violently in the capital Tokyo. In various locations along Japan’s coast, TV footage showed severe flooding, with dozens of cars, boats and even buildings being carried along by waters. A large ship swept away by the tsunami rammed directly into a breakwater in Kesennuma city in Miyagi prefecture, according to footage on public broadcaster NHK.
Public broadcaster NHK showed flames and black smoke billowing from a  building in Odaiba, a Tokyo suburb, and bullet trains to the north of  the country were halted.
Black smoke was also pouring out of an  industrial area in Yokohama’s Isogo area. TV footage showed boats, cars  and trucks floating in water after a small tsunami hit the town of  Kamaichi in northern Japan. An overpass, location unknown, appeared to  have collapsed into the water. A magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people in 1933.   Last year fishing facilities were damaged after by a tsunami caused by  a  strong tremor in Chile.
Earthquake shaking could be felt as far as the capital of Tokyo, which  is located around 413 kilometers (256 miles) from the epicenter. “An  earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a destructive  tsunami that can strike coastlines near the epicentre within minutes and  more distant coastlines within hours,” the agency said.
