(Newser) –                                                                 Is what happened in Japan set to repeat itself in California? Author Simon Winchester thinks so. In an article for Newsweek that’s turning some heads , Winchester notes that though scientists aren’t sure why, major earthquakes have a tendency to happen in clusters, with a quake on one side of a plate followed by one on the other some weeks or months later. “It is as though the earth becomes like a great brass bell,” he writes. Strike it in one place, and the vibrations carry.
After last month’s quake in New Zealand and last year’s quake in Chile , the Pacific plate has now seen catastrophic quakes on three of its corners. The only corner left untouched: the northeast, meaning either the San Andreas fault or Cascadia fault—the latter of which would trigger a tsunami. Winchester repeated his warning on MSNBC, in an interview spotted by Mediaite , saying that California “really isn’t taking this seriously enough.”
