NASA shows location & intensity of Japanese earthquakes, aftershocks and foreshocks
NASA’s Earth Observatory has issued a map documenting the number of earthquakes, foreshocks and aftershocks that have rocked Japan this week .
According to NASA the tsunami that resulted from the 8.9 magnitude quake occurred 24.4 kilometres (15.2 miles) below the seabed, 130 kilometres (80 miles) east of Sendai.  The earthquake was preceded by a number of smaller foreshocks which began on March 9, including one that measured 7.2 on the Richter scale.
The British Geological Survey says that Japan will likely suffer further related earthquakes for a number of weeks.  Over 1,000 people are feared dead or missing at this time.

NASA said,
“This map shows the location of the March 11 earthquake, as well as the foreshocks (dotted lines) and aftershocks (solid lines). The size of each circle represents the magnitude of the associated quake or shock. The map also includes land elevation data from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and ocean bathymetry data from the British Oceanographic Data Center.”
