The tsunami in Japan has affected a wide swath of the northeast coast of the island nation. A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter near the city of Sendai set off a series of waves that did so far incalculable damage.

While the quake has affected much of Japan, with aftershocks themselves reaching 7.7 magnitude, damage from the tsunami has affected coastal areas, especially around Sendai where waves reached six miles inland, according to the Kyodo News agency .
Following the earthquake the U.S. National Weather Service issued tsunami warnings to more than 50 countries and territories, but as of 12:30 PM PST, much of the threat of tsunami had dissipated throughout the Pacific areas. California itself experienced the effects of a large storm surge due to the tsunami. Boat owners in Santa Cruz and Crescent City were dismayed Friday morning to find many boats had been damaged or even washed out to sea by the waves.
