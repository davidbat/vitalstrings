The 9.0- magnitude ( MW ) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (19.9 mi), [35] with its epicenter approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku , Japan, lasting approximately six minutes. [1] [2] The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 MW by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8  MW, then to 8.9  MW, [36] and then finally to 9.0  MW. [3] [37] Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, 130 km (81 mi) from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred 373 km (232 mi) from Tokyo . [2]
The main earthquake was preceded by a number of large foreshocks , with hundreds of aftershocks reported. The first major foreshock was a 7.2 MW event on 9 March, approximately 40 km (25 mi) from the epicenter of the 11 March earthquake, with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0 MW. [2] [38] Following the main earthquake on 11 March, a 7.0 MW aftershock was reported at 15:06 JST (6:06 UTC), succeeded by a 7.4  MW at 15:15 JST (6:16 UTC) and a 7.2  MW at 15:26 JST (6:26 UTC). [39] Over eight hundred aftershocks of magnitude 4.5  MW or greater have occurred since the initial quake. [40] Aftershocks follow Omori's Law , which states that the rate of aftershocks declines with the reciprocal of the time since the main quake. The aftershocks will thus taper off in time, but could continue for years. [41]
One minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives. [42] [43] The warning for the general public was delivered about 8 seconds after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places in Kanto and Tohoku regions. This was thought to be because of smaller estimated earthquake magnitude, smaller estimated fault plane, shorter estimated fault length, not having considered the shape of the fault, etc. [44] There were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. [45]

This earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu; which plate is a matter of debate amongst scientists. [19] [46] The Pacific plate, which moves at a rate of 8 to 9 cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) per year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate releasing large amounts of energy. This motion pulls the upper plate down until the stress builds up enough to cause a seismic event. The break caused the sea floor to rise by several meters. [46] A quake of this magnitude usually has a rupture length of at least 480 km (300 mi) and generally requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone in the area of the rupture is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of an earthquake to exceed 8.5; the magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists. [47] The hypocentral region of this earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki Prefecture . [48] The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500 km (310 mi) and a width of 200 km (120 mi). [49] [50] Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events. [51] The earthquake may have had a mechanism similar to that of another large earthquake in 869 with an estimated surface wave magnitude ( Ms ) of 8.6, which also created a large tsunami. [52] Other major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and in 1933 .
In a study of N. Uchida and T. Matsuzawa, it was pointed out that the source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5~0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260~880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami. [53]
The strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara , Miyagi Prefecture . [54] Three other prefectures— Fukushima , Ibaraki and Tochigi —recorded an upper 6 on the JMA scale. Seismic stations in Iwate , Gunma , Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a lower 6, recording an upper 5 in Tokyo.
In Russia , the main shock could be felt in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (MSK 4) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). The aftershock at 06:25 UTC could be felt in Yuzhno-Kurilsk (MSK 5) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). [55]
Damage to Tokyo Tower
This earthquake released a surface energy (Me) of 1.9 ± 0.5×1017 joules , [56] dissipated as shaking and tsunamic energy, which is nearly double that of the 9.1-magnitude 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people. If harnessed, the surface energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year. [41] The total energy released, also known as the seismic moment (M0), was more than 200,000 times the surface energy and was calculated by the USGS at 3.9×1022 joules, [57] slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake. This is equivalent to 9,320 gigatons of TNT , or approximately 600 million times the energy of the Little Boy bomb .
Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of 2.99 g (29.33 m/s²). [58] [fn 2] The largest individual recording in Japan was 2.7g, in the Miyagi Prefecture, 75 km from the epicentre; the highest reading in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 0.16g. [61]
[ edit ] Geophysical effects
The quake moved portions of northeastern Japan by as much as 2.4 m (7.9  ft ) closer to North America, [18] [19] making portions of Japan's landmass wider than before. [19] Portions of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. [19] A 400 km (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 m (2.0 ft), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. [19] One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 m (66 ft), [62] and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft). [63] On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 meters (79 ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi prefecture by 3 meters. [64] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology , published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 meters east-southeast and rose about 7 meters as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area. [65]
Soil liquefaction in Koto , Tokyo
The earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in). [18] [19] [20] This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day , the tilt of the Earth , and the Chandler wobble . [20] The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass. [66] The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia . Because of conservation of angular momentum , such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. [67] These are expected changes [20] for an earthquake of this magnitude. [18] [66]
Soil liquefaction was evident in areas of reclaimed land around Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu , [68] [69] Chiba City , Funabashi , Narashino (all in Chiba Prefecture ) and in the Koto , Edogawa , Minato , Chūō , and Ōta Wards of Tokyo. Approximately 30 homes or buildings were destroyed and 1,046 other buildings were damaged to varying degrees. [70] Nearby Haneda Airport , built mostly on reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced liquefaction, but damage was minimal. [71]
Shinmoedake , a volcano in Kyushu , erupted two days after the earthquake. The volcano had previously erupted in January 2011; it is not known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake. [72] In Antarctica , the seismic waves from the earthquake were reported to have caused the Whillans Ice Stream to slip by about 0.5 m (1.6 ft). [73]
Map of seismic intensity observations resulting from mainshock
The first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth’s rotation came from the United States Geographical Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost 13 feet (4.0 m). This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet. Scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory did some calculations and determined that the Earth’s rotation was changed by the earthquake to the point where the days are now one point eight (1.8) microseconds shorter.
[74]
Dr. Richard Gross, one of the head researchers working for NASA, explained that even a difference of 1.8 microseconds is important to his team because it affects the way that spacecraft being sent to Mars are navigated. Not taking the changes into account could increase the chances of failure of the mission. Gross noted that the way the Earth rotates is not very smooth, like an old car wobbling on its axle. The earthquake's effect was as if a person took a hammer and whacked the car's axle, causing it to shift and the car to drive differently. The powerful earthquake hit the Earth’s axle, causing it to spin in a slightly different way. [75]

Japan experienced over 1000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 Mw and three of which were over magnitude 7.0 Mw. A magnitude 7.7 Mw and a 7.9 Mw quake occurred on 11 March [76] and the third one struck offshore on 7 April with a disputed magnitude. Its epicenter was underwater, 66 km (41 mi) off the coast of Sendai. The Japan Meteorological Agency assigned a magnitude of 7.4 MJMA, while the U.S. Geological Survey lowered it to 7.1 Mw. [77] At least four people were killed, and electricity was cut off across much of northern Japan including the loss of external power to Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant and Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant . [78] [79] [80] Four days later on 11 April, another strong magnitude 6.6 Mw aftershock struck Fukushima, causing additional damage and killing a total of three people. [81] [82]
As of 16 Mar 2012 aftershocks continued, totaling 1887 events over magnitude 4.0; a regularly updated map showing all shocks of magnitude 4.5 and above near or off the east coast of Honshu in the last seven days [83] showed over 20 events.
[ edit ] Tsunami
Energy map of the tsunami from NOAA
The earthquake, caused by 5 to 8 meters upthrust on a 180-km wide seabed at 60 km offshore from the east coast of Tōhoku, [84] resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands. Thousands of lives were lost when entire towns were devastated. The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile . Warnings were issued and evacuations carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific. However, while the tsunami affected many of these places, the extent was minor. [85] [86] [87] Chile's Pacific coast, one of the furthest from Japan at about 17,000 km (11,000 mi) distant, was struck by waves 2 m (6.6 ft) high, [88] [89] [90] compared with an estimated wave height of 38.9 meters (128 ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan. [16]
[ edit ] Japan
The tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it rated as a "major tsunami", being at least 3 m (9.8 ft) high. [91] The actual height prediction varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at 6 m (20 ft) high. [92] The tsunami inundated a total area of approximately 561 km2 (217 sq mi) in Japan. [93]

The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST around 67 km (42 mi) from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30 minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography of the coastline. [94] [95] Just over an hour after the earthquake at 15:55 JST, a tsunami was observed flooding Sendai Airport , which is located near the coast of Miyagi Prefecture , [96] [97] with waves sweeping away cars and planes and flooding various buildings as they traveled inland. [98] [99] The image of the tsunami sweeping cars on the street in Sendai was caught by an in-car camera. The impact of the tsunami in and around Sendai Airport was filmed by an NHK News helicopter, showing a number of vehicles on local roads trying to escape the approaching wave and being engulfed by it. [100] A 4 m high tsunami hit Iwate Prefecture . [101] Wakabayashi Ward in Sendai was also particularly hard hit. [102] At least 101 designated tsunami evacuation sites were hit by the wave. [103]
Like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , the damage by surging water, though much more localized, was far more deadly and destructive than the actual quake. There were reports of entire towns destroyed from tsunami-hit areas in Japan, including 9,500 missing in Minamisanriku ; [104] one thousand bodies had been recovered in the town by 14 March 2011. [105]
Among several factors causing the high death toll from the tsunami, one was the unexpectedly large size of the water surge. The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami thought that they were located on high enough ground to be safe. [106]
Tsunami flooding on the Sendai Airport runway
Large parts of Kuji and the southern section of Ōfunato including the port area were almost entirely destroyed [107] [108] Also largely destroyed was Rikuzentakata , where the tsunami was reportedly three stories high. [109] [110] [111] Other cities reportedly destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami include Kamaishi , Miyako , Ōtsuchi , and Yamada (in Iwate Prefecture), Namie , Sōma and Minamisōma (in Fukushima Prefecture) and Shichigahama , Higashimatsushima , Onagawa , Natori , Ishinomaki , and Kesennuma (in Miyagi Prefecture). [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] The most severe effects of the tsunami were felt along a 670-km (420 mi)-long stretch of coastline from Erimo, Hokkaido , in the north to Ōarai, Ibaraki , in the south, with most of the destruction in that area occurring in the hour following the earthquake. [119] Near Ōarai, people captured images of a huge whirlpool that had been generated by the tsunami. [120] The tsunami washed away the sole bridge to Miyatojima, Miyagi, isolating the island's 900 residents. [121] A two meter high tsunami hit Chiba Prefecture about 2 1/2 hours after the quake, causing heavy damage to cities such as Asahi . [122]
On 13 March 2011, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) published details of tsunami observations recorded around the coastline of Japan following the earthquake. These observations included tsunami maximum readings of over 3 m (9.8 ft) at the following locations and times on 11 March 2011, following the earthquake at 14:46 JST: [123]
15:12 JST – off Kamaishi – 6.8 m (22 ft)
15:15 JST – Ōfunato – 3.2 m (10 ft) or higher
15:20 JST – Ishinomaki-shi Ayukawa – 3.3 m (11 ft) or higher
15:21 JST – Miyako – 4.0 m (13.1 ft) or higher
15:21 JST – Kamaishi – 4.1 m (13 ft) or higher
15:44 JST – Erimo-cho Shoya – 3.5 m (11 ft)
15:50 JST – Sōma – 7.3 m (24 ft) or higher
16:52 JST – Ōarai – 4.2 m (14 ft)
Many areas were also affected by waves of 1 to 3 meters (3.3 to 9.8 ft) in height, and the JMA bulletin also included the caveat that "At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites." The timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to 15:21, between 26 and 35 minutes after the earthquake had struck. The bulletin also included initial tsunami observation details, as well as more detailed maps for the coastlines affected by the tsunami waves. [124] [125]
JMA also reported offshore tsunami height recorded by telemetry from moored GPS wave height meter buoys as follows: [126]
offshore of central Iwate ( Miyako ) – 6.3 m (20 ft)
offshore of northern Iwate ( Kuji ) – 6.0 m (18 ft)
offshore of northern Miyagi ( Kesennuma ) – 6.0 m (18 ft)
On 25 March 2011, Port and Airport Research Institute (PARI) reported tsunami height by visiting the port sites as follows: [127]
NOAA animation of the tsunami's propagation
Port of Hachinohe – 5–6 m (16–19 ft)
Port of Hachinohe area – 8–9 m (26–29 ft)
Port of Kuji – 8–9 m (26–29 ft)
Port of Kamaishi – 7–9 m (23–30 ft)
Port of Ōfunato – 9.5 m (31 ft)
Run up height, port of Ōfunato area – 24 m (79 ft)
Fishery port of Onagawa – 15 m (50 ft)
Port of Ishinomaki – 5 m (16 ft)
Shiogama section of Shiogama - Sendai port – 4 m (13 ft)
Sendai section of Shiogama-Sendai port – 8 m (26 ft)
Sendai Airport area – 12 m (39 ft)
A joint research team from Yokohama National University and the University of Tokyo also reported that the tsunami at Ryōri Bay (綾里白浜), Ōfunato was about 30 m high. They found fishing equipment scattered on the high cliff above the bay. [128] At Tarō, Iwate , a University of Tokyo researcher reported an estimated tsunami height of 37.9 m (124 ft) reached the slope of a mountain some 200 m (656 ft) away from the coastline . [129] Also, at slope of nearby mountain from 400 m (1,312 ft) Aneyoshi fishery port (姉吉漁港) of Omoe peninsula (重茂半島) in Miyako, Iwate , Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology found estimated tsunami run up height of 38.9 m (127 ft). [16] This height is deemed the record in Japan historically, as of reporting date, that exceeds 38.2 m (125 ft) from the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake . [130] It was also estimated that the tsunami reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133 ft) in Miyako in Tōhoku's Iwate Prefecture. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 869 Sanriku tsunami . [131]
A Japanese government study found that only 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent were caught in the tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water. [132]
[ edit ] Elsewhere across the Pacific

Shortly after the earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific. At 07:30 UTC, PTWC issued a widespread tsunami warning covering the entire Pacific Ocean. [133] [134] Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands . [135] The United States West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas of most of California , all of Oregon , and the western part of Alaska , and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia , Canada. [136] [137] In California and Oregon , up to 2.4 m (8 ft) high tsunami surges hit some areas, damaging docks and harbors and causing over US$10 million in damage. [138] In Curry County, Oregon $7 million in damages occurred including the destruction of 3,600 feet (1,100 m) of dockspace at the Brookings harbor; the county has received over $1 million in FEMA emergency grants. [139] Surges of up to 1 m (3.3 ft) hit Vancouver Island in Canada [137] prompting some evacuations, and causing boats to be banned from the waters surrounding the island for 12 hours following the wave strike, leaving many island residents in the area without means of getting to work. [140] [141]
Fishing boats moved to higher ground in anticipation of tsunami arrival, in Pichilemu , Chile
In the Philippines , waves up to 0.5 m (1.6 ft) high hit the eastern seaboard of the country. Some houses along the coast in Jayapura, Indonesia were destroyed. [142] Authorities in Wewak , East Sepik , Papua New Guinea evacuated 100 patients from the city's Boram Hospital before it was hit by the waves, causing an estimated US$4 million in damages. [143] Hawaii estimated damage to public infrastructure alone at US$3 million, with damage to private properties, including resort hotels such as Four Seasons Resort Hualalai , estimated at tens of millions of dollars. [144] It was reported that a 1.5 m (5 ft) high wave completely submerged Midway Atoll's reef inlets and Spit Island, killing more than 110,000 nesting seabirds at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge . [145] Some other South Pacific countries, including Tonga and New Zealand, and U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam , experienced larger-than-normal waves, but did not report any major damage. [146] However in Guam some roads were closed off and people were evacuated from low-lying areas. [147]
Along the Pacific Coast of Mexico and South America, tsunami surges were reported, but in most places caused little or no damage. [148] Peru reported a wave of 1.5 m (5 ft) and more than 300 homes damaged. [148] The surge in Chile was large enough to damage more than 200 houses, [149] with waves of up to 3 m (9.8 ft). [150] [151] In the Galapagos Islands , 260 families received assistance following a 3 m (9.8 ft) surge which arrived 20 hours after the earthquake, after the tsunami warning had been lifted. [152] [153] There was a great deal of damage to buildings on the islands and one man was injured but there were no reported fatalities. [152] [154]
The tsunami broke icebergs off the Sulzberger Ice Shelf in Antarctica , 13,000 kilometres (8,100 mi) away. The main iceberg measured 9.5 by 6.5 kilometres (5.9 × 4.0 mi) (approximately the area of Manhattan Island ) and about 80 metres (260 ft) thick. A total of 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi; 31,000 acres) of ice broke away. [155] [156]
As of April 2012, wreckage from the tsunami spread around the oceans, including a soccer ball which was found in Alaska. [157]
