This video uses the 2011 Japan 9.0 magnitude earthquake to demonstrate how a global seismic network locates an earthquake while it's happening.  The black dots represent seismic stations used by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, and the expanding white halo represents the P-wave of the earthquake.  As the P-wave crosses the seismic stations, the stations turn from black to white.  Small circles also appear centered on each dot with a radius equal to the distance from the station to the epicenter.  Where the small circles intersect a "hot spot" forms indicating the location of the epicenter.
NOTE:  Though I am using the Sendai earthquake and real seismic station locations, this demonstration is simplified from reality in that I'm using a constant P-wave velocity of 5 km/s and P-wave travel is restricted to the surface of the earth.
