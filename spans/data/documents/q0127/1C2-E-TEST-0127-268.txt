I know. Ken Rockwell, in typical style, is already referring to Nikon in the past tense. :)

Canon is the greatest Japanese consumer photography equipment maker after Panasonic and Sony. Their cameras are excellent value for the money!
I used to be a Nikon guy. Film and digital. But after the SECOND failure of my D70's shutter-block, days after warranty ended on the repair of the first, on a road trip and WAY too expensive to replace with new and incompatible Nikon gear, I was "reduced" to a Canon S3 IS (pseudo-SLR, no lens substitutes) for an event.
But in the course of that event I came to kind like the unfamiliar Canon.
Soon after return home I discovered and installed CHDK and, as a result, outside of the S3's limited glass, I have a camera that serves me far better than the Nikon D70 ever did. And now has worked longer too.
My tagline hints at why I will not buy Sony. Nikon, well, I've sunk money into them and I am not happy with the result. Too unreliable and WAY too expensive to repair. The D70 is about to go up on sale as "spare parts" for anything other than the second defunct shutter block.
And I will soon find a way to unload the rest of the Nikon gear I have.
