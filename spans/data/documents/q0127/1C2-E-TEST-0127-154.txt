 
Japan Earthquake Relief Fund
On March 12, 2011, Japan Society created the Japan Earthquake Relief Fund, a disaster relief fund to aid victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake. One hundred percent of your tax-deductible contributions to the Japan Earthquake Relief Fund go to organizations that directly help victims of the March 11th disaster.
Of the funds that have been generously donated so far, we have earmarked $7.2 million to 19 nonprofit organizations in Japan on the front lines of relief, recovery and reconstruction  in Tohoku.  Read more about these organizations or read the latest press release .
Japan’s recovery is expected to take five years or more. With this in mind, Japan Society is working to gauge the long-term needs of those affected by the disaster with the goal of supporting organizations that will contribute to longer term recovery and reconstruction. As long as individuals, corporations and foundations show interest in supporting the longer term recovery and reconstruction process in Japan, Japan Society will keep the Japan Earthquake Relief Fund open for contributions. As we have seen in the past in places like the Gulf Coast in the United States and in Haiti, among other places, the need is great not just in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, but also in the longer term recovery and reconstruction process.
“Every day the world learns more about the extent of the damage and devastation in Japan,” said Motoatsu Sakurai, President of Japan Society. “We will make announcements about where additional funds will be allocated in the future as we gauge longer term needs.”
