So what do we know? Here's a run down of events so far:
- The biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 140 years struck the northeast coast on Friday, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that swept away everything in its path, including houses, cars and farm buildings on fire.
- The earthquake struck at 1446 local time (0546 GMT).
- 22 people are confirmed dead, with many more missing. Some news agencies are reporting a higher number of fatalities.
- The Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia all issued tsunami alerts, reviving memories of the giant tsunami which struck Asia in 2004. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued alerts for countries to the west and across the Pacific as far away as Colombia and Peru.
- There were several strong aftershocks. In Tokyo, buildings shook violently. An oil refinery near the city was on fire, with dozens of storage tanks under threat.
- Stunning TV footage showed the tsunami carrying the debris and fires across a large swathe of coastal farmland near the city of Sendai, which has a population of one million. The pictures suggested the death toll was going to rise.
- Sendai is 300 km (180 miles) northeast of Tokyo and the epicentre at sea was not far away.
- Thick smoke was also pouring out of an industrial area in Yokohama's Isogo area. TV footage showed boats, cars and trucks floating in water after a small tsunami hit the town of Kamaichi in northern Japan. An overpass, location unknown, appeared to have collapsed into the water.
- UK airlines have cancelled flights to Tokyo.
- The western prefecture of Wakayama ordered 20,000 people to evacuate after further tsunami warnings.
- Passengers on a subway line in Tokyo screamed and grabbed other passengers' hands during the quake. The shaking was so bad it was hard to stand, said Reuters reporter Mariko Katsumura.

Hirofumi Yokoyama, spokesman for Japan's meteorological agency, said in a briefing: "Historically, the magnitude scale was different, so simple comparison is not possible - but 8.8 is one of the largest we have experienced in Japan. It is the largest recorded by the equipment currently in place".]

Family of a work colleague told me that an aftershock hit Japan(Tokyo).

Steve, fukuoka appears to be distant from the area that experienced main damage. According to a news report by channelnewsasia.com, "The carrier says, flight SQ12 which took off from Singapore at about 9.45am, will be diverted to Fukuoka in southern Japan instead. " So I'm assuming they are alright if flights are being diverted to there.

I'm in Tokyo, in the last hour there's been a few aftershocks every 10-15 mins or so.

In that interview with BBC News, Dr Roger Musson, British Geological Survey, went on to say that the Japan earthquake was much bigger than the quake which struck Christchurch in New Zealand in February. The reason the Christchurch quake was so destructive, he said, was due to it being a direct hit on the city.

thank you for all the info. this is so tragic. watching these videos is just crazy. i just hope the u.s. doesnt see damage to that extent.
