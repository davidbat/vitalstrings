I am looking for Machiko Tsuji she has a younger sister and her two parents. Last time I knew, she was Aichi-Ken, Japan. She would be 26 or 27 years old now. We met in Findlay, Ohio in the United States almost 12 years ago. We were friends who lost touch. I hope she is okay. Please contact me at dj-jaylaine@hotmail.com if you know where she is or if she and her family are okay. Thank you!

Wondering about Teruo Fukuji, used to live at Kanaoka-cho, Sakai City, Osaka Japan, is about 65-70 years old. Had as pen pal for many years. We exchanged gifts and many letters. I was told by a relative to stop writing to him, and being young, I did what I was told.  Think of him every time there is a cataastrophe in Japan.

This occoured back in the 1970â€²s so the info is old. But I would love to see her again. Thank You in advance for any assistance you may provide. My Tel # is 541 299 0224
