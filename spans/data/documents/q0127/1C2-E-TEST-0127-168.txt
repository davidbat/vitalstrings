Following the incidents at nuclear power plants in Japan after the earthquake I was wondering which power stations around the world are near active earthquake zones.
With this in mind, I’ve created a map combining two sets of information:
A heatmap of every 4.5+ magnitude earthquake since to 1973 – around 174,000 in total
The location of 248 atomic energy plants, including numbers of reactors. Represented by blue markers.
The seismic data are from the United States Geological Survey and the nuclear power station information the International Atomic Energy Agency . The map is built from two Google Fusion tables, here and here .
To see the actual locations of the earthquakes you can toggle the heatmap off and display markers instead.
