The epicenter of the massive 8.9 earthquake in northern Japan was away from the country's main auto production centers but caused work to halt at some Toyota, Honda and Nissan facilities.
Toyota: A statement from Toyota USA said production has restarted at all of the company''s Japanese plants. Toyota has four subsidiaries with plants in the quake zone, including facilities that make the Yaris and the Scion xB and xD for export. Toyota USA said those plants are shut down and workers have been evacuated to safe areas.
Toyota said the extent of the damage at those subsidiary plants -- Toyota Motor Hokkaido, Toyota Motor Tohoku, Central Motor and Kanto Auto Works Iwate -- and at suppliers including Denso is undetermined.
Honda: At least one person was killed and 30 injured when a wall collapsed at a Honda's R&D facility in Tochigi prefecture. Production was disrupted at two plants but has restarted at one of them. The plant at Sayama, which makes several Honda and Acura models for export, remains closed.
Nissan: The company halted production at five plants in northeastern Japan and in Yokohama near Tokyo because of damage or power outages. It said two workers were slightly injured at its Tochigi plant and its technical center in Kanagawa. A statement from Nissan USA said small fires were put out at plants in Tochigi and Iwaki. Nissan said its facilities would remain shut down through the weekend and a decision on what will reopen Monday will be made tomorrow after it has better information on its facilities and those of suppliers.
Fuji (Subaru):Â  Reuters reports that Fuji Heavy Industries stopped production at eight of 10 factories, including all five car and car parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo. An aircraft factory and power products plant in Tochigi prefecture also was shut down.
