We have created a new donation page, giving full coverage of how we spend your cash gifts. For more updated information, please click here .
We heartily appreciate your kind offer of support.
If you want to donate money to those affected by the earthquake and tsunami, please contact your national Red Cross/Red Crescent society , which may have already launched a fundraising campaign within your country.
If you wish to send your donations directly to the Japanese Red Cross Society, you can donate online, or direct your funds to the following bank accounts. All funds received under this account will be transferred to the Distribution Committee, which is formed around the local governments of the disaster-affected prefectures. These funds will be distributed directly among the affected population. For more information on how your donations will be contributed, please click here .
* Due to complicated procedures, we regret that we are unable to accept personal and bank checks.
* Some banks may charge additional fees if the wire transfer has to be processed via an intermediary bank. Therefore, please indicate that the money is going to the Japanese Red Cross so that transaction fees as well as currency conversion fees may be exempted.
* The donation period: We have extended the donation period until September 30, 2012 (as of March 2, 2012).
