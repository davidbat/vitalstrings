A high-intensity 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Japan today at around 1: 45pm Japan local time. It was a horrific quake that rattled the east coast of Japan but did not trigger a tsunami there. The Japanese Meteorological Agency later told that the quake was originated approximately 8.8 miles beneath the earth. The huge effect of the quake was felt in Honshu province of Japan where the house and buildings remained shaking for several seconds.
Assessing the whole situation, the Japanese Meteorological Agency has issued a tsunami alert for the northeastern coast. According to the agency scientists, 20-inch tall tsunami waves can hit the coast around noon Wednesday thus, the natives should leave the area immediately so that they could remain safe from the catastrophic effects of the tsunami. Another mega earthquake of 6.3-magnitude was immediately felt after the main quake and still the aftershocks were continue.
There were no immediate news of injuries and damages. The officials are still assessing the situation and they are trying to know if the quake has caused any damage. It is being said that even the buildings in Tokyo were also shaken and they also felt the effect of the quake.
The US Geological Survey also released a statement immediately following the Japanâ€™s earthquake in which they said that they were not feeling any tsunami warning for the island of Hawaii and everything was normal there. They said there could be local tsunamis in the area but they were not expecting any big tsunami.
