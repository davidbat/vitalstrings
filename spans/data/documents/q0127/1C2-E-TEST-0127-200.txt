News and discussions about image sensors
Saturday, March 12, 2011
My sincere condolences to Japanese people who is suffering from the disastrous earthquake.
According to ElectrIQ map, most of Japan's fabs are quite far away from earthquake zone:
Looking on the earthquake areas, Toshiba Iwate image sensor fab seems to be right in it. Panasonic Tonami image sensor plant seems to be quite close too (Most of other Panasonic fabs are near Osaka, far from the earthquake). I'm unable to see Canon CIS fab here (in Tokyo area, if I'm not mistaken). Also, Fujifilm CCD fab is not shown, not sure where it is located.
Sony Kyushu fab is located in Fukuoka area, south of Japan. The new Sony Nagasaki center is also on the south. Sharp CCD fab is located in Fukuyama, near Hiroshima, also quite far on the south. Toshiba Oita CIS fab is on the south, so it should be OK.
If somebody knows more about Japan image sensor plant locations and status, please add in comments.
Update: Bloomberg reports that Toshiba shut down its Iwate plant and evacuated the employees. No damage was reported at the Iwate plant, which produces logic chips and CMOS image sensors for mobile-phone cameras, Keisuke Ohmori, a company spokesman, said by telephone.
Update #2: Digitimes too reports that Toshiba closed its Iwate fab. Not much more info is given.
EETimes gives guite a detaled summary of Japan fab status and damages.
