A huge earthquake hit Japan this afternoon. I've got a headache thinking about the safety of my friends. To be honest I would rather be back in Japan at a time like this - my own safety is the last thing on my mind.
Latest reports is that it was a Magnitude 8.9. A tsunami came along after and it looks like Sendai is for the most part underwater. I'll update you with any info I have from comrades back in Japan but for now you can watch a clean stream live on NHK at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/foxtokimekitonight
Update: TBS have a live stream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/tbstv
As I write this, you can see the Tsunami moving across the land eating up everything in its way, there are fires and cars trying to escape from the wave. I just cant believe what I'm seeing. All I can do is share as much info as I can.
