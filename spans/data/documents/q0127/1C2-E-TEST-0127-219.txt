Â 
There has been some interesting news coming from the scientific community after Japan's earthquake.
The earthquake that rocked the nation of Japan has actually moved the USA closer to Japan and cause the Earth's axis to shift causing a slightly shorter day.
The crack in the earth's crust off the coast of Japan caused a crack that is more than 15 miles beneath the sea surface. it stretches 180 miles long and 90 miles wide.
The crack in the sea floor cause the nation of Japan actually 13 feet closer to the UNited States.
The world's fifth-largest, 8.9 magnitude quake was caused when the Pacific tectonic plate dove under the North American plate, which shifted Eastern Japan towards North America by about 13 feet
The quake also shifted the earth's axis by 6.5 inches,shortened the Earths day by 1.6 miliseconds, and sank Japan downward by about two feet.
As Japan's eastern coastline sunk, the tsunami's waves rolled in.
I wondered how the Earth could actually have a shorter day, but apparently the quake shifted the mass of the planet toward the center of the Earth causing it to spin faster.
In 1995 Sensors were placed around Japan to record this data today hopefully helping save lives for the future.
So Maybe we can better understand natural disasters
