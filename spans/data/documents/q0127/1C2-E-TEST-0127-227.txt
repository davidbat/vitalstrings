On Friday 11 March a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the east coast of Japan, triggering a vast tsunami which engulfed huge swathes of land and killed thousands of people. Many more were made homeless by the catastrophe.
As rescuers battled to reach those affected, a new disaster began unfolding at Japan's Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant. The crisis there would eventually become the world's biggest and most serious since Chernobyl . Thousands were evacuated as workers struggled to prevent major radiation leaks.
The Channel 4 News team, including Presenter Jon Snow and Chief Correspondent Alex Thomson, covered these events and more with a series of video reports from around the country. Raw footage shot by terrified bystanders also poured in.
Eight months on, Channel 4 News went back to Japan to see how recovery efforts were going and found towns still devastated and memories still raw -
but there was hope as well.
