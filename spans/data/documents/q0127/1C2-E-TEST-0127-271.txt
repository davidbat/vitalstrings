Brendan                          O'Connell made an uncanny prediction in Dec 2010 -- three                          months prior to the 3-11-2011 Fukushim meltdown -- in                          his correspondence                          with American activist John de Nugent : “John,                          with your Tea Party and WN types, and Obama imploding,                          the Jews understand they will never get hate-speech laws                          or gun confiscation in America. Instead, they will go                          for creating disasters via HAARP, reactor cook-offs, famines,                          epidemics, stopping the Gulf Stream via the Gulf oil spill,                          and other things to justify martial law.”
John                          de Nugent response (following 3-11): "Now look at                          what just happened to Japan……. the Israelis                          did security at the Japanese reactors: I am certain they                          put the Stuxnet virus on it to sabotage the reactors after THEY also did a HAARP attack via the tsunami."

Benjamin                      Fulford 2008 video talking about HAARP Fulford states at the beginning of the video: "Last year I confronted Heizo                      Takenaka , the former Japanese finance minister [Editor's                      note, actually the Minister of State for Financial Services, according to Wikipedia], over why he handed over control of the Japanese                      financial system, to a group of American and European oligarchs.                      He and his envoy told me that it was because Japan had been                      threatened by an earthquake machine. I did not believe it                      at the time, however, when I started exposing some of their                      doings, I was told by the Japanese security police that because                      of what I had said on places like Rense.com, that Niigata                      City was going to be hit by an earthquake. Two days later,                      Japan's largest nuclear reactor was the exact epicenter of                      two earthquakes, both 6.8 in magnitude. That was too much                      coincidence for me. So I did some research and started to                      find out about HAARP..."
 
2011-03-21 US troops and occupation forces flee Japan, their lackeys                      flee Tokyo , by Benjamin Fulford, benjaminfulford.net . "The United States occupation forces in Japan are staging                      a major strategic defeat because they know the Japanese defense                      establishment knows it was elements of the US military that                      set off the March 11, (311) tsunami attack against Japan.                      This attack used nuclear weapons drilled into the seabed by                      submarines and not HAARP according to senior Pentagon Sources.                      In addition, four months ago they overruled Japanese authorities                      and placed deadly plutonium into the number 3 reactor at Fukushima,                      according to the governor of Fukushima prefecture. This was                      to provide a nuclear cover story for the seabed atomic attack,                      pentagon sources say. Needless to say, the ring-leaders of                      this attack are now in hiding and know they will be found." See other more recent entries at benjaminfulford.net .

"On                      the 11 March 2011 the zionist jewish head of the IMF had a                      meeting planned with the Japanese prime minister to discuss                      the structuring of the country's public debt to the private                      central bank.
"The                      agenda of the meeting was for the IMF to structure a loan                      from the IMF to Japan to pay the Rothschild private central                      bank.
Jonathon                      Azaziah Japan Earthquake 11.03.2011
“PakAlertPress                      reported three days ago that H.A.A.R.P. activity two days                      before, two days after and on the day was everywhere.”
“Why?                      There are three reasons:”
“One.                      There was a report that came out of Russian media and Chinese                      media, obviously not reported here, that the day of the earthquake                      - prior to the earthquake - the Japanese government issued                      its condemnation of israel’s new settlement project.                      They were also thinking of recognizing the Palestinian state,                      which is another issue entirely, interesting nonetheless that                      they would do it.”
“Two.                      There has been a growing movement within Japan over the last                      2½ years to remove the United States’ military                      bases in Okinawa which have occupied this country for decades.                      And we’re not talking about civilians. We’re talking                      about local politicians, we’re talking about bankers,                      we’re talking about businessmen and policemen who want                      these bases out. These bases in Okinawa serve as Rothschild’s                      empire’s ear-to-the-ground within Asia.”
“Three.                      You always look for the money. Anytime any major disaster                      happens you always look at the globalist corporations owned                      by the sympathizers to the Zionist entity and its cause, and                      what they’re looking to profit off of. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,                      the jewish head of the IMF and the founder of the organization                      Socialism and Judaism, who spent millions of dollars every                      single year on the principal of ethnically cleansing Jerusalem                      from Arab, Muslim and Christian influence, was supposed to                      be in Japan on March 11th the day of the earthquake.”
“Well                      guess what? Dominique Strauss-Kahn didn’t show up. This                      was a high profile meeting between prime minister (Naoto)                      Kan and Dominique Strauss-Kahn and he didn’t show. And                      the reports I’ve been reading out of Russia is that                      Dominique Strauss-Kahn had been traveling to Japan to restructure                      Japan’s debt and to take a loan from the IMF, and that                      prime minister Kan had no interest in doing so.”
“So                      now with hundreds of billions of dollars of damage more than                      likely, after this earthquake and this tsunami and now the                      nuclear meltdown, who do you think is going to come in and                      offer reconstruction loans and development loans to the Japanese                      people? The IMF run by Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the World                      Bank run by PNAC member Robert Zoellick and probably the European                      Bank of reconstruction and development which is run by a consortium                      of Zionist bankers and CFR agents.”

2011-03-15 Jeff                      Rense interview with Yoichi Shimatsu , a leading                      Japanese investigative journalist based in Hong Kong, who                      believes that Japanese may be victims of a sabotage campaign                      by globalists who hate nationalists and countries with the                      potential to offer competing nuclear capabilities:
Yoichi Shimatsu: You                        know last year about this time I was in Berlin where I heard                        Henry Kissinger announce his non-nuclear world policy. It                        was his first announcement. He happened to be in the former                        headquarters of the Stasi, the East German Secret Police                        where he made this statement. And since then we have seen                        a lot of what we might call very robust anti-proliferation                        work going on around the world. You know, we saw Mubarek                        and his son, they were trying to build a nuclear, revise                        Egypt's nuclear plant to build up a nuclear deterrent against                        Israel. They had the cooperation probably of Libya, a uranium                        provider. Tunisia, because they are concerned about what                        has been happening in Gaza and Lebanon. Mubarek was shut                        down. We see Angela Merkel, she made a U-turn, cut and run.                        Her speech was given in Germany. So we are seeing the possibility                        -- I don't know, I am not suggesting anything, but I don't                        exclude the possibility, maybe those generators at Fukushima                        were shut down by computer virus before the Tsunami                        hit. We do not know, OK.
Jeff Rense: And we probably never will.
Yoichi Shimatsu: Well, it could be traced.                        If people check and see if Fukushima One was under attack,                        Japanese nuclear plants have been under attack. It is a                        high national security issue, the Japanese government would                        never disclose that because of its security alliance with                        the United States. But in the Kobe quake, and the subsequent                        disasters, we did find evidence -- and we are talking about                        top seismologists from Tsukuba                        University of Seismic Technology, talking about very,                        very unusual patterns in the ionosphere above Kobe for six                        months prior to the earthquake. That puzzles them. Today                        Japanese seismologists are saying this quake behaves like                        no other quake they have ever seen. It is completely inexplicable.                        It has been followed by quakes along fault lines where these                        are totally disconnected to this fault line, so the seismologists                        themselves are saying this does not seem to be a natural                        event like previous quakes we have been studying for the                        last hundred years, so there is some concern that maybe                        some of the disaster has been -- some of this disaster may                        have been abetted by a robust anti-proliferation campaign                        that is being run something like Captain Nemo or like Operation                        Swordfish . There might be a covert program to shut down,                        like with Stuxnet in Iran, to shut down the world's nuclear                        systems to maintain a monopoly of a few countries.
Anti-proliferation                      from Israel's viewpoint applies not only to Egypt and Iran,                      but also to its concerns about Pakistan, which is already                      the sole holder of the "Islamic A-bomb." Israel's                      Mossad has allied itself with Pakistan's arch-enemy, India's                      intelligence services, and has sought to destabilize Pakistan                      in ways that may enable Mossad-CIA or the U.S. military to                      take control of Pakistan's nuclear weapons and divide Pakistan                      from its ally China. See Chapter                      37 of my Mission of Conscience series,                      where I list among other things the 11 Dec 2009 article " Obama                      Declares War on Pakistan ," by Webster G. Tarpley.                      See also the 24 March 2011 article China                      to Sell Outdated Nuclear Reactors to Pakistan by Stephanie Ho, voanews.com. "China has provided two                      reactors to Pakistan’s Chasma nuclear power plant, with                      a deal that it provide two more. American officials have not                      expressed outright opposition, but have said if China goes                      ahead with Chasma 3 and 4, these actions would be "inconsistent" with commitments it made when it joined the Nuclear Suppliers                      Group in 2004."
Rense                      and Shimatsu also discussed how the U.S. encouraged Japan                      to become dependent on nuclear energy --and faulty GE nuclear                      power plants -- as an alternative to Japan's frustrated quest                      for oil that had been a motivating factor behind the 1941                      attack on Pearl Harbor. At the same time, Japan remains at                      the mercy of certain globalists who jealously guard their                      nuclear monopoly:
Shimatsu: The other                        thing is I have often been asked why is it the Japanese,                        the only country to be hit with two nuclear bombs, would                        opt for nuclear energy, and one of the reasons is that in                        the 60's the whole history of the nuclear power history                        was a time when the United States under this program called [Operation]                        Murray Hill -- tried to build a global monopoly over                        uranium. Saw it as a power of the future. The king power                        of the future. And this is one that could ultimately be                        controlled globally under U.S. standards and management                        systems and Nonproliferation Treaty and all, and Japan was                        basically a subordinate ally of the United States and accepted                        it. The United States does not want Japan to rely heavily                        on oil like it did before World War II, which lead to World                        War II. The Japan drive for war historically was to try                        to feed oil reserves.
Rense: That was the greater Southeast Asia                        co-prosperity project, which the United States torpedoed.
Shimatsu: And to counter that, the United                        States component had nuclear power as the alternative to                        petroleum. And this is how the Japanese nuclear power industry                        really got started, and that is why it is no accident that                        GE designed these reactors.
Rense: And who owns most of the uranium                        mines in the world? The Queen of England. She is the figurehead,                        but she has been buying them up. And the largest recent                        purchase I am told was in the middle of Australia.

Intelligent                        and informed people know what has happened, the understand                        the message, and it is understood that the message will                        be transmitted by such people to reach all -- even as all                        media will ignore the overwhelming evidence for precisely                        planned tectonic warfare...
MacArthur                        aimed for a strong centralized nationalist/paternalistic                        but pacifistic and non-chauvinistic government seeking the                        prosperity through the American model of the conservative                        business with a dash of "Huey Longish" wealth-sharing                        -- a system very well realized under Prime Ministers Yoshida                        Shigeru, Hatoyamna Ichiro, Ikeda Hayato Paternalism for                        the betterment of its people -- although big corporations                        -- they were big-family corporations with co-existing union                        power etc.
The                        Japanese made it work -- as Americans failed to make these                        very same ideals work. All that came after Hiroshima-Nagasaki.                        Japan will not be so fortunate with the IMF and Rothschild "globalist" reconstruction occupation as it was                        under the MacArthur occupation. Japan is in dire need now                        -- and all aid will have strings. A new order is now supreme                        in Japan. The Jews are in control."
2010-10-07 Japan                        fast-tracking nuclear weapons acquisition ,                        (subscription page, waynemadsenreport.com)
New                        information obtained by WMR from Asian intelligence sources                        points to Japan fast-tracking nuclear weapons acquisition                        as a result of Japan's tense relations with China, Tokyo's                        frayed relations with Washington, and fears over North Korea's                        nuclear weapons.
Japan                        no longer believes its security treaty with the United States                        is reliable and Tokyo has decided, even with a strong tradition                        of anti-nuclear weapons sentiment among the Japanese people                        arising out of the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima                        and Nagasaki in 1945, that the country has no other choice                        but to scrap its commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation                        Treaty (NPT) and opt for an independent Japanese nuclear                        deterrence capability.
Japan                        reportedly has the capability to assemble nuclear weapons                        in 18 hours. That is in marked contrast to its previous                        assemblage time frame of 40 hours. Current-generation Japanese                        missiles, with nuclear warheads, are can be programmed to                        target the large Chinese cities and naval bases along the                        Pacific coast.
WMR                        has been told that Japan war planners have discussed a joint                        strategy with India to take out Chinese ballistic launchers                        in the interior of China with missiles launched from India.                        The Indian option would be in place until Japan could upgrade                        its M-5 missile to serve as an intercontinental ballistic                        missile (ICBM) delivery platform to target China's interior                        nuclear missile sites and bring Moscow, which is 7000 miles                        from Japan, within range.
As                        far as Japanese defenses are concerned, Tokyo, itself, is                        a hardened city, with an infrastructure for the government                        and VIPs to survive and escape underground to new headquarters                        in the event of a Chinese nuclear strike.
Japan                        has a number of granite mountains from where second and                        third strikes against China could be launched. Since the                        Chinese cities are much more heavily populated, China would                        take staggering casualties in a nuclear exchange, and the                        sheer number of victims would swamp the Chinese government's                        ability to cope much less govern.
Japanese                        nuclear war planners have concluded the Japanese are psychologically                        prepared to move on with a smaller population after a nuclear                        exchange with China and/or North Korea. Some Japanese war                        planners feel a nuclear war could actually be good for long-term                        economic development, as strange as that seems, since it                        would destroy a lot of backward capital and force new initiatives                        to go forward. The nuclear trauma has already been absorbed                        and incorporated in the Japanese psyche, so the Japanese                        are probably the most capable of maintaining social order                        and reorganizing after a global nuclear catastrophe. The                        bottom line for Tokyo is that nuclear war is survivable,                        though the victims would be numerous and the damage nearly                        unthinkable.
Japan                        is also in no mood to be lectured by the United States if                        it decides to abandon its NPT treaty commitments. A nuclear                        Japan will use the lesson of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to argue                        for a swift nuclear retaliatory response, that is, if any                        country launches a nuclear weapon on Japan, Japan's nuclear                        response will be total with a goal of wiping the aggressor                        off the map.
If                        Japan deep-sixes its NPT obligations, a half-dozen countries                        are expected to follow suit, primarily South Korea, Taiwan,                        Germany, Brazil, Argentina, and possibly, Turkey."
2010-10-04 A                        nuclear-armed Japan may be around the corner .                        (subscription page, waynemadsenreport.com)
"Frayed                        relations with China and Russia, the ever-present threat                        posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons, and a re-examination                        of the 1960 U.S.-Japan security treaty, formally known as                        the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the                        United States and Japan, has some in the Japanese government                        and military considering what would have been unthinkable                        just a few years ago, Japan entering the club of nations                        possessing nuclear weapons.
Since                        Japan was the only nation to have suffered from the wartime                        use of nuclear weapons -- the dropping of U.S. atomic bombs                        on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in August 1945, there is a strong                        anti-nuclear feeling among the Japanese people. But it noteworthy                        that Japan had two nascent programs to build an atomic bomb                        during World War II -- the Army's Ni-Go project and the                        Navy's F-Go program. In the 1960s, the Lyndon Johnson administration                        pressured the Eisaku Sato government to sign the nuclear                        Non-Proliferation Treaty amid fears that Sato was pushing                        for a Japanese nuclear weapons capability to counter that                        of China.
The                        security treaty provided for the United States to come to                        the aid of Japan to defend against an armed attack on those                        territories under Japanese administration. However, WMR                        has learned from informed Japanese sources that a classified                        annex to the treaty does not provide for the United States                        to commit to the defense of two disputed territories: the                        Senkaku islands, which are claimed by China (which calls                        them the Diaoyu Islands) and have been the basis for recent                        naval incidents between Japan and China, and four islands                        in the southern Kuril Islands chain that were occupied by                        the Soviet Union in the final days of World War II and which                        are still occupied by Russia.
The                        Senkakus were occupied by the United States when its military                        occupied Okinawa in World War II but a secret annex to the                        U.S.-Japanese treaty excludes the islands from the U.S.                        defense umbrella for Japan, according to Japanese sources.                        Similarly, the annex does not recognize Japanese sovereignty                        over the southern Kuril islands of Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu                        and Kunashir. Another secret protocol to the U.S.-Japanese                        treaty permitted to United States to station nuclear weapons                        on Japanese soil.
With                        the U.S. increasingly seen by Japanese miitary and foreign                        policy polcy-makers as an overextended and failing superpower,                        some elements in the Japanese government and think tanks                        feel that the only way Japan can be self-assured over its                        defense is for the country to amend its constitution and                        laws to allow for the introduction of nuclear weapons for                        the Japanese Self-Defense Force.
The                        recent demotion of Japan below China to a number three world                        economic power ranking also has some Japanese convinced                        that Japan must look beyond its security alliance with the                        United States and provide for its own defense, which in                        today's geo-political climate necessitates the acquisition                        of nuclear weapons. WMR has learned from Japanese sources                        that when a green light is given by the government, it will                        take only three months for Japan to develop and deploy nuclear                        warheads for its military forces. Japan maintains an independent                        uranium enrichment capability and is able to use its own                        rocket technology to develop an intercontinental ballistic                        missile delivery system. There is some speculation that                        Japan merely that since Japan already possesses nuclear                        weapons designs details it merely has to jump to production                        in order to field weapons. Japan is already the world's third largest nuclear power producer after the United States                        and France, both of which are nuclear weaponry powers.
The                        recent skirmish between Japanese Coast Guard vessels and                        a Chinese fishing boat in disputed Senkaku waters and a                        firm Russian rejection of negotiations with Japan over the                        future of the disputed southern Kurils as a "dead end," has renewed interest by Tokyo in a more independent Japanese                        military policy, one that sees the possession of an independent                        Japanese nuclear force as a definite option. Adding to Japanese                        frustration is the refusal of the United States to vacate                        its unpopular military presence on Okinawa, a factor that                        helped bring down the government of the former Prime Minister,                        Yukio Hatoyama.
In                        1968, Sato's government re-defined its peaceful nuclear                        power policy and commitment to non-proliferation by amending                        it to give it the option of pursuing nuclear weapons if                        the U.S. nuclear umbrella was ever seen as unreliable. With                        the revelation that the United States has excluded the Senkakus                        and southern Kurils from what it considers to be Japanese                        territory, the Sato clause is now being seriously considered.                        In 1994, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono revealed the existence of a secret 1969 Japanese Foreign Ministry document urged                        Japan to maintain the capability to develop nuclear weapons.
In                        2005, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso reportedly told                        Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that "India,                        Pakistan, and the DPRK all have nuclear weapons. If the                        DPRK continues to develop nuclear weapons, Japan must also                        arm itself with nuclear weapons." In 2008, Aso became                        Prime Minister of Japan. In 2006, former Prime Minister                        Yasuhiro Nakasone floated the notion of Japan acquiring                        its own nuclear weapons.
Because                        China has always insisted Japan must not develop nuclear                        weapons, there is a powerful faction in Japan's military                        and political establishment that wants to do exactly what                        China opposes as a way of throwing down a gauntlet to Beijing's                        wider aspirations in Asia.
The                        word from Tokyo is that it is no longer a question whether                        Japan will develop a nuclear weapons capability, but when.                        And "when" would now appear to be very close.
If                        Japan opts to leave the NPT regime and obtain nuclear weapons                        there will be a domino effect in Asia. It is well known                        that while the world was concentrating on North Korea's                        nuclear weapons program, South Korea quietly embarked on                        its own secret nuclear weapons acquisition program. In 2004,                        it was revealed that Seoul had maintained a secret uranium                        enrichment production program at South Korean research facilities                        since the early 1980s and that the program involved enriching                        uranium and producing plutonium. Canada investigated charges                        that one of its Candu nuclear reactors it sold to South                        Korea was involved in the clandestine program.
It                        is also believed that Taiwan acquired nuclear weapons as                        the result of a secret alliance between apartheid South                        Africa, Israel, and Taiwan. South Africa gave up its nuclear                        weapons when it achieved majority black rule in 1994. There                        are also reports of secret Israeli involvement with North                        Korea's nuclear weapons program. Burma is also suspected                        of maintaining a clandestine nuclear weapons acquisition                        program."

"To this                        day Japan remains a vassal state, making huge annual payments                        to their new masters. In theory, they can cash in on the                        $35 trillion in worthless paper (official data put the number                        at close to $5 trillion, secret data at over $35 trillion)                        they have been given in exchange for 60 years of supplying                        Americans with radios, TVs, cars etc. In reality, any Japanese                        Prime Minister who tried to do this was killed or deposed.                        More recently the Japanese have been threatened into submission                        with powerful secret weapons. Using former Prime Minister                        Koizumi and Finance Minister Heizo Takenaka (a Henry Kissinger                        prot'g') they also engineered a semi-secret take-over of                        the Japanese commercial banking system. For example, Tokyo                        Mitsubishi UFJ bank's new logo is a Masonic eye."

[7:56] "The CIA is on record managing things at the                      Fukushima cataclysm that is happening so that they can continue                      building these dangerous reactors all over the world, because                      the CIA does not work for us. They work for Wall Street that                      created the CIA and runs our nation. The CIA is not run by                      America. That is why it has gone from the light of liberty                      and an example of human dignity and human freedom to the example                      of the evil empire."
2010-07-28 Cheonan                      sunk by mine, not North Korea? (RT Video)
Wayne                      Madsen commented: "...There is a lot of skepticism from                      China and Japan because many in Japan feel that this may have                      been used as a cause to keep the U.S. military base in Okinawa,                      which ultimately led to the downfall of the Hatoyama government                      and replacement by somebody much more pro-U.S."
2010-June 7-8 -- Mossad fingerprints on Cheonan propaganda                      war launched by Seoul by Wayne Madsen:
"Israeli                      intelligence has been involved in the propaganda war created                      by the attack on a vessel in strategic waters. No, we are                      not talking about the attack by the Israelis on the Turkish                      vessel Mavi Marmara off of Gaza. According to WMR's intelligence                      sources in Asia, Mossad's fingerprints are all over the propaganda                      actions by the South Korean government of right-wing President                      Lee Myung-bak in the aftermath of the March "false flag" attack on the South Korean anti-submarine warfare corvette                      Cheonan in waters near a joint U.S.-South Korean intelligence                      base near North Korea.
Israel                      and the Blue House
President                      Lee's major conduit for his covert intelligence relationship                      with Israel is through his Foreign Minister, Yu Myung-hwan,                      South Korea's ambassador to Tel Aviv from 2002 to 2004.
Israel's                      propaganda support for the Seoul regime also involved the                      Obama administration, which was keen to create a tense situation                      on the Korean peninsula to convince the Japanese government                      of Yukio Hatoyama on changing its mind about seeking to move                      a U.S. Marine Corps base from Okinawa. The tactic worked.                      Hatoyama flipped on the American base and supported its continuing                      presence in Okinawa, citing the post-Cheonan sinking rise                      in tensions in Korea. As an added benefit for the neocons                      in the Obama administration, particularly Defense Secretary                      Robert Gates, the Hatoyama government fell after it flipped                      on an important election campaign plank.
Almost                      immediately after South Korean, Chinese, Australian, and American                      journalists began to question the "facts" presented                      by the South Koreans and a hand-picked team of "independent" investigators from the United States, Australia, Britain,                      and Sweden, the Mossad propaganda mills in Asia went into                      full operation.
Chinese intelligence is increasingly convinced that the "North                      Korean" torpedo that was used to "prove" Pyongyang's                      role in the sinking of the Cheonan was not only of German                      manufacture but was provided to the South Korean and the American                      sabotage team by Israel."
2010-06-28 American                      Alert: Israel and Iran -- World War and False Flag by Capt. Eric May. The U.S. and Israel remain joined at the                      hip, spring-loaded to conduct more false flag attacks.
False                      flag operations typically utilize major official operations to accomplish the exact opposite of what is stated                      for public consumption.
Editor's Note: If in fact Japan's nuclear catastrophe was                        caused by deliberate subversion, such as a combination of                        HAARP, a nuclear device detonated within a fault zone, Stuxnet,                        and extreme hazards deliberately embedded like time bombs                        in Japan's nuclear plant policy (like storing hundreds of                        thousands of spent fuel rods in pools over reactors, analogous                        to storing jerry cans full of gas over your stove in your                        home kitchen), this type of false flag operation would fall                        into what I call a "soft" false flag operation,                        where false flaggers hide their moves behind natural events                        or willful negligence to create "plausible deniability" as opposed to orchestrating overtly violent "terrorist" activities that piggy back on military exercises, like 9/11 or London                        7/7 . I have covered other forms of "soft" false flag operations in the chapters of my Mission                        of Conscience Trilogy that address the Katrina                        strike on New Orleans and Swine                        Flu biowar .
Let                        me briefly summarize the "catastrophes waiting to happen" that authorities in the U.S. and Japan supported for decades,                        either out of criminal willful blindness or deliberate malevolent                        design:
*                        Building nuclear reactors near hazardous fault lines. According                        to Leuren Moret, Japan experiences an 8.0 earthquake every                        five years, and sits on the confluence of four tectonic                        plates.
*                        Storing spent nuclear fuel rods over reactors.
*                        Allowing Israeli firms to provide security, particularly                        in the post-9/11 period with so much strong evidence that                        the City of London, Mossad-CIA, and other Zionist entities                        have been repeatedly executing outrageously criminal and                        massively destructive false flag events, as documented in                        my Mission                        of Conscience series , the melt-down                        of Iceland's banking industry , (a combination of Mossad,                        the Russian Jewish mafia, and the City of London played                        a major role in causing Icelandic leaders to betray the                        traditional " Nordic                        character "), the City of London's BP-Gulf                        Catastrophe , and myriad other examples.
We                        need to focus extra attention on Israel's involvement with                        Japanese nuclear plant security and the Stuxnet virus --as                        well as reckless negligence in GE's Mark I plant design                        and location -- because the exact same problems currently                        exist in America right now as "catastrophes waiting                        to happen." There are dozens of GE-built Mark I nuclear                        plants in the U.S. built near fault zones and " guarded" by Israeli firms .
Criminal Negligence on a Massive Scale That                        Has Been Completely Off the Charts
2011-05-07 Alfred                        Webre interview with Leuren Moret "Fukushima                        HAARP nuclear attack by CIA, DOE, BP for London banks," embedded video and complete transcript page:
Leuren Moret ...there                        were very low-level people left in the plant and this is                        right after the explosions occurred which made it impossible                        for cooling systems to work. But actually all the reactors                        were in melt-down 90 minutes after the earthquake because                        90 minutes after the cooling system stops, a reactor goes                        into melt-down, and there was no way to get the cooling                        system started. The main cooling system that operates normally                        has the pump down on the beach. Why in the world you put                        a pump for a nuclear power plant where a magnitude 8 or                        greater earthquake happens every five years, and the history                        of Japan and tsunamis, I mean that is a Japanese word for                        these huge tidal waves that are caused by large magnitude                        earthquakes, so that would seem a very, very poor design.                        Also, the backup first system, which was a diesel backup                        cooling system, was in the basement under the reactor.                        Why in the world would you put a power plant right on the                        ocean and then put the back up cooling system under the                        reactor in a room, a basement room, that would immediately                        be flooded? So it seems like it wasn't just poor design.                        It seems like there was planning, very careful planning,                        that would sabotage the safety of these nuclear power plants                        in the event of earthquakes and tsunamis. Of course the                        diesel system flooded. The workers tried to get the pump                        on the beach to start up, they couldn't do that. There was                        no electricity coming into the plant, so they resorted to                        their last backup system, which is battery driven, and even                        that couldn't work because a Stuxnet virus created by the                        CIA with the help of Siemens and the Mossad was also involved.                        It sabotaged the operating system in the power plant, and                        no matter what they did to correct whatever they could correct,                        including probably the software and the operating system,                        it was immediately changed back to the sabotage code, and                        this was done remotely through satellites, probably NSA.                        So those nuclear power plants, all six of them, have absolutely                        been in melt-down since 90 minutes after the earthquake.                        Also, no expert engineers have been allowed in the plant.                        They would know how to deal with this issue. This really                        requires the aid of an international consortium of experts                        and governments and military to resolve this issue. But                        it is too late now. The molten fuel has burned through the                        bottom of the reactors. Melted through the bottom of the                        reactors. It is in the ground now. It has even melted through                        the bottom of the operating plant. So the secrecy in the                        past week has intensified during this first week of May,                        2011. So it is not getting better, it is getting worse.                        And the United States Government has been complicit in this. They confiscated iodine supplies that U.S. citizens should                        have been taking. Actually they should have evacuated the                        West Coast of North America. We are all terribly contaminated                        now. And they used weather modification to cause two weeks                        of rain beginning March 18th to the 30th when the highly                        radioactive dust and nanoparticles were arriving in huge                        plumes that went all over North America, the Arctic, Mexico,                        and then part of what was carried out to Hawaii in that                        Pacific gyre that I mentioned, circulation system...
Highly Coincidental                      Military Exercises
2011-03-22 " Radioactive                      Questions for Barack Obama ," Capt. Eric                      May notes "The Japanese and New                      Zealand governments were both running national-level catastrophe                      exercises when the Christchurch and Fukushima catastrophes                      occurred. Did these governments have foreknowledge of                      their quakes?"
U.S.-Israeli nuclear                      plant security "protection" in the face of the Stuxnet                      virus threat that they themselves created
"The                      security at the airports used in the 9/11 attack were Israeli                      owned.

That's                      only the start of some very disturbing "coincidences".
Did                      the nuclear meltdown occur because of the earthquake and tsunami,                      or from the Stuxnet virus that compromised the reactor's safety                      system?..."

[Editor's Note: This is an outstanding article                      -- well worth reading in its entirety -- which provides compelling                      evidence that the Stuxnet virus was a leading cause for the                      incapacitation of the Fukushima reactors. The following extract                      is also listed in the waynemadsenreport.com March                      24-25, 2011 -- OFF-TOPIC DAILY CHAT Blog ]
"Let’s                        review the facts as we now know them. First, we know Japan’s                        air and water have been directly affected by the radiation                        fallout from the Dai’Ichi nuclear power plant. We                        know both of the Dai’Ichi and Diani power plants were                        physically hit with the same level of water from the tsunami                        and the velocity of the earthquake. We know the diesel fueled                        back-up generators had a back-up battery system as well,                        but we’ve heard no report on the latter’s failure                        or success. We know the Diani plant had problems in the                        first two to three days, but secured the plant reporting                        no events since March 13, 2011. We know the Dai’Ichi                        power plant has seen a nuclear related event many times                        a day over a 12 day period. We know the Japanese government                        went into “secrecy” mode on or around March                        12, 2011. We know the US sent CIA experts into Japan on                        or around March 12, 2011, rather than nuclear/energy emergency                        experts. We know the US and Israel created a worm called                        Stuxnet which infected 63 Japanese computers by October                        5, 2010, and those are the ones we know of. We know the                        Stuxnet Virus has infected hundreds if not thousands of                        other computers in dozens of other countries culminating                        in untold damages. We know the US government gave the Japanese                        government an “ominous private warning” on Tuesday,                        March 15 14, 2011, a full four days after the original event,                        that the workers will die if the US wasn’t allowed                        allowed immediate access to emergency operations. And we                        know, the individual who was tasked to tell the 60 Minutes                        viewers about the “ominous private warning” spent her entire career in intelligence services, served                        the Director of National Intelligence as the Chief lobbyist                        on Capitol Hill and is sponsored by Hitachi Ltd.
The                        facts are the facts. Trying to spin them through misdirection                        or misinformation is a telltale sign of one’s complicity.                        There is no question the Stuxnet virus infected the Dai’Ichi                        plant and to believe otherwise is sheer folly. There is                        no question those plant workers will die, because of their                        heroic measures to save their country and you and me. There                        is no question parts of Japan will become a wasteland for                        century’s to come. There is no question others will                        die due to the fallout. There is no question the nuclear                        energy lobby will pay dearly for generations to come."
2011-03-21 Japan's                      Nuclear Crisis, Stuxnet and SCADA Defenses by                      Anthony M. Freed, infosecisland.com
"...I                      asked Richard Stiennon if he could provide some insight on                      this hypothetical scenario. Richard is the Chief Research                      Analyst and founder of IT-Harvest, an independent analyst                      firm that focuses on IT and network security....Stiennon confirms                      that a Stuxnet-type attack could theoretically cause reactor                      core cooling systems to be disrupted:
"Stuxnet targeted high speed                        rotating machinery controls, most probably the Uranium enrichment                        centrifuges in Iran. Both electricity generators and water                        pumps are examples of rotating machinery that are also controlled                        in industrial systems by PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).                        Communications with industrial control systems, often via                        SCADA, can be a vector for attack, or as in the case of                        Stuxnet, malware can be introduced directly by a bad actor.                        It is not hard to extrapolate that designer-malware could                        target these systems with the intent to shut them down and                        cause at the very least the emergency shut down of a nuclear                        power plant, at the worst, release of a radioactive plume                        and the permanent disabling of the reactor - as has happened                        in Japan," Stiennon replied via email...
"...From                      what I understand of the current crisis in Japan, the problems                      at the nuclear facilities did not stem from the reactors themselves                      sustaining significant damaged in the earthquake.
Instead,                      the problem with the reactor cores over-heating was caused                      by a disruption to the power and water supplies that are needed                      for the cooling systems. The problem was compounded by the                      destruction of the backup generators for the cooling system                      pumps in the subsequent tsunami.
In                      the past, the majority of these systems are operated manually                      or by analog control systems like electro-mechanical relays, but that is changing.
A                      senior member of the technical staff at one of our nation's                      largest and most prestigious national research laboratories                      indicated that a significant number of the nuclear facilities                      in the U.S. have modernized the controls for those auxiliary                      systems, and are now employing Programmable Logic Controllers                      (PLCs).
According                      to the source, at least one facility specifically uses Siemens                      PLCs, the same type attacked by Stuxnet at Natanz in Iran..."
2011-03-18 Israeli                      firm which secured Japan nuclear plant says workers there                      'putting their lives on the line' Magna                      CEO says Japanese workers at nuclear plant 'projecting business                      as usual' but says it is 'unclear if they are healthy due                      to the high level of radiation at the reactor, which is life-threatening.' by Ora Coren, haaretz.com, states:
"...The                      CEO of the Israeli company that installed the security system                      at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant said Thursday that those workers who have elected to stay behind are "putting                      their lives on the line" to save Japan.
Magna                      BSP set up the security system about a year ago at the facility,                      which suffered extensive damage after the recent earthquake                      and tsunami, with particular concern over radiation leakage                      from the reactors at the site.
The                      system includes cameras and a warning system, enabling the                      facility's security staff to monitor anyone attempting to                      trespass onto the site or damage the perimeter fence. The                      security system was designed to guard the plant against any                      hostile elements seeking to seize radioactive material to                      use in a terrorist attack.
Among                      the 50 Japanese workers who have remained at Fukushima amid                      the unfolding crisis, in an effort to bring the facility under                      control, are two individuals who were in Israel about three                      weeks ago, where they underwent training to transfer the operation                      of the security system to the Japanese themselves..."
