6.6M Earthquake
The remaining occurrences of tsunamis happen in the Mediterranean Sea (15%), Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean (7%), Indian Ocean (6%), and finally the Black Sea (1%). Of all tsunamis, 83% are produced directly by earthquakes.
Landslides/rockslides (or icefalls) into water or landslides under the ocean surface can generate sufficient displacement of water to produce tsunamis as well.
One such rockfall occurred on July 9, 1958 in Lituya Bay, Alaska. An earthquake triggered a 40 million cubic yard rock fell at the head of the bay.
Due to the confines of the bay, the resulting tsunami wave reached a height of 1,720 feet (520 meters) on the opposite side of the inlet. Down the inlet itself, the initial wave reached a height of 600 feet (120 meter) moving toward the ocean at 100 mph (160 km/h).
This was not the only time this type of event occurred in this bay. There are at least four other instances of a landslide causing a tsunami in Lituya Bay (1936, 1900, 1874, 1854).
While the magnitude of the 1959 tsunami event has not been matched since it occurred over 50 years ago, 6% of all worldwide tsunamis are generated by earthquake induced landslides.
While also rare, volcanoes can produce devastating tsunamis. One of the most deadliest tsunami events was generated by the Krakatoa volcano eruption in 1883.
