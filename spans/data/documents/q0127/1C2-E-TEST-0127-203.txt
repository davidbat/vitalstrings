First, Terry –
I seek to ‘convert’ no one. Think for yourself, but do not presuppose under the agies of bias what is a ‘science,’ and what is not. No one is qualified to take the term of ‘Science’ and define it so as to keep it only for themselves.
Those who do this deserve no respect, for Science is larger than any single person, group or organization. Ideology has no place in science. Anyone who claims to use the term ‘science’ to exclude that which they are ignorant of, or show bias toward, are not in practice of ‘science’ in the least – but only practices ignorance.
Science is about exploration and discovery. We learn by observation, study, objectivity. We do not learn simply inside the man-made lab, for you live in the largest laboratory there is – that of the Earth and the universe.
We call it ‘Nature.” It is here that you will find the answers to your questions.
As for Casual forces –
Astrological observations over the centuries based on celestial configurations and their correlations on life are earth are extensive. There are centuries-old texts of empirical data. You can easily find them online.
Here, you will find one of Isaac Newton’s mundane astrological science notebooks ->
http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00001
You are incorrect to say that the ‘past’ of science is not valid, that only today is valid.
You are in serious error, for without the past efforts of others – the scientific disciplines people take for granted today would not exist.
The mistake many conventional thinkers make on astrology is that they bring up the distance of celestial bodies and gravity when no one says that astrological forces are based on gravity and distance alone. There are many influences on the Earth, the primary one are solar, then lunar, then planetary.
The Earth is NOT a single body apart from the solar system. The Earth is a member of the solar system, surrounded by magnetic and kinetic forces.
Moreover, you are in error when you use small numbers and percentages to determine effect as any physicist knows that the smallest causes can, and do bring about big effects.
The mundane astrologer Isaac Newton’s synthesis of the unification of celestial and terrestrial physics concludes that “the power of gravity … was not limited to a certain distance from the earth but that this power must extend much farther than was usually thought.”
From Newton’s Notebooks –
Systema Mundanum secundum Copernicum.
Make a circumference for the Zodiack divide it into 12 signes or {illeg} Place Sun symbol in the centre. Make the centre of the earth almost 4 of Sun symbols diametars from his centre towards the Earth Aphelion i.e. {two} degrees 2m 13sec towards Cancer’s 7th degree.
Make its orbe or circumference so wide as that the Sun’s diameter may be the 697th parte of it i.e. 31.min: Divide it into 365 equal p{arts} & let each parte stand for the Earth motion in one day 1 minute. or thus: Make the Earth symbol centre one degre 1min 6sec from the Sun’s.
Make the circumference as before: take a new center two degrees 2min 13sec from Sun symbol on the same side. make a circumference about it & divide it into 365 parts, drawing lines from each opposite marke through the same centre.
Then marke the places {on} the sphære of Earth symbol which those lines cut. & you have the Earths motion each day, & 1 min Make Mercuries centre 4degr 55min towar{ds} his Aphelion from the Sunn, Sun symbol being in Virgo symbol {illeg} i.e. Earth symbol being in Pisces symbol 15d.
Put the Earth in Aries symbol: {illeg} the centre of Mercury symbol is in Pisces symbol 25d: 6m; & the utmost parte of his sphære reacheth to the 7th d{eg} 11th min of Pisces symbol it being 22degr: 50m distant from his centre.
Divide it as you did the Earth’s  in 88 parts by a circle whose centre is 9degr: 10m from Sun symbol toward his Aphelion (call this a divideing circle each part Mercury symbol passeth over in 23h. 59m.
Or thus. Make Sun symbol the centre of his circumference. make his circumference so large as {illeg}{illeg}. make him an Epicicle the diameter {be}ing 9 degres 50m.
Mercury symbol moves about his Epicicle {illeg} {illeg} 44 days {epicle} about Sun symbol in almost 88 days therefore {di}vide  that circles into 88 parts & you have {his} motion each 23h 59min. divide his epicicle {in}to 44 parts & you have the like. but this will not solve the Phænomenon unles he be made to stand still in his Epicicle towards his Aphelion. & then the swiftnes of his motion in his Perihelion, & slownes Aphelion will not be solved.
Place Venus her centre about 20 or 30 min dist from the centre of Sun symbol. her diameter is  42deg  from her centre. &c By a Degre I understand the 360th {parte} of the sphære or circumference of the earth.
Place the Moon 2deg 21min in her full & change from the earth.
Place the centre of Mars distant from Sun symbol 6d 46min towards Virgo 0d. 8′. 2” let his circumference be made 98deg distant from his centre. Marke a new centre 13degr: 32m: distant from Sun symbol towards his Aphelion in Virgine 0d. 8′. 2”. & let the circumference of it divide the Spæ{re} of Mars symbol into 687 parts each parte being the sp{hære}{illeg} of Mars symbol his motion in a day.
From another of Newton’s own notebooks –

The observation of celestial inclinations (astrophysical) to those on Earth (geophysical) connected physical events with mathematics, angles, light, sound (music of the spheres) electromagnetism and gravity. These are the kinds of calculations I apply in forecasting via astrological means.
This is clearly seen in the works of the mundane astrologers Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, among others. This reached its fuller expression in Newton’s dynamics.
The Universal Gravitation Law & The Planetary Laws Of Motions discovered by these astrologers, along with the three laws of motion and the calculus, formed a complete Newtonian approach to quantifying and calculating the motion, inclinations and effects of everything from the smallest atom to the largest planet. Telsa and Einstein based their work on all this and took it yet to another level.
So let’s not diss the ‘past of science’ – astrological or not – so easily, shall we?
