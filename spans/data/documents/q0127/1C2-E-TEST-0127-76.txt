1999 Izmit, Turkey Earthquake
Kevin Mulligan, director of the center, said the map was developed today following a lack of new information presented on major news outlets. The map connects to near-real-time remote feeds from the United States Geological Survey's Earthquake Hazards Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Tsunami Warning Center.
"This map is a dynamic map surface that shows the distribution of recent earthquakes from a USGS live remote feed," Mulligan said.
"It provides map information, satellite imagery and location of recent earthquakes. As part of this major earthquake, there are hundreds of aftershocks that follow."
