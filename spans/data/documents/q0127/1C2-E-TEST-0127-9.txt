On March 11 at 2:46pm JST a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred near the               northeastern coast of Japan, creating extremely destructive tsunami waves which hit               Japan just minutes after the earthquake, and triggering evacuations and warnings               across the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake and tsunami have caused extensive and severe               damage in Northeastern Japan, leaving thousands of people confirmed dead, injured or               missing, and millions more affected by lack of electricity, water and transportation.
