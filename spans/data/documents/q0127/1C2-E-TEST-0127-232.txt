Our Strategy for Japan Disaster Response
Give2Asia is taking a local perspective on the Japan disaster, working to empower the affected communities and those whose communities have been destroyed. Give2Asia is funding local Japanese nonprofits, NGOs, professional associations (e.g. chambers of commerce; associations of lawyers, nurses, and other professionals), social enterprises and entrepreneurs addressing long-term recovery needs.Give2Asia funds projects that meet one or more of the following criteria:
Innovative ideas that require seed funding in order to demonstrate proof of concept, scale to serve more survivors, or graduate to public or corporate funding
Projects that effectively empower and enable survivors to rebuild their lives and livelihoods
Information sharing and networking initiatives that have the potential to strengthen and amplify recovery efforts
Creative solutions that overcome problems of coordination and information gaps to enable more efficient and effective recovery and rebuilding
Services that meet a specific need not currently being addressed by other major benefactors due to the scope of the disaster and allocation of resources for other needs
