Take a look at some of these recent images I gathered. Japan really needs the prayers of everyone right now. Images below show various people upset over the devastation, lost loved ones, having no food or shelter, etc. Think about the men working at the nuclear power plant who will lose their lives. We are a world away from Japan but the Earthquake victims still need our prayers. Please take time to pray for all of them.
