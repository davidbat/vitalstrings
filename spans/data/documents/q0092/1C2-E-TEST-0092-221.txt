Hawaii Career Opportunities
As you might imagine careers in Tourism & Travel Management, Resort Management and Hospitality Management are plentiful in the Aloha State, and both the top universities and career colleges like the Travel Institute of the Pacific can prepare you for a successful career. However, you can find other opportunities on the islands after attending one of the Hawaii colleges, too. If you don’t let the miles of brilliant beaches distract you from studying, dedicated entrepreneurs can take advantage of Hawaii’s booming travel market as well from running a beachside adventure tour company to developing a luxury hotel and spa. Consider a degree in General Business to get you started. If supporting another's  business is more your style, try an Advertising or Accounting & Related Services degree. Careers in Skilled Trades such as Welding Technology/Welder are also growing on the islands. Several technical schools and career colleges in Hawaii can prepare you to work in the field. And with the Pacific Ocean surrounding the state, careers involving the marine industry are smart to pursue. Ship engineers, marine oilers, marine engineers, naval architects and even motorboat operators are in demand.
