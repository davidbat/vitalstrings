Pros
Tuition waivers and discounts are very good for those that wish to further their education while employed at HPU.  The mix of students that attend HPU is very diverse, and meeting people from all over the world was fun and informative.
Cons
Lower-level staff employees are "pigeon-holed" into similar roles.  Promotions and advancement are extremely rare, and it not for lack of available positions.  At such a small institution, you would think that communication and follow-through would be easier and more important.  There were several instances where people applied for other positions, and never heard back - not even a "thanks-but-no-thanks" email.
Advice to Senior Management
The president of HPU is set to retire soon, so perhaps this would be a good time to introduce some changes in their structure.
