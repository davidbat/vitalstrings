E ʻImi Pono: "To Seek Excellence"
Welina Mai!
Hawaiʻi Community College embraces the concept of Kauhale that traditionally means the Hawaiian village. Kauhale is an ʻohana of administrators, faculty, staff, students, their families, and the Hawaiʻi Island community that contributes measurably to the success of our college's mission and outcomes. Kauhale maximizes the "community" in our mission through dialogue, planning, innovation, and assessment across traditional college divisions and units. Kauhale enables all members of the college ʻohana to recognize and celebrate our own individual skills, knowledge, and experiences as well as the skills, knowledge, and experiences of others. Kauhale unites all components of Hawaiʻi Community College into   an "academic village without walls" for the overall success of our learners, the  learners' communities and their families, in the spirit of E 'Imi Pono (seeking excellence).
