Join us on Thursday, July 12th from 4-5 p.m. EDT for our #OnMyWay Twitter Chat!
Grades and test scores aren’t all it takes to get accepted to your dream school, so we’ll put you in the shoes of an admission counselor and discuss how to build your résumé to showcase your passion and stand out from the crowd.
