Answer
If you continue to work hard and bring your grades up, you may have a chance to get into one of the two schools in Hawaii.  If not, you can always go to a community college or another school in Pennsylvania, make the best grades you can in core classes and then try and transfer after a year.  Schools then will be much more interested in how successful you are in college level classes and your high school grades will be far less important.
