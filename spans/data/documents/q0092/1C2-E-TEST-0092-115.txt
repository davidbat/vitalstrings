I am being charged for the Spring housing costs, when they have found someone to take my space after I left. Basically, they are charging both me and this other girl for the same space!
If you rented a place anywhere else you'd sign a year lease and owe the balance if you left early.  Colleges only rent rooms two times a year and they need to enforce the lease; they can't waive it for you and then enforce it for the next student.
