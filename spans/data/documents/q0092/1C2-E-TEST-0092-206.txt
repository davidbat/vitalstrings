The  health and welfare of humans residing in the coastal zone and on small islands  are inextricably linked to the ocean environment. During the past 25 years, a  dramatic global resurgence of water-borne diseases and harmful algal blooms has  occurred, particularly in the tropical Asia-Pacific region. At the same time,  the diversity and abundance of novel compounds produced by marine organisms with  potential utility as therapeutic agents or pharmacological probes in biomedicine  have become increasingly apparent. In response to the urgent regional need to  more effectively prevent water-borne diseases and control harmful algal blooms,  as well as in response to our unique island setting and strategic geographic location  to mine the virtually untapped ocean environment, the Pacific Research Center  for Marine Biomedicine (PRCMB) has been established. PRCMB is one of four Centers  on Ocean and Human Health (COHH), a program funded by the National Science Foundation  and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
