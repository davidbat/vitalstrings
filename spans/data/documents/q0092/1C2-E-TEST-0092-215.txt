Hirono turns down Hawaii Pacific University debate
The Associated Press
U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono has declined an offer for a substitute debate at Hawaii Pacific University.
The university extended an invitation to Hawaii's two Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate after a forum scheduled for Thursday had been postponed.
Former U.S. Rep. Ed Case challenged Hirono to a debate anyway and accepted the university's offer.
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser ( http://bit.ly/KIVkop) reports Hirono Deputy Campaign Manager for Communications Carolyn Tanaka says Hirono previously announced participating in five debates, including the rescheduling of the Oahu County Democrats forum.
Oahu Democrats postponed indefinitely the joint forum, which was going to be the first of five debates before the primary election in August.
