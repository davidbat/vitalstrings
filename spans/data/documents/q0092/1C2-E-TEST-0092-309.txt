Welcome to our new APC website!
Asia-Pacific College (APC) is a new institution with a sharp focus on a single goal: to create globally aware and well-informed leaders who will guide the Asia-Pacific region through the challenges it inevitably faces in the 21st century.
Here you will find information about our new programs designed to create these leaders. All courses are offered entirely online during Summer, Fall, and Spring semesters, and require students to read a variety of materials, write reaction papers, and participate in online group forums with the instructors and other participants. Our instructors will prepare you to lead by helping you understand the evolving economic, environmental, political, and socio-cultural changes of the Asia-Pacific region.
With several program choices, APC can accommodate the busy schedules of full-time professionals.
