Women of Federated   States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands who come to   Hawaii to Give Birth
Community Health Centers in Hawai’i   report a rising number of women coming to give birth in Hawaii. Most of   these women enter into prenatal care late, often in their last trimester.   Infant mortality rates in FSM and RMI are greater than that of the State of   Hawai’i.  Perceptions of birth outcomes in FSM and RMI were collected   from patients seeking prenatal care in a community health center in Hawaii.   Prenatal care and birth outcome data from FSM, RMI and Hawaii were collected   and analyzed. FSM and RMI comprise of many islands with diverse culture,   language, and beliefs. This study explores differences in birth outcomes and   prenatal care services received by Pacific Islanders in FSM, RMI and   Hawai’i.  Pregnant women perceive prenatal care in Hawaii is superior   to care in FSM and RMI. A significant difference between FSM, RMI and   Hawai’i prenatal care services was that Hawaii provided comprehensive   screening and treatment for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) during   pregnancy. Barriers prevented STD screening and treatment in FSM and RMI   prenatal care services, which may have contributed to higher infant   mortality rates.
