Introduction
I chose Hawaii Pacific University because I wanted to go somewhere warm and because I thought that it would be good to get away from home for a while while I was still young.  :)
Campus Life and Social Life
There are some events on campus but it is not a huge on campus party scene. Most students go out in Honolulu or Waikiki. Clubs on campus are fun and there is a wide variety like Surf club, Hiking Club, to student government and academic clubs, etc.

Academics
Really good professors overall, they listen to the students and have open office hours. No TAs. You have to go to class, and dont be late to class because some of the professors lock the doors when class starts. Good Communication dept., Marine Bio, International Relations, Travel Industry Mgmt.   The shuttle between campuses needs to be improved, they use 15 passenger vans and should have real shuttles that hold more people.
Student Body
Weekends are fun, most students are from out of state so they all hang out together and its easy to make new freinds. There is free movies on the beach in Waikiki, parades, hiking, camping, water sports.
In Closing...
Hawaii is great if you are laid back and open to new things. Respect the local culture and you will be fine in Hawaii!
