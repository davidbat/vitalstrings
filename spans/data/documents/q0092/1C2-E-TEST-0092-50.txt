Am learning a lot
The foreign language and business classes here are taught really well and the students actually learn applicable material. The small class sizes allow for a lot of focus on areas specific to the individual students.
Am enjoying being here
The school is beautiful and the people are all really nice. There are people from all over the world, and every day something new is going on.
Bang for the buck
For a private college, this school comes at a great price. There are a lot of scholarships. The classes are interesting and the professors try hard.
Tips for prospective students
Just make sure you keep up with the work load from the beginning. Do not schedule any classes before 9. Also, live in the off-campus housing, it is much cheaper and closer to more activities.
Great for these types of students
People who can balance having fun and working hard.
