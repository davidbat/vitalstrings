Our                              Look
There is no doubt that the World Wide Web is the              most quickly evolving medium in the world today. Our site is no              exception. This is the second generation of HPU Bookstore Online. We              hope this new design makes it easier for you to navigate the site              and take full advantage of the book store from your computer.
Textbooks
All textbooks that are required or recommended              for a course will be listed as in stock.  However, depending on              the timing of your order, we may not have the book in stock.  If the book is out of stock we will contact you immediately with the              estimated due date and will place your order on backorder.  Your order will be processed as soon as the book arrives.  You              can cancel your backorder by calling us at 808-544-0290 or by              e-mailing us at bookstore@hpu.edu .
While we will try our best to fulfill your              textbook order in the condition requested, we may have to substitute              if the requested condition is unavailable.  If such a              substitution is made, you will be charged accordingly.  In              other words, if you order a used copy of a text but only new copies              are available, we will ship you a new copy and charge you the new              price.  If you do not wish us to substitute the condition, you              can notate "NO SUBSTITUTIONS" in the shipping instructions when you              process your order.
