The mission of PEACESAT is to facilitate “development” and “public service” communications.
"Development            communications" is the use of ICT to assist in the institution            and capacity building of an organization, community, state, or nation.
"Public              service telecommunications" is the use of ICT for the purposes               of education; public awareness and participation; research; economic                         development; health, medical services, and welfare; and emergency management               by government, education, health, and other non-profit organizations.
PEACESAT works collaboratively with partners in the          region to achieve its mission. Initially the PEACESAT network was based          solely on satellite telecommunications and now includes public and private          fiber, copper, and microwave network technologies.
