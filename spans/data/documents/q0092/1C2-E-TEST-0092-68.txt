Campuses
The main HPU campus as I stated above in downtown Honolulu, spread out along Fort Street Mall and Bishop Street. Like most urban University campuses, there is very little to identify the campus as a place of higher learning, other then the large gaggle of younger people hanging about the mall with various books, book-bags, walkman, and laptops. The campus is very inconspicuous and blends in well with the rest of downtown.  The campus is surrounded by the sights, smells and hustles of Honolulu, and as such is surrounded by high rise business and apartment buildings that make up the heart of the islands largest city.
First Hawaiian Bank, and Bank of Hawaii headquarters buildings are both within easy walking distance from the campus, if memory serves, and the state capitol building, Lolani Palace, Aloha Tower Marketplace, and Restaurant Row are also close by.  The beaches, clubs, and nightlife of the Waikiki tourist district is a short bus ride from the campus.  And if one is lucky enough to own a car, the island is full of wonders; snorkeling, scuba diving, whale watching, hang gliding, sailing, hiking, cycling, eating, and just hanging out at one of the myriad of beaches on Oahu await the book weary student.
HPU&#146s other campus, Hawaii Loa, on the windward side of the island, offers the student a completely different experience.  Situated near Kaneohe, beneath the immense and breathtaking Pali cliffs, along Oahu&#146s eastern mountain range, the Hawaii Loa campus offers the student a serene environment in which to learn.  A free shuttle runs between the two campuses every fifteen minutes, so that students living in the co-ed dorms here can easily take classes at the main campus.  The sheer beauty of the Hawaii Loa campus will steal your breath; the campus is the most verdant in terms of vegetation I have ever visited.  Because of the abundance of vegetation it can get humid during the day, but not overly hot.  And be forewarned, like most buildings in Hawaii, the dorms do not have central air-conditioning. As I stated above, the Hawaii Loa campus is the site of the Nursing, Marine Biology, Oceanography, and Environmental Science programs, and several liberal arts programs.
My HPU Experience
I had rare occasion to visit the main downtown campus, and only visited the Hawaii Loa campus once.  All of my course work was completed either at one of the military campuses, and sine the island of Oahu is not that large, traveling from campus to campus was not a chore.  The bulk of my course work was completed at the Pearl Harbor campuses right across the street from where I worked on the Submarine Base.
The course work was challenging but not overly so; I was able to maintain an A- average while attending the school for some three years.  I usually only took two course per semester; one during the week, and another on the weekend.  Hey I was in Hawaii; I had to find time to live the Hawaii experience; scuba diving, hiking, and clubbing were my recreational pastimes.  In the early nineties when I attended the school, the Internet was just taking hold in the public arena, so there were not on-line courses, but today of course HPU offers a plethora of coursework online via it Distance Learning Program.
I left Hawaii in late 1994, three credits shy of my Associates.  I was not able to make up the course I was missing until I enrolled in DePaul University in 2001. After I completed the required course&#151Algebra yuck&#151I was able to apply it to my HPU coursework via their Distance Learning Program.  I finally graduated in August 2001 with an Associates degree in Supervisory Leadership, some 10 years after I started!

Conclusion
I enjoyed my learning experience at HPU.  Because of HPU&#146s pioneering Military Campus Program I was able to attend college while pursuing my on-going military career and in the end I obtained an Associates Degree, which in turn was a stepping stone to my later Bachelor&#146s degree, and post-graduate studies.
Now that I am an Alumnus, I continue to enjoy the Hawaii Pacific University (www.hpu.org) experience through frequent newsletters offering news on the latest at the university.  I am proud to have attended and I would highly recommend the school to anyone trying to choose which school to attend in Hawaii.
