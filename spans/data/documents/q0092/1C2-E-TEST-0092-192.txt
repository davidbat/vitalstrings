I am currently attending HPU and I am not going to lie I was apprehensive at first. I am from New England and there are obviously a lot of prestigious schools there. I am a A/B student and I got into many New England schools including the University of New Hampshire and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Science. I am a pre-med student (Biology & Human Health Science). I am a surfer, which was one of the reasons I was drawn to Hawaii. I visited both schools (HPU an UHM) and liked both of them However, what really drew me to HPU, and what I am still happy with now, is the small class sizes and the relationships with my professors. I do not have class that has more than 20 students in it. HPU also stresses the importance of the "Global Citizen,"which I feel is a a very important trait to have in the current state of this country and the world as a whole. If you want to try something new, become more well rounded academically and culturally, go to HPU. If you want to party, go to football games, and don't really care about your relationship with your professors then go to UH. I am not saying that either school is better than the other, I am just saying they are different. A college eduction is what you make of it, and I decided that I would spend my four years in paradise at a unique and culturally oriented university. This is why I chose HPU. Don't be apprehensive, it is a good experience whether you stay all four years or not. But challenge yourself, raise yourself among your peers and do something different! Oh ya, and get a great education, too.
