Research interests 
Human mobility; generational change and islander identities;     indigenous epistemologies; field methods; Melanesia
I am interested in population movements in the third world, generational     change in rural populations, mobility and identity, and field methods, with     a regional focus on the island Pacific, especially Melanesia. In the early     1990's, I returned to Solomon Islands and worked for the third time in twenty-eight     years with the Guadalcanal communities who formed the basis of my doctoral     dissertation. The aims of this research were both applied and basic. Applied,     because the Solomons' need for information for socioeconomic planning, meant     collecting details about population structure and dynamics for comparison     with previous field data. The intellectual concern was with local epistemologies     of movement as indicating structures of knowledge that have evolved independent     of the Western intellectual tradition and might well inform its blinkeredness.

Working with graduate students
Over the years, including in theoretical retirement since August 2001, my     primary advising in doctoral studies has been with midcareer Asian professionals     and in masters'     work     with persons     from     not      only Asian     countries but also Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, and United States.  Dissertation     topics have included an insider and humanistic perspective on movement in     a Nepali village, and the resource links between an urban housing estate     and rural communities in Java. Theses have ranged from Filipino movements     seen in terms of social networks reaching across national boundaries, to     household mobility in a Pacific atoll environment as collective strategy     for survival. All this student research has been informed by the goal to     develop theory grounded in the social reality of the Asia-Pacific world.     Such an approach to graduate study means taking the long- term view but,     as a result, much student research has appeared in monographs and as published     papers in professional journals (eg: Asia Pacific Population Journal 2001;     Asia Pacific Viewpoint 1999; International Migration Review 1995; Asian and     Pacific Migration Journal 1993; Tjidschrift     voor Economische     en     Sociale Geografie 1991).
