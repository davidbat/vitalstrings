I knew a girl from PA that go into their undergrad program pretty easily.  I don't think it is a difficult school at all, but I dont know much about their graduate school.  I've been to the campus several times and its very......eh.  Like 5 buildings it seems and its really in the middle of nowhere.  It took us a long time to drive there from waikiki beach.  Univ of hawaii is much closer to the action, however HPU has great scenery.  It's like you're in the jungle.
