Our department at the                          University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) was established in            1992. The Department of Family Medicine            and Community Health (DFMCH) set a goal            of having both a required third year FP            clerkship and the only civilian Family            Medicine residency in the state by 1994.            It was accomplished in July of that            year.  There are many community            faculty that provide teaching sites for            our medical students.  The            Physician Center at Mililani and Wahiawa            General Hospital are the primary            residency teaching sites. The department Interim            chair is Allen Hixon, MD, MPH.
