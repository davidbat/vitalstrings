I attended Hawaii Pacific University for three years I enjoyed the small classes and the availability of my teachers.Hawaii's relaxed atmosphere took some getting use to but it was worth it, you can't beat quality education and a positive enviornment. Anyone who doesn't mind the distance from the main land should apply today.
