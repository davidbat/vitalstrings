ScholarSpace Spotlight
National Foreign Language Resource Center - Drawing on institutional strengths at the University of Hawai`i in foreign language teaching, applied linguistics, and second language acquisition, the NFLRC undertakes projects that focus primarily on the less commonly taught languages of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. However, many of its projects have implications for the teaching and learning of all languages, and the overriding goal of all projects is to develop prototypes that can be applied broadly as resources to improve foreign language education nationally.
