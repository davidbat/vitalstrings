I have actually benefited for over 30 years from having a degree from a prominent university. Deservedly or not. And my degree is in a subject far-removed from my career focus. Dropping the name of a top-tier school opens doors and tends to anneal an image in some people's minds. (Often prospective employers or clients.)
As alluring as going to school in Hawaii might be, I still recommend that people attend the very best school they can get into in their area of interest. If they don't know what they want to major in, I still recommend they select the best school for the kinds of programs they tend to like.
There are very few "all-purpose" universities in the US. Fewer that are worth their salt. If you're going to school because you're serious about learning or pursuing a discipline, aim for the top. If you just want a degree, take what you want, but be prepared to run with the pack.
Best of luck.
