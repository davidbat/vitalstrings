Statement
My research has focused on the cultural histories of human-plant                interactions with special emphasis on the pan-global, traditional                use of psychoactive species. I also study the human impact on native                vegetation in tropical island ecosystems, both past and present,                with a general interest in the natural history of Remote Oceania.                My most important career object has been to contribute to and foster                environmental education and preservation of traditional ecological                and ethnobotanical knowledge.
