We are located within the College of Business Administation , on the campus of the University of Hawai`i at Manoa , in Honolulu, Hawai`i and our reach encompasses the entire Pacific region.
Utilizing the faculty and other resources of the University, we provide diverse management and technical assistance to our clients from Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Islands who are starting up, revitalizing or expanding small and large businesses.
PBCP is part of the University Economic Development Association (UEDA), formerly NAMTAC. UEDA provides resources to enhance the performance of university-based organizations and their affiliates providing economic development, business and technical assistance to businesses and communities.
