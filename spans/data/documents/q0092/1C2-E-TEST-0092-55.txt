Located              in the heart of the Pacific Rim on the island of Oahu, Hawaii Pacific              University (HPU) is an institution like no other. To begin with, nearly              30% of the 8,800 person student body at Hawaii Pacific is international              representing more than 100 countries. Add to this mix students from              all 50 United States and you have one of the most diverse universities              in the world. The educational experience at HPU, which builds upon              this international diversity by combining American educational traditions              with global perspectives, stresses rigorous intellectual engagement,              relevant career education, and social responsibility.
Because Hawaii Pacific is a private institution, you will have the              benefit of learning in small classes from professors and lecturers              whose job it is to teach – there are no TA’s in the classroom.              HPU also benefits from having two campuses, linked together by a free              shuttle, providing you with the option of attending the urban campus              in downtown Honolulu, or taking classes at the Hawaii Loa campus,              located on 135 lush, tropical acres on the Windward side of Oahu,              just 15 minutes away.
Of course, HPU has all that you would expect in a modern university              (and some things that you might not expect):
Accreditation by WASC, the Western Association of Schools and                  Colleges;
Academic                  programs in a variety of disciplines including Liberal Arts, Business                  Administration, Communication, Natural Sciences, International                  Studies and Nursing.
Computer, library, tutoring, laboratory and classroom facilities                  as well-equipped as any you will find;
A                  student to faculty ration of 18:1, an average class size of 25,                  and no class larger than 45;
A support staff of academic advisors, counselors and student service                  personnel to assist you with your studies;
Technologically                  advanced systems including wireless internet access on both campuses
Student life that rivals any university with more than 70 student                  clubs and organizations ranging from the Student Government to                  the Debate Club to the Surfing Club.
Sound              inviting? We think that there is no better place to challenge yourself              intellectually and culturally, even when you consider that you are              still in within the “comfy” borders of the United States.
