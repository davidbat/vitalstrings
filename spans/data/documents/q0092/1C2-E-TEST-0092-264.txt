The College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature is one of the four Arts and Sciences colleges of the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa. LLL (as it is popularly called) offers a broad curriculum in English studies, foreign and heritage languages, second language acquisition, and linguistics. Composed of six departments and several programs and centers, LLL has capitalized on Hawai‘i's location in the Pacific to provide, in addition to traditional fields of study, curricula with a focus on Asia and the Pacific unique in the nation. The College regularly teaches 25 languages, mostly Asian and Indo-Pacific, and has the capacity to teach 50 more according to demand. The programs in the College offer a full range of degrees, from the BA, to the MA, and the PhD.
Our faculty has long been recognized for its commitment to innovative research in language and literature, and for the excellence of its teaching, with an emphasis on small classes (averaging 20 students) and close interaction between teacher and student.
