Applicable to applicants from Hawaii only
 
Pacific University has a long standing history with students  from Hawaii and would like to extend that relationship to our School of  Physician Assistant Studies. We are committed to addressing the Physician  Assistant workforce issues in Hawaii.
The Hawaii Outreach Program is both an admissions advantage  as well as a clinical rotation advantage. If an applicant meets all minimum  criteria required by the School of Physician Assistant Studies, they will be  granted an on campus interview. While this does not guarantee admission, it is  an acknowledgment of our dedication to Hawaiian students and their needs.
If students from Hawaii are admitted to the program they  will complete their didactic year in Hillsboro, Oregon with the rest of the  incoming class. Students in the Hawaii Outreach Program may be able to complete  the majority of their rotations in Hawaii. Pacific University continually seeks  out rotation sites in Hawaii which will provide students with quality  experiences and networking opportunities.
There is no separate application for the Hawaii Outreach  Program. Students are initially identified through their Permanent Address,  Current Address, State Residency or State of Birth on their CASPA application and their stated commitment on the Supplemental  Application to return to Hawaii following graduation to work as a PA. Please  contact Graduate Admissions if you have any questions.
