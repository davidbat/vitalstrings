As all college students know, books can get expensive.  And when you're taking 21 credits ... that's even more expensive.  Although sometimes the bookstore is the only place that you can get that one particular book for that one particular class.  (Remember that you need the right edition and all that jazz).
However, there are good good things about the bookstore.  For one, they moved to a nicer venue.  Air conditioned and clean.  Way better than the BH location.  They also have a nice array of HPU gear.  Clothing, school supplies, Macs, USB drives ... all pretty reasonable.  I've never actually bought the clothing, but I did get my Mac Book Pro from here, and I've never been disappointed.
The workers are so nice, and they work really hard to make sure students get what they need.  i also like the fact that I can order my books online.  That's what I normally do.  Check http://bookfinder.com for books (if there are any) and whatever I can't find, I order.  They send emails regarding your pickup promptly, and my books are always ready to go.
