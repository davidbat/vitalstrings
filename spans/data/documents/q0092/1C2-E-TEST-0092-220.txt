Professors at Colorado State University and the University of Northern Colorado are developing a drug that can stop replication of West Nile, dengue and yellow fever viruses that continue to plague two-thirds of the world’s population with no clinically useful antiviral drugs available.
Their research appears this week online in the peer-reviewed Journal of Virology.
West Nile and dengue fever are vector-borne viral diseases – pathogens that can be transferred from an insect to a human – in a family of viruses known as the flaviviruses. The National Institutes of Health considers a number of flaviviruses priority pathogens because they cause life-threatening illness with few drugs or vaccines available and have the potential to be used as biological weapons. More than two billion people are at risk globally of infection by dengue virus, and West Nile virus is endemic in 47 of the 48 lower United States. Dengue virus has re-emerged in southern Florida and Hawaii over the past few years. Worldwide, as many as 50 million dengue infections occur each yearcausing roughly 20,000 to 30,000 deaths.
