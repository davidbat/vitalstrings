The accreditation type can help narrow down your search. Accreditation types include:
Institutional: This includes all general accreditations for an entire college or university.
Internship/Residency: This includes any internships, residencies or similar programs specific to gaining experience in a hands-on role.
Specialized: This includes all special programs related to a specific topic or industry. Select this along with a category if you know a specific area you are already interested in.

Institutional
A few colleges, universities and programs are "pre-accredited," as opposed to fully "accredited." These institutions or programs usually have many important elements in place, but have not been around long enough or have not graduated enough students yet to qualify for full accreditation.
