HPU is one of the most culturally diverse universities in America with students from all 50 U.S. states and more than 100 countries. Founded in 1965, HPU prides itself on maintaining strong academic programs, small class sizes, individual attention to students, and a diverse faculty and student population. HPU offers more than 50 acclaimed undergraduate programs and 14 distinguished graduate programs.
Hawai'i Pacific University (HPU) is consistently ranked among the best institutions of high education in the nation. HPU is recognized as a "Best in the West" college by Princeton Review and the U.S. News and World Report, and a "Best Buy" by Barron's business magazine. Bloomberg Businessweek also rates HPU as the "Best Undergraduate Return on Investment" among any College or University in the state of Hawai'i, based on tuition costs and earnings of alumni.  HPU is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission, and the Council on Social Work Education, to name a few.
HPU is proud to offer more than 500 full and part-time faculty members with outstanding academic and business credentials from around the world. Faculty range from top-level executives at Fortune 500 companies, to state government leaders that enliven the learning experience with real-world knowledge. Our student-centered approach and low student-faculty ratio of 15:1 naturally results in personal attention and one-on-one guidance. HPU puts a priority on teaching. There are no student assistants; only highly qualified faculty teach each class. Even with 8,200 students our average class size is under 25. This means youÂ’ll enjoy all of the technological and academic resources expected at a large university, delivered within the atmosphere of a small school.
The diversity of HPU's student body stimulates learning about other cultures firsthand, both inside and outside of the classroom. Students are encouraged to examine the values, customs, traditions, and principles of others to gain a clearer understanding of their own perspectives. HPU students develop friendships with students from throughout the United States and the world; and form important connections for success in the global economy of the twenty-first century.
HPU has NCAA Division II intercollegiate sports. Men's athletic programs include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, and tennis. Women's athletics include basketball, cross-country, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. HPU's women's softball team as well as its cheerleading squad and dance team have received national championship titles.
The housing office at HPU offers many services and living options for students. Residence halls with cafeteria service are available on the windward Hawai'i Loa campus, while off-campus apartments are available in the Honolulu and Waikiki areas for those seeking more independent living arrangements.
