Welcome!
We are an international climate research center, with a focus on the Asia-Pacific region. We seek to understand the climate system and how it may respond to human activity by conducting experiments with computer simulation models and by analyzing the many direct and remote observations related to climate.
Our mission is to provide an international research environment dedicated to improving mankind’s understanding of the nature and predictability of climate variations and change in the Asia-Pacific region, and to developing innovative ways to utilize knowledge gained for the benefit of society.
Our Asia-Pacific Data-Research Center (APDRC) provides easy access to a wide variety of climate data and products and conducts research to improve data products.
