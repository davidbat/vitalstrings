Rat Lungworm Disease Scientific Workshop
Ala Moana Hotel, Honolulu, Hawaii
August 16-18, 2011
Dr. Robert Cowie , with colleagues from the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Hilo and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, organized this transdisciplinary international workshop. The workshop addressed all aspects of this important emerging infectious disease that is caused by a parasitic worm and which can cause coma and even death. Scientists and clinicians from China, Thailand, Taiwan, Brazil, Jamaica, the U.S. mainland and Hawaii covered everything from the biology and control of the snail and rat hosts of the parasite, detection of the parasite in the hosts, pathways via which people become infected and ways to reduce the chances of infection, to the epidemiology of the disease, its diagnosis and treatment.
