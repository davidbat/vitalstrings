Announcement of Closure
TransPacific Hawaii College (formerly Kansai Gaidai College) stopped educating students on December 18, 2008. The reason for the closure was that the college fell victim to the demographics currently in Japan. There are fewer Japanese students who are of college age and the students appear to have a preference for four year colleges as opposed to two year colleges. Even though TransPacific tried to recruit in other countries these recruitment efforts did not produced the desired number of students.
TransPacific could not exist without a critical number of students. The college did not have endowments like major universities and depended entirely on tuition for funding. Therefore, when the college lost students the funding decreased dramatically.
I do want to let you know that the college students continue to be successful. We have transferred a large percentage of our students to four year colleges and universities and they are successful in completing their Bachelors Degree. A recent study of students who transferred to University of Hawaii, Manoa from 2003-2005 showed that TransPacific students had a higher percentage of Bachelor Degree completion than other transfer students. The college continued to provide good quality education until the last class graduated in 2008-2009.
We want to let you know how you can obtain transcripts of your TransPacific or Kansai Gaidai work after we close
As of January 1, 2009, the Center for International Education at Kansai Gaidai University will handle transcript and graduation certificates for Kansai Gaidai Hawaii College and TransPacific Hawaii College.
