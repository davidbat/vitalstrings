and the Pacific
The School of Pacific and Asian Studies (SPAS), founded in 1986, is a strategic cornerstone to the mission of the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.
SPAS coordinates and promotes resources in Pacific and Asian Studies throughout UHM, supports faculty and student development, instruction, research and publication in these areas, and serves the educational and cultural interests of the people of the State of Hawai‘i by promoting a deeper understanding of our Pacific and Asian heritage.
SPAS is composed of 2 degree-granting units and 8 area centers. The area centers serve as a focal point for faculty throughout the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM) with interests in specific geographical areas, facilitating collaboration and interchange. Centers also provide outreach to the community, public schools and other organizations by sponsoring lectures and film screenings to the public, and providing unique resources to the education community.
