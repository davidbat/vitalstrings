Cappex is the company behind MeritAid.com.
We help students and colleges connect. In the past year, we've helped over 600 colleges make over two million connections with students! Cappex allows colleges to search anonymous student profiles to find the students they'd like to connect with. It makes the college admissions process easy by offering college search and lots of college resources , with detailed information on admissions, scholarships and financial aid.
Best of all, the students stay in control. Students review messages from colleges in their own "College Center" here on the site. The student chooses which colleges to share their contact information with, keeping their information hidden from the rest.
Cappex recently launched MeritAid.com, to help students learn about college options they might have otherwise assumed were out of their reach. Colleges are investing over $11 billion annually in merit aid and academic scholarships to attract and retain students, and we want to help them get the word out!
Shed some stress and gain some confidence. Cappex - College search made simple.
