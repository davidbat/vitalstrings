I would love any opinion about getting your nursing degree at Hawaii Pacific University.  I have been offered admission to HPU but before I invest three years of hard work and money I'd really like to know that I'm going to a good program.  If anyone is in the program or has graduated I would love their opinion about their experience.  Did HPU adequately provide you with good training as a nurse?  Were your professors good?  Was the program well organized and well run.  Did you feel like you learned a lot and was challenged by the program?  If you did it all over again would you go to HPU?  I would greatly appreciate any advice, experiences, insights, specifics about HPU's Nurisng Program.  Thanks!
