Martial arts and sex appeal are my two new favorite qualities in a woman, and beautiful newcomer Jennifer Garner has both. Jennifer, who's shown she has what it takes every week as the CIA agent Sydney Bristow on the ABC drama "Alias," is a blossoming actress in Hollywood that has the acting skills and the good looks needed to make it in the business.
Jennifer's love for acting drove her to enroll as a theater student at Denison University in  Ohio and, following graduation, left for New York to test her skills in the Broadway ring. After proving she had the right stuff, Jennifer quickly left for LA and appeared in guest spots on "Spin City," "Law and Order," and was the unfortunate victim of two failed TV dramas between 1998-2000.
After an extended guest star role on the J.J. Abram's WB drama "Felicity," where she met former husband Scott Foley, Jennifer was able to impress the creator so much that he chose her for his newest show, "Alias." Three years later, Jennifer is an accomplished television actress with a budding film career and a 2001 Golden Globe for Best Actress. With the charm and modesty of a 1950s movie star, we'll be sure to see Jennifer only get bigger and better in the future.
