 
overview
Award-winning actress Jennifer Garner was a budding ballerina when she discovered just how much she loved acting. After college (where she briefly studied chemistry), she moved to New York, where she supported herself part of the time as a hostess at a restaurant.
Luckily, she made the move to Los Angeles and was soon landing small roles in television and film.  She appeared in a few films before getting her break when she was cast in the lead role in a new J.J. Abrams produced spy drama for ABC called, “Alias.” Her success in the series led to other high-profile roles in action movies such as “Daredevil” and the title role in its spin-off, “Elektra.” She married former co-star Ben Affleck in 2005 and the two have two daughters together, Violet and Seraphina.
Recently, Garner has taken on romantic comedy roles in films like “13 Going on 30,” and more dramatic roles such as her acclaimed performance in the indie favorite, “Juno.”
