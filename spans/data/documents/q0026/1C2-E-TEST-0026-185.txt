Garner not slowing down on Alias set
Jennifer Garner’s co-star and former flame Michael Vartan discusses work and pregnancy on the Alias set: "It’s hard, it’s 14 hours a day, you know…I hope she takes some time off. She needs to really take care of herself because she’s such a workaholic. I can just see her working to the very last day saying, ‘No, I really want to do this.’"
Michael says that he is "very excited" about her pregnancy. "I think it’s fantastic…Very cool," but says that "the baby takes precedence over Alias…It’s a no-brainer."  He will also become a TV dad this season, when Jennifer’s character, Sydney, is pregnant by him on the show.
