Introduction
Celebrity           hair watchers everywhere have been thrilled with ABC TV’s Alias           (Sundays at 9 p.m. ET), the red-hot spy thriller that made its debut           in the Fall of 2001.  Jennifer           Garner, as CIA double agent Sydney Bristow, joins famous dark-haired           TV ass kickers Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) and Charisma Carpenter           (Angel) giving new meaning to brunette bombshell status.

The premise           behind the Alias action packed show is Sydney’s quick change status           from studious grad student to sizzling super-spy cloaked in a           never-ending stream of “aliases”.  As mild-mannered college girl, Garner appears regularly coiffed           in classic longish bob styles.  Her           shiny brunette locks are often worn tucked innocently behind one ear           with a hint of soft curl playing at the ends. 
When           Garner’s character slips undercover into her ever-changing spy           personas, each “alias” is instantly transformed into an           eye-popping array of different hairstyles and colors ranging from           short day-glow red to long platinum blonde. 
As           Garner punches and kicks her way to eventual safety, her tresses           remain amazingly unruffled. From thick Nordic braids to a beaded Vegas           cap for her Coup episode, Alias hairstylists, Susan Kelber and Michael           Gizcchiano are constantly thinking up new shades, accessories and           looks for the beautiful Garner as she averts global disaster and           travels on intercontinental missions.  (Photos           copyright ABC - ALIAS,  Craig Sjodin, The Coup, Jennifer Garner - all rights reserved.)
Series           insiders have reported that the set hairdressers have some hair           creation help in the form of a dizzying collection of wigs in all           shades and variations crafted specially for the Sydney Bristow           character. This fabulous wig wardrobe, reported to contain over 75           wigs and growing, guarantees Alias hair watchers that there will be an           ongoing supply of high-octane hair changes for the future. It also           helps keep her locks intact during those famous fight scenes.
Which begs the           question. Will the Alias hairstylists eventually run out of new           permutations of styles and colors?   Probably not.  Although           at some point the key hair colors may need to recycled, there are an           endless number of lengths, styles and accessories that Garner can           morph through as she fights evil. 
You           can be sure of one thing, while Alias writers are busy concocting           heart-stopping plot-lines, her hair consultants will be busy thinking           up matching hues and dos while leaving Jennifer’s natural brunette           locks alone.  Executive           producer J.J. Abrams wears two hats as producer of WB’s Felicity           staring Keri Russell and ABC’s Alias staring Garner.  For those out of the loop, Felicity suffered a major ratings           plummet when curly mopped Russell did a mop chop.  The use of wigs will save Abrams from repeating the Felicity           fiasco keeping both the ratings and Jennifer’s locks intact.  (Photos           copyright ABC - ALIAS,           Craig Sjodin, The Coup, Jennifer Garner - all rights reserved.)
Garner’s           beautiful dimpled oval face, soft eyes and gorgeous natural skin tone           offer her stylists a special advantage.  With her striking looks, Jennifer could look stunning in just           about any hair style or color. 
Although           many actresses suffer hair damage from constant hair changes,           Garner’s use of wigs happily eliminates this danger.  Garner was recently spared an on-set burnt hair incident when           Dana Hee, her stunt double’s hair caught on fire in an explosion           scene. Although Garner often does many of her own fight scenes, she           was lucky to avoid this particular hair scorching incident.
Off-screen,           Jennifer favors classic, yet sexy, all-American styles for her sleek  locks.  At the           recent 2002 Golden Globe Awards Jennifer looked simply elegant with           her shiny brunette tresses coiffed into a sleek Audrey Hepburnesque           bun. At the 2nd Annual TV Guide Awards Jennifer wore her           silky locks down and held neatly in place with a simple barrette. 
Accompanied to           both awards by her beloved hubby, Felicity heart-throb Scott Foley,           Garner won the Golden Globe award for best actress.  Although Jennifer seemed pleased with her surprise win, she           later confused to Time magazine that she much prefers a quiet evening           munching pizza rather than hobnobbing at glamorous star filled           parties.
Garner           has been heralded by critics as the biggest new star for the 2001-02           TV season but she has worked very hard for her success.  Although she is now known as TV’s newest double-dealing           agent, until recently, she was mistaken by Felicity fans as her           husband’s business agent.

Even though she           has to work long hours and endure fittings for her many costumes and           hair changes, Jennifer accepts this as just one part of her job.  She also puts in extra hours doing pilates, martial arts,           running and strength training to keep her body buff for her intense TV           role.
Conclusion
So what’s           next for the beautifully tressed Jennifer?  The big screen may beckon. Although her movie career has been           limited to playing Ashton Crutcher’s galpal in Dude, Where’s My           Car and the short curly coiffed Nurse Sandra in Pearl Harbor, Ms.           Garner was recently cast as the sensuous Elektra Natchios in the new           Daredevil movie that is currently being filmed with Ben Affleck.

Don’t worry           about Garner bailing on her once-in-a-lifetime do-or-die Alias role.  The actress has publicly admitted that a plum part like Sydney           Bristow is a special acting gift.  Don’t expect Garner to leave TV or her fabulous wig           collection anytime soon.
