Alias fans (especially those in the United Kingdom), be sure to visit our newest sponsor TVStandShop.co.uk ! When you are ready to sit back and enjoy an episode of Alias, you need the essentials, and after you have a nice big TV to watch Sydney and the gang on, you need to find the perfect TV stand to display it. There a number of TV stands to choose from, in a variety of styles and materials, and TV Stand Shop is ready to serve you. Their website is easy to navigate and shop, and they take all major credit cards. They also carry other products for your T room, including cables, wall brackets, entertainment centers, and DVD storage units.
Don't forget how important it is to determine where to place your TV. It needs to be the focal point of the room, and if you don't have a  "true" center, or are pressed for space, consider their selection of corner TV stands , which will make the screen easy for anyone to see. TV Stand Shop offers stands in a variety of materials, including woods, metals, and glass that will compliment your decor. If you need something modern yet low-profile, check out their selection of black TV stands that will meet your needs without setting you back a fortune. 
TV Stand Shop offers free shipping in the UK with a minimum purchase order. Customers outside the UK should check their website for international shipping rates. Be sure to tell them AliasConnection.com sent you!
