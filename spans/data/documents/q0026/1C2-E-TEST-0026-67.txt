ALIAS Reboot in the Works!
One of the greatest TV series of all time, J.J. Abrams’ Alias , is reportedly being rebooted.
Although an insider tells E! that “nothing is even close to being anything official yet.”
The new version of Alias would “borrow some elements of the original series that starred Jennifer Garner (and Michael Vartan , Victor Garber and Bradley Cooper ). But the series would most likely not include any sort of complex mythological throughline such as the Rambaldi prophecy (a storyline that lost some of the fans).”
