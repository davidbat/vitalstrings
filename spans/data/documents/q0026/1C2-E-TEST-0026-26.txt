Drumroll please…. Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck , who are parents to Violet Anne and Seraphina Rose, have announced the name of their third child. And that name is, get ready for it...Samuel!
Oh. Well, that’s an oddly normal name for a celebrity baby. Shouldn’t it be like Panther or Rock or Fettuccini or something?

Congrats to Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck , who welcomed baby #3 today. Jen gave birth to a baby boy in Santa Monica on Tuesday.
Jen announced her pregnancy in August 2011, but they had kept the sex of the baby a secret from everyone until today.
She did however hint she was having a boy

Planning to get your loved one something really cool this year? Getting your dad that iPhone 4 he’s been wanting? Or maybe you’re getting your brother that really fancy laptop he asked for?
Garbage. It’s all garbage, at least compared to this over-the-top celebrity Christmas presents. Celebs love to do things big, and for the biggest time of the year, it only gets more outrageous. Here are 10 extravagant celebrity Christmas presents.
Paris Hilton : Pink Bentley: Paris bought her own Christmas present—a $285,000 pink Bentley Continental GT. The dashboard is diamond-encrusted.  At this point, I’m surprised the woman doesn’t get Tinkerbell encrusted with diamonds.
Mariah Carey : Rolls Royce Phantom: No surprise here, these two live like royalty. Nick Cannon gifted his wife with a $400,000 Rolls Royce Phantom. It included a personalized license plate that reads “mommyMC”
