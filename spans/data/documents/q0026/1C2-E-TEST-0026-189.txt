Slideshow: Celebrity Sightings Asked if he thought the show might lose male viewers who eagerly anticipate seeing Garner in action, McPherson replied that “she’ll be able to run a fair amount.”
But he acknowledged her exploits would change when Garner is visibly pregnant. To protect the show’s sex appeal quotient, a younger agent who is being mentored by Sydney will be added, he said.
