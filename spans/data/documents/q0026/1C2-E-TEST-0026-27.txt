Former Alias star Jennifer Garner has revealed the misery caused by the show's punishing schedule.
Speaking to Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, the actress recalled an emotional visit to see the programme's showrunner J.J. Abrams: "I just cried and cried and cried and said, 'Could I just come in late one day or could I go home early one day? I don't even need a whole day off, but I think I'm going to crack'.
"Alias made every decision for me," she continued. "I didn't even have a lunch break during the first two years. Every lunchtime somebody would be there to teach me a language or teach me to fight."
Garner, currently starring in the US box office smash Juno, added: "One of the great things about Alias being over is that now I can do things just because I want to."
