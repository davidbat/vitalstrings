In town to film "Arthur," Jennifer Garner made the most of NYC's gorgeous weather by taking her daughters to the park with former small screen daddy, gay BFF and all around awesome actor Victor Garber on Saturday.
Of course any "Alias" reunion instantly sends me back to the days of SD-6, J. Garn in wigs, Francinator, pre-fame Bradley Cooper and anything before Lauren Reed came into existence.
