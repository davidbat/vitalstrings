Style Evolution: Jennifer Garner
During her heyday as spy Sydney Bristow on "Alias," Jennifer Garner proved herself to be a true style chameleon. But the days before she hit it big--as well as her post-"Alias" life as a mom--are just as interesting. Take a look back at Garner's style evolution.

Jennifer Garner's small role on "Felicity" was life-changing. In addition to serving as her professional breakout, it was where she met her future husband, Scott Foley. Here the pair kept it casual at Nickelodeon's 12th Annual Kids Choice Awards in May, 1999.

Early in their relationship Jen and Scott apparently subscribed to the "couples that dress together stay together" theory. Sadly for Garner the baggy suit she wore to the "Scream 3" premiere circa February 2000 hasn't fared as well as Foley's classic gray two piece.

Garner is solo and saucy on the red carpet at the 2nd Annual TV Guide Awards in March of 2000. The dress isn't exactly a classic, but it was a personal style milestone for the young actress as she discovered her exposed back was one of her best features.

At an ABC party in May 2001, the dimpled actress shows that you can never go wrong with a classic L.B.D. Matching your lipstick exactly to your footwear, on the other hand, is a style statement that should never be repeated.

Before the advent of Michelle Obama arms, there was Jennifer Garner guns! In 2001 she had begun filming her spy action show "Alias" and by the time the Golden Globes rolled around in January of the following year, the impact of her workouts was obvious. Her new physique - which was shown off nicely in a fire red sleeveless gown - lended itself to carrying the statuette she received for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Drama.

Nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the 54th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in September of 2002, Garner dazzled in this strapless Ralph Lauren dress.

Garner received a second Golden Globe nod for her work in "Alias" in 2003. She didn't win, but she did land herself a spot on the best dressed list for this plunging Ralph Lauren gown and pearl choker by Janis Savitt for M&J Savitt.

Jennifer Garner first met Ben Affleck after she snagged a bit part as a nurse in "Pearl Harbor". She later worked with her future husband more directly in both "Daredevil" and "Electra." In hindsight this affectionate shot from the "Daredevil" press conference is rather telling, but at the time all anyone saw was Garner looking fresh-faced and very girl next door in this simple blazer.
