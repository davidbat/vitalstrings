An athletic, dimpled beauty with a history of falling for her costars, Jennifer Garner first caught viewers' eyes as Scott Foley's girlfriend on Felicity, a part she continued to play off-screen until the two wed in 2000. A handful of feature films and short-lived series followed before Garner became a small-screen star as a wig-donning international spy on Alias. As her career heated up, her marriage to Foley cooled off and she was briefly linked with her Alias costar Michael Vartan. But her role as Elektra in the 2003 film Daredevil changed her life. Not only did her butt-kicking performance lead to her own starring vehicle (2005's sequel Elektra), but she also married and started a family with costar Ben Affleck. Garner splits her time these days among raising her children, starring in action films and romantic comedies, and working on behalf of charitable initiatives, including early-childhood education.
