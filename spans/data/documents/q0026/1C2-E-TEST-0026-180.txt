Despite, or perhaps because, she gave birth in real life last year, Jennifer Garner is worried that her Alias character’s forthcoming onscreen childbirth will be not be fun to film.
“I think it is going to be an incredibly embarrassing day,” she’s said. “I have been dreading this moment as long as I have known it was coming.”
“I can’t even imagine being in front of my crew. It is not even about the people watching it on TV. Imagine what this crew has seen me do over the last five years?”
“I still get embarrassed any time I have to not have my clothes on around them, because those are my guys. They are all like brothers or father figures, so it will be a rough day for me.”
