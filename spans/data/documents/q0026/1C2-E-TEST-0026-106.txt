Trivia Note: The number 47 is                       used repeatedly throughout the series. Examples: Marshall                       expresses a desire to improve a camera design so that it                       has 47 exposures, the key code Will needs to get into a                       computer room in order to retrieve data on SD-6 is 4747,                       The crate at the Vatican which contains the painting with                       Rambaldi's cipher-key has a 5-digit catalog number ending                       in 47, page 47 is always significant in a Rambaldi                       manuscript, and of course, there are 47 parts to                       Rambaldi's magnum opus. In episodes of season 3, Sydney                       tries to retrieve memories of when she is abducted, as she                       is dreaming... Masked men take her in to a room with the                       number 47 largely printed on its doors. Interestingly, the                       Star Trek TV shows also feature the number 47 many times                       (It's usually seen in their monitors).
