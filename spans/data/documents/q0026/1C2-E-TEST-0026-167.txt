Alias: Sydney the blonde (season 4)
A sister discovered and getting back together with Vaughan – things seem to be looking up for Sydney (Jennifer Garner) who didn’t have a lot of laughs in season three. But hey this is Alias so the final moments crush her smile.
I dont know about blondes having more fun but the disguises were definitely biased towards the blonde look this season.
Makeup credits are on the main Alias page.
