Acting Career
After several canceled television series, Garner earned a recurring role on Felicity . She had minor roles in Dude, Where's My Car? and Pearl Harbor before being cast in Alias. She won a Golden Globe in 2002 for Best Actress in the series.
Since Alias ended, she has appeared in several films, including Peter Berg 's The Kingdom and the sleeper-hit Juno. She appeared in the Ricky Gervais comedy This Side of the Truth alongside Jonah Hill and Tina Fey .
Personal Life
Garner has two sisters, Melissa (older) and Susannah (younger). They had a very strict childhood, where going to movies, wearing make-up and having their ears pierced was banned. In early 2006, Garner pierced her ears specially to be able to wear a pair of $250,000 diamond earrings at that year's Academy Awards ceremony .
Foley and Garner met on the set of Felicity and married in 2000. They divorced in 2004 and Garner has since said that their  Hollywood lifestyle led to the separation. Garner briefly dated her Alias co-star, Michael Vartan, and their split instigated rumors that Garner encouraged the show's producers to have him "killed off."
Garner married Ben Affleck in June 2005 and she gave birth to their daughter Violet Anne Affleck in December of the same year. Garner gave birth to the couple's second daughter on January 6, 2009.
