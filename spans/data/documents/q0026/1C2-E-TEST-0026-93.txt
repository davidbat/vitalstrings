Over the years, celebrities such as Jennifer Love Hewitt , Mandy Moore, and Mischa Barton have represented Neutrogena, a popular brand of skin care products. Now, it’s Jennifer Garner’s turn to represent the company as their new ambassador. For $1 million the former Alias star will be the face of the cosmetics company and will be promoting the firm’s new anti-oxidant age reverse treatment product range.
Garner, a 35-year old native of Houston, Texas, is an award-winning actress known for her role on the spy-drama Alias as the CIA Agent Sydney Bristow. Her ilm credits include 13 Going on 30, Elektra, Daredevil, Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can, and Dude, Where’s My Car?
As a fan of Neutrogena’s products, Garner became ecstatic when she inked the deal. She said, "For me, Neutrogena has always been a part of my life; I have used the products for years. I feel an emotional connection to the brand because it represents healthy beauty - and that's something that I strongly support. I am excited to be a part of the Neutrogena family."
In turn, the company was also delighted with Garner coming on board. Stefano Curti, General Manager of Neutrogena, said in a statement, "We are thrilled because Ms. Garner represents a relevant voice that epitomizes both the equity and true spirit of the brand; she is undeniably the perfect choice as she is the quintessential ambassador of healthy beauty."
In line with Garner’s contract, she will be featured in U.S. television commercials and print advertisements until December 2008.
Apart from being preoccupied as the new ambassador of Neutrogena, Garner is also busy making movies. She stars in the drama-thriller The Kingdom, which is scheduled for release on September 28, 2007, and in the drama-comedy Juno.
