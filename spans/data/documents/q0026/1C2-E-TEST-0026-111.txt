Although it was basically sacrilege to support any "Alias" coupling that didn't' involve the words "Sydney and Vaughn," a small part of me always thought that our beloved spygirl would be better off with her best friend Will Tippin.
Who knew back in 2001 that the lovable reporter would turn into one of the year's biggest names thanks to his role in "The Hangover." Hell, who knew back then that Jennifer Garner would become a megastar? Even according to Bradley, she never seemed like the type!
"She was one of the first people I met when I stepped onto Los Angeles soil," he told W Magazine. "And she was very maternal, even then. She wanted to take care of me, make sure I was OK all the time. The first time I saw her, I was in the production office when we were shooting the pilot [for 'Alias'] and this girl comes in, glowing. She had just baked cookies, and I was like, 'That who is playing Sydney Bristow?'"
I believe that's one of the reasons "Alias" was so successful as a series -- because Jennifer was not cut from the Eliza Dushku/Katee Sackhoff cloth. She wasn't born to be an action star, she's a giant dork who loves cooking, knitting and nesting. That's what made her so endearing as our off-the-clock Sydney.
Take this blooper, for example: she's kicking ass, taking names and then Bradley flubs his line, leaving her in hysterics. Adorable.
And just because I stumbled across this while searching for Sydney/Will clips...
