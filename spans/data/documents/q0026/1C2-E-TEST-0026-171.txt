Jennifer Garner (born April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas) is an American film and television actress.
Although Garner was born in Texas, her father's engineering job with Union Carbide (now a part of Dow Chemical) took the family to Charleston, West Virginia when she was three years old, and she lived in Charleston until she left for college. She studied ballet for nine years before enrolling as a chemistry major at Denison University. After realizing that she loved the stage more than science, she changed her major to drama.
She currently stars as the character of Sydney Bristow in the TV show Alias. She married Scott Foley (who played her love interest on Felicity) in 2000, but separated and filed for divorce in 2003 and began dating her Alias co-star Michael Vartan, though in the summer of 2004 she was romantically linked with her Daredevil co-star Ben Affleck. She enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking and kickboxing (a hobby inspired by her character on Alias). (Wikipedia)[ Update biography ]
