yes, hot news....ALIAS lead gorgeous actress Jennifer Garner, now pregnant in real life, will be expecting on-screen this fall as the new ALIAS TV series hits the screen on Thursday (note new day) at 8 p.m. on ABC for it's 5th Season (wow, I can remember when it premiered --seemed like only my brother Frank and I were big fans in our respective crowds from the onset--but most of America and International fans caught on quickly. So I figure the hottest question for the season is what color hair will Jennifer's real life baby have and what color will Sydney Bristow's baby have-- it's kind of an insider question for those of you who may have never caught the show -- Sydney changes hair styles and hair color faster than you can watch the next commercial....red, blond, black, purple and of course the trademark rouge color. Did you know at the Alias booksigning in Los Angeles they even gave away the brilliant red/rouge color wigs to promo the show....hmmm how did I miss that?

RING TONES ARE HOT THIS SUMMER:
Seattle research firm M:Metrics found that 9.56 percent of mobile phone subscribers downloaded a ring tone in June, a total of 17.3 million downloads. In a "Washington Post" report, Proteus co-founder Timothy Shey said he was excited to expand the potential market for his company's products and reach more female customers .
MORE MALE RINGTONE BUYERS THAN FEMALES?
Some experts say that more males than females buy ringtones and downloadable content. . In the past, Proteus has frequently offered ring tones, screen savers and games some consider tied to more male-oriented content, such as sporting events or TV shows such as HBO's mob series "The Sopranos."
ABC MOBILE STORE --- for soap fans too...
With an "ABC Mobile Store" promoting downloads from shows such as "General Hospital" and "One Life to Live," Proteus hopes to reach more female customers."ABC has the power to put that [Web address] everywhere," Shey said. "We want to reach a mainstream audience."
. For a monthly fee, for example, fans might be able to get regular text messages with previews, recaps or behind-the-scenes news from their favorite ABC shows. A joke-of-the-day from late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel is another possibility ABC and Proteus are considering.
KIDNAPPER RINGBACK?
One proposed "ringback" script, which has not yet been recorded, would feature the voice of "One Life to Live" actor Michael Easton in his role as police detective John McBain:"If you're the kidnapper, the money's on the way. Everyone else, please leave a message and be sure to leave a number."
Proteus is no stranger to working with the networks. In May, the company announced it was helping to facilitate a wireless-based sweepstakes for the FOX television hit "Nanny 911." In February, the company announced a deal with Fox Sports en Español, Fox Sports Latin America to launch Fox Sports Copa Móvil, a suite of mobile products and services based on the soccer club Copa Libertadores.

New names for "Alias"
French actress Elodie Bouchez is the latest addition to the cast of the hit ABC spy drama "Alias."
Bouchez will portray an internationally wanted criminal who, unbeknownst to Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), has been secretly working with fellow CIA agent Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) for several years.
YES, VAUGHN IS BACK ON ALIAS
-- despite rumors it looks like Vartan is back as Vaughn
Sydney is expecting a baby too
so her "Alias" character will be too, even though she's a globe-trotting spy.
"We are going to embrace the fact that she's pregnant," ABC programming chief Stephen McPherson said, referring to the character, Sydney Bristow.
But the show will focus on making the situation realistic and not "campy," he said."We also don't want to put her in situations where she's endangering herself and the baby," making it difficult for viewers to suspend disbelief, he said.
