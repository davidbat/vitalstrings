Will Jennifer Garner take on another film alias?

"Alias" fans, take note.  Jennifer Garner could keep those multiplex appearances coming, After appearing in the ensemble "Valentine's Day" and opposite Ricky Gervais in "The Invention of Lying" over the past six months, Garner is getting ready to shoot the lead part in "Butter," that story of Midwestern country-fair jealousies that she's also producing.
Now comes word that producers are talking to her for a key part in Ron Howard's (at-the-moment untitled) movie about cheating. Kevin James, Vince Vaughn and Winona Ryder are already on board for the Universal/Imagine project. So, another sultry beauty in the land of average-seeming guys. But we guess if she could hook up with Gervais, playing alongside these guys should be as easy as, well, butter.
