I was totally disappointed
I absolutely loved Alias for the first 4 seasons, and I thought the season finale of 4 was the most brilliant I had seen to date.  Season 5 was a huge disappointment.      I don't agree with those who said there was closure.  There may have been closure as far as what happened to all of the characters, but there were many, many plot questions left unanswered.    I thought the season was rushed and the ending was rushed and completely fell short of the level of creativity and brilliance of the first 4 seasons.      I also thought the character assasination of Irina was horrible.  She was the most interesting and complex character in the series suddenly she became one-dimensional and carton-villian-like.       Sloan's fate, while poetic, was predictable and not believable.  Jack's was just dumb and a great waste of skill for a superior strategist.     Those who like Season 5 are probably those who are just Sydney/Vaughn fans.  If you fall into this category, you will probably enjoy the season.  I just like to pretend the series ended after Season 4 and forget Season 5 ever happened.

I completely agree with the review below.
I love ALIAS.  The show is so addicting and because of my work schedule I was unable to watch season 5. I am so happy to finally find out what happened.

Ending with a thud
After the boffo ending to season four, I was really disappointed in season five. The main problem, aside from no action from my favorite characters, was that the writers kept pursuing leads that went nowhere. There was a serious lack of wigs and fight scenes. True fans will buy this anyway to see how it all panned out, but c'mon Abrams, we deserved better. All in all, season five was LOST in translation.

Not the best, but still excellent television...
I came to be an Alias fan late in the game as well, near the end of the fourth season. Then, as I anticipated the fifth season, I barely got to see it, as ABC was constantly changing its scheduling.     Now, with the ability to watch each episode individually, I can understand both points of view--in other words, why fans adore this season and why it was a ratings flop.    Fans adore this season because of the rich development of characters we have all loved since the pilot. Sydney in particular changes much  besides the obvious pregnancy, her discovery of Rachel Gibson and the way she takes Rachel under her wing are compelling. There's a wonderful (but perhaps a bit obvious) mirror effect from the last season to the first, which is extremely rewarding for longtime fans. Also, this season returns to some of the themes and exciting, different, globe-trekking missions that populated the first and second seasons--by far the most superior of all five seasons. Milo Rambaldi takes center stage, and Sydney is once again forced into her role as the Chosen One. (The perspective on this madness afforded by new agents Rachel and Tom is a shock, but then they haven't seen what the viewers have seen over four seasons).     On the flip side, new agents and departing faces meant that there was a lot new for longtime fans to deal with, which may have turned them off. The plot, though circular, was sort of been-there, done-that at times. Also, the plotline with Vaughn kind of jumped the shark, and they never really recovered (a one-sentence description in passing of what really happened is odd and not sufficient in a show as complicated as Alias).     My main issue with this season, though, was the ending, which many fans say was fitting. I do not think so. I, for one, was disappointed by the simplistic motives of Irina and Sloane. I know they were supposed to be evil, but Irina especially was not evil through and through. Character deaths are also insufficient and lacking in weight. (The death of Renee, a character that the show invests much time in, dies, is anticlimactic and...well, lame.)    Still, do I recommend the fifth season? Yes. It represents a huge leap in character evolution and also the resolution of (in my opinion) one of the best shows on television. If you are a fan, you already know that you have to pick this up.    Nonfans, beware: You will comprehend nearly nothing of what happens in this season. It is basically a fan-only season.

Amazing
This show was amazing, and it ended (especially in the last episode) with closure. I mean  because they keep at least one bad person alive at the end (so it is not pathetic) and syd + vaughn gain closure/ are united because of a child too... so ya, this season, while it doesn't start off the best of all the seasons it does bring closure to one of the best shows in TV history

THE BEST TV SHOW IN HISTORY!!!
The fifth season may not have been the best season of ALIAS, but the final 8 episodes including the 100th and the series finale gave the audience a satisfying conclusion to the characters that we fell in love with the past five years. I did not start watching ALIAS until the fourth episode of the fourth season but was instantly hooked and within 4 months I owned all of the seasons on DVD. ALIAS is the most addicting television series in all of history. Once you watch the pilot you will want to buy all five seasons just to find out what happens to the heroine of Sydney Bristow. Season five's season premiere stunned fans with the death of Michael Vaughn but like all loyal fans of ALIAS know no one ever really dies on ALIAS. This show will always be my favorite tv show simply because I love everything about it: the unforgetable characters, stunts, aliases, locations around the world, and of course the relationship between the struggling Bristow family and the never-ending love story of Sydney Bristow and Michael Vaughn despite Vaughn's wife in season 3. Season five introduces more characters that bring more espinage and drama into the mix. The fact that they made Sydney pregnant was simply a great idea because from watching the first season you could just tell that Sydney Bristow would make the perfect mother.  I want to thank the cast and crew for providing the best show ever for free every week and have me wondering all summer long what would happen next. Only a truly dedicated and talented team could pull off a show like ALIAS and make it last for five years. To anyone who doubts buying this boxed set, trust me this is some of the best television you will ever get your hands on. I would recommend this to anyone who simply loves to be entertained and ALIAS THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON will do that for you as well as the other four seasons already available. It's a shame that ALIAS couldn't have lasted for the originally contracted seven seasons because I would still watch the character of Sydney Bristow through anything!
