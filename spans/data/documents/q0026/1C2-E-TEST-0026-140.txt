Even the stars need help sometimes when their marriages don't work out. Jennifer Garner, for one, was willing to humble herself and get professional assistance when she separated from her first husband, actor Scott Foley, in 2003. The Alias star told Parade magazine this week that she went to therapy after the split.
"I had a lot of growing up to do," Garner told the magazine. She explained that at the time, she'd had trouble communicating her true feelings, which may have contributed to the marital breakdown.
"I don't like to argue," the 37-year-old actor added. "But back then, I couldn't have a fight. I couldn't work things out, because I wasn't able to say what I needed to say. It was a huge heartbreak for me. So I went to work on it."
