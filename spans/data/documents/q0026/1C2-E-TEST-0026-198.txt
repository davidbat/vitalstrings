Couple Profile
Jennifer was born in Texas, the daughter of Patricia Ann and Billy Jack Garner. She is the middle child between two sisters, Melissa Garner Wylie and Susannah Kay Garner Carpenter. When she was four years old, her father`s job with Union Carbide relocated her family to Princeton, West Virginia, then to Charleston, West Virginia, where Jennifer lived until her college years.   Jennifer and her sisters had a very strict home life as children. They were expected to attend church every Sunday, were not allowed to go to movies or wear make-up, and had to wait until they reached the age of 16 before they were allowed to have their ears pierced. Although Susannah broke the rules and had her ears pierced before she was 16, Jennifer did not have her ears pierced until the age of 27.   In 1995, she moved to New York to work in theater, earning $150 a week  as an understudy in a play. This led to her first screen role in the movie "Zoya", followed by a number of minor TV roles. In 2001, she was cast in the lead role in a new action show, "Alias". This proved to be her big break, and the rest, as they say, is history...
