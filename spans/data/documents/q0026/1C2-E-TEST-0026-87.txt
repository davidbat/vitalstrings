J.J. Abrams Spy Drama ALIAS May Get a Reboot

NBC is launching the spy drama Undercovers from J.J. Abrams this fall, but we’re not too far removed from the era that the combination of “Abrams” and “spy drama” pertained rather to the producer/director’s action series Alias.  The series aired from 2001-2005 on ABC and helped launch the careers of such notables as Jennifer Garner and Bradley Cooper.  Plus, it established Abrams as a presence in the action/sci-fi genre when prior to the series he had best been known as the creator of teen drama Felicity.
E! Online reports that ABC has recently been batting around the idea of rebooting the series, Current discussions are very preliminary, and the project is not yet in development, though a reboot of the series would reportedly dial down the mythological elements of the original (that means no Rambaldi prophecy, for fans of the series).  More after the jump:
If true, it kinda sounds like ABC wants to have a doppelganger ready to go in case Undercovers is a hit this fall.  Still an interesting idea, to be sure.  I’ve only seen a handful of episodes so, commenters, is the material worth revisiting?  Is the “No Rambaldi” rule a good thing or a bad thing?
Here’s a first season synopsis via Amazon :
Sydney Bristow is not exactly your  average grad student. Her life might appear normal, but she’s hiding a  secret life working as a spy for the CIA. Sydney’s world is turned  upside down when she learns she may work for the very enemy she thought  she was fighting. Now she’s entangled in a covert lifestyle where she is  forced to question the allegiances of everyone, including those closest  to her.
