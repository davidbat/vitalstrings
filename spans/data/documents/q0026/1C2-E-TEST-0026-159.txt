I can't believe no-one has rated this supidly good product. Ok ok its a bit pricey but the sure entertainment and the package offset that easily. The package is beautifully crafted with fold down magnetic sides. Inside are all 5 seasons in lovely hardback book style cases. Also included is the coveted hardback book and a bonus disc hidden under a secret (but easy to find) compartment at the bottom of the box. If like me you're a fan of Alias THIS IS the set to get. There's a limited edition worldwide so should retain some value. Of course you need a multi region dvd player but hacks are easy to find or just buy one from Richer Sounds.
The programme making is exceptional even though you often have to suspend disbelief it is so worthwhile. The first two series are brilliant, the third one takes it to a different angle continuing into the fourth series which has a great cliffhanger ending leading into the shorter fifth series which introduces a few new characters which although necessary does slow proceedings down a little. The overall ending although not answering every question from the entire series is suitable enough if not over a little quickly. Still this does not deflect from the hours and hours of great fun and pleasure this series brings. Jennifer Garner is HOT and changes outfits 3 or more times an episode, all the cast members are excellent, the production design is great and money well spent on a show that deserved it.
Best thing about Alias: Marshall Flinkman, the genius! He's awesome, a true revelation and brings much needed comic timing to woeful situations. The guy's a legend, Kevin Weisman i salute you.
Buy it, watch it, love it.
