Life & Style has the scoop:
When a slim Jennifer Garner stepped onto the stage recently at the Golden Globes in LA, the Versace-clad mom of two drew plenty of oohs and aahs. But her streamlined silhouette was a new look for the 37-year-old star, who was once famous for the super-muscular physique she showed off in action-hero roles.
“She’s a size 0 now,” an insider says about Jen, who has two daughters, Violet, 4, and Seraphina, 13 months, with hubby Ben Affleck. “She used to be a size 6.”
That means after having her second child, Jen dropped the baby weight and more — which was tough to do the first time, she’s said.
“I just wasn’t that motivated,” Jen said about taking time to lose the weight after Violet’s birth. Then I got on the treadmill, stopped stuffing my face and lost the weight. I cut out croissants, bagels and muffins — all the good stuff — and went back to having
a salad once a day and protein.”
