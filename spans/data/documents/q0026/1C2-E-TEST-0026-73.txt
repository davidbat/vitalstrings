On somebody she’d like to meet:
“During my second pregnancy I loved listening to the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. I’ve thought about contacting him, but I’ve never had the nerve.”
On husband Ben Affleck:
“Honestly, I would do anything for that man, because I know it’s not taken for granted.”
On loving her current state of life:
“I’m not as myopic as I used to be. During those Alias years I worked 362 days a year. It was great, but I wouldn’t trade my life now for anything.”
On the joys of being a producer:
“Being a producer has helped me find the part of myself that has a voice. I’m not just the good girl who’s handed a script.”
