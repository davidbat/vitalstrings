Jennifer Garner
HOLLYWOOD - Jennifer Garner 's pregnancy is set to be written into her hit TV show Alias--and the character of her real-life ex-boyfriend Michael Vartan is the father.
Garner and her new husband Ben Affleck recently ended several weeks of speculation by announcing they're expecting their first child together in December.
And series creator J.J. Abrams has decided that rather than shoot around the actress' growing stomach, he'd make her character Sydney Bristow pregnant.
He says of Garner , "She'll be in every episode."
Production on the show resumes on Friday.
Garner and Vartan dated briefly in 2004 after the beauty divorced first husband, actor Scott Foley .
