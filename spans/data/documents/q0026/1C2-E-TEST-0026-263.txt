How You Know Her: Dude, we totally first noticed Jennifer when she played Wanda, Ashton Kutcher's hot onscreen girlfriend in Dude, Where's My Car?. Soon after, she secured her place in Hollywood and at the top of our 2002 Hot 100 List with her hit show Alias. She's also appeared in Pearl Harbor, Thirteen Going On Thirty, Catch Me If You Can, The Kingdom, and Juno. Up next, Jennifer costars with Matthew McConaughey in romantic comedy Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, out in theaters this Friday. Just the title of this movie is enough to give us nightmares, but the possibility of having Jennifer's face haunt our dreams almost makes up for it. Almost.
She likes getting rough: "[Filming my fight scene for The Kingdom] was so down and dirty that we had scratch marks that we had to cover up on my face for the next few days where he tried to grab me and pull my face off. He had a scab on his ear ‘cause I bit his ear. I just yanked and got his ear and went ‘yuck.’ It was nasty. It was great." — Movies Online
