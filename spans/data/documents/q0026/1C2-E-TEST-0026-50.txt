Season One of the television series           Alias stars Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a secret agent working           for SD-6, a covert branch of the CIA. By day, Sydney is a college grad           student attending university in Los Angeles. By night, she travels to           all corners of the earth, wearing all sorts of disguises, and carrying           out all sorts of missions - whether it be stealing ancient artifacts,           finding hidden weapons, or sabotaging enemy resources. And in between           attending college and fighting the bad guys, Sydney has to juggle her           personal life, where she has to hide her real identity from her           friends, where she is trying to repair a severely damaged relationship           with her secret agent father (Victor Garber) and where she is trying           to deal with the deaths of people very close to her, including the           death of her very own mother. The six-DVD set features 22           action-packed, high flying, edge-of-your-seat episodes and a bevy of           extras that is sure to entertain even the most un-entertainable           person.
I must admit I was pleasantly surprised after watching Season One of           Alias. Although the pilot episode was quite gripping, there were a           couple of episodes in the middle that I just did not see going           anywhere. They just seemed to be the same story in different episodes           and different locations. But then the season took a few surprising           twists and turns and ended up being one hell of a ride. The back of           the DVD claims that after watching season one, we will be "gasping for air and begging for Season 2!". I can't say I           was really gasping for air, but begging for Season 2? Yeah, I'm           begging. There is just so much to like about this show, starting with           its main attraction Jennifer Garner. Garner plays the role of Sydney           Bristow to perfection - one minute being the sweet, innocent,           vulnerable beauty and the next minute kicking some guys balls up his           throat just before she hacks into his computer, steals all his data,           breaks into his safe, steals his stolen artifacts and jumps out the           window to safety. She is intelligent, beautiful, athletic and all that           stuff that every guy looks for in the perfect woman. And it doesn't           hurt that we get many a shot of Garner in skin-tight dresses, bikinis,           bra and panties, in the shower, in the bathtub and even in her pajamas.           Garner is a strange one though - there are some shots of her where her           beauty is simply mesmerizing and then there are other shots where she           doesn't look too great. It's sort of like that Seinfeld episode where           Jerry has a beautiful girlfriend but when she steps into a certain           light, she looks terrifying. Nevertheless, Garner is the star of the           show and she does a bang up job in that role.
But Garner does not carry this show on her own. Ron Rifkin as SD-6's           ice-cold boss Arvin Sloane and Victor Garber as Sydney Bristow's           father Jack are quite possibly two of the strongest characters I have           seen on television in the last ten years. They are outstanding and           practically steal every single last scene in which they appear. The           remaining main cast includes Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper), Dixon (Carl           Lumbly), Marshall (Kevin Weisman), Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and a           handful of others that are equally strong characters (but not nearly           in the league of Rifkin and Garber).
As for the episodes, well, you have to give the creators of Alias           credit. Considering the show is featured on prime time television,           they are not afraid to push the envelope in terms of blood, guts and           violence. There are plenty of scenes of torture, death and several           main characters getting knocked off, which while disappointing,           disturbing and sometimes heartbreaking, it always makes for good           television. These guys and gals really went out on a limb at times and           for that, they get my respect. Sure some of the stunts that Sydney           Bristow and her comrades manage to pull off and the bullets they           manage to dodge will leave even the biggest optimist scratching his or           her head but hey, it can't all be perfect. Besides the spy stuff           Sydney has going on, there are plenty of other happenings - her           relationship with Sloane, her father, Will, Vaughn; her search for the           real reason her mother died; Will's search for some answers to a few           questions he has stumbled upon - to keep you interested. In fact, I           often found myself much more intrigued by the side stories of Alias,           rather than the real spy stuff.
As for the extras on the DVD's, Disc 1 has an Alias Script Scanner           that requires you to put the DVD in your computer's DVD-ROM to access.           There is a commentary for the episode entitled "Truth Be Told" which is narrated by creator J.J. Abrams and Jennifer           Garner (quite an entertaining commentary) and another commentary for           the episode called "So It Begins" which is done by producers           Michael Bonvillain (who I believe also directed this episode), Sarah           Caplan and Ken Olin. In this commentary, they do what I am beginning           to notice many directors and producers do in their commentaries -           complain how difficult it was to shoot almost every scene in the           episode. Disc 5 has a commentary of the episode "Q & A" by executive producers John Eisendrath, Alex Kurtzman-Counter and           Roberto Orci who basically explain this recap episode and point out           the reason the recap episode was made was because of budgetary           concerns (another common theme amongst producers and directors -           complaining about money). Disc 6 has the final commentary track, this           time for the season finale "Almost Thirty Years". It is           quite an entertaining commentary, which includes Jennifer Garner,           Micharl Vartan, Victor Garber (briefly - apparently he disappeared           during the taping of the commentary), Bradley Cooper, Carl Lumbly, Ron           Rifkin, Merrin Dungay and Kevin Weisman. It is quite an entertaining           commentary in which the cast seems to get along extremely well, as           they joke, laugh, interrupt and make fun of each other. Perhaps it is           this camaraderie that has contributed to the extreme success of Alias.           Then again, this is only Season One. I wonder if the jokes will last           into Season Two.
Disc 6 also includes some short featurettes, which include an Alias           Pilot Production Diary (an interesting look at the making of the pilot           for the series), Inside Stunts (where we learn that Garner does a lot           of her own stunts), Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel (funny stuff), Alias TV           Spots, Alias Video Game Preview, Season Two Sneak Peek and Credits.
Overall, I will say that Alias: The Complete First Season is a keeper.           I was not expecting much from this DVD and came away pleasantly surprised           with a show that I look forward to watching in the future. It is by no           means my favourite show of all time - that still belongs to the likes           of The Shield and The Sopranos. But I could see it replacing 24, who,           after a stellar opening season, has seemed to stumble a bit late in           the second season and into the third season. Although I am not yet           gasping for air, I will enjoy watching Season Two of Alias and will           probably do so tonight!
