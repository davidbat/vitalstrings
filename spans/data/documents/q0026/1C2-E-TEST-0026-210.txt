Movie Description
Jennifer Garner stars in this television series as Sydney Bristow, a 26 year-old graduate student working for a secret division of the CIA. The mission of this arm of the CIA is to combat SD-6, a secret terrorist organization whose agents believe that they, in fact, work for a secret organization of the CIA that combats terrorism. This second season of the series introduces a host of new plot twists including a new romance for Sydney and the appearance of a woman who may be Sydney's mother. Quite possibly the most entertaining network television show of the last decade, ALIAS is a fast paced thrill ride buoyed by Ms. Garner's performance as well as her penchant for wearing some outrageously risque disguises on her missions.
