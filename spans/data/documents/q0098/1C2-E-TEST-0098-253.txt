We want you to have the wedding of your dreams.          Elegant or casual, modern or conservative, a wedding at The Landmark offers an atmosphere of warmth and elegance in the sophisticated          surroundings of our banquet facility. You can welcome your guests in a separate lounge for a cocktail hour or with your Bridal          Party in a private Bridal Room. We offer our exclusive Tuxedo and White Glove French Service, combined with delicately prepared,          ethnically diverse menus, tableside cocktail service, individually created ice sculptures and your choice of linen, as well          as the convenience of valet parking.
The          Landmark promises a wedding reception which is seamless, elegant, and - above all - uniquely yours. Our valuable years of          experience will insure you a wedding you will cherish forever.
We appreciate that you are considering The Landmark for your special day. We welcome your comments and          questions regarding our reception and event location. Please contact us and a member of our staff will be happy to give you our personal attention.
