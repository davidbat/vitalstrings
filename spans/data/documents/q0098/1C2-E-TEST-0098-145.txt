Information About Taxes, Governmental Fees, Tax Recovery Charges and Service Fees

Hotel Transactions:  We market hotel rooms on the site under two different business models. The first is the "postpaid" model (also known as the "published rate" or "traditional agency" model), where you book a room through us at published rates and you pay for that room, plus any applicable taxes, governmental fees and other charges directly to the hotel at check-out. The second business model is the "prepaid" model (also known as the "net rate" or "merchant" model), where we collect payment from you up front and then transmit funds to the hotel. We label the "prepaid" model rooms as "Save Rate" rooms on our site because they are covered by our 110% Best Rate Guarantee.  Amounts displayed as the nightly rate for Save Rate hotel transactions consist of the amount that the relevant hotel has agreed to accept for the room, plus a Facilitation Fee that we retain to compensate us for facilitating your travel arrangements. Amounts displayed in the "Tax Recovery Charge & Service Fees" line for Save Rate hotel transactions consist of the amount that we expect the relevant hotel to charge for any applicable taxes, governmental fees and other charges (a "Tax Recovery Charge"), plus a Processing Service Fee that we retain to compensate us for processing your travel reservation through our system. For hotels located in certain jurisdictions, the Tax Recovery Charge also includes taxes on our Facilitation Fees and/or our Processing Service Fees that we are required to collect and remit to those jurisdictions. Combining the Tax Recovery Charge with our Processing Service Fee enables us to maintain the opaque nature of the "prepaid" rate. Note that at the time your hotel reservation is made, we can only estimate the amount that the relevant hotel will collect for applicable taxes, governmental fees and other charges; we will pay the full amount of those charges in any event. Please note that we are unable to facilitate a rebate of Canadian Goods and Services Tax (GST) for customers booking Canadian hotel accommodations using our services. Also, remember that you may incur other charges during your stay that are not payable to us and are not included in the quoted price, such as extra-person or extra-bed charges, resort fees, gratuities, hotel energy surcharges, parking fees, telephone fees, room service, movies, mini-bar, and incidentals..          : .
