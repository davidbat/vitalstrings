Awakening to French Monuments, Paris
Bonjour mes amis,
While you’re wandering through beautiful Paris on your next trip, you’re going to no doubt fall straight in the line of monuments and fountains. These will usually be sculptured in marble or bronze, decorated in varying degrees of  ornamentation- perhaps even coated with gold or at the very least gilded in parts. Many of them will be massive in stature. Why stop?
There are all sorts of monuments in Paris-such as those who commemorate patriotic soldiers, monuments to mark the place of historical significance, of middle class respectability, even monuments to human ingenuity. Some people walk by them. I tend not to.
My French awakening has come to realise that these monuments have one thing in common- they each tell a story. And I love stories…
So I’m sending you my photo of one of my favourite statues from Place de la Concorde- the biggest public square in Paris which was designed by Gabriel aaround 1755 for Louis XV( in his popular days). This same square (which is actually octagonal in shape and once surrounded by a moat) was the guillotine site for over thirteen hundred  French (including Louis XVI) during the Revolution.
You will find it just outside the eastern gate of the Tuileries Garden. Massive and standing above a high pedestal base, this magnificent winged horse carrying his rider always seems to remind me of the fact that we should get back on our horse when things have not been that easy and clip clop along again. Or perhaps really kick our heels in, with one arm outstretched into the air and fly?
P.S. May we all become monuments in our lifetime, with more “concorde” than “revolution”!
Au Revoir,
