The Tour Triangle is a building concept that will be erected in Paris, France, between 2016 and 2017. It is to be located in the Porte de Versailles sector, which will bring a new landmark to the area that happens to already be rich in culture due in large part to the well-known Parc des expositions. Shaped like a pyramid, the Tour Triangle will soar 180 meters high with 41 stories altogether.
Designed by Swiss architecture studio Herzog & Meudon, the Tour Triangle is another addition to an already impressive portfolio that holds such creations as the London Tate Modern and the famous National Stadium of Beijing. The Tour Triangle will be used for office space.
