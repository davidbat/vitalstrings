Paris 75008
métro: Concorde
Originally known as place Louis-XV, this square was created                            between 1755 and 1775 by the architect, Gabriel. Renamed Place                            de la Révolution in 1792, a guillotine was installed and 2800                            executions took place including that of King Louis XVI. Louis-Philippe                            christened it Place de la Concorde in 1830.
The Louqsor obelisk, a gift from the Viceroy of Egypt to King                            Charles X of France, has been standing in the centre of the                            square since 1840. The eight statues representing France's largest                            cities and the two fountains were also added at this time. The                            square is home to one of Paris' most prestigious hotels, the                            Hôtel Crillon.
Place du                            Tertre
métro: Anvers,
Funiculaire de Montmartre
Why does the Place du Tertre swarm with mediocre artists clamoring to paint your portrait? As is often the case in Paris, it's                            Baron Haussmann's fault! But for once, the good baron did some                            good along with the damage when, by razing many working-class                            neighbourhoods in central Paris, he unwittingly encouraged the                            development of Montmartre (which had been annexed to Paris in                            1860). Around 1880 began the transformation of the Butte (Hill)                            from a country village into the home of hordes of artists and                            other marginalized folk who no longer had a place in Haussmann's                            grandiose central Paris. At the foot of Montmartre cabarets                            thrived - up top on the Place du Tertre, an unimaginably (to                            us) intense period of artistic activity took hold. The Place                            saw movements from Impressionism to Cubism to Fauvism to Surrealism                            come and go; right up to the eve of World War I, such greats                            as Renoir, Picasso, Braque, Dufy, Cézanne, Manet, and Toulouse-Lautrec                            painted here and, often, kept studios and living quarters in                            the adjacent streets. These days, despite the oppressive, constant                            tourist crush on the square, one can still discover that old-time                            Paris feeling here - not to mention the fact that some of the                            current painters aren't too bad at all!
Défense                            (La)
Neighborhood:Western Suburbs
métro/RER: La Défense Grande Arche
With buildings such as the CNIT (Centre National des Industries                            et Techniques) or the Grande Arche, the architecture of the                            La Défense complex is definitely futuristic. Over 1000 major                            blue chip companies -and 15 out of 50 of the world's largest-                            have chosen to set up their head offices here. No less than                            15000 people 20000 residents and 13000 employees) walk through                            this gigantic area of scurrying activity (over 160 hectares)                            every day. La Défense also houses one of the largest shopping                            centres in Europe: the Quatre-Temps counts over 250 shops. The                            promenade on the square (a vast concrete slab which makes up                            its base) exhibits contemporary sculptures by famous artists                            such as Calder, Miro, César, Takis, etc.
