Great staff - horrible room. The staff did everything they could to make our stay more enjoyable. We were in for 5 days and we had the most uncomfortable bed we'd ever slept in. I could actually feel the springs in my back. When we complained, the staff had the maids "flip the mattress". This time, my husband was actually scratched by an exposed spring. There was no padding left!
We actually slept on the floor the last day we were there and it was far more comfortable.
Great location, though. And helpful staff.â€¦
