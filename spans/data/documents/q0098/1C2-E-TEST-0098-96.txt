Upon his    return at Seddül-Bahir, general Gourand made for a completely white    memorial stone, which com-memorates the exact spot where he was wounded.  The    small wall behind which there was a first aid post and across which the    general was thrown -by the strengh of the explosion of the shell-  and the fig    tree on which he fell are still there.
