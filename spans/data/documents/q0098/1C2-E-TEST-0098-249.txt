Located in the Benton Park Neighborhood of St. Louis, the Chatillon-DeMenil Mansion was built in two sections beginning in1848 by Henri Chatillon.  Henriâ€™s part of the mansion was a simple four room brick farmhouse.  In 1856, Henri sold the farmhouse to physician, drug store chain owner and French immigrant Dr. Nicolas N. DeMenil.  DeMenil and his wife Sophie used the farmhouse as a summer retreat until 1861, when Nicolas hired the English architect Henry Pitcher to turn the farmhouse into a Greek revival mansion, which was completed in 1863.
The DeMenil family would remain in the mansion until 1929.  From then until 1945, the property was looked after by caretakers.  That same year, Lee Hess purchased the property with the plain to make it a tourist attraction in conjunction with the natural cave system in the area.  While the caves proved popular, the mansion did not.  In the early 1960s, during the planning for Interstate-55, the mansion was under threat of demolition.  In response, the Landmarks Association of St. Louis purchased the Chatillon-DeMenil Mansion with a $40,000 gift from Union Electric as the mansion was one of the few examples of Greek revival architecture in St. Louis.  Restoration on the mansion took place from 1964 to 1965, with the formal dedication taking place in May of 1965.  After the restoration was complete, control of the mansion was handed over to the Chatillon-DeMenil Mansion Foundation.
