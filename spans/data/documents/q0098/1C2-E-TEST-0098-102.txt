This complex looms at the place of the antique city once founded by Julius Ceasar in 49 BC in the heart of today’s pedestrian town centre. The cloister’s galleries on two levels are covered by a joisting which is decorated with paintings of a bestiary dating from mid-14th century. The richness and the diversity of these designs is unique in Provence.
