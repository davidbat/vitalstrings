Saint-Pierre                             Cathedral - Map E3 (1)
The original Saint-Pierre Cathedral had been burned                         to the ground during the 1902 fire. It was rebuilt                         between 1905 and 1907 and is located on the same                         land as Saint-Pierre's original church from 1690.
Saint-Pierre's Cathedral was built in the style of Basque                       churches with the featured upper galleries with stain glass                       windows close to 100 years old;                        with the exception of those located in the transept. These windows were a gift from General Charles de Gaulle                       and unveiled during his visit in 1967.
The                         steeple was                           rebuilt in 1975 with sandstone from Alsace, France and                         rhyolite from Saint-Pierre.
Please                         remember to show respect when visiting, as while the cathedral                 is a local landmark it still functions as a place of worship.
