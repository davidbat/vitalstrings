VILLA ET JARDINS EPHRUSSI DE ROTHSCHILD -Propriété de l'Académie des Beaux-Arts de l?Institut de France  - ST JEAN CAP FERRAT
All the atmosphere of the Riviera is to be found in this enchanting site overlooking the quayside of Villefranche and Baie des Fourmis. Built by Baroness Ephrussi de Rothschild during the "Belle Epoque", this architectural "folly" was inspired by the great renaissance residences of Venice and Florence. Its seven different gardens are alone worth a visit : Spanish, Florentine, Japanese, Provençal, oriental, exotic and classic French.
CITADELLE SAINT-ELME  - VILLEFRANCHE SUR MER
To protect the County of Nice from invaders, the Duke of Savoy had the Citadel built in the 16th century, together with the satellite fortresses of Mont-Alban and Saint-Hospice, and the port of La Darse where the galleys were moored. These constructions entrusted to Italian engineers were fore-runners of a new type of bastion fortification. Today, this remarkable complex (7.5 acres) accommodates the Town Hall, the Volti, Goetz-Boumeester Museums and the Roux Collection.
