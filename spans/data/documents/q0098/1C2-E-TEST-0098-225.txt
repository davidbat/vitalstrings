#668   French Camp
Here was the terminus of the Oregon-California trail used by the French-Canadian trappers employed by the Hudson's Bay Company from about 1832 to 1845. Michel la Framboise, among others, met fur hunters here annually, where they camped with their families. In 1844 Charles M. Weber and William Gulnac promoted the first white settlers' colony on Rancho del Campo de Los Franceses, which included French Camp and the site of Stockton.
