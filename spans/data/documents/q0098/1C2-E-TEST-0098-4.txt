The Eiffel Tower
Designed by bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest building until 1930, measuring 320.75 m, including its antenna. In 1945 the Eiffel Tower was scaled by a mountaineer, and in 1984 two Englishmen parachuted off of it. One of the most interesting events in its history occurred in 1923 when a journalist rode a bicycle down from the first level.

The construction of famous Notre Dame de Paris began in 1163. This cathedral was one of the first buildings in the world to use arched exterior supports, known as flying buttresses. During the French Revolution of the 1790s, much of the cathedral's religious imagery was damaged, but during the 19th century the cathedral was restored to its previous state.
