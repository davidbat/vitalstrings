Test your French skills
This tool will help you assess your French proficiency level and point you to learning resources on BBC Languages and elsewhere on the web. The activities will help test your abilities in the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.
Listen to authentic speakers, practise speaking French, read real texts and try your hand at writing. You can also track your progress and get feedback.
Although the results of this quiz do not exactly match any national or officially recognised qualifications, youâ€™ll get a good idea of what your level is.
Good luck with your French!
