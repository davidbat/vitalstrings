Paper Summary:
In this paper, the historical premise of public monuments in French sculpture has been brought forth in the works of Rodin, Carpeaux, and Fulguiere. By realizing the different periods of time that these artists sought to represent in the struggles of the Third Republic of France, they all convey heroism through vulnerability and realistic issues of self-sacrifice for one's country. By realizing the use of the human female, male and child forms, the basis of a new way of understanding 19th century sculpture is brought forth in a new way to depict nationalistic identity.
