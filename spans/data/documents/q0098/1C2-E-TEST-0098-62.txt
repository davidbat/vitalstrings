Engraved around the top of the Arch are the names of major victories won during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. The names of less important victories, as well as those of 558 generals, can be found on the inside walls. (Generals whose names are underlined died in action.)

Admission
Inside the Arch, a small museum documents its history, architectural design and construction  complete with interactive touch screens. The price of admission includes access to the top of the Arch. From the roof, one is treated to spectacular views of Paris. Looking eastwards, down the Champs Elysées, toward the Louvre, there is the Place de la Concorde, the Tuileries Gardens, and the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. In the opposite direction - westwards - in the distance is its larger and newer cousin, La Grande Arche de la Défense.

Note: The Arch is most easily  and safely  reached via a convenient pedestrian tunnel from the north side of the Champs Elysées. Brave (or foolhardy) souls may be amazed at the reaction of motorists, if you try to cross the vortex of traffic hurtling around the circle. (We do not recommend this for the faint-of-heart!)

Escargot, anyone? Actually, this is the view from atop the spiral staircase within the Arc de Triomphe.
 
 
Biography of Jean Chalgrin
Jean François Thérèse Chalgrin {shal-gran'}, b. 1739, d. Jan. 20, 1811, was a French architect who helped initiate romantic classicism in the late 18th century. A pupil of Jean Nicolas Servandoni and Etienne Louis Boullée, Chalgrin's major innovation was the reintroduction of the basilica plan at St-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-84; not extant; Paris). This became one of the principal models for romantic classical churches throughout Europe. Chalgrin is best known for designing the Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile (1806; Paris). The megalomanic grandeur of the Arc de Triomphe relates it to the Porte St-Denis in Paris, built (1671-74) by Nicolas François Blondel, and Chalgrin adopted almost line for line the square proportions of Blondel's arch.
