29 September 1986: St. Rose Catholic Church once again blossomed as the pride and joy of French Gulch. After many years of hard work and     several thousand dollars, the 86-year-old church was starting life anew thanks to a renovation by the French Gulch Progress Club. The renovations     made the church look as good as it did on its birthday back in 1900.

19 November 1998: The historic St. Rose's Catholic Church in French Gulch burned to the ground. A passer-by reported the blaze at 11:27 p.m.,     said Capt. Jim Diehl of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Six engines responded, including members of the French Gulch Volunteer     Fire Department, but crews could not save the structure. The cause of the fire was under investigation.

10 May 1999: Shasta College archeology students under the direction of Eric Ritter sifted through the ashes of the St. Rose Catholic Church in French Gulch looking     for artifacts. Stakes and strings divided the site into a grid so researchers could keep track of where every item was found. They were trying to piece together     blueprints so they could eventually reconstruct the church.
