"Best Western in French Quarter"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
Hotel was fine. Do not accept a room on the front side. The traffic, trash removal and pedestrian traffic goes all night. Front desk clerk said only rush hour is noisey. WRONG. Second night I took sleep aid and was able to sleep. Might have well put bed in middle of blvd. If you take a room toward the back or courtyard side you might be alright.

Nice hotel, breakfast was great, just concerned about the surrounding neighborhood. We were told only to walk on one specific street which was safest in that area.

"Newly remodeled rooms & close to Bourbon Street"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The Best Western French Quarter was a very nice hotel. The rooms were beautiful. They actually seemed like they had been remodeled very recently. They had ample parking, tall enough for a luggage container on top of a Ford Explorer. Parking is extra but well worth the convenience. Stayed at the Best Western French Quarter on New Years Eve 2011. The […] staff was also very helpful telling us the safest route to travel by foot to and from Bourbon Street on a major event day. Breakfast was great also! Highly recommend! Read more

"Within walking distance to the French Quarter"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The Landmark Best Western French Quarter is a lovely, updated hotel, but several blocks away from the main attractions of the French Quarter. My room exceeded my expectations, as New Orleans in the neighborhood seemed a bit rundown. Most importantly, my room was clean and quiet, so I didn't mind walking a bit. The common area (breakfast) seemed a bit […] crowded and chaotic, but I was there at a busy time. The Front Desk was helpful and friendly. Read more

"Better than expected"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
It's an old hotel but it keeps its unique southern style quite well. It's a little far from the river, but if you stop by somewhere else, you won't feel it's far at all. The park across the street is nice! The breakfast is good! The room is a little small. It looks like the room was newly renovated. Overall, it's a good deal to get such a nice hotel […] in this area.

Reviewed by Cindyc of Santa Barbara, CA
We had stayed in center of French Quarter before cruise, but this was well within walking distance to everything. Had a great center court that was quiet and serene where we ate a late lunch. Wonderful breakfast, very nice clean rooms and great bathroom. I couldn't be anymore happy. Rampart is a little sketchy, but easy access. Great computer access/printer […] and fun bar. The only thing that could have been better is if they opened the door for us with our luggage, but I haven't noticed that anywhere. Book ahead of time to get best price. Read more

"Best Western - French Quarter"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The hotel was surprisingly good. It's just that it was far from the airport, but only a walking distance to Bourbon street (which was utterly weird) and Cafe Du Monde. My girlfriends and I stayed in a room with two double beds. The beds were comfy enough, but the room was a little cramped, especially for girls who love clothes and make-up. When we got […] back from Bourbon street one night, we were giggly and chatty when our friendly neighbor started banging on the walls for us to keep quiet. I thought that was extraordinarily rude; a simple knock on the door to politely tell us to keep our voices down would have sufficed. This led me to believe that the walls are paper thin. And the room we stayed in was not inside the hotel building, we had to walk outside to get into the main lobby. In the cold of december, this wasn't exactly desireable. The only thing that I couldn't understand with the hotel structure (apart from some of the rooms being outside the main building), was the elevator. The elevator was ridiculously small. Three of us girls could get into the elevator, and no one else could; of course, you couldn't even fit in luggage. And we are not fat, by any means. All in all, I think the hotel was pretty good. The breakfast was very nice, and the people, very friendly. It is far enough from the french quarter, so you don't get the weird noises and people around, but it's close enough to walk there. I liked it, but I would give the architect a ticket for designing such tiny elevators! Read more

Staff was very pleasant and helpful. Maid service was lacking. Rooms were dark due to Dark Brown Paint on walls. Hotel location was on the outskirts of the French Quarters - okay to be walking around by day but recommend cab during the night.

"Paying for hotel parking"
Reviewed by HenryC of Mountain Home, Idaho
I don't think one should have to pay for hotel parking when you check into a hotel. The parking should be free and that is the reason why I will not let my family members stay there for our family reunion in August 2012. I came there to see how far we were from the major attractions in New Orleans.

We were pleased from the front desk through our departure. The entire staff, from the front desk to housekeeping, were excellent; good attitudes and very pleasant. The breakfast was good.

We chose this hotel because it was close enough to the French Quarter that we could walk to the attractions but not be in the middle of the fray. This hotel served that purpose well (even though it was a bit noisy still).
