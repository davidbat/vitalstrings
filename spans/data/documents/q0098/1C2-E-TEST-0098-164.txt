Essay on French Monuments Review
Eiffel Tower, wrought-iron tower in Paris, a landmark and an early example of wrought-iron construction on a gigantic scale. It was designed and built by the French civil engineer Gustave Alexandre Eiffel for the Paris World's Fair of 1889. The tower, without its modern broadcasting antennae, is 300 m (984 ft) high. The lower section consists of four immense arched legs set on masonry piers. The legs curve inward until they unite in a single tapered tower. Platforms, each with an observation deck, are at three levels; on the first is also a restaurant. The tower, constructed of about 6300 metric tons (about 7000 tons) of iron, has stairs and elevators. A meteorological station, a radio communications station, and a television transmission antenna, as well as a suite of rooms that were used by Eiffel, are located near the top of the tower.

Notable for its elegant proportions, it was a model for the French Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages. An earlier church (perhaps preceded by a Roman temple) probably existed on the site of the present building, which was begun in 1163 by Bishop Maurice de Sully and completed, for the most part, by 1250. The original plan was later compromised by the construction (late 13th and early 14th centuries) of a run of side chapels completely encircling the nave and choir.
The west front of the cathedral is a classic of French Gothic style (see� Gothic Art and Architecture), with three richly carved portals, or doorways. The central portal depicts the biblical story of the Last Judgment. The north and south transept fronts, which date from the second half of the 13th century, are decorated with two rose windows, circular stained-glass windows constructed using a technique called bar tracery, an elaborate stone support system. Another rose window, at the west front of the cathedral, is considered a masterpiece of Gothic engineering for its large glass surface area, which is supported by a seemingly delicate web of carved stone tracery.
The cathedral's interior, 35 m (115 ft) tall, has lost most of its medieval glass, as well as its original fittings (largely removed during liturgical reorderin
