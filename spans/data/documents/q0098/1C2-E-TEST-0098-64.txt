Shops at French Lick & West Baden
 
Sophisticated and eclectic describes the variety you'll find at Indiana Landmarks’ museum stores in the French Lick and West Baden Springs Hotels. Our Landmarks Emporium shops at West Baden and French Lick carry merchandise inspired by the past yet hip and in-the-moment. The shops are also outlets to purchase tickets for our guided tours .
 
In both stores, you’ll find items with images of the landmarks as mementos of your visit, as well as books about each place.
 
Although the two stores carry different merchandise, each place offers vintage-inspired jewelry and other accessories, books (history, biography, fiction), greeting cards, home décor, and toys and books for children.
 
Indiana Landmarks members who present a membership card receive 10% purchases in both shops.
 
Shop for a good cause 
You can feel virtuous while you shop: your purchases at both Landmarks Emporium shops benefit Indiana Landmarks' work to save and restore historic places throughout the state.
