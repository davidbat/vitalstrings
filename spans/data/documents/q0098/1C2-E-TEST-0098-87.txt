French National Monuments and Museums now free for anybody under 26
The French National Monuments and Museums are now free for anybody under 26. Not all the Monuments and Museums are under the National tag but that represents more than 100 of the most famous and visited French museums and monuments. Not having to pay for the kids entrance will be a nice savings when visiting a country where the currency and cost of living are high (and it is even better if you are young parents under 26 with children !)
This law applies to the most famous museums and monuments in Paris : Le Louvre, Musee d’Orsay, Musee Picasso, Musee Rodin, the Versailles Castle, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Notre Dame Tower.
I have included the complete list of museums and monuments (If you click on the name, you will access to their website if they have one).
If you have any questions about any of them, feel free to email me at travelismorefunwithkids@gmail.com and I will find the information for you.
