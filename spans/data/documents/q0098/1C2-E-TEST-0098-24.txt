Notre Dame de Paris
Notre Dame de Paris
is probably the most famous cathedral in France. It is the place, where all dramatic national and religious events have been celebrated. Notre Dame de Paris is widely considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Notre Dame de Paris was one of the first Gothic cathedrals, and its construction spanned the Gothic period. Its sculptures and stained glass show the heavy influence of naturalism, giving them a more secular look that was lacking from earlier Romanesque architecture. Notre Dame de Paris was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress. The cathedral suffered desecration during the radical phase of the French Revolution in the 1790s, when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. During the 19th century, an extensive restoration project was completed, returning the cathedral to its previous state.
OPENING HOURS:
The cathedral is open every day of the year from 8:00 am to 6:45 pm (7:15 pm on Saturdays and Sundays).
Access to the cathedral is open and free of charge ever day of the year, during the opening hours.
