The Eiffel Tower, no need for me to explain any more, I think it’s one of the most recognizable structures in the world and become a global icon of France. We went there when it’s a drizzle day, but still there were so many people waiting in line for visiting. The most impression for me there is several couples were embracing each other in the rain with long passionate kiss under the tower, the feeling is really quite romantic… onto the tower you can have a panoramic view of the whole Paris city.

The Palace of Versailles located in the suburb of Paris, some twenty kilometers southwest of the French capital. it was the official residence of the Kings of France from 1682 until 1790. Now it’s a national museum. It’s famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien Régime. There the French classical architecture was complemented by extensive gardens. This photo is taken at the fairy tale park around it.
In general, France is a really nice place to visit, its classic architecture and strong artistic atmosphere really gave me a good memory.
