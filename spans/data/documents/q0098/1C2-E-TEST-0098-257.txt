Paris, also known as the City of Light, is famous for its history, art, architecture and cuisine. What many visitors do not know, however, is that the French capital contains several green spaces frequented by outdoor enthusiasts. The Bois de Boulogne, a forested area containing paths suitable for jogging, is one of the city's many large public spaces. Registered hiking paths can also be found throughout the city for visitors looking to explore the city on foot. The carefully designed paths allow a tour of many of Paris' most famous museums and monuments.
Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile
The Arc de Triomphe on the Champs Elysees was first envisioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 and was later dedicated in 1836 by French king Louis-Phillipe, who dedicated it to soldiers of the French Revolution. The arch today is considered a monument to the old and the new and contains four relief sculptures completed by three different artists. The Arc itself was inspired by the Roman Arch of Titus. Visitors experience French history on interactive displays located inside the monument and sweeping views await those who visit the top. The Arc de Triomphe is open most days of the year, although times can change depending on holidays, private events and ceremonies. Check the official website for updates. An admission fee is collected.
