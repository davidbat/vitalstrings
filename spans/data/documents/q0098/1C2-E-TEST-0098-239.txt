Bastille                   :
History
The Bastille has alot of importance to the French history.                     By crossing the Seine and following the Boulevard de la Bastille,                     you will find the site of the Bastille Saint-Antoine, which                     was a major part of the defences ordered by Charles V, built                     from 1370. Louis XIV had the ramparts demolished but kept                     the Bastille as a luxury prison for people of quality.
Promoted to the rank of a symbol of the arbitrariness of                     the old monarchy, the Bastille was stormed by the Parisians                     on                   14th July 1789, and later razed. To remember not the surrender                   of the prison with its last seven occupants in 1789, but the                   July Revolution of 1830, which replaced the autocratic Charles                   X with the "Citizen King" Louis-Philippe, a column                   surmounted by the "Spirit of Liberty" on place de                 la Bastille was erected.
Four months after the birth of the Second Republic in that                     year, the workers took to the streets. All of eastern Paris                     was barricaded, with the fiercest fighting on rue du Faubourg-St-Antoine.                     The rebellion was quelled with the usual massacres and deportation                     of survivors, but it is still the less contentious 1789 Bastille                     Day that France celebrates. Political protestors have always,                     however, used place de la Bastille as a rallying point, and                   still do.
A sign of the Bastille Opera's vocation is that the metro                   exit is in the hall where shopping area have also been planned.
The Neighborhood
The Bastille in the past
Where at one time , this area was filled with low-rent housing,                       today, this is one of the most trendy areas of Paris. You                       can find anything from old tool shops and ironmongers alongside                       cocktail haunts and sushi bars; laundries and cobblers flank                     electronic notebooks outlets.
The Bastille Today
You'll find art galleries clustered around rues Keller, Tamandiers                       and the adjoining stretch of rue de Charonne. And, on rue                       de Lappe, a very Parisian tradition : the "bals musettes",                       or dance halls of the1930s "gai Paris", frequented                 between the wars by Piaf, Jean Gabin and Rita Hayworth.
Day and Night Life
The most famous bals musette,"The Balajo", rue de                     Lappe was founded by Jo de France, who introduced glitter                 and spectacle into what were then seedy gangster dives, and brought                     Parisians from the other side of the city to savour the rue                     de Lappe lowlife.
The rue de Lappe can still be as dodgy a place to be at night                     as it was in prewar days. The bouncers at clubs like the Chapelle                     des Lomobards, and at Balajo itself, the heavy drug scene and                     the uneasy mix of local residents have taken the soul away                     from a street that ten years ago deserved the special affection                 that Parisians of all sorts gave it.
