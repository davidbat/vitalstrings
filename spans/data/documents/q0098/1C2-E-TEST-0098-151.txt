Place de la Concorde
The Place de la Concorde separates the Tuileries gardens starting at the Champs-Elysees, just a walk down from the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre. Inside the public square's boundaries you will find the Obelisk, given to the French by Egypt in 1829. In the late 18th century, Place de la Concorde was the location of over 2,800 executions, including Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette and Robespierre. Today, many see the site as a symbol of the end of a bad era in French history. The square is in such a convenient location that you can enjoy a crepe, stroll in the park or a nearby neighborhood.
