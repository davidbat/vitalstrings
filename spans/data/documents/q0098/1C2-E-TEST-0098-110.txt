Tours at French Lick & West Baden
 
Unprecedented in the nation, the grand hotels in French Lick and West Baden Springs—both listed in the National Register of Historic Places and located one mile apart in southern Indiana—offer a fascinating window on the grand hotel era of the early twentieth century and the tradition of “taking the waters.”
 
Guests from Al Capone to FDR, Bing Crosby to Helen Keller, captains of industry and pampered socialites came to imbibe the waters and take spa treatments, enjoy sports and entertainments, and perhaps test their luck in the casinos.
 
Today, the lavishly restored French Lick and West Baden Springs Hotels still draw visitors for the same pursuits. Like Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, and Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, French Lick and West Baden Springs offer overnight accommodations in an atmosphere steeped in history.
 
Indiana Landmarks leads one-hour guided tours of the hotels, highlighting their fascinating histories, stunning architecture and gardens, and award-winning restorations.
