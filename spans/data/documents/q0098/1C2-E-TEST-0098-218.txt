Mon Petit Café
Landmark for French cuisine since 1984
Cozy, cute French bistro with an authentic French vibe. Crepes, Quiches, and Croque Monsieurs unique to New York City are what sets apart lunch at Mon Petit Café from other restaurants. Always on the menu are traditional French specialties such as Steak Au Poivre and Sole Meuniere.
Dinner is warmly candle-lit and romantic and provide the perfect atmosphere for any occasion. Highly liked by loyal customers after 26 years Mon Petit Café has become a landmark for French cuisine.
