Landmarks of the french north Alps
Annecy-Geneva-Mont-Blanc.com: Your website to pleasure!
Annecy and its immaculate lake surrounded by mountains is an absolute gem. On the list for the 2018 Winter Olympics Games it already offers all amenities because of its super equipped resorts.
Geneva and its majestic lake is a renowned international city. Luxury, arts and finance makes it the epitome of a welcoming swiss beehive. With its international airport and a long history with nearby France, it is the entrance to this region.
Mont Blanc is the highest peak of the Alps and is surrounded by numerous well known ski resorts. With Chamonix, a center for alpine activities at its feet and close to Italy and Switzerland, I welcome you to this magnificent region.
I'll take you to places where you'll feel welcomed, show you family walks, get you to taste lovely wines and tell you some local history. I don't know it all but I have spent years living there. My mother, my wife and my kids were born there. And if I have been schooled, lived and worked on five continents, my heart is here and I'll open it to you.
From Art de Vivre to Adrenaline you'll get it all!
