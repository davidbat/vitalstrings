Butte de Warlencourt, Le Sars
50.07581492007727
2.7948778867721558
The Butte de Warlencourt is an artificial hill used as a location of strategic        high ground in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 and again in the Battles of the Somme in 1916 and 1918.        The Butte was full of tunnels even before the        Germans fortified it in the First World War. The Butte was taken by the British when the German Army retreated        to the Hindenburg Line in February 1917, but was retaken during the German offensive in March 1918. The British        21st Division captured the Butte on 25th August 1918 during the Allied Advance to Victory.
The Butte has been owned by The Western Front Association since 1990. There is a memorial plaque and bronze        diorama on the summit. Access may be restricted depending on the cover of undergrowth over the path and        the views from the summit may also be limited by the trees.
