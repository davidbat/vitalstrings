Start with No.10
International landmarks are great and deserve to be seen, but there a lot of national sites also worth a visit -- no passport required. 
Even after limiting our geography to the United States, it wasn’t easy to restrict ourselves to just 10 landmarks. Any given state has 10 landmarks worth seeing, and any given major city easily has that too. So, what do the chosen represent? Hopefully, they form an around-the-nation perspective as diverse as America itself: natural, man-made, modern, classic, peaceful, tumultuous, and above all, not seen anywhere else.
