Private Wine Room
Sunlight illuminates the eponymous hues at lunchtime while evenings feel as Parisian as the restaurant’s two Michelin stars. In the inviting, elegant dining room of interiors by visionary Adam Tihany, Hong Kong’s most conveniently located power tables sit at generous intervals for privacy while allowing diners to cast their eyes upon enticing contemporary French dishes coming from the talent-filled kitchen of Chef Richard Ekkebus.
Trained in the illustrious kitchens of Alain Passard, Guy Savoy and Pierre Gagnaire, the Dutchman cooks firmly in the French tradition while taking full advantage of Hong Kong’s unique crossroads between East and West, incorporating amadai fish line caught and delivered the same day from Japan, seasonal blue lobsters from Brittany, Tasmanian truffles, Spanish fraise de bois and Chinese dragonfruit.
Pair Amber classic dishes like Mieral Bresse pigeon breast with wild cep mushrooms with Sommelier’s selection of 1,100 plus references, all artisanal, top quality wines culled from old world vintages in France and Italy as well as exciting bottles sourced from Chile, Argentina and Portugal.
Surrounded on all sides by the restaurant’s glass-clad wine cellar, the Private Wine Room can seat up to twenty guests and confers the ideal spot to sip and celebrate milestones, personal and professional, not soon to be forgotten.
Discreet, well-informed staff fluently recommends dishes yet offer a fresh absence of pretention that encourages diners to ask questions and develop their palate on every return.
