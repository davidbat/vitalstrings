Points          of Interest on the New Orleans French Quarter Map:
The French Quarter (or Vieux Carre)          was the original city center, and          still retains much of the architecture          it had three hundred years ago. You'll          still find cobblestone streets and          gas lamps. The French Quarter is famous          for its bars and nightclubs (go to Bourbon Street for the largest          concentration of bars), antiques and          art galleries (Royal Street is the hub for those pursuits), live          music, quirky museums and great restaurants          on seemingly every corner.
Along          the Mississippi River, Waldenberg          Park provides green space and          views of ships passing by. At the          end of the park is the Audubon Institute's Aquarium of the Americas and IMAX theater. Keep walking          into the neighboring Warehouse          District for the Riverwalk          Marketplace shopping center, Harrah's          Casino and the Ernest N. Morial          Convention Center.
Jax          Brewery has shops and restaurants          like the Hard Rock Caf√©.          Next to it, the Moonwalk, named          for a former New Orleans mayor and          not for the celestial body, is a good          place to rest your weary feet and          hear an impromtpu saxophonist. Cafe          du Monde is world-famous for beignets,          the fried donut covered with powdered          sugar. The French Market is          a fruit and vegetable stand during          the week, and a full-blown flea market          on weekends -- a great place for inexpensive          souvenirs.
Jackson          Square is a small public park          flanked by fortune tellers and artists.          Just outside, St. Louis Cathedral is open for tours whenever mass is          not being held.
