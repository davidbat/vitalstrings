La Salle Monument
Dr. Lee W. Woodard  discovered that Rene Robert Cavelier De La Salle  was assassinated at the juncture of Fourche Maligne and  Poteau rivers in eastern Oklahoma.  James (Jimmy) Hiens crafted the  Normandy French Heavener Runestone in 1687 to memorialize that infamous  death place. Hiens also made the 1687 burial crypt for the La Salle expedition members, Duhaut and Liotot,  which was previously known as The Van Buren Arkansas  Mystery Grave.
 The grave of La Salle expedition drowning  victim, Petit Jean De Marne (Marle), is at the East  end of Petit Jean mountain of Arkansas, and became  the basis for Arkansas legends of Petit Jean. These  1684-1687 La Salle expedition archeological and historic  landmarks vitally involve french colonial,  Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas history, as well as Arkansas and Oklahoma state parks, which do not yet  properly understand their Landmarks. This discovery also has great importance  for the study of native American society during 1600's,  since La Salle Expedition participants vividly described the Native Customs of  Coenis and Assonis Indians now known to have been located near Spiro Native American Mounds and junctures of Poteau and Arkansas Rivers. 
These discoveries are told in Dr. Woodard's books: Secret La Salle Monument and Historical Marker, Petit Jean's Mountain, "7 Noms" At Wicked Fork Where La  Salle Died, and in his Forthcoming La Salle's Last Year: Including Relevant Arkansas and Oklahoma Landmarks.

Secret La Salle Monument
 & Historical Marker
Mysterious        Heavener, Oklahoma Runestone is a 1687 Normandy French        Monument. It tells  the nearby Death Locations of Famous French Explorer        Robert Cavelier de La Salle and six others. This book tells the initial        discovery.
Woodard discovered that  this large Runestone oddity is not of Scandinavian Origin, as incorrectly  advertised for so long at an Oklahoma State Park. It is instead a 1687 Normandy French Memorial  Monument.  
It uses Normandy French Runes  (La Salle was from Rouen Normandie) for concealing French messages from  Spanish Soldiers. La Salle's tragedy-plagued Matagorda Bay Area French  colonization attempt was into territories claimed by Spain since the early  1500's. La Salle and his men were encroaching upon Spanish American Terrain  (even when penetrating to the Poteau and Arkansas River Valleys).

Petit Jean's Mountain
 The Origin of the Legend
Fascinating        true life story of the 1687 Historic La Salle Expedition Drowning        Tragedy which claimed life of a young French Noble. That death resulted        in the Old Arkansas oral Legends about Petit Jean's Mountain and        River.      This is an important sequel to        the book "Secret La Salle Monument And Historical Marker."
Oklahoma La        Salle discoveries convinced Dr. Lee Woodard that on St.        Jeans Day, June 24, 1687, the seven fleeing French survivors of the La        Salle expedition were at what is now known as Petit Jean Mountain of        Arkansas.
On that date, says Woodard, young French        Noble, de Marne, drowned in the nearby Arkansas river, and was buried        near the top of Petit Jean Mountain.
