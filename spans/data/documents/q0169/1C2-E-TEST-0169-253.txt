20  Sparse Matrices
This chapter describes the use of sparse matrices in Octave. For matrices where a large number of the elements are zero, Octave provides a sparse matrix type which stores only the non-zero elements. This reduces the amount of memory required and allows unnecessary operations involving empty elements to be avoided.
