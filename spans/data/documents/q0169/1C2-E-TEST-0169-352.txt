Sparse Matrix Screening in Protein Crystallization
Nov 1, 2009
Sparse matrix screening involves a combination of conditions (varying: pH, buffer, additive and precipitant) that have previously generated protein crystals.
This type of screening process is often recommended as the first method to attempt with a protein that has not been previously crystallized. Jancarik & Kim introduced this type of screening 1991.
