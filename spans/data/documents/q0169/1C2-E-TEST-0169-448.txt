I am new in C language and want to be good in it. I am trying to write
the program for Spare matrix operations using linked list. I got some
success but in many scenarios it fails to give proper results in
summation. I have to start coding the multiplication also. Can anybody
give me algorithm and sample code for operations on spare matrix using
linked list.
