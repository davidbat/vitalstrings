Parallel Preconditioners for Sparse Iterative Methods
Known Bugs and Issues
Please refer to the section titled "Recent Changes and Other Important  Notes" in the Users' Guide before upgrading to a newer version of the  software.
On AIX, setting the environment variable RT_GRQ to ON if smt_threads are enabled can result in performance degradation.  RT_GRQ must be set to OFF if smt_threads are enabled and ON if smt_threads are disabled.
On Linux, setting the environment variables MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ and MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_ to -1 and 0, respectively, yields the best performance,  especially for the unsymmetric and symmetric indefinite solvers.  However,  setting MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ to -1 can lead to memory problems when multiple processes are running on the same node/machine.   In such cases, a reasonable value between 1000000 and 100000000 could be used.
On AIX, the environment variables SPINLOOPTIME and YIELDLOOPTIME must be set to 200, AIXTHREAD_COND_DEBUG and AIXTHREAD_MUTEX_DEBUG must be set to OFF.
The distributed-memory parallel  unsymmetric solver can use only one thread per process when using an MPI implementation that is not thread-safe.   Therefore, the WSETMAXTHRDS routine must be used to set the number of  threads to 1 in such an environment. MPI_INIT_THREAD must be used for initializing MPI-2 with the appropriate level of thread support.
Running WSMP in 64-bit mode with multiple threads on certain Linux  distributions can result in severe memory fragmentation or memory leaks.  This  is due to a bug in the glibc malloc library, and is not a WSMP bug.   If you encounter this problem, then please download the file tcml.tar.gz and follow the instructions in  this README file to bypass glibc malloc and use Google's TCmalloc library instead.  This should fix the problem.
HP-UX, Tru64, Altix, and SunOS are not supported any more. Older versions of the  libraries for these platforms can be requested by e-mail.  The latest version of WSMP can also be built for these platforms if access to the hardware can be arranged.
Miscellaneous
Link for downloading GOTO BLAS libraries to speed up WSMP on certain platforms.
