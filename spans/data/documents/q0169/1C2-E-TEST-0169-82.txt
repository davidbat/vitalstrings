ABSTRACT To study the effect of individual genes by segregation or linkage analyses, the likelihood of the model needs to be evaluated. The likelihood can be computed efficiently using the Elston-Stewart algorithm. This algorithm involves summing over the unobserved genotypes in the pedigree, which…

Abstract. Given a partitioning of a sparse matrix for parallel matrix-vector multiplication, which determines the total communication volume, we try to find a suitable vector partitioning that balances the communication load among the processors. We present a new lower bound for the maximum…
