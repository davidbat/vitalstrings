Recovery of low-rank matrices has recently seen significant activity in many areas of science and engineering, motivated by recent theoretical results for exact reconstruction guarantees and interesting practical applications. In this paper, we present novel recovery algorithms for estimating low-rank matrices in matrix completion and robust principal component analysis based on sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) principles. Starting from a matrix factorization formulation and enforcing the low-rank constraint in the estimates as a sparsity constraint, we develop an approach that is very effective in determining the correct rank while providing high recovery performance. We provide connections with existing methods in other similar problems and empirical results and comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods that illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.
  Bayesian Group-Sparse Modeling and Variational Inference by S. Derin Babacan , Shinichi Nakajima , Minh N. Do . The abstract reads:
In this paper, we present a general class of multivariate priors for group-sparse modeling within the Bayesian framework. We show that special cases of this class correspond to multivariate versions of several classical priors used for sparse modeling. Hence, this general prior formulation is helpful in analyzing the properties of different modeling approaches and their connections. We derive the estimation procedures with these priors using variational inference for fully Bayesian estimation. In addition, we discuss the differences between the proposed inference and deterministic inference approaches with these priors. Finally, we show the flexibility of this modeling by considering several extensions such as multiple measurements, within-group correlations and overlapping groups.
