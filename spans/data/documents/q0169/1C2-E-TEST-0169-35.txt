arg1, shape=None, dtype=None, copy=False
)
A sparse matrix in COOrdinate format.
Also known as the ‘ijv’ or ‘triplet’ format.
This can be instantiated in several ways:
coo_matrix(D)
with a dense matrix D
coo_matrix(S)
with another sparse matrix S (equivalent to S.tocoo())
coo_matrix((M, N), [dtype])
to construct an empty matrix with shape (M, N) dtype is optional, defaulting to dtype=’d’.
coo_matrix((data, (i, j)), [shape=(M, N)])
to construct from three arrays:
data[:]   the entries of the matrix, in any order
i[:]      the row indices of the matrix entries
j[:]      the column indices of the matrix entries
Where A[i[k], j[k]] = data[k].  When shape is not specified, it is inferred from the index arrays
Notes
Sparse matrices can be used in arithmetic operations: they support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and matrix power.
Advantages of the COO format
facilitates fast conversion among sparse formats
permits duplicate entries (see example)
very fast conversion to and from CSR/CSC formats
Disadvantages of the COO format
does not directly support:
