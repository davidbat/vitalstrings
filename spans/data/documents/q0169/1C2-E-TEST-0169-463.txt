SPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.
Dictionary learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...)
Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate descent, OMP, SOMP, proximal methods
Solving structured sparse decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse group lasso, tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with overlapping groups,...).
See the documentation for all the features.
It is developped by Julien Mairal , with the collaboration of Francis Bach (INRIA), Jean Ponce ( Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure ), Guillermo Sapiro ( University of Minnesota ), Rodolphe Jenatton (INRIA) and Guillaume Obozinski (INRIA).  It is coded in C++ with a Matlab interface. Recently, interfaces for R and Python have been developed by Jean-Paul Chieze (INRIA).
