I was trying to make an app for my website using web view. Am almost done, but the problem is when I try to download songs, the music player opens and starts playing. I want it to download files rather than playing. I canâ€™t change the file streaming settings on the server side, I must make the app to download files by itself, is that possible?? thanks in advance.
my site is http://www.songsdl.in
