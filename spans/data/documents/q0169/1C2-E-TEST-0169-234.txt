Represent the given sparse matrix using Linked List MC9217 DATA STRUCTURES LAB Anna University lab manual download
Aim: To write a program to represent Sparse Matrix using Linked list
Algorithm:
Enter      the row and column matrix
Read the      value of m and n
Set      for loop i< row as i=1 and another loop i < col as j=1
Read      value of x
If we      choose insert then check if (sparse == Null ) then sparse =p
      Else check while (q-> next != Null ) then q = q-> next; q-> next =p
If we      choose display than for i=1 to r then check p=p->next
stop
Logical Description      
A matrix that has relatively few non-zero entries. It may be represented in much less than n × m space.  
An n × m matrix with k non-zero entries is sparse if k << n × m. It may be faster to represent the matrix compactly as a list of the non-zero indexes and associated entries, as a list of lists of entries (one list for each row), coordinate format (the values and their row/column positions), or by a point access method .  It is implemented with linked list
