Commercial Crystallization Kits
The Crystallization Facility utilizes commercial kits from Emerald Biosystems , Hampton Research , and Qiagen . For initial screening of samples we typically recommend 4-8 screens consisting of: Crystal Screen 1-2, Index, JCSG+, PACT, PEG-ion/Cryo, SaltRx, Wizard 1-2, and AmSO4.
Please note, only underlined screens are kept ready to use for crystallization trials. You must contact me well ahead of time in order to use any other screen.
