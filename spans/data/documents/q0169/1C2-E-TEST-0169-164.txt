A sparse matrix is    any matrix that contains very few non-zero elements? Or said the    other way, a sparse matrix is any matrix who's elements are    mostly zeros. For example, the matrix below is sparse.
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
Sparse matrices occur often in science and    engineering problems. In addition, real world problems often generate large    sparse matrices.
 
MATLAB has a special data type for storing and    manipulating sparse matrices because:
You can save memory by not storing all of the zero     elements in a sparse matrix.
Vector and matrix operations can be sped up     significantly by not processing the elements that are zero.
 
Therefore, using sparse matrices allows for the    calculation of larger problem sizes (because of the memory and CPU time    savings) as compared to using "normal" (full) arrays.
 
You can create a sparse    matrix in MATLAB using the following commands
MATLAB function
Description
speye(n)
% Create an identity matrix (all 1's down the diagonal) that      has n rows and n columns, but      store it as a sparse matrix.
sprand(n,m,density) .
% Create a sparse matrix that has n rows and m columns, with a specified      density (a fraction between 0 and 1). For example, if the      density is 0.1, approximately 10% of the elements in the matrix      will be non-zero.
sprandn(n,m,density)
% Same as sprand(), except the non-zero elements are random in a      normal distribution.
 
You can convert between a    full matrix and a sparse matrix using the following commands
