Sparse Matrix
A sparse matrix is a matrix that allows special techniques to take advantage of the large number of zero elements. This definition helps to define "how many" zeros a matrix needs in order to be "sparse." The answer is that it depends  on what the structure of the matrix is, and what you want to do with it. For example,  a randomly generated sparse
matrix  with
entries scattered randomly throughout  the matrix is not sparse in the sense of Wilkinson (for direct methods) since it  takes
time to factorize (with high probability  and for large enough
; Gilbert et al. 1992).
