Partial factorization and Schur complement matrix (centralized or 2D block-cyclic);
Interfaces to MUMPS: Fortran, C, Matlab and Scilab;
Several orderings interfaced: AMD, AMF, PORD, METIS, PARMETIS, SCOTCH, PT-SCOTCH.
Recent features
Detection of null pivots, null space basis estimate;
Symmetric indefinite matrices:   preprocesssing and 2-by-2 pivots
Hybrid scheduling;
Computation of the determinant (with an option to discard factors);
Sparse multiple right-hand side, distributed solution;
A fully asynchronous distributed solver (VAMPIR trace)
Implementation
Distributed Multifrontal Solver (F90, MPI based);
Dynamic Distributed Scheduling to accomodate both numerical fill-in and    multi-user environment;
Use of BLAS, BLACS, ScaLAPACK.
