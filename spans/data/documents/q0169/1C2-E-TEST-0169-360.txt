Dear Prof. Davis,
Thank you for your suggestions.
To find the inverse of large sparse matrix A which is
360000*360000,  I use the command
B= A \speye(360000)
But I get the error message
??? Error using ==> mldivide
Out of memory. Type HELP MEMORY for your options.
How can I solve this problem?
Thanks.

I need to find the inverse of a very large sparse
matrix.
The size of the matrix is 360000.
The problem is that Matlab yields : "Out of
memory" ,when I
I tried to find the inverse of A by using the command
C=A\speye(360000). But C*A is not equal to identity
matrix.
Why it is not working?
If somebody knows how to I find the inverse of sparse
large matrix simply, please help me.
Thanks.
The solution is to never ever to compute the inverse of a
sparse matrix.
If dmperm reports that the matrix is a single block
(nblocks
= length(r)-1 from the r output of dmperm) then your
inverse
will be completely nonzero.  The largest block of size
max(diff(r)) will be dense, if nblocks > 1.  If that is
large, then it's hopeless trying to invert your sparse
matrix.
If you are wanting to multiply by the inverse of a sparse
matrix, then use backslash instead.
