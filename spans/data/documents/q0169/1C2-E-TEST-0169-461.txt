Questions about  David MacKay's Sparse graph code resources are answered here.
This is a database of sparse graph codes.   Properties recorded include the codes' parity check matrices,   their rates and minimum distances,   their empirical performance on the binary input Gaussian noise channel,   and histograms of decoding times.
These Codes and Related Data  are made freely available under the  conditions that  (1) when they are used, the authors of the codes and the data  and this archive are acknowledged; (2) the authors of the   codes and data are not liable for any inaccuracies   in the materials presented here or any failure of   the codes to work as hoped.
Please scroll down to enter the archive
Note: there are  more codes that I have simulated  that have not yet made it into this archive.  If you have any requests for additions, email me. With appropriate  incentives (eg financial support for my group), I can probably help.
