Fast sparse matrix vector product description
Fast sparse matrix vector product - sparse matrix vector product
This is a dedicated mex-file to efficiently compute the Sparse-Matrix-Vector-Product (smvp).
x = smvp(A,b);
This is generally 4 times faster than x = A*b for large A (On my machine).
Type "help smvp" and "smvp_demo" for more information.
NOTE: You will need either windows or the MATLAB compiler to use this function. A pre-compiled version is included, but you can re-compile via:
mex -O smvp.c
