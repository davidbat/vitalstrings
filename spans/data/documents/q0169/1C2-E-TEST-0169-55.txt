sparse matrix A matrix usually arising in the context of linear algebraic equations of the form Ax = b in which A is of large order and has a high proportion of zero elements (greater than, say, 90%). Special techniques are available that exploit the large number of zeros and reduce considerably the computational effort when compared to a general full matrix. Examples of such methods are variants of Gaussian elimination (see linear algebraic equations ) and iteration methods. Large sparse systems can arise in the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations . See also numerical linear algebra .
