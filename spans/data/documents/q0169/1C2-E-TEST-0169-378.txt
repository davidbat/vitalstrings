Do you have access to Parallel Computing Toolbox ? Otherwise, you can code in Fortran using LAPACK (or whichever library you prefer) and link it to MATLAB using MEX. –  Nunoxic Apr 26 at 10:52
Thanks to Nunixic! I don't know Fortran. I know Parallel Computing Toolbox, but I have no experience . I know the function eig to compute eigenvalues in MATLAB, but I don't know the way to use parallelism for this, or I have to code for computation eigenvalues myself and then parallel it. If you know, please give me some guides. Thanks! –  HongTu Apr 26 at 11:09
Hi HongTu.  Welcome to SciComp :)  I'm curious... are you looking to implement the computation of eigenvalues yourself, or are you looking for a MATLAB routine that already computes them in parallel?  Also, do you need all the eigenvalues, or just one in particular (e.g. spectral radius)? –  Paul♦ Apr 26 at 13:44
Hi Paul, thanks for your consideration for my problem. I'm really trying to code it myself. But I also look for the already parallelism for this because I haven't more time for my project at university. I don't need all the eigenvalues, just some largest or smallest eigenvalues. I have a similarity matrix of image, so this matrix is very large. So I think parallelism for the computation will get better performance. But I'm new in parallel computation. So I really need some guides. Thanks! –  HongTu Apr 26 at 14:53
I haven't worked on MATLAB's PCT much but MATLAB"s newsletter and this article at OSC could be good starting points. Seems like what you need is overloaded functions on codistributed arrays . How do you access the matrix? If you have the MATRIX explicitly available (or you read from file or whatever), writing a parallel eigen solver is sell than 20 lines in FORTRAN when linked to an LAPACK. –  Nunoxic Apr 26 at 16:39
