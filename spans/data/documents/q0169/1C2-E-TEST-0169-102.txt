You can also use the rule syntax
with Mathematica patterns to create structured sparse matrices. This example makes a tridiagonal matrix:
In[5]:=
Out[6]//MatrixForm=
More complicated matrices can be made with Band . In this example a band is created along the antidiagonal:
In[7]:=
Out[8]//MatrixForm=
You can also create sparse matrices by importing one of the sparse matrix formats such as Harwell-Boeing or Matrix Market.
This imports a sample 961×961 matrix that has 10591 nonzero elements:
Out[9]=
    
Functions that work with dense matrices typically work with sparse matrices. Often they will use special sparse matrix techniques that are faster and work without ever converting to a dense matrix. This leads to large savings of time and memory.
This creates a banded sparse matrix:
