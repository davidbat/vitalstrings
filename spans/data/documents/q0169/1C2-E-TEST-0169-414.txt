w(t) = exp(tA)v is the analytic solution of the homogeneous ODE problem:
w'(t) = Aw(t), w(0) = v.
w(t) = exp(tA)v + t*phi(tA)u, where phi(x) = (exp(x)-1)/x, is the analytic solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE problem:
w'(t) = Aw(t) + u, w(0) = v.
Expokit handles both cases.
Frequently Asked Questions
From Computing Reviews: "This amazingly complete paper gives the theoretical background of the methods, presents applications, provides computational results for a standard set of pathological matrices, and closes with a mini-user's manual (...) It is entirely self-contained (...) Here we are given several sure ways to compute (...) exponentials, and these with rather sharp error bounds."
