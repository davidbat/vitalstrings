Sorry, looks like I sent this unfinished 1st message unwittingly...
I am currently in my final year at University, and my personal project
involves sparse computing on multicore processors. We may skip the
"multicore" part because I first need to get a good grasp on the basic
of sparse matrices...
I am trying to write a class that will generate a sparse matrix
(having nature of a continuous-time Markov chain). Is there any
example of such class available on the internet?
I still haven't found anything relevant. Could you please help me out?
There is quite a bit, including code, on the subject in _Applying C++_ by
Scott Robert Ladd.  I would expect a decent University library to have that
book or at least access to it.
