Using a high-level-language to hardware-description-language compiler and some novel architectures and algorithms to map two  well-known double-precision floating-point sparse matrix iterative-linear-equation solvers--the Jacobi and conjugate gradient methods--onto a reconfigurable computer achieves more than a twofold speedup over software.
