I would like to know if there is a way to calculate the singular

When i use the matlab's SVD function its gives "out of memory"
error
as it tries to convert the sparse matrix into a full one.
Then i tried using SVDS which is svd for sparse matrices, but the
problem with that one is that if matrix A is of size m by n then
U is of m by k
S is of k by k
V is of n by k
where k is an integer that you specify.
So if i do [U,S,V] = svds(A,10);
I'll get U = 17640 by 10, s = 10 by 10 and V = 254016 by 10 where
as
in a real SVD, if A is m by n,
U will be m by m
S will be m by n
V will be n by n
Can anyone help me ?
What is wrong with that?
So how will you expect to store a full version
of U and V? Remember they will be dense matrices
even if A was sparse.
HTH,
