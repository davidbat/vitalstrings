Mobile source processing using SMOKE-MOVES Integration Tool
(1) Met4moves prepares spatially and temporally averaged temperature and relative humidity data for use by MOVES and SMOKE
(2) MOVES model processing scripts: (1) MOVES driver script creates importer files and the MOVES input file (runspec), which specifies the characteristics of the particular scenario to be modeled. (2) MOVES post-processing script formats the MOVES emission lookup tables by SCC for SMOKE
(3) Movesmrg processes emissions from both on-road and off-road mobile sources based on MOVES-based emission rate lookup tables and  meteorology data from Met4moves to create hourly gridded speciated air quality model-ready input files
