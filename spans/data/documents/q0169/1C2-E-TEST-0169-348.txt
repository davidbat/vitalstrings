Some of the algorithms needed to know some a priori information, and we fed these algorithms with the required a priori information. Details are given in the following list:
T-MSBL: did not require any a priori information
EM-SBL: did not require any a priori information
ExCov: did not require any a priori information
CoSaMP: fed with the number of nonzero elements
Subspace Pursuit: fed with the number of nonzero elements
AMP: did not require any a priori information
BCS: did not require any a priori information
Magic-L1: needed to know the SNR to calculate the regularization parameter
FBMP: fed with the true SNR value, and the number of nonzero elements (used to calculate the activity probability of elements)
FOCUSS: fed with the true SNR value
HTP: noise was removed, since it can only be used in noiseless cases; in the noisy case it completely failed
Smooth L0: noise was removed, since it can only be used in noiseless cases; in the noisy case it completely failed
The experiment was repeated 1000 trials. In each trial, the number of nonzero elements in the source vector x was 3, i.e.K=3. These nonzero elements had the unit amplitude. Their indexes in x were randomly chosen. SNR was 25dB. The measurement indexes are Failure Rate and MSE.
The comparison result in terms of Failure Rate is given below:
The result in terms of MSE is given below, where I only show the MSE's of 8 algorithms, since other algorithms completely failed.
We can clearly see T-MSBL has the best performance. In many applications such as neuroelectromagnetic source localization, Direction-of-Arrival estimation, radar detection, under-water sonar processing, power spectrum estimation, the ability of algorithms to handle the cases when dictionary matrices are highly coherent is very important (especially in the presence of noise). The simple experiment shows the advantage of T-MSBL in these cases.
