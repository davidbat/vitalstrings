This is LIFO (Last-in-first-out) structure.
The insertion of element into stack is called push
The deletion of element from stack is called pop.
OVERFLOW:
This situation will come when the stack is implemented using an array.
If an element is pushed into the stack when the size of the stack greater than or equal to maximum size of the array, then we say that the stack is overflowing.
Underflow:
If deletion operation is performed on the stack with no elements then the stack is said to be underflowing .This occurs in both types of implementations of stack.
Algorithm for push operation:
1)If(top>=maximum size of the stack)
  i)Then print “Stack is overflowing”
2)Else
