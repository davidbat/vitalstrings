-> This programm is to implement sparse matrix
   addition , with out using pointers to store
   the matrix
-> This programm works for matrices which have
   less than 100 elements (U can just change)
-> This program works in microsoft vc++ 6.0 in
   windows xp
-> For simplicity it is assumed that there
   are no duplicates (U should not enter two
   elements with same row no. and column no. ie the
   the program can not detect the error)
