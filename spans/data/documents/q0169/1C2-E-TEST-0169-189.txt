My bachelour thesis theme is "Parallel algorithms for solving linear programming problems". I am using the revised simplex method with LU decomposition. I don't know how to exploit the sparsity of the restrictions matrix other than tridiagonal systems. In the attachments I have plotted some matrices I use. Do you ...
