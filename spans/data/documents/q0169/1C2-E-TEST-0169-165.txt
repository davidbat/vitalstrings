MatView
MatView: Scalable Sparse Matrix Viewer
MatView is a handy tool for viewing and exploring large sparse matrices. Using MatView, a sparse matrix with millions of elements can be reduced to a graphically viewable size for overviews of the high-level structure, or a detailed view can be obtained by zooming in and navigating through small regions of the matrix.
MatView provides:
Scalability: Efficient Viewing of Very Large Matrices  (including new huge matrix file support!).
Easy Thumbnail Navigation, and Zooming In & Out of Matrix Details.
A Variety of Data Reduction Functions  (Avg, Min/Max, Sum, Std, Var).
Custom Color Adjustments, or Greyscale Rendering.
Viewing of Matrix Pattern Only, If Desired.
Filtering of Matrix Values Outside the Color Map Range, if desired.
Printing of Matrix Views, or Saving Views as PostScript / PPM.
Compatibility with Matrix Market Format, Harwell-Boeing Format,  and Matlab MAT Files.
Loading of Compressed or Gzipped Matrix Files.
The MatView 1.0 Beta 6 Software (no longer Alpha, complete with new "configure" installation!) is available for FREE DOWNLOAD (gzipped tar format - you can also download uuencoded and zipped distributions).
Now Works with Tcl/Tk 8.4! :-D  (12/3/2008)
(Now with smaller example matrices! :-)
