You will want to ask scipy questions on the scipy list.
There is no explicit interface on sparse matrix objects to expose the indices of
the nonzero elements. A different implementation would have to be written for
each type of sparse matrix format. However, if one can spare the memory, one can
convert to the coordinate list format and read the row and column indices from
that object.
In [1]: from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix
In [2]: A = lil_matrix((3,3))
In [3]: A[1,2] = 10
In [4]: A[2,0] = -10
In [5]: Acoo = A.tocoo()
Out[6]: array([2, 1])
In [7]: Acoo.col
Out[7]: array([0, 2])
