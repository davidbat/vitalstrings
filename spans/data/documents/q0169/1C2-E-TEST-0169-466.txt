Sparse, simply means "something which is scant, or not available in plenty..  Here are some of the synonyms of the word "sparse": meagre, scant, scanty, thin, bare, less, minute, poor, exiguous, small etc. A thing which is sparse does not grown densely. It is available in small proportions and that too in a scattered manner.
Here are examples which will justify the usage of the word in the following couple of sentences:
1. The population in this island is sparse.
2. The sparse growth of cotton in this region indicates the inferior quality of the soil.
3.  Thing which are available in sparse quantities are rare and hence command a lot of value.
Sparse is believed to have made a relative late entry into popular English literature (1614).
