There is a survey of decomposition algorithms in the first table of this NIPS paper .
It lists modern algorithms (with links to known implementations), including the stochastic decomposition of Halko et al. , arguably the state-of-the-art method today.
You ask for convenient programming packages but don't state your platform or language of choice. Assuming it's:
Python:
use scipy for in-core decompositions (input must fit in RAM)
use gensim for both in-core and out-of-core sparse decompositions (also supports incremental decomposition updates)
Java:
Mahout has several scalable decomposition algos
LingPipe (in-core) supports missing input values
C++
redsvd (in-core) very clean and elegant, efficient implementation
MATLAB
pca.m by Mark Tygert, one of the co-authors of the stochastic method.
Your problem isn't particularly big though, so I guess any existing package (using the iterative Lanczos algorithm) will do fine, eigen decompositions have been around for a while.
