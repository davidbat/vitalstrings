Re: Which Matrix Storage Format should I choose for large sparse matrices in MKL
The length of the values and columns collections is equivalent to the numeral of non-zero elements in the matrix. As the row Index collection gives the position of the first non-zero component within a row, and the non-zero elements are accumulated one subsequent to the additional, the numeral of non-zero elements in the I-th row is equal to the dissimilarity of row Index(I) and row Index(I+1). To encompassed this relationship hold for the most recent row of the matrix, an supplementary entry (dummy entry) is added to the end of row Index. Its value is equivalent to the numeral of non-zero elements plus one. This creates the total length of the row Index array one larger than the numeral of rows in the matrix.
