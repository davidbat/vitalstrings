Sparse coordinate storage
I wonder why the Matlab development team seems to have madethe choice that the following lineresult in three vectors stored in "double" as shown hereName Size Bytes Class Attributesi 3x1 24 doublej 3x1 24 doubles 3x1 24 doubleas opposed to make i,j be in the "Int32" class. It might bea matter of...
sparse 3d or indexed
I have a very large sparse 3d matrix (say Mat3) and I need tocalculate the Mat gradient matrices Umat3,Vmat3,Wmat3 ...(i.e to calculate the vector field from a scalar field )but the system does not support such an amount of memory requirementand get an out of memorysince matlab sparse is only a...
S-parameter normalization
Has somebody already done the following: I'd like to get the code tonormalize my simulated S-parameters (to be exported in Touchstoneformat, in my case S2P), even so that the original port impedancesare different compared to each others and to the desired refimpedance (in my case 50 ohms).A...
Sparam n-port simulation file
HiI am wondering if somebody would help me on this.Lets assume the following network:2 amplifiers where the s2p is known01 attenuator where s2p is known01 three port device where s3p is known (Lets say a power splitter).I am going to connect 01 amplifier on port 1 the other amplifier onport 2 an...
spanning tree enumeration
I am taking this liberty to pose the following problem and asking foryour adviceGiven a connected graph, Kirchhoff's matrix gives the total number ofspanning tree in the graph.However enumeration can be interpreted as not only evaluating theexact number of spanning trees but also specify th...
Span 3d plan
HiI've got a big problem.I have a curve, consisting of points that represent the centerline ina vain.E.g. points[0 -53 -170 -52 -160 -51 -150 -50 -140 -49 -13etc.]Now I want to make a new 3D-plan that is perpendicular to the vain ina given point.Any good solutionsFlemmingDenmark...
