"A treasure in NYC"
"This place is really amazing! It's a brand new property in the middle of NYC. Very central so it's easy to get to everywhere you want, close to Village and Midtown, too. Our room was spacious and so nicely designed, also very clean. Kitchen is superb and useful if you don't want to eat out everyday and want to save some money. But you'll find several nice restaurants closeby. Staff also very helpful, kind and informative. All in all, I had a lovely stay here and I think it's very good value for money. If you'd like to stay somewhere central and nice, this is definitely a good choice!"
