We stayed at this delightful West Village apartment in February 2012 and loved it! The location is brilliant: super close to the Christopher Street subway station and so many fabulous restaurants and cafe's. The management and concierge are excellent to deal with and made the logistics of our stay very easy. We will definitely stay here again!

I stayed at the LA SUITE over xmas, and we had the best time. It's one of the greatest corners of the West Village, and the LA SUITE is, very well designed, chic, stylish, four big windows, light and calm, a real heaven in Manhattan. But beyond the chic interiors of the Suite, that we were expecting seen all the press that those designers had in the last few years, we were impressed by the service,the efficiency of the concierge at  really affordable prices. We loved the driver! and the Fitness they sent us to, and great room service. Only thing: mySuites is not for the Frugal traveler readers!!

Great Time In New York - Comfortable Stay in the Village

My nephew, his partner and myself spent a week in New York.  Originally, we had a reservation in the Butter Suite.  However, there was a scheduling problem and we found out we were double booked for the property.  However, the owner did some magic and was able to accommodate us in another one of his apartments about a 20 minute walk from the Butter Suite.  The apartment was bigger, but because of the schedule mix up, we got it for the same price.  It was the Bowery Suite, and we very much enjoyed the location, the accommodations, and what great condition the apartment was in.  The common patio to the side of the apartment was a great place to go have a cocktail, and the air conditioning was a life saver.  We very much enjoyed our stay in this property.

We're ex-New Yorkers, in town for a week - couldn't have stayed in a better location in the city than the Black Spade apartment! It's a tastefully decorated apartment with a rare quiet separate bedroom. Nice finishes, basic small kitchen but you don't need it much with so many great restaurants around.  Would definitely stay there again.

Great loft suite. Very modern and very clean which I loved. Stayed there with my husband and 3 year old daughrter and the space did not fill small at all. Leo and Julio were very accommodating and helpful with everything. We had a great stay. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks Guys!
