Las Vegas in July
July is the hottest month in Las Vegas, with average highs over 100ÂºF throughout the entire month!  If you want to walk the Strip, avoid going before late afternoon.  If you do venture   outside in the heat of the day, stay hydrated, and remember that an air conditioned hotel is never more than few minutes' walk away.
The pool is a great way to fight the heat, but be sure to pack plenty of    sunscreen to protect yourself from the desert sun.  With the heat, golfing can be very affordable in Las Vegas during July.  Still, be forewarned that even if you have an early morning tee time, you can expect to be on the course with temperatures   in the mid 80s.
