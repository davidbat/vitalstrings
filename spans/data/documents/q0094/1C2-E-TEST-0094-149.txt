If you're looking for cheap food choices in Manhattan, the Shake Shack is a very popular option.  You can get lunch there for under ten doll ... morears, so it is also the perfect place for family dining.

If you're looking to cut costs, there are tons of places you can got to to grab a bite for less than 10 dollars. If you like Middle Eastern ... morefood, you can go to Cheep's Pita Creations and get a falafel for under three bucks. Sunny and Annie's, located in the East Village, have amazing specialty sandwiches for only seven dollars.

Some of the best restaurants in NY are located in Manhattan, but if you're looking for both good and inexpensive, you'll need to head South ... moreto Chinatown. Big Wong King on Mott St. is one of the best places to find good, inexpensive food near Manhattan. They serve truly authentic Chinese food from the Cantonese region, with large portions that will quickly fill you up.
