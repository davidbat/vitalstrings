We two grandmothers from Canada stayed in the Pop Loft with our two granddaughters for 5 nights over Easter. If you don't mind stairs (2 flights), it is a charming QUIET place in NYC. Every morning we walked out into a veritable flower garden to the local grocery store(s) to pick up fresh fruit and muffins. It was situated between 2 subway lines and walking distance to Empire State Building and Times Square.. Sylvio met us after our late arrival and made several suggestions as to where to eat. He answered all of our questions during our stay.

We stayed in August of 2011.  The apartment had plenty of room for the five of us.  Sylvio and Leo were extremely attentive during our stay.  Everything you need is a short walk away - groceries, coffee shops, yogurt and the subway.  The flower district was beautiful every day.  Thanks for helping to create many memories!

My family (husband and 2 teenaged sons) stayed at the Pop Loft in August of 2010.  We wanted to experience New York more like residents than tourists.  The Pop Loft enabled us to do just that!  The suite is exactly as it is pictured and everything was close by.  We really enjoyed "living" in the flower district.  Everything was handy to us (Groceries, Restaurants, Wine Merchants, Cafe's - our favourite was Madeleine) and easy transportation via the Subway a block away.   Times Square is within walking distance.  The whole process was very straight forward booking with Leo and then getting settled in with Julio's help when we arrived.  The transaction was safe and secure.  I would definitely stay at a mysuites apartment again!!
