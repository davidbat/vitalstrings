Fit In
The dress code in New York is strictly 'anything goes'.                 It's all about what you can get away with, whether it's Andy                 Warhol-era drainpipe trousers or Blondie-era spandex. You may wish to dress with the                 extremes of weather in mind, but plenty of New Yorkers choose to disregard even this                 rule of thumb.
Get Around
Get Around
New York is composed of five boroughs, each one of which would constitute a sizeable                 town in its own right: Manhattan (central), the Bronx (north), Brooklyn                 (south-east), Queens (east) and Staten Island (south-west). Manhattan Island is the                 hub of the action.
Manhattan Island, which is tall and thin, is divided into three: downtown (south of 14th             Street), midtown (14th to 59th Street) and uptown (north of 59th Street). Fifth Avenue             runs the length of Manhattan, south to north. Anywhere to its east has an "East"             address, anywhere west has a "West" address.
Subway
The subway is the fastest way to get around and, having been mythologised on the                 page, in song and on film, is an attraction in itself. It connects all five boroughs                 and runs efficiently 24 hours a day. Routes are identified by letters, numbers and                 colours.
Walking
Walking is a great way to get around since most of New York's attractions are easily                 found on Manhattan's grid system. One common mistake, however, is to underestimate                 the sheer vastness of Manhattan. A walk from Battery Park to Central Park for a                 curious sightseer can take up an entire day.
Bus
The 3700 blue and white MTA buses are a slower, more scenic alternative to the                 subway. They are a wonderful way to get a feel for the city and its streets. If you                 happen to get stuck in a traffic jam you may wish you took the subway.
Taxi
Yellow cabs can be hailed on the street if the large central light is on. When the                 side lights are on, the taxi is occupied. Ranks are located on the main arteries of                 the city (Canal, Houston, 14th, 23rd, etc) and outside major hotels. All taxis have                 meters and drivers usually get a 15% tip on top of the final fare.
Car
For visitors, driving in central New York City is not advised. Many streets are                 one-way and day-time gridlock is common. The public transportation system is a far                 better alternative.
Transport Tips
Rush hour is 7.30am-9am and 4.30pm-6.30pm - some will say it is around the clock! A                 MetroCard pass for 1, 7, 14 or 30 days is available at all subway stations, for                 unlimited travel on subway and bus. On city buses payment – a flat fee of                 US$2.50 – can also be made with a MetroCard, tokens or in cash (although                 drivers require exact change).
Time Travel
The 1865 Morris-Jumel mansion in Washington Heights is the city's                 oldest building. Traces remain of the Lower East Side's Jewish community.                 These tenement buildings were jammed with large, often poor families with big                 dreams. Finally, grab a piece of New York's writerly history by spending a                 night in one of its most literary hotels, the Chelsea or the Algonquin.

Highlights
A view from the top of one of New York's famous buildings brings to mind                 Kurt Vonnegut's nickname for the city: Skyscraper National Park. But of                 course the Big Apple is infinitely more than its skyscrapers.
Don't miss the MoMA art gallery or the Statue of Liberty and its             observation deck. The Top of the Rock Observation Deck at the Rockefeller Center rivals the Empire State Building for views. The glorious Art Deco skyscrapers of the             Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building are monuments to New York's             heyday as the world's undisputed greatest city. CNN Studios offer a             45-minute guided tour of the news-making process at the Time Warner Center at             Columbus Circle. The former site of the World Trade Center also continues to draw             the crowds.
Sightseeing Tips
New York can boggle the mind. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consult the                 tourist board for information on organised walking tours. If you're                 planning to visit several museums, it's worth investing in a CityPass for                 reductions on museum entrance and skipping the queues.
