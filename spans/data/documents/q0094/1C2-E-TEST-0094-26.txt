Home, sweet home: The Tribal Room                    at Second Home on Second Avenue.
Below 14th Street
Second Home on Second                Avenue
Pick your theme: Peruvian, Tribal, Caribbean, 20th-century Modern...                Each of the seven cozy rooms ($80-$195) has decorative touches that                are intended to evoke a cultural motif  thankfully most are                too subtle to detect. Staying in five of the quarters does require                sharing a bathroom, but the charm of this 19th-century townhouse                (and its owner, Carlos) makes that trip across the hall in the middle                of the night worth it.

Howard Johnson Express                Inn
Despite the hip address, the accommodations are fairly run-of-the-mill                (you can take the HoJo out of suburbia but, well, you know). As                a result, this East Village over-nighter is perfect for those who                would rather spend their time hitting the streets than hitting the                hay. Rates start at $109 for a single and include a continental                breakfast.

Cosmopolitan Hotel
TriBeCa's latest bargain hotel, the Cosmo offers 122 small, clean                rooms, ideal for business types looking to stay downtown. If you                do want a bit more space, however, they can accommodate  book                one of their eleven 2-level mini-lofts with a lower-level sitting                area and upper-level bedroom area ($129 per night). Other features                include newly renovated rooms, all of which have color televisions                and private bathrooms. Rates for a single room start at $145.

East Village Bed and Coffee
Let you inner child out at this funky nine-room B&C (sorry, no breakfast here), where room options include the first-floor Treehouse room (which was used as Jennifer Tilly’s bedroom in the French film, Happy End), the relaxing top-floor Zen room, and the top-floor Children’s room, which is meant for “grown up kids” and decorated with the proprietor’s childhood artwork, a chalkboard wall, and a desk from the intermediate school down the street. And it won’t take too long to save up your allowance to stay here, as rooms start at just $80, with all taxes included.

Union Square Inn
Artists of all kinds flock to this East Village inn, which is patterned after a European pensione and just steps away from lively Union Square, itself reminiscent of an open European plaza. Its 46 rooms are clean, simply furnished, and come with the expected basic amenities, but are also slightly larger than many comparable rooms in the city. Rates start at $109 for a single, or $119 on Friday and Saturday nights.
• 209 E. 14th St., between Second and Third Aves.; 212-614-0500; unionsquareinn.com
SoHotel
This Broome Street hotel claims to be the oldest in the city, and sometimes it shows—the rooms are small and amenities are sparse. But SoHotel has three things going for it: location, location, location. Just steps from Little Italy, Chinatown, and (of course) SoHo, its central downtown position is ideal. Actually, it has a fourth thing going for it, too—rooms that start at just $93.07, tax included.

Saviour-faire: European-style charm                    at the Chelsea Inn.
Midtown/Chelsea
Chelsea Inn
With its muraled art-deco bathrooms and flea market furniture, the                Chelsea Inn has all the bohemian charm of a Montmartre flat. They                offer a choice of private or shared singles and suites, ranging                from $99 to $259. Check often for seasonal specials where you can                snag one of their quaint singles for as little as $79.

It's quiet and                private, and with 26 rooms in an Americana style  complete                with showers, televisions, and air conditioners  you'll                be one rested, comfy tourist. Rates start at $95 for single occupancy.

Chelsea Savoy Hotel
Not to be confused with its famous neighbor the Hotel Chelsea, amenities                in this 89-roomer are pretty spare and the overall experience is                not nearly as enchanting. But what it lacks in allure, it more than                makes up in location and price (singles begin at $99, doubles at                $135).

Colonial House Inn
You wouldn't know it from the outside, but this charming Chelsea                inn doubles as an art gallery. The lobby is home to The 24 Hours                for Life Gallery, which has featured art by Keith Haring and                proprietor Mel Cheren. Some rooms have mini-fridges and fireplaces, with all rooms boasting free satellite TV. There's                a roof deck and the first floor lounge has Internet access.

Apple Core Hotels
Apple Core's quintet of Midtown hotels lack flair but the rooms                are clean, supply the basics, and come with complimentary breakfast.                All locations have fitness and business centers, and the La Quinta                has a great view of the Empire State Building from its year-round                rooftop bar. Not a bad deal considering that doubles start at only                $89.99.

The Gershwin Hotel
A veritable arts epicenter unto itself, the quirky Gershwin boasts                a pop art- festooned lobby with an actual Campbell's Soup can signed                by Andy Warhol; rooms with an array of wall murals and art pieces.

Murray Hill Inn
There may be a few things a pricier hotel offers that this east side inn does not (for instance, an elevator). However, there aren’t as many as you might think, as amenities here include air conditioned rooms, a 24-hour concierge, and daily maid service. Rooms start at only $89—just be sure to request one with a private bathroom.

Seasonal rates vary, but most of the year a standard overlooking                the glittering Queensboro Bridge can be yours for the bargain price                of $135. Oh, and be sure to save some time in your busy itinerary                for a drink at the spectacular rooftop bar.

Two doubles ($156.50 or $186.50) and one single ($128.50) are furnished completely with antiques and decorated  with ecclesiastical art, although secular amenities like a TV, VCR and,  thankfully, an air conditioner, offer 21st century comforts. Less modern is the  communal bathroom, shared by all occupants on the second floor.
