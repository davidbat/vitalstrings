Midsummer Night Swing -- Dancing in the Park
Tuesday June 26, 2012
I love Midsummer Night Swing because it always makes me feel like I've stumbled upon a Broadway musical number in the middle of New York City -- and have been invited to join in (kind of like what I thought New York would be like when I was 7 and watched West Side Story for the first time).
At Midsummer Night Swing , you can kick up your heels and admire the moves of some of New York City's finest dancers. You can even take free dancing lessons to loosen up and learn the steps before strutting your stuff on the dance floor.
Tuesday, June 26 is the first of 15 swinging midsummer nights, so put on your dancing shoes and boogie on over to Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park .
Up first is a night of big band swing featuring the stylings of the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. Also this week: Mexican cumbia, boogie woogie, hot jazz, salsa, and more. Dance lessons begin at 6:30 pm and the live music starts at 7:00 pm. Tickets are $17.
