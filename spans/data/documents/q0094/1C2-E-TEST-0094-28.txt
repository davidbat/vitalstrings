If you're up in the Northeast and you're still thinking about a quickie vacay for the Fourth, we've got pretty good news for you: there's plenty of room at the inn. Or, like, all the inns. And they're pretty decently cheap, too.
Gild Hall (though they charge egregious amounts of money for lame Internet connections) is right down by the seaport  and since you shouldn't be working on a holiday weekend anyway, you shouldn't need the WiFi. A quick look on Quikbook shows that it's going for $136 a night (which is not bad) if you book the nights of the 3rd, 4th and 5th.
Meanwhile, if you're down for being one of the first folks to stay in The MAve , you can book the 3rd, 4th and 5th and get your third night free  which averages out to about $133 a night .
$127 is the going rate on QB for The Ace (perf for you and a pal if you want to do a bunk room with two twins), and hey, what the heck, there's room at The Jane for $89 a night .
