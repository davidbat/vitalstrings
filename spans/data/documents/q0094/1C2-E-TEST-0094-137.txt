Our rates are cheap for New York hotels and motels, even if you book at the last minute. They are some of the cheapest NYC rooms you will find. It's like knowing a little secret. Check often for upcoming deals and packages.
Our luxury amenities include room service, free wi-fi and a gym. Come to check out the lobby bar scene, where DJs often play music. It's open late. And check the calendar for upcoming events. We have a ballroom called Liberty Hall that's a good venue for corporate events or a party. The Boardroom event space and our lobby are good for that, too. Our accommodations are pet-friendly, which really means dog-friendly.
