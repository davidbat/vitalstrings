It's the perfect destination to enjoy a sunny beachside vacation, treat your hardworking staff to a functional business meeting, throw the wedding or event of your dreams, and experience the thriving South Bay surf cities.
Condé Nast Traveler listed Shade as the #6 reason to visit LA, and Manhattan Beach as LA's newest hip corner. With its ideal Southern California location, guests can enjoy scenic drives to The Staples Center and downtown LA Live, partake in movie magic back lot tours at Paramount Studios, and see the beautifully expansive Pacific Ocean by walking down to the Manhattan Beach Pier or The Strand.
Stemming from owner and restaurateur Michael Zislis' visionary take on personal service, allow our staff to ensure your experience is nothing less than stellar. With upscale dining, shopping, and sightseeing all within a close distance, Shade guarantees you an unforgettable stay.
