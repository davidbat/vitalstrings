Barcelona - the real Olympic city!
Long before London got the Olympics, Barcelona wrote the book on how to do it in style. Not the least of which was a little help from Freddie Mercury. Barcelona isn't one of the grand         European capitals - it's far too out there for that, but Cheap Rooms, can take you there and put you up in cheap hotels in Barcelona that will stun you with their sense of style!
Getting flights to Barcelona         is easy - it's a popular city and you'll get a direct flight from most European cities as well as plenty of trains from across the continent. Barcelona is foodie heaven and an art lover's paradise so check Cheap Rooms for         the best deals (and don't forget the lowest price guarantee).
It's hard not to fall instantly in love with Barcelona with its Gaudi-inspired architecture grand monuments, bars, amazing restaurants and some of the best city         beaches in the world. The locals love the place; they love the energy of the city and the social spaces such as Las Ramblas.
For people-watching purposes you have to         walk La Rambla perhaps Europe's finest boulevard. It's approximately 1.2 kilometres long with Port         Vell (near the cruise port terminal) at the Southern most end and Plaça Catalunya at the northern most end. Attractions along the Ramblas including live performances, human statue         art, artists that will draw your portrait or caricature, as well as monuments, markets, museums and cafe after cafe.
Shopping in Barcelona? Well Spain is the home of Zara one of the most successful clothes brands of         modern times, so you're safe in assuming Barcelona has plenty of shopping to tempt you with. One of the best ideas is to climb aboard the Tomb bus (T1) which takes you directly to the         main shopping areas. It departs every seven minutes from the Plaça Catalunya. The best shopping areas in central Barcelona are Passeig de Gracia and the streets to its southwest, the         Barri Gotic streets such as Carrer de la Portaferrissa, Carrer de la Boqueria, and Carrer de Ferran, and around Placa de Sant Josep Oriol.
The Spanish truly enjoy their food.         The secret is to indulge in lots of small nibbles rather than have a huge mound of whatever takes your fancy. Everyone will have their favorite spot but for our money, we recommend Bo de B         (Fusteria 14 | Merce 35, 08002 Barcelona) for just sheer great taste, good prices and no pretence. It's always busy but service is quick and you indulge in their version of tapas while         waiting for a sandwich. (Yup, it's just a simple sandwich joint - but oh so special.)
What the human body can achieve is amazing...
What the Olympics did for Atlanta
The London Olympics are coming up fast and London is fast sprucing up with gentrification, new facilities and urban transport rapidly coming online. That's London, but what happened         in Atlanta after the 1996 Olympics? Quite a lot as it turns out. And if you want to see what careful planning and significant effort can bring to a city, come visit Cheap Rooms and sort out a trip to Atlanta, Georgia quick smart!
There are hundreds of hotels in Atlanta to choose from - at all levels of the budget. You can stay close to the action in Cheap Rooms for deals right now to get you there!
What began as a dusty settlement some 170 years ago is now a         bustling metropolis of 5,000,000. Atlanta is the ninth largest city in the US and is a transport hub as well as home to dozens of Fortune 500 company headquarters. It's         also the ninth-most-visited city in the US. The key to Atlanta's new-found favor as a tourist destination dates back to the Olympics. Dozens of inner city areas were         revitalised, whole areas of Midtown warehouses were turned         into galleries and boutiques, restaurants and cool inner city apartments. Parks were created, transport revitalised and pride restored.
With the summer solstice         almost here, why not hit Atlanta's Piedmont Park? This extraordinary place is home to Atlanta's Botanical Gardens         and is also a spaghetti map of walks and trails, sport fields, quiet areas and entertainment precincts. During summer there are free concerts and entertainment in the park almost         every weekend.
The Atlanta History Museum is at the Atlanta History Center and you can rediscover the         old south in a couple of beautifully restored old mansions. You'll find Swan House here as well as the Margaret Mitchell House, Tullie Smith Farm and the Olympic Games Museum.         Also in the museum is a very simple but poignant Civil War section.
Do you want to see something quite different while you're in Atlanta? Then head to the Shakespeare Tavern. Good grub, decent beer and an evening of Shakespeare. It's a live music venue, a real         English tavern and full of authentic costumes, sword play and good food. They don't just do Shakespeare's plays, others clamber on to the bill occasionally. It's a fun night         out with a little culture thrown in!
There's a swathe of talent shows around the world at the moment unearthing amazing talent...
Hit the beach for summer solstice!
With the weather warming up, what better way to celebrate summer solstice (the longest day of the year) by hitting the beach. Cheap Rooms has got just the ticket - a summer solstice trip to Myrtle Beach. This is good old fashioned beachside         fun - mini golf, giant fairground wheels and one of the most beautiful beaches in South Carolina.
The Myrtle Beach State Park is a grand stretch of rugged sands and dunes, plus the hotel strip marked         by the famous Pier. Cheap Rooms has plenty of good hotels to suit every budget so that you can enjoy a good old fashioned beach         vacation this summer!
Every beach vacation needs a good round of golf. Bring your clubs to King's North and get set for a solid,         challenging game. The Arnold Palmer course is a classic of long fairways, deceptive bunkers and off-set greens that will test your putting skills. The course is a beautiful South Carolina         scene - green, water, birds and a laid back feel that belies the professional level course.
Sick of too much sun and beach lollygagging about? Entertain yourself at the Carolina Opry show. It's right in the middle of the action and you can likely walk to it from your hotel. The show is 2 hour extravaganza         of music, comedy and dance - from Broadway to country, from classic pop to rock 'n roll, and gospel to bluegrass. It's a big, energetic show at a very reasonable price.
You're         at the beach right? And beach holidays are simple affairs with sun, sea, a couple of cocktails... and maybe a big night at a legendary music show! The Good Vibrations show is just one of the shows on offer in Myrtle Beach, and it is a         cracking good night out - especially if you're dragging kids along with you. There's a ton of other shows, but start here and you can't go wrong.
Every beach holiday needs a         Skywheel (Ferris Wheel if you're of a certain age) and it delivers an impressive view across the beach and the pier and the         surrounding scenery. You get a real feel for the laid-back beach that Myrtle is from way on high and the ride is a decent length. Come down at night and enjoy all the goings-on in the         surrounding area, but the ride delivers the best during the day.
