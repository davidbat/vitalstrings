6. The Jane Hotel

If you're looking for style in a budget hotel, the Jane Hotel might be a good choice. Of course, everything comes with a trade-off, so you'll have to be willing to tolerate tiny accommodations, shared co-ed bathrooms and a location near the West Side Highway. All that said, it's a great choice for visitors on a budget looking for a downtown location -- you're in the West Village and close to the Hudson River Park. All cabins are just 50 square feet; standard cabins ($99) accommodate one guest and bunk bed cabins ($125) accommodate two. Captain's Rooms ($250) have private bathrooms, full, queen or king beds, views, and more.
Address: 113 Jane Street
