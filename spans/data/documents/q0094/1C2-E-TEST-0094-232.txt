Hotel Deals: Free Nights for July 4th Weekend
June 16, 2009
July 4 falls on a Saturday this year, which means weekend travel plans are on the rise. A few tips for  July 4 travelers:
You'll get cheap airfares if you can travel Saturday through Monday or Tuesday, instead of Friday through Sunday. Book the first flight out on a Saturday morning and you'll be at your destination by BBQ time.
Don't wait to buy an airline ticket . If you see a fare that works for your budget and your travel window, book now.
Hotels are on sale around the country and many of them are offering additional amenities for longer stays. Make sure to ask about free in-room WiFi, complimentary breakfasts, and kids-stay-free promotions when you book your hotel.
If you're still looking for hotel discounts for July 4 weekend, Hotels.com is hosting a holiday weekend promotion.
Book a participating hotel by July 4, 2009 for travel between July 1 – 8, 2009. and receive a free night at your chosen hotel. One catch: you must stay the minimum number of nights required by that hotel to cash in the free night.
For example, when you book four nights at a participating hotel that requires a 4-night stay, you will receive 25 percent off of your entire stay, which is the same as receiving a free night.
Added bonus: Hotels.com is throwing in a pre-paid MasterCard® for booking. The amount on the card depends on how long you stay: $25 for 2 nights; $50 for 3 nights; and $75 for 4 or more nights.
