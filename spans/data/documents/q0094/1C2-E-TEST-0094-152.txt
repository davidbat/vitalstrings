Welcome to New York City... and the SETON HOTEL
Please note: Our lobby is undergoing a full transformation,
and will be under renovations through June of 2012.
This Midtown Manhattan Budget Hotel is the secret of  savvy travelers who seek affordable, attractive accommodations in the very center of the city. The SETON HOTEL guest can now choose from fully renovated and imaginatively redesigned  accommodations, or our remaining standard rooms.  All of our rooms are served by our mission--total management dedication.
We provide all guests with great service and comfort. Our modest entry barely hints at the  dynamic new rooms upstairs at The Seton. The Front Desk staff, courteous and attentive, will always share their city secrets and local favorites, including special discounts and entertainment deals—24 hours a day. Guests can choose either budget or upscale rooms, private bath or shared bathroom. A range of size and décor for your group adventures or budget goals! 
Located at 40th Street and Lexington Avenue, in the very heart of Midtown East, both the business and leisure traveler agree The Seton is an ideal choice. Be close to: Grand Central Terminal and every feature of 42nd Street, including Times Square and the Theatre District; the United Nations; Empire State Building. New York Shopping: Herald Square and Macy’s; Fifth Avenue shopping for every budget. Easy access to subway and major bus lines, so you’re everywhere in the city in no time. 
…and Before We Forget:
