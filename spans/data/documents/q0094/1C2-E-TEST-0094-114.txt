Great location and easy to get to main tourist areas such as Times Square, bus terminal and train station. Also there were many restaurants in the area as well as convenience stores. Check-in and check- out were quick as it is a small hotel. There was always hot water for a shower and maid service was good. This is a budget hotel and doesn't have a bar or restaurant on the premises. The restaurant is next door. Considering this is Manhattan, for the price the hotel was good value for a short stay.
While the location is good, if you are unfortunate (like us) to get a room facing the street, you will be awake every night between 3-5 am as there is an after hours club across the street and the music is extremely loud and the customers very noisy. Having said that, the area near Times Square is very busy and noisy and even the best hotels have complaints about noise. My advice is to request a room facing the courtyard and the problem will be solved. My other complaint is that while the room had a small fridge and microwave, it did not have a coffee maker nor did it have any mugs so that you could heat water in the microwave at least make tea or instant coffee.
