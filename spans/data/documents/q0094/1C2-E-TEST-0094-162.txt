Four Star Amenities and Service with a refreshing design and feel located close to everything New York has to offer.
New Yorkers are defined not just by the city they call home, but also by the neighborhoods in which they reside. These unique “districts” are worlds in and of themselves, and together they define an icon. The Distrikt Hotel New York City celebrates the individuality of these melting pots and the island of Manhattan itself through architecture, design, style and service.
Located in the heart of Manhattan on West 40th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues in Midtown Manhattan, Distrikt Hotel New York is steps away from The New York Times Building and Times Square. Part of the Ascend Collection, Distrikt Hotel New York offers a dedication to detail with impeccable service, cutting edge technology, comfortable yet luxurious guestrooms, four -star amenities, and fresh cuisine with locally grown ingredients. Each of the 155 guestrooms are designed for the comfort and needs of the guest to include relaxing Simmons Beauty Rest mattresses, decadent Frette bed and bath linen, a 37” LG flatscreen television, a business desk with ergonomic chair, Ecru New York soaps and amenities, and wireless internet in every room.
