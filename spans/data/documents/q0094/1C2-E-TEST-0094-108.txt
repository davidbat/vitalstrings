About Midtown Manhattan
Midtown Manhattan is one of the three main        subdivisions of Manhattan, New York, US, together with        Uptown and Downtown Manhattan. The area hosts the        tallest and most famous buildings in the city, such as        Empire State Building and it is the largest central        business district in New York. A part skyscrapers,        hotels and apartment towers, here you can also find        retail establishments. As for the “Plaza District”, the        term is often used by real estate agents to refer to the        most expensive area of midtown, which lies from Third        Avenue to Seventh Avenue, therefore on a distance of        about one square kilometer.
This subdivision of New York City is chosen as a        destination by many tourists, visiting residents and        students, since it is the epicenter of the American        Theater, located in Times Square, of several museums        (such as Museum of Modern Art), colleges, universities        and schools and of New York Public Library.
Moreover, as tourists, here you can shop after you have        hopefully chosen between hundreds of locations and        offers. To make things easier, you can start by        selecting your target stores between those of the famous        retailers, such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Macy’s or        Tiffany&Co. If you don’t feel like shopping, you can        enjoy the cityscape provided by the world-famous tallest        buildings or by the shores of East River or Hudson        River. And after a long day of exploring the area, you        can relax yourselves in one of the Midtown Manhattan        Hotels, who will provide you with an excellent        accommodation.
