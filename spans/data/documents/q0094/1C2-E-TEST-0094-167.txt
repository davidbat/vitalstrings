SPICY
The bánh mì, a classic example of French influence on Vietnamese cuisine, starts with a French baguette—a crisp shell that, once your teeth break through, reveals a soft, fluffy interior. Within is an assortment of meats, pâté, pickled carrots and daikon, plus a refreshing cucumber spear, cilantro, fresh jalapeños, a swipe of Vietnamese mayo, and (if you want it spicy) Sriracha. At Paris Sandwich, the baguettes are baked daily on-site. It’s hard to find a better bánh mì, especially when you order the Paris Special, stuffed with three meats: pork roll, ham and headcheese. Visit during the lunch hour; while it’s their busiest time, it also guarantees the freshest sandwich possible.
