Manhattan Hotels: Park79 Upper West Side New York City boutique hotel near Central Park, Broadway and American Museum of Natural History lodging in NYC
PARK 79 brings a true touch of an Old World boutique hotel to the Upper West Side, one of New York’s most dynamic neighborhoods, offering a style that appeals to the discriminating corporate or leisure guest.  Convenient to everything, Park 79’s calm appeal is complemented by thoughtful service and touches of New York glamour, always at modest nightly rates.
The hotel is close to major subway and bus lines.  At day’s end, the savvy corporate guest selects from many fine restaurants for social appointments — and during working weekends. Close by is an amazing choice of museums, shops and entertainment for all, and  guests respond to our quiet greeting after sightseeing and shopping or a stressful business day. Park 79  is near many of the city’s universities and professional schools, as well as wedding and corporate event sites. Lincoln Center, Broadway, Central Park, Time Warner-Columbus Circle, American Museum of Natural History, Columbia University ... the list continues.  Our guests savor a sense of well-being while enjoying the excitement and discovery that is New York City.
