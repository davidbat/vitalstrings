I'm coming to JFK for just 8 days.  I want to do some sight-seeing (liberty, empire state bldg, times square, manhattan, etc.).  I'm a lady travelling alone, hence a little worried about where is a safe place to stay to get all this done.  I'd like a clean, safe and easily accessilble location (I saw quite a few hotels at Queens but have no idea as to whether this is a safe neighbourhood to stay at and exactly how far from the main city and what it would cost me to and fro). e just as close or too far?  Is a hotel in Newark a good option for all this? Also, targetting an airport pick up and drop off (JFK airport T8).  I was wondering if I stay in Queens, or Manhattan, what it would cost me to get to and from the airport by cab.  If anyone could help me out with this - I have been trying since 2days on the net, but have gotten more and more confused and need to make my booking by today as I travel the day after.  Thanks.
