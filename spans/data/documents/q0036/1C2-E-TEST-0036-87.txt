” It’s instead our Light, and not the darkness within us
that most frightens us. Because our deepest fear isn’t
that we’re inadequate, but rather that we’re powerful
beyond measure. Our playing small doesn’t serve the
world. Nothing enlightening about shrinking away from
our humanitarian duties. We’re born with the destiny of manifesting the glory of God within us ” Nelson Mandela
My mom gave heavily to the African Christian missions.
I’ve collected for UNICEF. Though we’re not acquainted,
I’d be honored if you’d regard me as your friend anyway, Charly. To me, you’re a hero, and someone I look up to.
Your heart is in the right place. That means everything.
