Charlize Theron is putting in some serious footwork to help kids in her native South Africa. Today she debuts a new, limited-edition collaboration with do-gooding company TOMS Shoes. The result, slip-on sneakers made for men and women embellished with an image of an African baobab tree, will benefit the star’s non-profit, the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project , dedicated to improving the health, education, and social development of high schoolers in South Africa. Additionally, 10,000 pairs will be given to impoverished children living in remote communities in her home country. “I’m thrilled to have TOMS Shoes as a partner. We are so grateful for their generous donation of shoes to the students we work with,” Theron says, “It’s exciting that we’re able to come together in such a cool and creative way to bring attention to the needs of many South African youth.” This month, the actress traveled abroad to start distributing the footwear herself in the far-flung KwaZulu-Natal Province. The eco-friendly canvas shoes ring in at $54 and are available exclusively at TOMSshoes.com . –Emily Hsieh
