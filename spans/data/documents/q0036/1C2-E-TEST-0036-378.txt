More from Douglas Charles >
Though I am not a big fan of her as a human being, or an actress for that matter, I will not cut off my nose to spite my, uh, face when it comes to taking a look when Charlize Theron does a photo shoot for something like Flaunt magazine. Babe is hot, and unfortunately, she knows it all too well. I bet Charlize was a real fun girl in high school. Probably head cheerleader, only dated the captain of the football team, that sort of thing. Oh yeah, she’s from South Africa… different type of football, but still… Hmm… Wiki says at the age of 16, Theron traveled to Milan, Italy, on a one-year modeling contract, after winning a local competition, so I guess she wasn’t even aruond much for high school. Maybe that’s why she seems comes off as such a biddy.
What'd you think of this?
