Charlize Theron is one of the most beautiful women in the world - and she's testing the boundaries of that beauty with a new look.
The Oscar winner was photographed in Los Angeles yesterday (holding adorable son Jackson), donning a hat that could not fully cover up the obvious: she has gone all Willow Smith on us!
Sources confirm that Theron, who is ruling the box office these days with Snow White and the Huntsman and Prometheus , shaved her head for a role in Mad Max: Fury Road. It starts shooting next month in Africa.
