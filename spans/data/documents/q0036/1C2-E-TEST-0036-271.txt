Everyone's been buzzing about the two upcoming 'Snow White' flicks on the horizon, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'Mirror, Mirror,' excitedly debating details like who will make the best heroine (Kristen Stewart or Lily Collins!) or the most dashing Prince Charming (Armie Hammer or Chris Hemsworth!) My favorite discussions, though, revolve around who will make the most deliciously evil queen: Julia Roberts or Charlize Theron.
Both actresses bring distinctive qualities to the table. Charlize excels at being downright terrifying, as evidenced by her role as serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 'Monster.' Julia, on the other hand, is a whole 'nother kind of frightening: her cutting remarks and disdainful glares could reduce any young girl to tears in the blink of an eye.
