Charlize Theron was born in Benoni, South Africa, on the 7th of August, 1975. Her father Charles worked on the family's road-construction business, which mother Gerda took over after Charles' death in 1990. Apparently, Charlize's mother shot her husband Charlie in self-defense, after he attacked her in a drunken state.
Charlize started out as a professional dancer, which allowed the young 6-year-old to fantasize and be the actress that she ultimately turned out to be. Since the farm they lived on had no means of entertainment (no television or movies), Charlize had to use her passion for dancing and her imagination to entertain herself when not caring for the farm animals. After dancing in Johannesburg, she began modeling in Milan, Italy, by the time she was 16.
