And then there was none….
On a trip to the doctor’s office to get her son Jackson a quick checkup, actress Charlize Theron strutted her stuff looking all sorts of fine. But even underneath her confident stride we got the sense that something was missing. Oh, that’s right…
ALL OF HER HAIR!

Snow White and the Huntsman star Charlize Theron looked stunning on the red carpet at the 2012 MTV Movie awards in a red Lanvin strapless dress. She paired the dress with silver Jimmy Choo shoes.
She's been all over the globe in the last month on a promotional tour for Snow White and the Huntsman, which came out Friday.

How badly do you want to see Snow White and the Huntsman ? If the answer was anything other than “so badly,” I have two words for you “ Chris - Hemsworth .”
Snow White and the Huntsman isn’t your typical “chick flick.”
A lovelorn career women doesn’t fall in love with her platonic male friend. Babies aren’t involved. Kate Hudson is not in this.

It’s a natural transition, as all models do a bit of acting on their photo shoots, it’s just in front of a different kind of camera… and they don’t have to worry about things like, words. But as is evidenced by some of the most anticipated recent releases, a lot of them have no trouble talking.
Here’s our rundown of our favorite new pretty girls to watch, and a nod to a few of our older (meaning like over 30) faves.
Brooklyn Decker
Brooklyn’s back story is what American dreams are made of: she was discovered as a teen, in a mall. Not just a model, Decker was a much-loved addition to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue (which means that at some point she ate enough food to grow boobs). After a few TV appearances she made it big opposite Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston in Just Go With It. Brooklyn continues to get bigger, and is in two movies opening this very weekend, What To Expect When You’re Expecting, and Battleship.
