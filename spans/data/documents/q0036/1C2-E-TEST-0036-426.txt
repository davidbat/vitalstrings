Hollywood’s A-list can’t seem to get enough of Stella McCartney’s funky spring collection.
At Thursday’s Swarovski Crystallized Unsigned Model Search Event in London, Helena Christensen (right) added intrigue to a patterned shift with striped, blue tights and a neon-green purse. Previous supporters of the unusual frocks include Charlize Theron , who selected a one-shouldered mini for the L.A. premiere of Young Adult, Gwyneth Paltrow , who celebrated Coach’s 70th anniversary in a one-sleeved version and Nicole Kidman , who sported a burgundy column at the Country Music Awards.
“It’s a celebration of energy, freshness, and fitness,” McCartney told Style.com of the hard-to-pull-off collection. Tell us: Who do you think looks best in Stella McCartney’s spring collection?
