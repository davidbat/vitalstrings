What Charlize Theron’s Stylist Thinks of the Star’s New Buzz Cut
Jun 13, 2012 @ 2:15 pm
Celebrity stylist Leslie Fremar counts Charlize Theron among her many clients, so when the star debuted a shaved head for her Mad Max: Fury Road character this week , Fremar was a little surprised. “She sent me a picture, and I said, ‘Where the heck is all your hair?!’” Fremar told InStyle.com at the launch of her new super comfy basics collection for Fruit of the Loom at Bloomingdale’s in New York City (shop it starting at $22 at stores nationwide). “But Charlize takes her trade very seriously. She’s not afraid to put herself out there and transform into the character she’s playing. And let’s be honest, she’s so beautiful.” So, will Fremar take this bold hairstyle into consideration when styling future outfits? “Probably, I think so,” Fremar said. “She’s going to be going away for a long time for this movie she’s working on, so let’s see how long it is when she gets back, and then we’ll go from there.” Interesting—we can’t wait to see what she picks for Charlize next!
