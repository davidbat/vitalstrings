Charlize Theron Gets Chesty For The GQ Awards
Wednesday, September 7th, 2011
Here’s the stunning and absolutely perfect Charlize Theron showing off a serious amount of chest action at the GQ Man of the Year Awards in London last night. Ok, so there isn’t really a lot of chest to talk about, but the little that she has and is showing off is damn hot and greatly appreciated. And anyone who disagrees is either a) partially or fully blind, or b) has yet to see Reindeer Games… which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you’re missing out on a few mega drool-inducing scenes. Anyways, this peach still looks ridiculously sexy, and is hands down the most prefect babe on the planet. Having said that, her MC Hammer parachute pants are far from perfect…
