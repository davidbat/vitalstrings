Charlize Theron isn’t like other any other actress in the business today. In fact, she’s not like any other actress we know. She’s a beauty queen and the girl-next-door rolled into one, but most importantly, she exerts an elegant form of professionalism that you just don’t see much these days. Born in South Africa in 1975, Charlize has had a very different upbringing, including witnessing her mother shoot her father in self-defense at a young age. After studying dance as a little girl, Charlize moved on to modeling at age 16, but soon decided to give acting a try while visiting New York for a fashion show.
In 1994, Charlize traveled to Los Angeles where she was noticed by a talent scout eager to get the beautiful actress up on the big screen, but before she began auditioning for roles, Charlize had to perfect an American accent. After losing out the lead role in the B-movie “Showgirls,” she landed small parts in “2 Days in the Valley” and “That Thing You Do!” More supporting roles in “Celebrity” and “The Cider House Rules” brought Charlize into the Hollywood spotlight, but her pose on the cover of Playboy’s May 1999 issue is all we can remember from that year. Her first major role in “ The Italian Job ” launched Charlize’s career as an A-list actress, but it was her Oscar win for the biopic “ Monster ” that placed her name on the lips of everyone in the industry.
