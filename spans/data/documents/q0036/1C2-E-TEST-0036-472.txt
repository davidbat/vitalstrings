Even though we haven't seen a trailer yet, I'm getting more excited about Young Adult , the dark comedy that pairs Juno collaborators Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody. Today we get to see the official poster, which gives us more of an insight into Charlize Theron 's character, a young adult novelist trying to get back together with her ex-boyfriend (Patrick Wilson). The art is reminiscent of a vintage book cover, a nod to the lead character's occupation, but the focal point is obviously our protagonist passed out cold, clutching a bottle of booze as her tiny pooch looks on. I can't wait to see Oscar winner Theron go off the deep end when the movie debuts Dec. 16. Excited too? Check out a bigger version of the Young Adult poster when you read more.
