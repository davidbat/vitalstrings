South African stunner, Charlize Theron is a bit of an enigma in Hollywood. You're not likely to see her in whatever paint by numbers romantic comedy is out at the moment, she almost prefers to draw the least amount of attention possible to her pretty face and opts for gritty projects like Monster, North Country and The Road. Then again, she's not so serious that she can't make a cameo in Robot Chicken or Between Two Ferns .
