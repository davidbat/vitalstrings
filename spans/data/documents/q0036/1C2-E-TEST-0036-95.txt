The Golden Globes are tonight, the only awards show were TV and movie actors mix and mingle at large circle tables and gush to the Hollywood Foreign Press association. But enough about that, let’s focus on the dresses. From the couture Dior to the vintage Versace, this is the Golden Globes best dressed list.
Charlize Theron: Charlize Theron looks flawless in couture Dior. With a giant bow on the waist, a high leg slit, and a beaded headband, this woman can do no wrong. Notify me when Theron makes it onto the worst dressed list, oh wait, that’s NEVER going to happen.
Angelina Jolie: Jolie could wear sweats and still be sexier than Mila Kunis, Charlize Theron and Beyonce combined, so she did not disappoint in a sultry cream satin Atelier Versace gown with red accents. This woman is so regal, she’s like a limited edition 1950’s Barbie doll.

The Critics Choice Movie Awards were last night, which means more chances to see celebrities wearing pretty gowns. While red carpet stars like Ryan Gosling and Angelina Jolie did not show up to the event, we made do with the fashion hits and misses from the rest of Hollywood royalty.
Charlize Theron : While I cannot pronounce the name of Charlize Theron’s Azzedine Alaia gown, it doesn’t matter because all you need to say is, “wow.” This stunning black gown featured an exaggeratedly ruched skirt and figure-hugging bodice.

The Palm Springs Film Festival Awards Gala kicks off awards season in Hollywood, so you would expect the stars to be on their best red carpet behavior, right? Wrong. Some stars stunned this weekend, and others did not.
Angelina Jolie: Are you having deja vu with this look? Jolie really loves those flowy grecian inspired gowns and went with a greige (Grey-Beige?) Elie Saab gown with halter neckline. She kept her hair and make-up natural, as per usual, and for accessories she chose Brad Pitt.
