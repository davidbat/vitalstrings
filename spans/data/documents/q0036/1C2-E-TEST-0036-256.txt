Celebrity Real Estate
Glee Creator Selling Charlize Theron’s Former Malibu, CA Home (PHOTOS)
Ryan Murphy is best known as the creator or co-creator of hit television shows such as Popular, Nip/Tuck, Glee, and American Horror Story, and a bit lesser known for his dabbles in real estate – dabbles that have included ownership of a Carl Maston-designed mid-century mod and the purchase of Charlize Theron’s Malibu, CA home. Now, a year removed from buying Theron’s sweet digs for $6.562 , Murphy is looking to sell the beachfront home.
So what will the $6.995 million price tag get you? For starters, the property is one of the finest in La Costa Beach. It offers just under 2,100-square-feet of living space spread over two floors, with three bedrooms and four bathrooms. Highlights of the home include a private courtyard with Koi poind, open living room, chef’s kitchen and a “bright lanai” However, the real appeal has to be the oversized beachfront deck, which boasts a cabana, lounge, fire pit, spa AND an outdoor shower.
The listing is presented by Ann M. Eysenring of The Partners Trust .
