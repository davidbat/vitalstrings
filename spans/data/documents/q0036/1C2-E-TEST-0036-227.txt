In an interview published with the gorgeous spread, Charlize spoke about her forthcoming film Young Adult, where she plays a young adult named Mavis with hair extensions and a stuffed silicone bra. The character tries to win her married high school boyfriend back.
Charlize had a lot of fun on this upcoming film and said her return to the silver screen brought back memories of her youth.
“I was on this date and started making out, and it was moving a little further, so I realized I had to get the cutlets out,” Theron recalls. “But my bag was small, and I couldn’t fit them in the thing. Jason [Reitman] was like, ‘No way. That doesn’t happen!’ But that stuff happens to girls all the time.”
Charlize later explains that she took her cutlets out and hid them in the trash with toilet paper!
