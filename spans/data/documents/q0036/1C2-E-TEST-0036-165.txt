As compassionate as she is gorgeous, Charlize Theron is always willing to lend her voiceand in this case, her faceto raise awareness about cruelty to animals. Charlize and her adorable canine companion “Tucker” posed for the latest “If          you wouldn’t wear your dog…” ad for PETA, which          will be gracing billboards in a town near you soon.
Animals raised for their fur spend their entire lives in filthy, cramped            cages with no shelter from the blazing-hot sun, the rain, or freezing            temperatures. They never receive veterinary care for any diseases or injuries            they suffer, and they all die horrible deaths at the hands of the fur            farmers, who drown them, electrocute them, or break their necks. Millions            of other wild animals suffer horribly after being caught in steel-jaw            leghold traps, snares, or underwater traps.
There’s nothing glamorous or stylish about wearing fur, and Charlize            knows that as a style icon, girls all over the globe are looking to her            for the latest trends and the hottest red-carpet fashions, so she’s            quick to set a good example. She joins other compassionate glamour gals—like            Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Jessica Parker, Gisele Bündchen, Christina            Applegate, P!nk ,            Gwyneth Paltrow, Aimee Echo, Agent            M , Christy Turlington, Pamela Anderson, Stella McCartney, Charlotte            Ross, Jo from Le Tigre, and Persia            White —who would never be caught dead in the pelts of small,            tortured animals. The guys are getting in on the act, too. Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, Brad            Pitt, Sugarcult’s            Marko 72 , the guys from Simple            Plan , Jack Osbourne, and designer Marc Bouwer are all speaking out            against wearing dead animals as decoration. Even celebrity stylist extraordinaire            Phillip Bloch says, “I advise my clients against it. It’s            a hot-button issue.”
An outspoken advocate for animals, the big-hearted Oscar winner also narrated          our puppy            mill investigation video and sent letters to every mall in the country            with a pet store, asking them to replace the stores with animal adoption            centers that work with local shelters to find homes for homeless animals.
Charlize says, “I grew up on a farm in South Africa, so I’ve            always been surrounded by animals. I was raised by a mother who always            had great compassion and respect toward animals. It was instilled in me.            I grew up that way. So when I see dogs or other animals suffer, it's just            been something close to my heart.”
So it just goes to show you, sometimes beauty isn’t only skin deep.
