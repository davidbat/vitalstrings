Flower
Charlize has a blue flower tattooed on her right foot. We do not have any information on when or where the tattoo was inked,
or what the meaning behind it is, but it is most likely a little tribute to Charlize’s love of gardening and nature.
Koi fish
Charlize and her mother got matching tattoos of little koi fish on their ankles in early 1990s.
This beautiful tattoo is a tribute to Charlize’s love of the ocean and water in general.
