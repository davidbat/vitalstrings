Charlize Theron: Yoga Helped Me Quit Smoking
By MindBodyGreen
Charlize Theron took her mom to yoga this weekend (isn't that awesome that she brought her mom?!), but did you know that Charlize credits yoga with helping her quit smoking?
Charlize just recently  talked about kicking the habit:
"I used to be such a bad, bad smoker - shameless, Marlboro Reds, three packs a day, chain-smoking, horrible. I don't know how anybody lived with me. I started yoga and Pilates in the hope that dedicating myself to a healthy ritual would help me stay off cigarettes and it has."
That 'connecting to the breath' stuff that we talk all about here seems to work, don't you think?
Namaste to that!
