Exclusive: “You’re going to be happy”
Dec 23rd 2011 By Total Film
Total Film recently sat down with the delightful Charlize Theron to chat about her award-baiting turn in Jason Reitman’s Young Adult, and talk turned to her role in Ridley Scott’s Prometheus.
When we asked if her role in the Alien sorta-prequel would be comparable to Sigourney Weaver’s iconic Ripley, she replied, “No, I actually don’t play the heroine in it; that’s Noomi Rapace. I play somewhat of a villain in it.”
When we pressed her on the type of villain she’d be playing, she told us, “She’s not believer, she’s not a scientist, she is the red tape that everyone has to go through.
“She’s working with the company that’s sponsoring this whole thing and you can feel she definitely has an agenda, which we pick up in the third act. She’s more quiet thunder.”
On whether there’ll be anything in Prometheus to compare to the original’s chest-bursting scene, she cryptically said, “Maybe! I mean if you’re a Ridley Scott fan and you love the genre, then you’re going to be happy. You’re going to be very, very happy.”
Young Adult opens on 10 February 2012, with Prometheus following on 1 June.
