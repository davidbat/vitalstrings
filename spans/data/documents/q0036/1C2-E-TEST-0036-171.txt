"Indeed a match!",,,,only if Ryan would gonna stay with Charlize for life, otherwise a waste of time, effort, oppurtunity and worst a heartache, remember the Charlize is already 35,,,,,it would be better for her if she finds a man who will truly love her for the rest of her life........possibility of relationship: not more than 5 yrs.

Well it appears if Charlize Theron didn't know that he was out with Scarlett within the last week, she does now..

They're close in age so that's good. I forget how old Ryan is. He always seems like he's stuck at 30 because he's aging well. But 34 and 35 is good.  After Scarlett I'm sure Ryan doesn't want marriage again and Charlize never wants marriage so these two could easily be another Kurt and Goldie just together forever.

What happened with her and Stuart? I loved them together!! This is an odd pairing to me.

Funny, cuz "People" just reported Ryan Reynolds & Scarlett Johansson had a "flirty dinner date"...

At least they are closer in age and "seem" to have the same temperment. BUT since when does Charlize not want to be in public with her man? She was with her ex in public a lot..at least according to the pictures that I saw.

what a beautiful couple! it's a good match ;)

She's beautiful, something Scarlet fever knows nothing about. I wish these 2 the best, they seem like they'd make a great couple.

If it's privacy she wants, you can't date a more private person than Ryan, He married and divorced Scarlett before anybody knew it. There was no Red Carpets, no smiling at the camera, no PDA.  This man says he wants a personal life and he really means it!!

They make a really nice couple. I hope it works out.   Treasures Of Goodness (Google it)
