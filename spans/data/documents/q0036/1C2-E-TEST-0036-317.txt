It was actually yesterday. No, I was twelve I think, twelve or thirteen.
NYROCK:
What was it like playing De Niro's wife in Men of Honor?
CHARLIZE:
It was just absolutely amazing. It wasn't a large role, but to me that part was just so big, because it was so layered. And when you work with somebody like Bob, there's just no two ways about it. There's like four hundred ways about it.
I only worked on Men of Honor for three weeks, but I walked away with so much. Because Bob is the kind of actor who gives you the opportunity to really go there. And we really had to go there. I mean, we were both playing drunks.
We had lines like somebody telling him, I didn't know you had a daughter. And I'm like, this is my husband. And being completely obnoxious, being drunks. So you've got to sometimes do that all by yourself. But it's just such a gift when you work with an actor who actually takes you by the hand, and goes there with you. And he does even more than that. So I would love to work with Bob again, I really would.
NYROCK:
De Niro is quite an enigma to people. What's he really like?
CHARLIZE:
He's somebody who doesn't take himself too seriously. People think he's very serious. He is shy, but he's got a great sense of humor about things. And he's fearless, I mean absolutely serious.
That was a pretty funny sex scene with Matt Damon in Bagger Vance, where you kind of get caught by a kid with your pants down.
Yeah, that was cute. But I think he was a little disappointed, because maybe he expected a bra and panties, you know, like contemporary stuff. And then I was basically in his grandmother's underwear. The kid was like, I thought you were gonna look like one of them girls in Victoria's Secret.
NYROCK:
Why have you said that you will never work with Ben Affleck again after Reindeer Games? You seemed like a pretty hot couple in the movie.
CHARLIZE:
No, I didn't want to work with Ben again. I gotta say something about him to get him back for all his stuff about Charlize being very method and I'm a very giving actor. I'm gonna shoot him in the head! What the hell is that about? Everywhere I'm going I see this headline: Charlize is method, Ben a very giving actor.
NYROCK:
How have you managed to be something more in movies than just another pretty face?
CHARLIZE:
Well, I pay them off! I'd love to sit here and say that's all there is to it, but you've gotta have a checkbook handy. But seriously, that's extremely flattering. And I do think that earlier in my career, I did make a very conscious decision to make sure that I was doing work that wasn't necessarily given to me, and that people didn't necessarily think that I would be able to do.
But I'm still very attracted to those parts. I think it's the child in me saying, I'll show you. You know, when they say no, you can't do that. So I did that for a long time in my career, and I waited for parts to play myself just physically down a little bit. But I do feel like I'm at a place in my career now where I don't necessarily fret about that too much anymore.
NYROCK:
Does it take much effort to look as stunning as you do in Men of Honor?
CHARLIZE:
Charlize as Adele Invergordon
in The Legend of Bagger Vance
I am human, and, yeah, I have very bad days. I have very talented people dress me and put my makeup on, stuff like that. But I do love that look, and I think it's maybe because I grew up on that old glamour. I grew up on Bette Davis movies, and Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe. And I think it may have been easier back then, because it was celebrated.
I think today women are very scared to celebrate themselves, because then they just get labeled. And I was victim to that very early in my career, where I would go into auditions, and I'd be wearing a big T shirt, a big baggy T shirt and loose jeans. You know, to try and show people that there was more to me than just that. Now, luckily, I'm at a place where I don't have to fear that anymore. And so I just ride it as hard as I can.
But that classic look is so great. When I do period movies, I can't believe that women wore hats all the time. And I don't even own a hat, things like that which I so wish we still had today. I don't know if it's conscious, it's just purely because I love it, I love that classic stuff.
NYROCK:
What's the greatest thrill of being an actress and immersing yourself in a role like this?
CHARLIZE:
All those little nuances, like coming up with a certain speech pattern or rhythm for the character. And doing a film in that period, and having to really celebrate what they wore back then, how they sat and how they spoke. You know, what the etiquette was back then for a lady. All of those things are like putting on a wig and transforming yourself, which I love. Women looked beautiful. Hey, I'm a girl, and we like to play dress-up.
NYROCK:
Who exactly is Charlize Theron, and what qualities would an actress have to have to play you in a movie?
CHARLIZE:
A lot of hair color! Hmm... A lot of high heels. But that's such a weird question. I don't necessarily sit in the bathtub and go, if somebody were to play me... I don't know, I might be wrong, but I feel that people think when you're pretty, that you take yourself seriously. And the person who would play me would definitely have to be fearless as far as making a fool out of themselves. Because I do that many times a day!
NYROCK:
What about that new Woody Allen movie, are you allowed to tell me anything about it?
CHARLIZE:
It's a forties detective story. Hey, that's all I'm gonna say.
