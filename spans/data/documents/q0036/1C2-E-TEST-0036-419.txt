Charlize Theron  with Short Hair
Here is a look that keeps coming back. Short hair cut with wild and tousled waves that work in almost every occasion.
If you have natural waves or texture in your hair, you can create this look in less time.            Center part the hair, mist some sea salt spray (avoiding the scalp and crown            section on top) and let it dry naturally.

Not enough waves!? To add some extra wild waves you can pull each side          into a bun before leaving it to dry. To finish the look for a night out, add few controlled waves around the          face using a curling iron. Do not overdo.
If you have straight or curly hair, this look might take some extra work with straightening iron and might not suit your lifestyle.
Some of her styles and looks from previous years...
Hair styles with short hair cut that suits a model or celebrity may not be the best style for your face shape, so make sure the style you select  flatters your face. Try different celebrity hair styles on your own face.
For styling shorter hair build the base of your style with hair styling mousse and then use texturizing product to create more volume and movement.
