Charlize Theron is one of those actresses who seems to have a complete package.  She’s definitely talented (I could barely recognize her in the role of a sympathetic serial killer in Monster ), benevolent , looks like a super model, is dating the handsome Stuart Townsend, AND recent shots of her  in various countries promoting the movie Hancock shows that she has great taste in shoes.
To wit, let’s start off Charlize’s shoe fashion bonanza at this week’s Hollywood premiere of Hancock.  I love that she’s forgoes stilettos and paired the soft dress with romantic Giuseppe Zanotti sandals.
I couldn’t find the exact shoes online, but Zappos does have a similar Giuseppe Zanotti version with the same stone color available as a slide for $699.
If you prefer the same Zanotti style but not the color, it’s available at Zappos in white stone for $599 .
 
Still another slightly cheaper option (though not by much) is the pink Giuseppe Zanotti t-strap,  on sale at Endless in pink stone for $455 .  I would have preferred Charlize have worn either the white or pink colors with the light seafoam colored dress as there is less of a contrast in colors, but nonetheless I’ve still pretty satisfied.
And going further back to earlier premieres of Hancock, Charlize Theron glams it up at the German premiere wearing a black Christian Lacriox dress and Dior ankle booties , currently selling at Eluxury for $880.

Keeping with the current trend of ethnic and tribal prints, Charlize is wearing the Sigerson Morrison toe sandal (on sale for $315) and is accompanied by that scrumptious boyfriend, Stuart Townsend.

And finally, Charlize in a white Dior dress and beautiful bejeweled peep-toe animal print slingbacks (whew, say that all in one breathe).  Shoe designer unknown…any ideas?  At first, the animal print made me think Roberto Cavalli but the heel tip doesn’t seem to fit.
