In the May 1999 issue of Playboy magazine, nude photos of Charlize Theron were published without her permission. It wasn't a case of Hugh Hefner offering Charlize millions of dollars to pose for a photo shoot.  The shots taken during the early days in Charlize 's modeling career and, according to the star, they were intended for private use only. Even though the photos were tastefully shot, they highlighted Theron's amazing figure.  Still, she was less than pleased and sued photographer Guido Argentini and won the case. Fortunately for us guys, the photos were already published and couldn't be retracted. In the end, Charlize came out on top since she was thrust into the public eye in more ways than one.
