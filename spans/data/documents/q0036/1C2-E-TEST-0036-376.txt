Charlize Theron was born an only child in Benoni, South Africa on August 7, 1975. She grew up near Johannesburg on her parent’s farm, and began attending The National School of the Arts at age 13. After winning a local modeling competition she traveled to Milan, Italy on a one year modeling contract. This took her to New York City where she enrolled in the Joffrey Ballet School, but a knee-injury forced her to cut her dance career short.  Charlize was discovered by her first manager at a bank, when she was yelling at a teller for refusing to cash a check. This got her noticed by other talent agents, and within 8 months she had a non-speaking role in “Children of the Corn”. In the late 90s she landed more noted roles in films such as “The Cider House Rules” and “Mighty Joe Young”.  It was in 2003, when Charlize was cast in the film “Monster” that she won The Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe and SAG Award. She earned her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005. Charlize is an active advocate for PETA and women’s rights, as well as a large supporter of gay marriage. She dated fellow actor Stuart Townsend from 2001-2009. Charlize Theron has an estimated networth of $30 Million.
