Charlize Theron, who plays one powerful mean queen in "Snow White and the Huntsman," says she was bullied by a pack of mean girls in school.
Theron, currently working the awards circuit for an acclaimed performance in Jason Riteman's "Young Adult," opened up about her days being teased -- days that saw a much less glamorous Charlize walking the halls.
"I wore really nerdy glasses because I was blind as could be and the boys didn't like [me]," Theron said in New York, where "Adult" was recently screened with Dior. "I didn't have any boyfriends, but lots of crushes."

"I actually got a lot of the mean-girl stuff from the ages of 7 to 12. I was pretty much a mess in primary school," she said . "But I got that out of my system by the time I got to high school and was more immune to all of that stuff."
Considering the Oscar-winning glamazon we've grown accustomed to, we'd say she's more than immune. "Adult" casts Theron as a boozy, vicious writer of teen fiction who returns to her hometown to steal back her high school boyfriend.
At least she's got some character background.
