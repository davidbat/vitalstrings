Julia Roberts vs. Charlize Theron: Who Makes the Better Snow White EvilÂ Queen?
Comments: 18 || Add Yours
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest Evil Queen of them all? Is it Julia Roberts, who will star opposite Lily Collins's Snow White in Tarsem Singh's untitled fairy tale adaptation? Or is it Charlize Theron, who will play the wicked queen opposite Kristen Stewart's armored Disney princess in Snow White and the Huntsman? Take a look at the side-by-side comparison below before deciding for yourself.
Entertainment Weekly premiered the first photo of Roberts in character as the Evil Queen as well as a few other new photos of Lily Collins and Armie Hammer. While we love Lily Collins's Snow White ballgown (no comment on the Bjork-inspired headpiece ), Julia Roberts looks more like a poorly-outfitted peasant with a soft spot for peacock feathers than an evil sorceress who plots deaths via poisoned apples. Which Evil Queen do you prefer?
Both Snow White films are due in theaters next year.
