Finding Her Core
Background:
"When all the Hollywood hype falls away, what is left? The work, living and  breathing a character. When you find that core, nothing else matters." Charlize  Theron
After giving a powerful performance as serial killer Aileen  Wuornos, in the movie Monster, Charlize Theron is now considered one of the most  talented and beautiful actresses of her generation. Having to forgot glamour in  order to portray killer-prostitute Aileen, Charlize stunned audiences with her  brilliant talent. She won over a dozen awards, including an Oscar for Best  Actress, for the role.
Charlize is beautiful, gifted with talent, and has vowed never  to star in a mediocre movie again, following that performance.
She is loyal to her homeland of South Africa, snuggles with  actor Stuart Townsend and can send fans rushing to theatres. Charlize is well...  Charlize Theron, now a legendary actress in her own time. "I've always been very  proud to be a South African and I've always been very honest to people about  that. And whatever I can do in my power, I promise you I will do. I don't think  it's too much pressure.
I think it's our duty as citizens of this country. You don't  have to win an Oscar to do something good for your country. We all can do that.  If I can be an encouragement for that I'll be glad to be that."
South Africa's Child
Childhood and Family:
Natural blonde beauty Charlize Theron was born on August 7, 1975 in Benoni,  South Africa. The only child to parents Charles (French, construction company  owner) and Gerda (German, later took over family business), Charlize was raised  on a farm. In 1990, Charlize's mother was forced to defend herself and her child  by shooting Charles (father) while he was dangerously drunk.
"I was always Mama's girl, and I always felt like her  protector." Charlize Theron
Charlize (nicknamed Charlie) loved dance and ballet, even  dancing professionally in Johannesburg and later performing with New York's  Joffrey Ballet. Charlize also worked as a model in Milan, Italy, after winning a  local modeling contest. She traveled and when working in New York, decided to  stay.
"Ballet taught me how to fantasize. That's what dance is about.  You can be a princess. You can be anything. I became ridiculous. Other people's  mothers would laugh at me because I was the biggest drama queen." Charlize  Theron
After a knee injury (hurting her ballet career), Charlize headed  for Hollywood. In 1994, Charlize was noticed by a talent scout after arguing  with a bank teller in a Los Angeles bank.
