Where You've Seen Her: Charlize is not only one of the most beautiful women on the planet, but also one of its finest actresses and models. She's receivedÂ  high praise from films The Cider House Rules (1999), The Italian Job (2003), her Academy Award-winning role in Monster (2003) and another nomination for North Country (2005), in addition to being the face of Christian Dior's J'ADORE campaign. Although we prefer to see her fully fleshed out, we'll be all ears when she provides her voice for the narrator in Astro Boy (opening October 23). We just hope she doesn't get too used to offering her pipes for animation!
Preach It, Sister: "I'm a sexual creature. There's nothing wrong with that. Why do we have to be ashamed of being so many different things? Why do we have to be only one thing, a good mother or a hooker? I don't think that what's under my clothes is evil. I'm a woman, I'm feminine. And I like the way I look. And I celebrate that. And I don't make excuses for that." (via IMDb )
