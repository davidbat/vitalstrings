Short Bio
Charlize Theron's Oscar-winning career started with a heated argument in a bank -- she had recently moved to Los Angeles and was trying to cash a check from her mother, but the teller refused. Their spat caught the attention of a talent agent who was standing in the same line. The rest is history.  
Once famous for her looks, Charlize Theron has displayed real talent to go along with it, thanks to her image-altering role in Monster, which won her an Oscar, and her work in North Country, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Among other things, 2008 saw her starring with Will Smith as well as getting some international attention from the United Nations.  Read more about Charlize Theron
