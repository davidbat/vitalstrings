"I'm                        one who seriously hates human life and would kill again.                        So what's the point! Let's move on. I am asking here then                        for the Florida Supreme Court to step in and 'Do Something.'" - Aileen Wuornos (in a letter to the Florida Supreme Court                        pleading for execution, June 2001)

Is Aileen Wuornos really considered to be the first female                        serial killer?
No. Although the media hyped Aileen Wuornos as the first                        female serial killer, in reality women have been murdering                        just as long as men. There methods are usually somewhat                        different, often preferring poison to a gun. This may be                        why Aileen was wrongly touted as 'the first female serial                        killer.' She killed her victims by way of a gun instead                        of the stereotypical devices that women serial killers have                        often used in the past.
For                        example, in 1981 the pediatric department of the Bexar County                        Hospital in San Antonio, Texas watched as many as twenty-five                        infants die due to cardiac arrest or runaway bleeding. The                        hospital soon discovered that most of the deaths occurred                        while the infants were in the care of licensed vocational                        nurse Genene Jones (right). After as many as forty-two baby                        deaths ended up under investigation, the grand jury returned                        indictments against Jones. She was charged with murder after                        the discovery of excess drugs in one patient's body. A second                        trial found her guilty of administering an overdose of the                        blood thinning drug heparin to a different child. This 1984                        trial decision caused hospitals across Texas to begin shredding                        records of her employment. Why did she do it? Possibly to                        be seen as the hero when she was able to save some of the                        children. -stagedirect.com/massmurder
How many murders did Aileen Wuornos really commit?
Aileen admitted to killing seven men, including a missionary.                        She was only convicted of killing six men because the missionary's                        body was never found. In the film Monster, this missing                        seventh man is very similar to the last man that Aileen                        (Charlize Theron) murders. -dailystar.com
Why did Aileen Wuornos commit the murders?
Abandoned                        by her teenage mother, Aileen was left in the care of her                        grandparents when she was just a toddler. Her father, whom                        she never met, hanged himself in a Kansas prison. He had                        been serving a life sentence for raping a 7-year-old girl.         Aileen claimed to have been sexually abused by her grandfather                        and raped when she was 13. She had her first child when                        she was 14, a baby boy, which she put up for adoption. Her                        grandmother died soon after the baby's birth. Aileen subsequently                        dropped out of school, left home, and became a prostitute.                        In the years that followed, Aileen's grandfather committed                        suicide and her brother Keith died of cancer. By no means                        should her childhood be a justification for her actions,                        but it definitely could have left her with severe emotional                        scars. Murdering, which she claimed with her first victim                        was an act of self-defense, was also a way for her to make                        money to support herself and her girlfriend/friend Tyria                        Moore, who was 24 when they met at a gay bar in Daytona. -About.com (Lesbian Life)
Was Aileen Wuornos ever married?
Yes. Shortly after arriving in Florida, Aileen married an                        elderly man named Lewis Fell, who earned a substantial income                        from railroad stocks. Fell took out a restraining order                        on Aileen after she was arrested back home in Michigan for                        hurling a cue ball at a bartender's head. The marriage was                        subsequently annulled after Lewis Fell claimed that Aileen had squandered his money and would beat him with his cane                        whenever she wanted more cash. -CrimeLibrary.com
Is there any evidence that Aileen's first murder was                        an act of self-defense?
For                        some time this remained uncertain. With nothing to support                        her claims, Aileen was convicted of killing Richard Mallory                        (right, click to enlarge) in January of 1992. In November                        of that year, Dateline NBC reporter Michele Gillens discovered                        that Richard Mallory had served 10 years for violent rape                        in another state. Aileen was never given a re-trial.

While on death row was Aileen really legally adopted?
Yes. Although it's not shown in the film, while on death                        row Aileen was befriended and legally adopted by Arlene                        Pralle, who claimed to have received her orders to do so                        from God. -CrimeLibrary.com
Did Aileen Wuornos really wish to be put to death?
Yes. Aileen wrote to Florida's seven Supreme Court Justices                        on two different occasions requesting that they cancel her                        pending appeals. Regarding her guilt and preference for                        the setting of an execution date, she stated, "While                        I say, fine and dandy, so be it, and if you'd like I'll                        be more than happy to take a polygraph, too, just so matters                        are that much more justified before proceeding." -news-journalonline.com
What was the meaning behind Aileen's strange last words?
In all of my research, it seems that no one is really sure                        of the meaning behind Aileen Wuornos' last worlds where                        she said, "I'd just like to say I'm sailing with the                        Rock and I'll be back like Independence Day with Jesus,                        June 6, like the movie, big mothership and all. I'll be                        back." I don't want to speculate, so I'll leave it                        up to you to figure out a meaning.
How was Aileen Wuornos executed?
Aileen Wuornos was executed by lethal injection on October                        9, 2002 at Florida State Prison.
How did Monster director Patty Jenkins obtain her                        material for the film?
Making her major motion picture filmmaking debut, director                        Patty Jenkins obtained a lot of her research material for                        the film by exchanging letters with the real Aileen Wuornos                        before Wuornos' 2002 execution. In a CNN interview Jenkins                        said that she also used, "Court documents ... lots                        of footage of her interviews, all of the transcripts and                        depositions from those trials. There have been a ton of                        books written about them. And talking to [Aileen]." -CNN
Is it true that actress and star Charlize Theron was                        the producer of the film Monster?
Yes. Charlize Theron was in fact the producer of the film Monster. In the CNN interview, director Patty Jenkins                        said the following about Theron's additional role on the                        set, "It was great. She really signed on as producer                        because I think that she knew, as did I, that there is a                        long hard road for a movie like this. And [the movie] can                        get pushed and pulled in all kinds of different directions.                        So instead of being this ... overlord as producer ... she                        really just put herself in a position where she could really                        defend what it was we wanted to do. And fight for it." -CNN
How concerned were the filmmakers with realistically                        depicting the true story?
Speaking about the realistic details of the film, director                        Patty Jenkins said, "All                        those details in the film were meticulously worked on. I                        am really obsessive about those details and so is Charlize.                        I can't stand characters with contradictory information.                        And that's the reason why, hopefully, there's the level                        of reality there -- because we made that reality." -CNN
Is it true that the filmmakers actually shot in the same                        bar that the real Aileen Wuornos used to visit?
Yes.                        Wanting to pay particular attention to the level of detail                        in the film, the filmmakers went to Port Orange, Florida                        to film at The Last Resort (right), a local bar there that                        the real Aileen Wuornos used to frequent regularly. The                        bar's owner, Al Bulling, said of Charlize Theron, "Every                        minute she was in this bar she was in character. Everything                        she did - from lighting cigarettes to laughing - was on                        target ...and how she acted, it was beyond excellent." Bulling wasted no time in marketing the bar's notorious                        visitor, selling T-shirts that declare The Last Resort as                        the "world famous home of ice cold beer and killer                        women." You can also buy bottles of Wuornos' favorite                        hot sauce that Bulling renamed "Crazed Killer Hot Sauce." The real Al Bulling is seen briefly in the film as a bartender                        who tells a drunk Theron-as-Wuornos that she can't run a                        tab for more beer. She begs "Al will give me credit," and he gives her another beer. On a side note, Bulling said                        that he can remember Wuornos asking for a ride home at times,                        but that she never propositioned anyone in the bar. After                        Aileen Wuornos' 1991 arrest made the news, three women showed                        up at the bar with photos to find out if their missing husbands                        had ever been seen in the bar with Aileen. -dailystar.com
Have any other movies been made about Aileen Wuornos?
Yes.                      In addition to Monster, there have been several films                      and television programs about Aileen Wuornos. Nick Broomfield                      directed two documentaries, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling                      of a Serial Killer (1992) and Aileen: Life and Death                      of a Serial Killer (2003). In 1992, the made-for-television                      movie Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story aired, starring                      Jean Smart (Bringing Down the House, 2003). Actress                      Jean Smart is pictured at right. Aileen Wuornos has also been                      featured on 60 Minutes, A&E, and Court TV.
With Aileen Wuornos so accurately portrayed by Charlize                        Theron, just how accurate was Christina Ricci's depiction                        of Wuornos' friend/lover?
Not very accurate, at least physically. To begin with, Wuornos'                        companion did not go by the name Selby. Her name was Tyria                        Moore and she was a strawberry-redhead. This lack of resemblance                        was likely intentional for legal reasons. Tyria Moore is                        still alive and could sue the filmmakers. -girlswithguns.org
How did Charlize Theron physically transform herself                        for the role of Aileen Wuornos?
Actress Charlize Theron underwent quite a drastic transformation                      to play the part of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Theron -                      who began her career as a model in her native South Africa                      before coming to the U.S. as a ballerina with the Joffrey                      Ballet - packed on between twenty-five and thirty pounds for                      the role. Makeup artist Tony G put on her makeup. This included                      two pairs of teeth, sculpted by Art Sakamoto, which she had                      to learn to speak with. Gelatin weighted down her eyelids,                      which caused them to sag, making her look tired. Other than                      her teeth, no prosthetics were used, just layers of paints. -monsterfilm.com

Wuornos'                      Letters and other Documents:
Below                      you can read two letters written by Aileen Wuornos, both to                      the Florida Supreme Court requesting for the dismissal of                      her appeals. They express her wish that an execution date                      be set. Her cursive is a little hard to read here at times,                      but it's still legible. The third document is the death warrant                      issued by Florida Governor Jeb Bush, which accommodates Wuornos'                      preference for execution.
