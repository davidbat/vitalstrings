Charlize Theron vs. Noomi Rapace: who looked hotter at the ‘Prometheus’ premiere?
I had too much to say about the photos from the UK premiere of Prometheus, so I had to split these up into two posts.  One post devoted solely to my love, my Forever Dong-bot Michael Fassbender.  Another post – this post – devoted to fashion and “other”.  It seems like everybody but Idris Elba came out for the premiere.  Charlize Theron was by far the most-photographed, although – as I said previously – Charlize is NOT the lead of Prometheus.  Her part is supporting – Noomi Rapace plays the lead character, but the photographers didn’t lovingly photograph Noomi’s every movement on the (blue!) carpet.
As for fashion… Charlize wore this great little Christian Dior dress.  It’s a great color for her, and her hair and makeup look pretty flawless.  Tiny little complaints: I think the bust of the dress is too tight on her or something, because there’s something awkward going on there.  And I hate the shoes.  Noomi wore Valentino, and she actually put some effort into looking glamorous for her big premiere.  I think it works.  Good (or improved) hair, good makeup, some diamond earrings and a great black gown.  Yes, the gown is a bit sheer, but it’s not like she’s wandering around London in her drawers .
I’m also including a small hint of Fassy (sigh…), Guy Pearce (gorgeous), Logan Marshall-Green (meh) and Salma Hayek, who was there for some reason.  It just occurred to me that Salma is probably Fassy’s type (dark with a sweetshop).  It also just occurred to me that Salma + Fassy = one of the best p0rns ever.  Jesus, I need a cigarette after that visual.

Kristen Stewart & Charlize go dark & glam for Interview Mag: beautiful or awful?
Words cannot even describe how much I loathe this Interview Magazine photo shoot.  I guess I’m just disappointed because I always held up Kristen Stewart’s 2009 Interview Mag cover shoot to be one of her best and prettiest photo shoots ever.  Her styling was gorgeous and dark and glam, and it worked beautifully on her.  For this July cover, Kristen is paired with Charlize Theron, her Snow White costar, and once again the magazine tries to do “dark/glam”.  They fail.  If it was just Charlize alone… maybe this could have succeeded.  But putting Charlize and Kristen together, styling them like extras in Cabaret… it’s just bad.  In my opinion.  Kristen’s look easily slips into androgyny, and the whole vibe seems very “An older dominatrix and her lithe boy-toy.”  As for the interviews – they’re epic and long and you can read both of them here .  I’m just going to do some excerpts from Kristen’s piece:
Working with male versus female directors: “In personal conversations between director and actor, the male directors that I’ve worked with are just as emotional [as women]. Maybe it’s because I had to start having very intimate conversations with adult men at a very young age in order to get the work, but I’m really comfortable with dudes. I mean, we push boundaries in this business in terms of getting to know people. There are things that directors know about me that people shouldn’t know. But everyone’s really different. I’ve worked with women who I’ve never wanted to tell anything about myself to, and I’ve worked with guys who have been pouring wells of emotion. So emotional availability is not a gender-specific thing.”
Relating to Snow White: “There’s so much that Snow White has been deprived of in terms of having the proper time to really develop and hone who she is. She’s put in jail at the beginning of her life, so she’s a stunted person. She has a really idealized concept of what the world is, and how people should live, and how wonderful things all can be, and there is this debilitating isolation that she feels because she has been locked away in a little cell for seven years. And I can kind of relate to that. There is something . . . It’s not the reason that I wanted to do the movie, but the fans and people who loved Twilight, they do put you on this sort of different plane where you’re not real.”
Snow White is not a ninja: “I think [the physicality] really helped define the character in a lot of ways. I liked not having to fake it, because in the original drafts of the script, Snow White kind of became this ninja person overnight who was just able to, like, own this six-foot armored man, which would never happen. We wanted everything to be, like, “Oh, f–k. She barely made it through.” Somebody my size couldn’t go into a man war and come out alive with only a sword. That just would never happen.”
On Charlize: “She is unlike anyone I’ve ever encountered. She is one of those people who walks into a room and everyone knows it… She’s a fucking movie star. It’s funny, too, because she always says, “I’m not really a performer.” But I’m like, “Yeah, not at all.” [laughs] She’s an actor and a performer.”
How she defines success: “I feel so extremely successful—and not just because I can greenlight a movie now. It’s because I’ve really only worked with people that I truly love, and I’ve only had bad experiences with one or two directors…[What was bad about those experiences…] I think it always boils down to people not being there for the right reasons, and not being there for the same reasons. It’s a miracle when things come together. But sometimes it just doesn’t happen—and when it doesn’t happen, you still have to finish the movie.
Playing an abused woman: Playing a character like Mallory [in Welcome to the Rileys] is tough. Not to discredit anyone’s personal situation or actual life, but there are so many examples of girls like that, and a film can very easily become an almost clinical rundown of what leads someone to a certain position. It’s hard to play a part like that because you want everyone who has ever walked in those shoes to be like, “Yeah, I mean, that’s the way it goes . . .” Pity is a really odd thing with abused women. You don’t want anyone to think that you feel bad—even though you might. So it was just interesting to play that part and to work with James. I went down to New Orleans to do the film and lived by myself and trudged around the city. But walking away from that character . . . It probably still hasn’t gone away completely, but for the first little while afterwards, I was so sensitive and touchy in a way that my character would never be. I was so protective and defensive of young girls, and sex in general.
She doesn’t want to talk about acting: “I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves, and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can, it’s so unnatural for me to do it on television, in interviews, in anything like that. I also don’t find that my process as an actor is really anyone else’s business. A lot of actors have felt like that. I mean, there’s that awesome quote where Joanne Woodward said, “Acting is like sex: you should do it, not talk about it.”
[ From Interview Magazine ]
If you couldn’t tell, these interviews are extremely verbose and Elvis Mitchell (the interviewer) pretty much lets Charlize and Kristen talk as much as they want in their separate interviews.  I have to say… Kristen comes across a lot better when you can read all of what she has to say in context.  She talks a lot about how much difficulty she has being entertaining on talk shows, and how she’s not good at delivering soundbytes, which… at least she’s self-aware, you know?  She’s also not a stupid girl, in my opinion.  She’s bright and she’s neurotic and she’s twitchy, of course.  But she really does think about her work and how she promotes her work and… she’s more interesting than I give her credit for most of the time.

Charlize Theron on ‘Go the F-ck to Sleep’: “I don’t need to judge myself”
Here are some photos of Charlize Theron after taping the “Today” show to promote Snow White and the Huntsman, which I am sincerely looking forward to watching in the theater. Charlize looks fierce in this black dress and matching strappy sandal heels, and I think she looks her best with a really good blowout too. She’s certainly a fierce bitch in her own right, and Charlize has now discussed how hard it is to turn off her own potty mouth tendencies now that baby Jackson has made his preferences known for the very difficult period in every parent’s life known as “bedtime.” So much so that Charlize has announced that her favorite children’s book is Go the F-ck to Sleep, which is famously narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. As a parent, I can certainly identify with Charlize’s plight:
Bad habits are hard to break — just ask potty mouth Charlize Theron.
When asked by MTV News if she’s been able to tone down her colorful language since adopting son Jackson in March, the 36-year-old Snow White and the Huntsman star laughed and shook her head.
“A lot of people have sent me these children’s books, and there’s this amazing book, a best-seller called Go the F-ck to Sleep,” she said. “This book was good for me because it made me realize that I don’t need to judge myself right now.”
Written by Adam Mansbach, Go the F-ck to Sleep has been called “a parenting zeitgeist” by The Washington Post and “a new Bible for weary parents” by The New York Times. For Theron, it’s been a breath of fresh air.
“The whole book is just basically, ‘Please, go the f— to sleep,” she explained to MTV News. “Because [Jackson] doesn’t understand anything right now, and so he just wants my face to look a certain way.”
Theron also spoke about the joys of motherhood — diaper duty included! — on Today Tuesday. “I love it! I’ve got to tell you, I’m available for other babies’ diapers to be changed. I can do it in my sleep now,” the Oscar winner bragged. “I’m so good.”
“As we were traveling, I had to buy diapers in different countries — because he came on the press tour with me — so I now know how to change a Japanese diaper, a Spanish diaper, an English diaper, German diaper,” Theron added. “They all have little things [that are different]. I’m, like, the diaper pro now!”
[From Us Magazine ]
Go the F-ck to Sleep really is an amusing book especially in audio format because of Sam Jackson’s distinctive voice, but I can only handle the first half before the F-bombs really do get to be a bit much even for me. It’s also quite interesting how Charlize discusses her expertise in changing diapers of differing nationality. One never thinks about that until faced with the possibility, of course. I think I’ll just take her word for it.

Charlize Theron’s two dogs have been helping her with baby Jackson
Charlize Theron is interviewed on today’s Ellen DeGeneres Show.  Usually, I just kind of ignore Ellen’s interviews – I mean, I like Ellen and everything, but I’m not crazy about doing a lot of coverage from television interviews.  But this one moved me.  Charlize has been doing press for Prometheus and Snow White and the Huntsman for weeks now, but somehow she’s managed to avoid really talking about her son Jackson, and the adoption process she went through and all of that.  But she gives it up to Ellen, including some personal photos of her dogs and her son.
Charlize describes bringing a newborn son into a household that includes two dogs, saying: “It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever witnessed.  From the moment this baby came into our home. Those two dogs have never been more in love. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever witnessed… People keep saying, oh you’re a single mom and I’m like actually I’m not. I got two boys (her dogs) helping me out. It’s incredible.” She says her terrier mutt Berkley is “the pacifier thief… He’ll just lay there with the pacifier in his mouth.” And Charlize says her Pit Bull “woke up with me for every feed, for every change, and whenever the baby would cry the Pitt would start crying.”
Charlize also confirms that she adopted Jackson from America, not Africa, and that she brought him home when he was nine days old.  She describes her two-year adoption process: “You know, it took me a while.  The process, it took around two years. My Mom said the most beautiful thing.  I’m going to cry.  She said,…it took me nine months to fall in love with you were growing in my stomach.  She’s like it took you two years to fall in love with this little baby.  It really took two years of just waiting and then one day it’s finally there.  It just feels exactly how it’s supposed to feel. I don’t know how to describe it.   It just feels right.”
Here’s the video – you should watch it just for the photos of Charlize’s dogs with the baby.

Kristen Stewart in a BCBG minidress in Madrid: boring   or awesome?
New photos of Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron!  Somehow, they managed to only do a photo call in Berlin yesterday, and they didn’t have a premiere…?  I can’t find the photos if there was a Berlin premiere.  So they’re on to their next stop: Madrid!  These are the pics from the Madrid photo call.  Charlize is wearing this red Giambattista Valli which… I’m not sure about.  It’s a great color on her, for sure.  And I like the idea of it.  But the execution, with the puffy shoulder embellishments – it’s kind of rough on her tall, broad figure.  It makes her look top-heavy and football-player-ish.  Kristen’s dress is BCBG Max Azaria.  It’s cute… eh.  I would like it better without the leather faux-suspenders.  Beyond that, it’s a silhouette that Kristen goes to all too often – the sleeveless, half-shift minidress.  Accessorized by bad posture.  It’s just kind of meh.
Incidentally, while promoting SWATH, Kristen was asked by Celebuzz about all of those casting rumors regarding 50 Shades of Grey. As you know, 50 Shades was based on Twilight fan-fiction, and the book is completely AWFUL.  But, as I said, it was written with Kristen and Sparkles in mind.  So what does Kristen think about it?
Kristen says : “I haven’t read the book yet– so I don’t know…I’m dying to make another movie with Rob, I think that we’re a good team… I just haven’t read it, so I don’t know what it is, but I would love to work with him again.” Sure.  Fine.  If Kristen and Sparkles get wrangled into this mess, that would be fine with me. Just keep g–damn Michael Fassbender OUT OF IT .

Charlize Theron: “I hate actors who quote Nietzsche, I don’t like pretentious s–t”
Charlize Theron is the cover girl for the June issue of InStyle Magazine (US).  She’s also on the cover of the Australian magazine Madison – I’m including the cover image at the end of the post.  I really like Charlize’s InStyle cover shoot, for what it’s worth.  Charlize has been churning out some really great photo shoots lately, but usually InStyle’s pictorials aren’t this… fierce…?  Is that the right word?  In any case, Charlize looks gorgeous.  As you know, she’s promoting Snow White and the Huntsman AND Prometheus, both out in June.  And she has no problems talking about babies and boys and she even comes close to claiming that she hasn’t had any work done – do you believe her?  Hm… anyway, here are some highlights from both InStyle and Madison:
On aging: “I don’t feel like I’m aging at all. I don’t think about that stuff. Especially not at 36.  I see my face and my body changing, and they’re all changes I’m OK with.  Part of me understands I may not be in front of the camera forever, and maybe not just because of age, but because of me. I wouldn’t have started my own production company if I didn’t feel that way.”
Becoming a mom: “So far I’m not surprised by anything about being a mom,” she said. “It’s all pretty great, but that’s what I expected.”
On her single status: “I’m always open to a relationship, but I’m not putting those feelers out there now.”
On having adopted son Jackson: Charlize recalled a letter she’d written when she was 8-years-old. “My mother found [it]. It said, ‘Would you please take me to orphanage, so that I can go and adopt a baby?’ I always knew I would adopt – always… It was never a question that one day I would have a child.”
On what she would do if she could switch careers at her current age: “I would be an amazing butler. I’m very good at organizing a house.”
Being a single mother: “You know, I don’t think any mother aims to be a single mum. I didn’t wish for that, but it happened.”
She’s not looking for a husband: “It’s never been a fantasy of mine.  Marriage has never been that important to me. I don’t know why exactly. Some might say it’s because my parents didn’t have a good marriage, but I don’t think so. I treat my relationships like marriages. The ceremony isn’t that important to me,” she adds.
She hates pretentious people: “You know what I can’t stand?  I hate actors who come and quote Nietzsche. I don’t like pretentious s**t. I like being around people who like to live life and understand the value of it. I need to be around people who understand we’re not curing cancer here. I like professional actors who show up, do the job and are not a pain in the a** to either myself or the crew.  I don’t believe in this idea that if you’re f****d up and Method, that’s the only way to do good work. It’s bulls**t. A professional actor does their homework beforehand and they do their job. Then when it’s all said and done, they have a beer with the crew. That’s what a professional actor does.”
[Excerpts via the NY Post , Become Gorgeous and The Gossip Girls ]
I love her diatribe against pretension.  I want to know if she’s directing that at a specific actor.  Who has she worked with recently?  Michael Fassbender.  Uh, no, not pretentious.  He probably buys the first round for the crew.  Idris Elba?  God, I hope not.  Noomi Rapace?  From what I hear, Noomi’s pretty low-key and sweet.  Kristen Stewart?  Hmm.  Charlize seems to like her.  Chris Hemsworth?  Doubtful.  Damn, I want to know who she’s calling out!!
As for her statement about marriage – I believe her.  I don’t think she’s one of those “Oh, I don’t want to get married unless you’ve got an engagement ring YES A MILLION TIMES YES!!!” women.  I think Charlize’s marriage apathy is for real.  And I do think it has a lot to do with her mom and dad’s situation.

Kristen Stewart in red Derek Lam for ‘SWATH’ photo call: improved & appropriate?
I know we’ve got a lot of Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron news today, but in my defense, there are lots of new photos, interviews and gossip.  And they are promoting the hell out of Snow White & the Huntsman… because both Charlize and Kristen have a lot riding on this movie.  Both of them need SWATH to be a big hit.  Will it be a big hit?  I think it will make a lot of money, but it won’t be like an Avengers or Hunger Games-style mega-hit.
Anyway, as I mentioned in the earlier K-Stew post , Kristen, Charlize and some of the SWATH people headed to Germany yesterday after the UK swing of the press tour.  I had hoped that the Berlin premiere would be held last night, but it looks like it’s going to be tonight.  These are photos from the (day-time) SWATH photo call.  First thought: I like that Charlize and Kristen don’t look like they’ve (badly) coordinated their looks like they did at the London premiere .
Apparently, Kristen’s dress is 10 Crosby by Derek Lam .  Still not wearing Balenciaga, I see.  Still, this Lam is a big improvement over the Marchesa hideousness.  I’m not really in love with the whole look, but Kristen looks presentable and interesting, which is an accomplishment.  Oh, and the belt is Alexander McQueen.  I feel like Charlize might have given her the belt.
As for Charlize’s outfit – I don’t know.  If anyone has the designer ID, please share it.  I think Charlize looks nice and appropriate here – and I buy that she probably had this outfit in her closet already, you know?  I’m also including a photo of Sam Clafin, “the prince” of SWATH.  He’s kind of meh.  He and Kristen look like siblings.

Charlize Theron refuses to give up her leather pants & stilettos for baby Jackson
It’s the new thing, you know. Mothers wearing crazy heels while holding their infants .  I feel like it’s a trend on par with the whole “not wearing your drawers and flashing the paparazzi” thing of 2006.  These are photos of Charlize Theron holding her son Jackson Theron in Paris.  We just saw photos of Jackson for the first time two days ago , also in Paris.  I think that was Charlize arriving in town for a quick promotional stop for Snow White and the Huntsman (Kristen Stewart was also in town), and in these photos, Charlize and Jackson are boarding a flight to London.  Is that a private plane?
Does the “wearing high heels while carrying a baby” issue really matter in the age of celebrity special treatment?  My guess is that Charlize was only walking in those heels, carrying Jackson, for a short distance, for a short amount of time.  Then she was resting comfortably in first class… or, if this is a private plane, there was even less time and distance involved.  And it’s not like she has to carry her own luggage or juggle all of the baby crap while holding the baby.  What I always hear from commenters is “I would never even dare wear those heels while carrying a baby because what if I fell?” Have you ever seen Charlize The Fierce Bitch unable to work her stilettos, though?  She won’t fall.
But yeah… traveling in stilettos?  I’m not cut out for it.  I swear, sometimes I’m all “Damn, my flip-flops are pinching!” I’m a weak bitch when it comes to shoewear.
