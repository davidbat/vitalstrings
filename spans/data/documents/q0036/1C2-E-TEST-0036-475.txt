Pierre Balmain Spring 2012 Video »
Charlize Theron was seen arriving at LAX, looking as chic as ever. She wore a pair of J Brand’s 811 skinny jeans in pure wash, with a utility style coat and a bright yellow Balenciaga bag. I love how her bag adds such a great pop of color. I have these jeans and the wash is actually much darker in person, it’s a great bluish-black color. The length is great too, these hit me right above the ankle and are really easy to tuck into boots for fall! Buy them online for $169 .
