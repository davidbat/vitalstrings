Why is She famous
After appearing in The Devil's Advocate, Reindeer Games, The Cider House Rules, and Sweet November, Charlize Theron starred in the stylish remake The Italian Job and struck Oscar gold with her gritty performance as a serial killer in Monster. Theron appeared in the 2008 drama Sleepwalking and Hancock. She followed up with 2009's The Road and also lent her voice to Astro Boy.
After a relatively quiet 2010 and 2011 in terms of releases, Charlize is back starring in Young Adult, written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman (whose last collabo was Juno). She's starring as the evil (and hot) Queen Ravenna in the upcoming Snow White and the Huntsman, which will be released in 2012.

92 Sex Appeal
Everything about Charlize Theron is sexy, from her amazing green eyes to her statuesque 5'10" body.
However, her sex appeal has a lot to do with her feminine grace and class, which she has in spades.  She always carries herself like a lady, and is never caught partying it up in the L.A. or New York club scene. Whether she's on the red carpet, in an interview or accepting an award, Charlize Theron always acts like a real woman.
83 Success
Charlize Theron was barely beaten out by Elizabeth Berkley for the lead role in Showgirls, which probably salvaged her chances of having a career. But many soon took notice of Charlize Theron after her sexy role in 2 Days in the Valley, and it was all uphill from then on.
After small roles in The Devil's Advocate and The Astronaut's Wife, she appeared in the 1999 Oscar-winning film, The Cider House Rules, which gave her more street cred among critics. Although Reindeer Games, The Legend of Bagger Vance and Sweet November all flopped, audiences were still willing to give her another chance.
Charlize Theron finally seems to be on the right track with her roles. She was in the 2003 remake of The Italian Job, in which she starred alongside Edward Norton and Mark Wahlberg . Charlize Theron proved that she's more than a beautiful face when she took home the Best Actress Golden Globe (in a Drama) and Oscar for her portrayal of real-life man killer Aileen Wuornos in the 2003 biopic Monster. Not only was she impeccable in the role, she was literally unrecognizable.
In 2004, Charlize Theron had roles in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers and Head In The Clouds, which were both met with mixed reviews. However, she received a Best Actress Golden Globe nomination for her lead performance in the drama North Country the following year, while also performing in the film Aeon that same year.
Charlize Theron was out of the limelight for a year, but in '06, Maxim magazine named her No. 25 in its annual Hot 100 issue. In 2007, she appeared in In The Valley Of Elah and Battle in Seattle, and in October of that year, Esquire magazine named Charlize Theron The Sexiest Woman Alive.
2008 had Charlize Theron in some big-name movies including Sleepwalking with Dennis Hopper and Woody Harrelson , as well as Hancock.Â 
She appeared briefly at the beginning of the harrowing 2009 film The Road, but now she's back starring in some funnier (but, truth be told, kind of dark) fare with Young Adult.
Charlize Theron Biography
Charlize Theron was born in Benoni, South Africa, on August 7, 1975.  Her father Charles worked on the family's road construction business, which mother Gerda took over after Charles' death in 1991.  Charlize Theron experienced tragedy early on in her life when her mother shot her father in self-defense after he threatened to kill her and Charlize in a drunken state.
Since the farm they lived on had no means of entertainment (no television or movies), Charlize Theron used her passion for dancing (specifically ballet) and her imagination to stay entertained.   After dancing in Johannesburg, she began modeling in Milan, Italy by the time she was 16.

But modeling was not fulfilling enough for Charlize Theron, who wanted to return to her original passion -- dance -- after only a year as a model.  While modeling gave her the opportunity to travel, she decided to stay in New York after a modeling shoot in order to study ballet at the Joffrey Ballet School in the Big Apple.
Unfortunately, Charlize Theron suffered a knee injury that ended her ballet career.  Jobless and broke, she headed for the West Coast with her mother's support.  In 1994, her luck changed when she made a scene at a Los Angeles bank after a teller refused to cash her check and a talent scout noticed her.

John Crosby (who also discovered model-turned-actress Rene Russo ) encouraged Charlize Theron to try her hand at acting.  It didn't take much convincing, since she was currently unemployed.  With no money to pay for a coach to perfect her English accent, Charlize Theron set out to lose her South African accent (her mother tongue is Afrikaans) by singing along to popular music and watching American television shows.
Unfortunately for us -- but fortunately for her career -- Charlize Theron was not cast as the lead stripper in the disastrous movie Showgirls.  But she finally landed her first "real" role, as Helga Svelgen in 1996's 2 Days in The Valley.  She also appeared in 1996's That Thing You Do!, directed by Tom Hanks , and still voices her appreciation to Tom Hanks for giving her that break.  Charlize Theron then appeared in 1997's Trial and Error costarring Michael Richards, and had a supporting role in The Devil's Advocate starring Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino .
