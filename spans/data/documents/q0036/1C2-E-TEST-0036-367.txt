Charlize Theron’s Vogue US December 2011
Before you look at it and judge, think that the most important trend for next year’s fashion is fashion aquatic. We’ve seen it everywhere on the catwalk, it was even in Victoria’s Secret 2011 show !
With that watery trend in mind, look at Charlize Theron’s Vogue US December 2011 cover and breathe – it gets better! The inside pictorial, as photographed by the amazing Annie Leibovitz is way more impressive than the cover . I don’t know about the swimming pose, but I guess there’s a perfectly fashionable explanation for it? ( see it here ; Charlize ’s feature goes by the name of “ Breaking Away ”)
