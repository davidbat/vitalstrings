Note to Ryan Reynolds: Really? Are you sure?!?
According to the latest issue of Us Weekly, the relationship between this actor and Charlize Theron is already over, scarcely two months after it began and without the pair ever making a public appearance together.
"He only wanted something casual, but she's in a rush to settle down, have kids and start a family since she's getting older," an insider said of the basis for the split.
How did the Oscar-winner take it? Not too well, a friend claims: "She knows deep down that it wouldn't have worked, but she is pretty bummed out about it all."
Having already been with Scarlett Johansson prior to Theron, it's unclear where Reynolds can even go from here. Megan Fox ? Mila Kunis? The beauty bar has been set impossibly high.
