Charlize's Retro Hairstyle
Charlize's current Retro 1920s hairstyle        doesn't really fit into the classic definition of a Bob        because it appears to have some discreet layering.  Yes, it's close to a classic bob (which is normally all        one length) but it is expertly angled        so that it dips slightly forward into seductive curvy        points in the front under her chin with some radical        shaper strands layered under her chin.  This builds in        beautiful movement and body.  It is also cut to        build in maximum fullness along the crown.  The        ends appear to have been either softly razored or cut        with a scissors at a point to create the texture and        angles.
Depending on some hair texture and        types, razoring may or may not be the best option.  With Charlize's current hairstyle the hint of textured feathering along        the perimeter creates just the right sharpness and edginess.

Her basic layered haircut also allows        Charlize to        either part her hair down the middle and wear a        shimmering veil of honey blonde strands framing        either side of her face or to wear a side part with a        side-swept, eye covering, fringe. 
When she wears the style with the        peek-a-boo fringe she also has the option to pull a few        tendrils forward so that they form soft pin curl shapes        along her cheeks.  Her side-swept bangs are also        curled into a classic pin curl created look.
Whether worn with or without the        side-swept strands, the style is perfect with her        classic heart shaped face and gorgeous features.
Her faux layered Bob cut takes on a        truly angelic and classic 20s flapper look with a traditional wet pin curl set.   The hair is set when        damp, but not dripping.  The finished pin        curls can be air dried or slowly dried while under a hood dryer of with a        diffused to avoid over blowing the curls.
To create the body along the crown,        curls are set in large loops.  For the tighter        curls along the sides, down the back and along the        fringe and tendrils, the curls are wound tighter. For        perfect symmetry, the curls are wound different        directions on each side for a perfectly balanced look.
Highlights And Lowlights
If you look closely you will be able to        see that Charlize's soft honey blonde tresses have been very        carefully highlighted with thin ribbons of lighter blonde        hues        placed strategically throughout her angled bob to add the        illusion of fullness and depth.  Additional lowlight        accent hues have also been interwoven with the base        color        and the lighter blonde highlights.

The lighter blonde highlights placed against the        soft honey blonde base also helps to bring out a        shimmering        shine.  Tiny lighter blonde streamers frame the        star's gorgeous face opening it up while playing off her        beautiful skin and eye tones. 
Steal Charlize 's Retro 30s Hair Style
Charlize's style is idea for hair that is        medium in thickness and cut shoulder to chin length in        graduated layers or a traditional bob style that is        inverted.
Follow the steps below to re-create Charlize's style:
1.  Start by washing your hair in        lukewarm water with a product designed to add back        moisture and to treat colored or highlighted hair with tender loving        care.

2.  Rinse hair well and then apply        a moisturizing rinse-out conditioner focusing the products on the        areas of the hair that are most dry or damaged.  If your hair is fine or thin you may wish to skip this        option.
For extra conditioning substitute the rinse-out        conditioner with a deep conditioner that is allowed to soak down into the hair's shaft.
3.  Finish with a cool/cold rinse        to lock in moisture and add additional shine.
4.  Towel blot to remove excess        moisture.  Apply a conditioning detangling spray or leave-in conditioner and detangle strands with        a wide tooth comb working from the ends to the roots. 
Create either a center or side part, depending on how        you wish to style your hair.
Note:  If your hair is prone to frizzing apply a defrisant product or mix with your other styling        products.
5.  For lots of fullness, lift and volume,        apply a volume enhancing product to the roots .  Distribute a straightening balm to the rest of the        strands distributing from below the roots to the ends.
