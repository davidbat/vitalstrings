How do you get over a breakup? If you’re like Charlize, you rely on your BFF’s to help you weather your emotional storm.
Charlize Theron is determined to keep on moving following her recent breakup with Stuart Townsend, her boyfriend of eight years, and she’s doing that with a lot of help from some good friends. The 36-year-old beauty hosted a dinner for the filmmakers and cast of Oscar nominated The Hurt Locker at Phillippe in West Hollywood on Feb. 15 and was the life of the party!
“Charlize was having a ball!” one partygoer tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively, adding that the actress was laughing and joking with co-stars Kathryn Bigelow, Harrison Ford, Nick Nolte, Jeremy Renner, Lou Gossett Jr. and – most of all – her buddy Keanu Reeves. “She looked gorgeous and was smiling and laughing, especially when was with Kathryn or Keanu,” our insider adds.
Even as the party started to wind down, Charlize didn’t appear to be in a rush to go anywhere. “Even though the party was due to end at 8pm, she hung out and closed the bar down around 10,” says the source, adding, “She seemed pretty relaxed and at ease.”
We’d still be in a puddle – especially the day after Valentine’s Day – if we’d just gone through a split! So we’re bowing down to the altar of Charlize, who’s proved – yet again – that she’s the personification of cool, calm and classy.
