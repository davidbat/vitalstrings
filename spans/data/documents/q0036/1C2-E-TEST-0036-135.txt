Zwart Water centers on a nine-year girl old who discovers that her new friend is not only sinister but also is her mother's dead twin. Theron is attached to play the mother, who is not quite right in the head, as they say. The movie, which was released in Europe last year, was re-titled Two Eyes Staring when hit international circuits, most recently playing at Fantastic Fest in September.
Theron picked up the remake rights last year via her Denver and Delilah Films banner, and later tapped Derrickson and Boardman. Theron and Beth Kono are producing via Denver and Delilah. Elbert Van Strien and Claudia Brandt are executive producing with Denver and Delilah's JJ Harris.

Erik Feig, Summit's president of production, and Geoff Shaevitz, the company's senior vp production, will oversee the project for the studio.
Theron, who won an Oscar for 2003's Monster, has a full slate ahead of her. She will next be seen in Jason Reitman's Young Adult, set for a December release, while next year she goes genre by starring in Ridley Scott's sci-fi epic Prometheus as well as Universal's Snow White and the Huntsman.
Derrickson, who last directed the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, is currently working on an untitled horror thriller for Summit.
Theron, Derrickson, and Boardman are repped by WME.
