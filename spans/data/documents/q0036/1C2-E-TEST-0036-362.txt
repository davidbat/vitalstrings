+++ FAREWELL +++
this is long overdue although i feel that it wasn't unexpected.. i have to let the site go.. i simply don't have enough time in my daily life to dedicate to the site any longer.. i still remain very fond of charlize and what she does in the future and will continue to follow her career.. although this is the end of the site, i feel that it had a really amazing run and am more than satisfied at how much it had grown from starting out as a small personal blog..
i must thank everyone for their constant help over the past years, all your support is what kept charlize_baby going.. your generosity was muchly and kindly appreciated.. inifinity thank yous to everyone, you all know who you are..
please continue to support the other amazing charlize fansites out there and i'll see you around..!
biya..!
