Personal                 life
 
Theron                 dated the lead singer of Third Eye Blind, Stephan Jenkins, from                 January 1998 to July 2001. Jenkins broke up with her after                 failing to take her requests of marriage seriously. [4] Theron now resides in Los                 Angeles with her long-time boyfriend, Stuart Townsend, with                 whom she starred in the 2004 film Head in the Clouds, as                 well as in the 2002 film Trapped; she has said that they                 will not marry until same-sex couples are able to have their                 marriages recognized. In October 2005, her mother, Gerda, was                 married in California. The media thought that Charlize was the one getting married (to Townsend) and the paparazzi got as close                 as it could for the photos.
 
While                 filming Æon Flux in Berlin ,                 Germany, Theron had surgery on a herniated cervical disc in her                 neck, the result of an injury incurred on the set during a                 stunt.

She has tried to apply for a German passport because of her mother's German ancestry, but was turned                 down because she did not have any family members currently                 residing there.
