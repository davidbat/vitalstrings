Oscar-winning actor and PETA supporter Charlize Theron appears in an anti-fur campaign for PETA. The Monster star poses with her dog, Tucker, beneath the slogan "If you wouldn't wear your dog, please don't wear any fur."
Theron's ad illustrates that the only difference between your "best friend" and animals killed for their fur is how they are treated. All animals feel pain and suffer when trappers and farmers break their necks, drown them, or electrocute them for their pelts. PETA investigators on a fur farm in Midland, Michigan , saw chinchillas who were being electrocuted, causing painful seizures to the animals' hearts, and having their necks broken while fully conscious.
Theron credits her respect for animals to her upbringing on a farm in South Africa, where her mother taught her compassion for all life. The stunning star, who regularly tops Hollywood's "Best Dressed" lists, says, "Fur isn't necessary. It doesn't make sense to me to let these animals suffer for fashion."
