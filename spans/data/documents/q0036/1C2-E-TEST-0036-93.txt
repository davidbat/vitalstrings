Yes, Charlize Theron had a good side.
When the Oscar-winning actress, 36, briefly stripped down for her role in "Snow White and the Huntsman," she had one rule: don't shoot her from the front or back. "I am very good with side nudity," Theron laughed during an MTV News interview. "I tend to find that's probably my best kind of nudity."
She added: "Back is a little too much back; I need an angle. I like angular nudity. I can do a small percentage of one side and the other."
