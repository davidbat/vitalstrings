Although it seemed to slip under the radar, Academy Award winning actress Charlize Theron (Monster) was recently in Newport, RI for a Vogue magazine photo shoot.
Shot by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz, the Vogue shoot took Theron from the waterfalls in Pennsylvania to the frigid coastal waters of Newport.
Despite only being in Newport for a matter of hours, one of the shots taken in the City-by-the-Sea made the cover of the current issue.
Theron is currently busy promoting her new film Young Adult, which centers on a recent divorcee (Theron), who moves back to her small-town home, with her heart set on rekindling a romance with her ex-boyfriend (Patrick Wilson), who is now married with children.
