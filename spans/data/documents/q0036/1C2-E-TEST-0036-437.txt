She claimed "Five nine and a half" on Letterman.

She looks tall next to Will Smith, so I have no qualms about thinking she's almost 5'10". She looks to be about my sister's height. Very tall, beautiful and youthful.

I think she is the modern day marilyn monroe mixed with grace kelly.
Mike O says on 24/Dec/11
She's a strong 5'10", maybe even a little more when she stands up straight. A long, tall classically and timelessly beautiful woman. She could fit into any era of movies or art.

I always hated being tall, but finally, with new, stunningly beautiful women who are tall (according to the norm) showing up, I enjoy my height (5'10").

Bateman doesn't want to look like a shirmp next to a tall hot actress. Camera effects. She is 177cm. In all her movies she stands her own ground and is pretty much tall as her male costars. She rarely gets dwarfed.

strong 5'9 next to bateman
Silent d says on 28/Oct/11
I believe 177cm. In trapped next to Kevin bacon a couple of centimetres shorter. She always looked tall. In monster easy 20+cm over christina ricci who i think is 5 foot 1. Rob you think she is tall as nicole kidman?
Genesis says on 22/Sep/11
Is she really 5´9.75", I think she looks closer to 5´8" or 5´9".

Rob Im curious is their a female movie star taller and equally as famous in hollywood as Sigouney Weaver?
[Editor Rob: I suppose geena davis had a run in the 90's and is taller than weaver I think.]

Joe Bloggs says on 9/Jul/11
At 5ft9/1m76, she's still a ****load taller that Aileen Wuornos, who was about 5ft5, and yet did not appear to be a much larger woman.
rasheed says on 8/Jun/11

Charlize's heights are:
Morning (ou of bed)= 5'10" (1.78 m)
After 1,5-3 hrs= 5'9.6" (1.77 m)
After 5-10 hrs= 5'9.25" (1.76 m)
She's tall but not taller as somebody thinks!
zaya says on 29/Dec/10
she is 177 at the most. she looks slightly shorter (1cm) with her 8-9cm heals on than Asashoryu who is 184 bare feet(186cm with slippers). so 186-1-8 = 177 = 5'9.7''. she is quite tall for women. damn I am only 5'8'' and 19 yrs old guy. any chance to grow taller? what you guys think???
Robert says on 14/Dec/10
She`s taller than Liv Tyler.
khan87 says on 12/Dec/10
Has Charlize been downgraded, because i swear she was list as 5ft10 b4. I personally think there are many celebs before Charlize who deserve to be downgraded.

On the topic of where tall starts: 5'7 is about the equivalent of 6'3 for men. See for your self Click Here
-------------------------------------------------------
U read it wrong 6ft3 male is equivalent to 5ft9 wfemale according to the link you provided.
But really the difference between a man and woman who are equivalent to each other is about 5.5inches.
jik says on 11/Dec/10
Its a disadvantage to be tall in Hollywood. She probably says 5-9 to get jobs, maybe closer to 5-10/11 real.
Bon says on 8/Dec/10
@ Anonymous, 5'7 woman equates 5'11 - 5'11.5 guy.
It's not just about national averages, since women tend naturally to be shorter.
