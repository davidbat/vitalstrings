Charlize Theron
Charlize Theron Perfume and Cologne
Funny enough, it was the movie that spent time and money making the South African-American beauty ugly that garnered her the most attention. Besides Monster, in which she plays an ex-prostitute turned serial killer, Charlize has starred in hits like The Devil's Advocate and The Cider House Rules. Charlize signed on to be the face of J'Adore fragrances by Christian Dior in 2004, pleasing fans when she stepped into the buff for its ad campaigns-- and we adore her for, finally, a well-deserved celebration of her as beauty, not beast.
