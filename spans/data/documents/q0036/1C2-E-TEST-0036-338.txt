Moviefone - Young Adult - Cast Interviews - High School
In the new comedy-drama 'Young Adult,' Charlize Theron plays Mavis Gary, an author of YA books who returns to her hometown during a bout of creative ennui to win back her high school boyfriend -- who happens to be a happily married new father. Whoops! Mavis is a former high school queen bee whose life hasn't turned out the way she had hoped -- a fact she manages to hide from everyone except a former classmate-turned-drinking companion, Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt). Brought to life by Team 'Juno' (director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody), 'Young Adult' serves as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, high school is but a blip. Which is a good thing for Theron, since as she told Moviefone in this exclusive video interview, her biggest dream in high school was to "stay off the pole. The stripper pole."
Above, watch Theron, Oswalt, Cody, Reitman and the cast of 'Young Adult' look back on high school and reveal how their former selves would react to the fact that they're all part of Hollywood's cool inner circle.
