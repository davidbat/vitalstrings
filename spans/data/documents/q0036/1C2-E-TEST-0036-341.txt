Charlize Theron feet & legs
Charlize Theron feet & legs
Charlize Theron / ʃ ɑr ˈ l iː s ˈ θ ɛr ən / ; born 7 August 1975) is a South African actress, film producer and former fashion model.
Charlize wanted to be a ballet dancer when she was a child, but a knee injury when she was 15 ended that dream. So instead, Charlize bought a ticket to LA and never looked back. Her first movie was Children of the Corn Three and luckily, it is the worst movie she has ever done (OK maybe it’s a tie between this and Reindeer Games). She followed this with larger roles in films like The Devil’s Advocate, The Cider House Rules, and Mighty Joe Young. Even though Charlize had achieved great commercial success at this point she was largely considered just a pretty face. This changed in 2003 when she won the role of Aileen Wurnnos in Monster. Roger Ebert called her performance one of the best in the history of cinema. We’ll take his word on it. 
Since then Charlize has starred in the sci-fi film Aeon Flux which performed poorly at the box office. Fortunately Charlize was paid a cool ten million up front, making her the seventh highest paid actress in Hollywood. (The other six being Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Halle Berry.) 
Charlize can be seen in the recent films Sleepwalking, Hancock, and Ice at the Bottom of the Lake.
92 Sex Appeal
Everything about Charlize Theron is sexy, from her amazing green eyes to her statuesque 5'10" body.
However, her sex appeal has a lot to do with her feminine grace and class, which she has in spades. She always carries herself like a lady, and is never caught partying it up in the L.A. or New York club scene. Whether she's on the red carpet, in an interview or accepting an award, Charlize Theron always acts like a real woman.
