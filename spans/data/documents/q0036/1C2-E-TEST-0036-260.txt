No, you didn't. You did! I quit. Well, I'm quitting.
WRITER
Oh, Jesus. What fun is a long conversation without cigarettes?
CLOSE ON CHARLIZE's mouth, her lips bent in her particular smile, sexy and knowing, a little bit leering, just sweet enough that you feel wont to assume some connection, some secret between you. This is the big trick of sexiness. The big lie. But it's no trick at all for her. She bites down on the pack of cigarettes and unspools the cellophane with her teeth, a luscious and familiar dissection.
CHARLIZE
Now you're bad.
CHARLIZE grabs the chair next to the WRITER and puts her legs up. They are as long as the afternoon.
CHARLIZE
I have been working on that. On not being late. And I've been doing better.
The waiter brings her drink. She squeezes the lime, licks the juice from her fingers.
WRITER
What did you do this morning?
CHARLIZE
I was pulling weeds in my fishpond.
WRITER
CHARLIZE
My dogs were with me.
The writer looks at CHARLIZE's hands. They hold steady, cigarette pinched on a downward tilt. She draws hard. Her nails are clean.
WRITER (V.O.)
It's this way with beautiful women. You always hope they are alone.
CUT TO:
P.O.V. SHOT of CHARLIZE's hands, from her point of view, tugging in the slime in a large fishpond. She is covered in the slime, wet with it. Working in cut-offs and a T-shirt. She is pulling, yanking, at the earth. She grew up on a farm. She knows what work is. She stands and draws a wet hand across her face.
WRITER (V.O.)
She devours whatever she looks at, without greed or arrogance, simply because the world delights her. It tastes good to her. She's easy to talk to. Talking is fun for her. She will argue and cajole, careen from one subject to another.
BACK TO SCENE:
CHARLIZE is lost in a moment. Suddenly, she seems sad. She is sad. The WRITER, surprised, asks why, quietly.
CHARLIZE
My dogs. One of my dogs -- he died. He was just a real dog, you know? You could see his spirit. People sensed it immediately. He watched you so deeply, he worried about you. We found him on the streets in Italy, sick and sort of mangy. I worked to make him well and brought him back to live with me here. Fuck. He was his own creature. He used to wander away, up the beach, and people would call me and say he was two miles away, that he'd come for a visit. They weren't angry. They loved it. He looked in on people, kind of watched over them. Then he got so sick, and it was fast, and all I was left with was the sense that he lived this large life and he didn't belong to any one person in the first place. So...
She stops talking, waves a hand at nothing. Her eyes are wet with tears. The WRITER looks at the sky, takes a sip of his drink, filling the moment.
CHARLIZE
So he died. Two weeks ago. Six years old. So I'm feeling that today. That's what I'm feeling.
The scene fades, slowly, to the same conversation, a few minutes later. CHARLIZE is laughing now.
WRITER
Really? There are movies of yours you hate?
CLOSE ON CHARLIZE, smiling at the thought of regret, as if the concept were a mere amusement. The WRITER construes this as braveness.
CHARLIZE
Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie. But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn't lying to myself -- that's why I did it. I mean, he directed The Manchurian Candidate, which is like the movie of all movies. Fuck regret. Just fuck it.
WRITER (V.O.)
See? Smart. Hard-assed. Pretty funny. She runs with these stories, and while she does, I have to look. That's what this job is: drinking with the Sexiest Woman Alive. And I have to point out -- despite my sensibility that wants not to offend women -- that there is a lot of flesh. There are a lot of parts -- tanned arms, even the tips of her fingers, when she jabs the air to make a point. I have to look. To set her up as a series of parts, and present her as a whole.
EXT. HOTEL -- LATER
CHARLIZE smokes a cigarette with her legs up. She spins the ice in her glass.
CHARLIZE
I grew up on a farm.
WRITER
I know. In South Africa.
CHARLIZE
Once, we were dealing with a lake -- my mom was, anyway -- that they had to fill in. The whole thing. And that moved her. My mom, she drained it and took every fish in this huge tanker truck and moved them to another lake. We were back there last year. And there was this lake, full of those fish, and I looked at her and said, "You did this. You made this."
CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE, SOUTH AFRICA
A vision of CHARLIZE. The sun falls in long diagonal columns. This is the writer's construct. CHARLIZE sits on a little chair in the middle of a sprawling plain, legs up, smoking a cigarette. We go CLOSE on her face. She speaks, as if to the writer.
