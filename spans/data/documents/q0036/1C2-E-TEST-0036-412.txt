Call us fussy but sometimes the red carpet circuit in Hollywood can just look a bit, well, samey. Floor length Marchesa blah blah blah, fitted  Hervé Léger yadda yadda, slinky Armani Privé yawn.
We’ll probably never completely tire of seeing the celebs decked out in every manner of extravagant couture, but sometimes it’s nice to see something a bit different.
That’s why we have to applaud Charlize Theron for mixing it up in this tomato red leather dress. We weren’t sure anyone could make red leather look classy but Charlize certainly proved us wrong in this daring Dior number.
Attending the Young Adult premier in New York, she reminded us why the iconic French fashion house chose her as an ambassador.  She paired the dress with a pair of nude Jimmy Choo strappy sandals and an insouciant curly blonde bob.
We like this edgy look, Charlize – more of the same, please!
Is Charlize's red leather Dior dress darling or too daring?
Darling - she makes red leather look so chic!
Daring - there's a 'certain place' for red leather.
