Charlize Theron looked stunning Thusrday night in a black-and-white Antonio Berardi dress and black Tom Ford heels at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City for an appearance on the Late Show With David Letterman . The South African native was making the rounds promoting her new film, Young Adult , about a divorced writer who returns to her hometown and decides to try and seduce her high school sweetheart into leaving his wife and newborn baby ( see our review here ).
After Letterman it was on to the premiere of the film for Charlize, for which she changed into a more conservative, yet sizzling red Christian Dior dress.
Charlize recently revealed to Collider.com that she hates rehearsing scenes and that a "lot of alcohol" was needed to get through readings with her co-star, Patton Oswalt .
"Yeah I don't like rehearsal," she says, "and Jason [director Jason Reitman ] doesn't like rehearsal either. I hate table reads. I hate anything where you have to say the words out loud."
Which dress does Charlize look better in? Leave us a comment below!
