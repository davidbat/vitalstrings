Because you needed a reminder that the wet, slicked-back hair look was in for spring, Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron‘s December cover of Vogue magazine is just drenched with evidence that that is the case.

The cover , which our friends at Fashionista brought to our attention this morning, features Theron standing in the ocean in an iridescent gray dress slit way, way up to her thigh. She is stunning, but she looks like nothing so much as a mermaid coming out of the water — albiet one whose makeup is entirely waterproof and who can’t be bothered with the fact that her dress is probably dry clean only.

Similar to the past few Vogue covers, this one is tied in with a movie promotion. Just like Rooney Mara talking about The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in the November issue and Michelle Williams shilling for My Week With Marilyn in October , Theron is promoting her new movie Young Adult, set to debut Dec. 16. It also calls her role in the movie “Oscar worthy,” which is a not-too-subtle reminder that awards show campaign season has begun. Theron just fired the first shot.
Take a look at the cover and tell is if you’ll be picking it up when it hits newsstands, and be sure to check out the trailer for Young Adult below.
