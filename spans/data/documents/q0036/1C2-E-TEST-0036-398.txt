FROM MTV MOVIES: Ever since the trailer arrived for Kristen Stewart's next likely blockbuster, " Snow White and the Huntsman " -- a.k.a. her first big post-"Twilight" movie -- we've been chomping at the bit for more info about the film.
Luckily, MTV News had a fun-filled chat recently with Stewart's "Huntsman" co-star Charlize Theron, during which the South African-born beauty revealed that she and Stewart are about to shoot the film's climactic battle sequence.
"I'm still shooting ['Huntsman'], I'm going back in two days," Theron told us as she promoted the comedy "Young Adult." "I haven't really worked with [Kristen]. I've done some small things with her, but we're about to shoot our big showdown, and fingers crossed for me. It's the big battle. I'm just really, really, really hoping I get to kill her," she said with a smile. "That is how the story ends up, right?"
