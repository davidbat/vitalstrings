Those who       have expanded our horizons.
The stuff of legends.
Charlize Theron
7 August 1975 - ?
Charlize Theron was born        in Benoni, South Africa. She grew up as the only child        on her family's farm. Learned the some of her 8        languages from staff on this family farm. Her parents        also owned a road construction business at the same        time. At the age of 6, Charlize took up ballet and began        to think of going professional. She would soon take her        dancing ability to higher levels, going professional in        the town of Johannesburg. At 13, in Johannesburg, her        parents enrolled her in a boarding school.
When she was 15, her father attacked her mother, and her        mother shot her father in self-defense. Her father died,        and her mother was not charged in the incident.
At the age of 16 she took an offer to begin modelling in        Milan, Italy, offered after winning a local modeling        contest. This, however, lasted for only a year when she        grew tired of it. On the last day of a modelling shoot        in Manhattan, New York, she decided she would not return        to Italy. She decided to return to her first love --        ballet. She began dancing with the Joffrey school in New        York. After completing such popular shows as the        Nutcracker Suite and Swan Lake, she suffered a knee        injury that ended her ballet career at the young age of        18.
Without the ability to dance ballet, and nearly broke,        Charlize bought a one way ticket to Hollywood at the        urging of her mother, Gerda. She arrived in Fairfax,        California where she set up shop in the Farmer's        Daughter Motel. It was in 1994 that she was "discovered." When an L.A. bank teller refused to cash        her out-of-town cheque because she did not have an        account at the bank, she threw "a little tantrum." This        tantrum was witnessed by a talent manager named John        Crosby, who also represents Rene Russo and John Hurt. He        called this screaming, arm-waving tantrum-thrower a "vision" and immediately asked her "I don't know what        you do, but if you're interested in acting, here's my        card." Initially skeptical of the card, she was informed        by a friend that John Crosby was legitimate. Of course,        with no money or job, she was definitely interested and        set out to shed her South African accent. She began        watching hours of television and singing along to        American songs on the radio. Soon after, she acquired        her first acting job -- 2 Days in the Valley, and from        that point her star status was assured.
She recently found herself in the centre of a highly        publicized controversy surrounding an advertisement she        did in her native South Africa. The campaign, an        anti-rape series done in an attempt to bring notice to        the high incidence of rape in South Africa, was met with        complaints after it was felt the ad was "anti-men" in        general. She has since supported actions to halt the        hunting of caged lions (canned lions), and she has        involved herself personally in trying to prevent the        same thing happening to a rare and tame Black Rhino.        According to a letter that Theron sent Virginia        businessman David Laylin, the owner of the Rhino, Laylin        is to be paid $60,000 for the animal from a big-game        hunter. Theron wrote:
"If you agree to          release (the rhino) to a sanctuary, I will agree          to meet you in South Africa to celebrate her          freedom."
These selfless acts        reflect her willingness to use her fame towards useful        causes and she has become one of South Africa's        darlings.
In 2004 she achieved the ultimate distinction in her        field when she won both the Best Actress Golden Globe        and Oscar for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen        Wuornos in the film 'Monster', becoming the first South        African to win a major Academy Award. She said in her        emotional acceptance speech:
"I          know everybody in New Zealand has been thanked,          so I'm going to thank everybody in South Africa,          my home country."
Afterwards Charlize        jetted into South Africa to a heroine's welcome. She met        her personal hero Nelson Mandela, and President Thabo        Mbeki sent a note saying:
"We are all immensely proud of this, our South          African daughter. We wish her well."
