Charlize Theron Debuts Shaved Head in Namibia
Charlize Theron debuts her new shaved head as she carries her adorable son Jackson on Sunday (June 24) in Namibia.
The 36-year-old actress cut off her blonde locks earlier this month for her upcoming film Mad Max: Fury Road.
Charlize recently commented that she will never do live theater.
“I’m just not made for that kind of live audience where you don’t create a fourth wall. I take my hat off to those guys. It’s not disconnected enough for me. Some people are good at performing in front of people like that, but I’m uncomfortable with it,” Charlize said .
