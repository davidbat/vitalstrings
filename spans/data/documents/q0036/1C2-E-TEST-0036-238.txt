Charlize Theron has been with her boyfriend, Stuart Townsend, for nine years and there have never been any rumors of the two splitting until now.
Charlize reportedly told friends that they split after a trip to Mexico during the Christmas holiday.
A friend of the couple said: “Stuart is gutted but Charlize said that she realised during the Mexican holiday the relationship was over. They had become more like brother and sister than lovers. It was she who ended it.”
A source told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: “She loved Stuart but their relationship ran its course. He is heartbroken but she is insisting it is over. Charlize was surprised the story hadn’t come out yet. But she didn’t confirm it because she wanted to break the news in her own time.”
The two never married because they felt like they were committed enough to each other and they didn't need a piece of paper to tell them how much they love each other.
A spokesman for Charlize said: “I never comment on her personal life.”
We're really hoping this is not true. They made such a cute couple!
