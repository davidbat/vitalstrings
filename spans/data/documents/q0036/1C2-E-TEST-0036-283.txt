Charlize Theron - Hairstyles Evolution
      As one of Hollywood’s most versatile actresses, Charlize Theron is a chameleon. When it comes to  her “look” for any given movie role, she seems to possess an almost magical ability to change her appearance to the point of being  unrecognizable.  All one has to do is compare the looks she took on for her roles in “The Astronaut’s Wife”, “Monster”, and “North  Country” to see just how versatile her look can be.
      But through it all, off-screen, the Hollywood leading lady is always stunning. She has a  wholesome, alluring beauty. With an oval face and dewy complexion playing backdrop to glistening, jewel-bright eyes, Ms. Theron is  another homage to the “naturally beautiful” starlets of previous eras. For my mind she seems a cross between Kim Novak and Marilyn  Monroe – a brilliant talent with sultry, sexy elements, and brains to boot.
      And just like on-screen, Ms. Theron has had a myriad of different looks off-screen. Sometimes the  looks come as a result of on-screen persona she’s undertaken, while at other times the looks seem to be an attempt to “reset” herself  after some intense change in a role.
      While normally, our “evolutions” features follow a chronological order, today we are taking a  different approach. In part, this is because many of the resource photos available were not documented for the date in which that  were taken and therefore I cannot assure accuracy. However, it is also due to the fact that Ms. Theron’s looks have tended to  vascillate back and forth in lengths and other styling elements so that the reader would end up feeling like a yo-yo.
      We examine Charlize Theron’s face and see that she has an oval face, although she does possess some  elements that need to be taken into account when choosing a style. The areas that can present difficulties for her are her forehead,  which is wide and somewhat square along the hairline, and her chin, which can appear somewhat pointed and small. Neither of these  factors are significant enough to cause major problems in selecting a style. Keeping them in mind, let’s look at Ms. Theron’s many  style choices by breaking them down into categories, using the following criteria:
 
Short Hair
      Some of Charlize Theron’s film roles have required her to cut her hair, as in the case of  “The Astronaut’s Wife” which was a revisioning of the classic Ira Levin tale “Rosrmary’s Baby”. She is more than capable of pulling  off a gamine short hairstyle, to be perfectly honest, the super-short style above could use some added length in the foreground/fringe  area and a rounded cut line in order to better balance the forehead and to counter the sharp point of the chin.
      Our second photo is another short style, but one that is significantly longer than the previous  cut. Notice how the added length, undefined, asymmetrical parting and big waves all combine to soften the features. The curved lines  at the upper corners of the face serve to minimize the size of the forehead while balancing the chin.
      In the third image above, we see yet one more short style – one which is approaching  middle-lengths – that combines some of the best of all possible elements. The smooth sweeping lines and waves accentuate the  curves of the face, while providing balance to the features. All-in-all it is a very professional, yet sensual look – one which  could be dressed up with a little more curl if one needed to attend a glamorous function.
 
Upstyle Looks
      Every Hollywood startlet knows that an Up-Style is the staple of awards shows and benefit galas. In  fact, the bigger the event, the more elaborate the style usually is. But not all up-styles are created equal, and some are better  suited to some faces than others. Let’s take the first two examples shown here and compare them to the third image. The full-volume  styling of the first two photos enhances the soft curves of Ms. Theron’s face, and while both styles feature a lot of lift and movement  in the styling, they are very different. The second style is more diffuse and energetic, while the first image shows a style that is  controlled, yet full.
