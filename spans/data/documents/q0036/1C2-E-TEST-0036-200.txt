BIOGRAPHY
Moviegoers were first introduced to the seductive charm of Charlize Theron in her feature film debut, MGM's 2 Days in the Valley. Starring with James Spader, Eric Stoltz, and Jeff Daniels, it was the bizarre story of what happens to the lives of ten people in the San Fernando Valley who cross paths over 48 hours. Theron played Helga, Spader's partner and love interest, who can't get enough of the danger that surrounds her. Even among an ensemble cast, Theron gave a standout performance.
