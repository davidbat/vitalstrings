Always on the go: Charlize Theron works hard doing charity work in Africa, and with three movies coming up, she's also hard at work in front of the camera
Yes, the Oscar-winning actress attended a polo match in England with Prince Harry  in May. But she swears it was mostly business.
"I am not dating him. I'm dating his passion for the work that he does," Theron says with a laugh. "I love what he's doing, and we met up with some people on his team. He has a real passion for it."
Theron, 35,  is referring to the prince's good works, done as part of his  Sentebale charity to help the impoverished children of Lesotho. Theron herself is active in her native South Africa through her Africa Outreach Project, which focuses on sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention. Starting Tuesday, people can donate to CTAOP via Tonic.com.

Her work, she says, is far from glamorous but completely rewarding.
"I'm sitting on a toilet for seven days with diarrhea. But it's the thing that puts everything into perspective," says Theron, in Manhattan to raise money for her organization. "There's a part of me that will always be the South African who knows and realizes how unbelievably fortunate I have been."
Yes, Dior spokeswoman Theron concedes that she enjoys the finer things, but within reason. "I'm completely spoiled — don't get me wrong — but I am not one of those people who needs another box of eye shadow. I only have two eyelids. There's only so much eye shadow that can go on two eyelids. I don't like a lot of stuff. I have a thing against excess."
Next up for Theron: Jason Reitman's Young Adult, which is set for release later this year and stars the actress as a remorseless fiction writer who decides to break up her former sweetheart's marriage.  She just wrapped Ridley Scott's Prometheus (out in 2012), and in August  she starts production on Snow White and the Huntsman, playing the evil queen to Kristen Stewart 's princess. How does Theron feel about tackling a character that iconic? "No pressure!" she quips.
Theron hasn't met Stewart yet. Nor has she delved into her character or figured out how she'll play her.
"The only thing I will say is that it will be dark. It will be a dark, realistic version of it," she says.
"I don't know where it's going yet."
