French luxury house Dior has released a new ad for its iconic fragrance starring Hollywood actress Charlize Theron.
Filmed at the Château de Versailles , the commercial depicts Theron arriving at an over-the-top fashion show where Grace Kelly, Marlene Dietrich, and Marilyn Monroe are getting ready for the runway among other models.
While it’s not (yet) possible to smell a fragrance through a TV commercial, the actress’s golden dress (inspired by the scent’s flacon) and empowered walk down the catwalk comes a close second.
Watch the ad, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and set against The Gossip’s “Heavy Cross” below.
