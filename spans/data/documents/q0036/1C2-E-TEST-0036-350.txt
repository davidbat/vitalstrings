All eyes were on a Dior-clad Charlize Theron as she stepped out onto the red carpet at today's Golden Globes in Beverly Hills. She's nominated in the best actress category for her role in Young Adult. Charlize won her first Golden Globe in 2003 for Monster, and has since been nominated on two other occasions. She told Ryan Seacrest that she has a small case of laryngitis. The actress kicked off her wild weekend of parties on Friday night at a W magazine party thrown at the Chateau Marmont, then mingled with Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Michelle Williams at yesterday's BAFTA tea. Let us know what you think of Charlize's latest red carpet look and be sure to vote on all of Fab and Bella's fashion and beauty polls !
