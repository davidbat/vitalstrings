Charlize Theron and son Jackson were seen catching a late night flight out of LAX. Charlize’s Snow White and the Huntsman costar, Kristen Stewart, was not far behind the duo. I wonder if they’re headed out for the next stop on their promotional tour for the film?
Usually in paparazzi photos, Charlize looks quite dressed up and is wearing heels, so she looks quite casual in these photos. She wore her Bleulab detour leggings in French Chalk with a striped gray tee and Uggs. We haven’t seen Charlize out in Bleulab since she wore these to a Laker’s Game. I’d love to see her wear these with the reverse side. You can buy these jeans online from Couturecandy.com for $172 .
