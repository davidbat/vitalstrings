On this website ( http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-02-charlize-theron_N.htm ) there is a quote by Charlize: “If you have my shoe size, which very few of my friends do!” she retorts. “I’m a 9 or a 10. My mom is always like, ‘Ugh, you’re killing me. You’re my daughter and you’re supposed to have my shoe size.’ “
