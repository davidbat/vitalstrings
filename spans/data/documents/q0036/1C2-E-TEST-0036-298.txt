Charlize Theron 's latest spot for J'adore Dior is literally a walk through Hollywood history. It features footage of golden age screen sirens overlaid on modern shots so that Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly, among others, seem to be sharing the Dior dressing room with Charlize. It's an impressively executed ad, and the CGI is really well done. Watch the commercial and see if you can name all the iconic ladies who make an appearance.
