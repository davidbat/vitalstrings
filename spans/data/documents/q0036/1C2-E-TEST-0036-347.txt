"Monster"Â (2003)
Aileen Wuornos is a drifter prostitute who kills many of her "johns." Nearing suicidal despair, Aileen wanders into a bar, where she meets fellow misfit Selby and falls in love. To keep their relationship alive, she continues hooking, only to fuel an increasingly escalating deadly rage that leads into a lurid string of killings and the media's designation of her as the 1st female serial killer.
