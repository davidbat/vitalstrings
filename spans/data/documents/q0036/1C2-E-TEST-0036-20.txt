 
overview
Academy Award-winning actress Charlize Theron was born and raised on a family farm in South Africa. She came to acting in a roundabout way after a short career in modeling and an even shorter career in ballet, which was cut short after a knee injury. So, it was off to Los Angeles to try her hand at the craft.
Her career got off to a strong start with a memorable performance (and even more memorable catfight with Teri Hatcher) in “2 Days in the Valley.” Next, she started landing bigger roles in films like “The Devil’s Advocate” and “The Cider House Rules.” Then came the acclaimed critical hit “Monster,” a dark and ugly bio of a lesbian killer. The performance by Charlize, which stunned critics, propelled her to an Academy Award.
