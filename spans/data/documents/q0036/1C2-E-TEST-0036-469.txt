The Burning Plain star Charlize Theron has often said that she has no idea when she will finally be ready to get married and have children with her boyfriend of 9 years, fellow actor Stuart Townsend . Charlize says her dogs are like her children and she is completely happy just taking care of them at the moment. We spotted Charlize walking her doggies on the beach near her Malibu home yesterday and you can see she how close she is with them! She is looking as lovely as ever! Being a dog mommy definitely suits her!
