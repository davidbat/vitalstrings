Colour Protect Caring Shampoo, £3.29 by L'Oreal Elvive
Charlize is a dedicated blonde and to keep her locks super bright and glossy she uses products from the L’Oreal Protect range (she was the face of their ad campaign) and it doesn’t have an A-list price tag – bonus!

Even Charlize knows that as great as it is to use natural, organic products where you can, when it comes to keeping wrinkles at bay you need to get tough. Str-Vectin’s eye cream soothes the delicate eye area while combating wrinkles and dark circles.
