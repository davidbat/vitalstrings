J'adore Perfume
J'adore by Christian Dior for Women launched in 2001 is a radiant, sensual, sophisticated fragrance. J'Adore is a luminescent, almost sharp fruity floral that is extremely romantic. There is a playful flirtation between the bright fruit and the seductive florals, which makes this fragrance so appealing on its wearer. J'Adore is perfect for formal affairs, as well as jeans and a tee shirt. Top notes include mandarine, peach, melon, magnolia, pear and bergamot. The heart combines tuberose, plum, violet, orchid, freesia, lily, jasmine and rose. The warm base brings everything together for a long-lasting fragrance, with musk, vanilla, cedar and blackberry.
