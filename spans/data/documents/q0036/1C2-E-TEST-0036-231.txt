Ryan Reynolds and Charlize Theron: New Couple Alert?!?

Ryan Reynolds has done it.
After splitting from Scarlett Johansson , it seemed impossible for the Green Lantern star to go anywhere but down in his dating life. Enter one of the few Hollywood hotties who can compete with Johansson: Charlize Theron.
They "have been dating - for months!" a source tells Us Weekly. "They're exclusive, and it's very hush-hush."
This seems about right, doesn't it?
A witness spotted Reynolds' motorcycle outside Theron's house on June 5, but another insider says fans shouldn't expect to see the alleged couple holding hands on the red carpet any time soon.
"She won't go to an event with him. That's not her style."
After nine years of dating, Theron broke up with Stuart Townsend last year. Reynolds, meanwhile, has been falsely linked with Sandra Bullock since his marriage fell apart.
