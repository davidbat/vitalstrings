Charlize Theron
Even though Charlize Theron does get a few extra kudos for appearing as an extra in Children of the Corn III, she didn't get my full attention until her full monty in The Devil's Advocate.  Acting beside Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino, Theron was able to show herself to be a wonderful actress and as some one who looks sensational in the nude; even with the scratches.  She also sports two seperate hair styles in this film, looking smoking hot in each of them.
But besides how good Theron looked in Advocate, the girl now reaks a pretty substantial filmography.  With films that inlcude Men of Honor, Mighty Joe Young, The Italian Job and her Academy performance in Monster, this girl is one of the top actresses in Hollywood.
Charlize Theron has two big films coming our way, each from an entirely different genre.  The first film is North Country, a fictionalized account of the case Jenson vs. Eveleth Mines.  Though this film could possibly throw her an Oscar nom, her other film surely won't.
Charlize Theron is also starring is Aeon in the live-action adaptation of the hit animated series Aeon Flux.  Expect to see Charlize Theron running around in tight black spandex.
