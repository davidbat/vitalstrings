Alleged Marilyn Monroe Porn Film Nets No Bidders at Auction
Wearing black shades, skinny jeans and stilettos, Theron, the face of the fragrance, arrives late backstage for a fashion show set at the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.
During the course of the ad, Theron changes into a gold gown while appearing to exchanges glances with Dietrich, Kelly and Monroe, footage of whom appears courtesy of CGI.
“It was incredibly glamorous and fantastic. I don’t think I’ll experience something like that again in my lifetime,” said Theron.
The spot was shot by Oscar-winning director Jean-Jacques Annaud (Black and White in Color, The Name of the Rose, Seven Years in Tibet) and features the song “Heavy Cross” by The Gossip. The fashion house unveiled the ad on its website dior.com.
It’s not the first time Monroe has promoted a fragrance since passing away in 1962. In a 30-second spot for Chanel in 1987, special effects techniques were used to morph model Carole Bouquet into the blonde bombshell, while a recording a Monroe singing “I want to be loved by you” plays. Black-and-white newsreel images of the actress also appear in the commercial.
Monroe once famously said, “What do I wear to bed? Why Chanel No. 5 of course.”
Dior introduced J’Adore in 1999.
