 
Biography
Charlize Theron was born in Benoni, a little farming                      community outside Johannesburg, South Africa on August 7th,                      1975. Her mother, Gerda, is German, while her late father,                      Charles, was French (she was named after her him).
Charlize began her modeling career in 1991, at 16, when she                      won a local modeling contest. She started modeling in                      Europe, and came to New York a year later. She didn't like                      being a model though, and decided to try her luck with                      ballet, which had been her biggest passion as a child.                      Unfortunately, a knee injury prevented her from dancing. Her                      mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles in 1994,                      and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood                      Bulevard, but without any luck. She went to the bank to cash                      a check for $500 she'd gotten from her mother, and became                      furious when she learned that the bank could not cash her                      check because it was an out-state check. She made a scene,                      and an agent gave her his card, in exchange that she learn                      the language, which she did by watching soap operas on TV.                      Her first role was as a young mother in a park in a B-film                      in 1995, but it was a non-speaking role with three seconds                      of screen time. Her next role was as Helga in 2 Days in the                      Valley (1996), which landed her the role of Tina in That                      Thing You Do! (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies                      like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998),                      The Cider House Rules (1999), The Legend of Bagger Vance                      (2000) and The Italian Job (2003). An important day in her                      life was February 29th, 2004, when she was awarded with her                      first Academy Award for her performance in Monster (2003).
