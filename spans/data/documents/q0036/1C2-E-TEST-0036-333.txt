Enjoy your morning coffee with a virtual tour of our celebrity house of the day. Today: Actress Charlize Theron's home.
Charlize Theron 's Malibu house has recently been reduced to just below $7 million. The film star originally had the 3 bedroom, 3.5 bath listed at $7.5 million, but buyers weren't biting.
This Malibu Beach, beachfront bungalow is worth a look. And thanks to our friends at Realtor.com , we have the pics!
