When you're an A-list actress with a movie to promote, your schedule is jam-packed and the outfit changes are endless. So like the able celebrity she is, Charlize Theron donned not one but two body-conscious dresses last night while out to promote "Young Adult."
While "Young Adult" depicts her as a coarse, self-destructive mess , Charlize kept things together quite nicely for the world premiere and an appearance on the "Late Show With David Letterman." For the red carpet she chose coordinating red, pairing a shiny yet conservatively cut Christian Dior dress with nude strappy sandals by Jimmy Choo.
But for Letterman, like so many other sexy actresses, she went for a slightly saucier look: a off-white and black dress with a deeply-cut neckline and black sandals that tied at the ankle. (Side note: it was absolutely freezing in New York last night, so we're totally bewildered and impressed by Charlize's commitment to sleeveless.)
So which style strikes your fancy: statement color or sexy curves?
