Instructions
1
Cleanse your skin to remove any dirt or impurities. Then towel-dry it gently. Apply your favorite moisturizer and allow it to be absorbed into your skin for approximately 10 minutes.
2
Dot foundation onto your face with your fingers. Blend the foundation into your skin using a foundation brush, a damp makeup sponge or your fingers. If you have concern areas, spot-apply concealer to give them some extra coverage. Then set the makeup with face powder.
3
Give yourself a glow like the one Charlize's skin always has. Find a bronzer that suits your skin and apply it to the areas of your face that naturally catch sunlight, such as your forehead, nose and cheeks. Then apply a natural-looking pink blush to your cheeks.
4
Apply eye makeup. Charlize usually sticks with nude or natural-colored eye shadows. These include colors like brown, gold or beige. Many of Charlize’s eye makeup looks have a touch of shimmer. Find a flesh-colored eye shadow that has a tinge of shimmer and use it as a wash on your eyelids. Line your eyes with eyeliner. Make the line fine; don't overdo it. Once your eyeliner is complete, curl your eyelashes. Follow up with a coat of mascara.
5
Frame your smile. Choose a light pink lip gloss with a slight touch of shimmer. Line your lips with a flesh-toned lip liner and use a lip brush to blend the liner into your lips. Follow up with a coat of lip gloss.
Tips & Warnings
If you can’t find a lip liner to that looks natural, search for a clear one. DuWop makes an invisible liner for lips that goes on colorless but does the job.
Don’t go overboard on the shimmer. Charlize usually uses subtle amounts of shimmer to add a little something extra to her look.
