It is true and I can assume that most of her fans already knew this. The beautiful actress Charlize Theron posed for Playboy Magazine in May 1999. Her pictorial was a real success as it was expected, even if at that time, Charlize was far from the fame she has now. Then, she was just another girl from the Playboy Magazine cover. At least, this was the general opinion. However, her beauty made that Playboy issue to sell over 100.000 magazines in United States only.
It is a known fact that a pictorial in Playboy Magazine is like a door towards fame. Loads and loads of young girls are choosing this way to became popular and rich. Some succeed and some fails because Playboy Magazine gives them the chance but from th
ere, everyone should make his own destiny.
Charlize Theron didn't hesitate when this opportunity was up. At that time, she was young, sexy and with a huge desire to become famous. She took the opportunity and she was one of the most beautiful women that posed for Playboy in that year. As it was expected, her pictorial resulted in numerous offers from various men magazines for additional pictorials. She declined them and it was a good decision. Soon after, she signed some good contracts for various movies (all with a big budget) and in less than 5 years she became one of the most appreciated celebrities from Hollywood and one of the best paid stars as well.
