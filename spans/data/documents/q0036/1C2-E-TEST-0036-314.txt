How to do your makeup like Charlize Theron

Charlize Theron’s petite, perfect features take center stage thanks to a soft, light-reflecting makeup palette. Apricot lips and smoky eyes are her signature, making her every bit the "effortless" red carpet goddess. Try on Charlize Theron makeup in our virtual makeup studio.
Play up blue or green eyes with shimmery shades of gold, plum or apricot, which can be used to achieve a soft smoky eye . Navy blue eyeliner and mascara will always make the whites of your eyes appear brighter. This is a great makeup trick for those mornings when you look a little more lackluster than usual from minimal sleep.
Give your face a matte finish like Charlize Theron by sweeping on translucent powder after applying a tinted moisturizer or sheer foundation (these makeup bases won’t erase your natural glow). You can add sheen to strategic parts of the face (think: apples of the cheeks, brow bone and inner corners of the eyes) with a pearlized highlighter powder.
Amplify the natural curves of your lips by outlining them in nude lip liner and blending the line with a lip brush. When she’s not wearing red, Charlize Theron rocks apricot lips for day or night. Use the same brush to paint on the color in layers to achieve your desired effect. --Stephanie Simons
