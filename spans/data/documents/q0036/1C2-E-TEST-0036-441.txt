About Charlize Theron
 
Charlize  was born August 7, 1975, and raised on a South Africa farm outside the small  town of Benoni, the only child of Gerda and Charles Theron. She is named for her  late father. She began modeling in her mid-teens, following her dreams from  Africa to Europe and eventually to New York where she continued modeling and  also performed with the famed Joffrey Ballet until a knee injury ended her  dancing career. At 18, she moved to Los Angeles where a talent agent who  observed her in an altercation with a bank teller over an out of state check  discovered her. Charlize has honed her craft in films since 1995, landing more  significant roles over time. In 2003 she won an academy award for her portrayal  of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in "Monster." Charlize has been dating  Irish actor Stuart Townsend since August 2001. In 2005 she appeared in North  Country.
