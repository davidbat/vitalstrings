Instructions
1
Start with shampoo and conditioner. Theron's hair is thin, so Angileri uses a volumizing shampoo and conditioner like the four-step Amplify Volumizing system from Matrix (see Resources).
2
Apply a root-lifter product. Towel dry your hair to get as much moisture out as possible, and use the root lifter from the Matrix Amplify Volumizing System. Apply the root lifter, first to the roots of your hair, and then finger comb the product throughout all of your hair.
3
Blow dry your hair. Use medium heat if you have thin or color-treated hair (or both) like Charlize Theron. Using medium heat minimizes damage.
4
Part and separate out your hair. First, part your hair in a deep side part. Then, separate your hair into four sections: two sections for your top layer of hair and two sections for the bottom. Using large hair clips, clip the two top and one of the bottom sections up. Leave the fourth bottom section down--you will start curling your hair in this section.
5
Get a 1.5-inch barrel curling iron. Wrap no more than one inch of hair around the barrel of the curling iron, holding it vertically. Continue curling your hair in this manner until all the sections of your hair are curled.
6
Loosen curls gently. Once you are finished curling, run your fingers through your hair and gently loosen the curls.
7
Apply a fine mist spray. Sticking with the Matrix Amplify system, spray the hairspray lightly, all over the hair.
Tips & Warnings
Always go easy on the conditioner. Using too much conditioner will weigh your hair down, so apply no more than a nickel-sized amount to your hair
Never loosen your curls before they have cooled. Once you curl your hair, don't touch the curl. You need to leave it and give the curl time to cool and set in your hair. If you don't leave it alone until it cools, your curl will fall out.
