Charlize Theron Cast for 'Prometheus' Movie, Ridley Scott to Direct
February 13, 2011 12:25 PM EST
Actress Charlize Theron has been cast for the "Prometheus" movie role.  The new film will be an interesting prequel to a movie considered a classic  by many.
According to ScreenCrave.com , Theron will be officially part of the cast for the new Ridley Scott movie.  Swedish actress Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender will also be a part of the "Prometheus" cast.  Scott noted a while back about the movie that "The keen fan will recognize strands of Alien’s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."
Theron was recently seen in 2009's "The Road" and heard as a narrator in 2009's "Astro Boy."  She's also an Academy Award winner for her role as a serial killer in the 2003 film, "Monster."  Generally she's considered one of Hollywood's hottest, so she just might be a draw for audiences to come check her out in "Prometheus."  Ridley Scott isn't so bad as a director either, with "Gladiator," "American Gangster," and "Alien" to his credit.  Scott also brought forth another amazing sci-fi film with "Blade Runner."
It has been said that "Prometheus" would be some sort of a prequel to "Alien."  That science fiction and horror film is considered a classic film by many, originally starring Sigourney Weaver and directed by Scott.  It's unlikely Weaver would have a cameo in this, but anything's possible in Hollywood these days!
Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" has a tentative release date for some time in 2012.  Will Scott be able to build upon the "Alien" legacy, or will he tarnish it with this film?
