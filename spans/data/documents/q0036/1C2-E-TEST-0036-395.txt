Computicket's new Queue-it Booking System Explained
As Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball tickets go on sale from Tuesday 19 June, Computicket have implemented a new booking system to ensure smooth running as high volumes of users try to purchase tickets. This is how it works.
Los Angeles - Charlize Theron relied on "a lot of alcohol" to get through her scenes with Patton Oswalt on Young Adult.
The 36-year-old beauty stars as a novelist in the movie - which is directed by Jason Reitman and sees Patton play her former classmate Matt - and the pair drank plenty of "acting juice" when they were rehearsing for their roles because the blonde stunner "hates" reading words out loud during rehearsals.
She said: "What did I need for rehearsal? A lot of alcohol. I don't like rehearsal, and Jason doesn't like rehearsal either. I hate table reads. I hate anything where you have to say the words out loud."
Unusual bond
Patton added: "We call it acting juice. We kind of got along right at the first table read. We were teasing each other, there was just something."
However, Charlize - whose alter-ego Mavis returns to her small hometown to relive her glory days and forms an unusual bond with Matt - admitted she found performing read-throughs for her part with Patton to be a "huge problem" and she "hated" the process.
She explained to Collider.com: "It was a huge problem. Then Jason, he had done two table reads at his house previously, said, 'Just come and do this,' and I was like, 'God dammit Jason, I might break out in hives and I hate this.'
"Jason was like, 'No just read it, I just want to hear the words. Don't feel pressure.' Then this fucker was like to the map, and I'm sitting there going, 'Are you kidding me? Are we going to do this now? Alright bitch, let's go.'
"By page 20 we were at it, and I walked out and I knew we were going to make the film together."
