Selena Gomez
Audiences who enjoy acts like Selena Gomez know that pop music and rock music are generally considered to be the types of music that the broadest audience will listen to. Pop and Rock artists target the "mainstream" through the use of catchy rhythms, melodies, and lyrics. Pop and rock music is often ranked in charts based on record sales, airplay, or a combination of both. Pop and rock artists are responsible for two of the most commercially successful and widely listened-to genres in the history of music.
One of the biggest pop music artists of all time is Madonna , who is often referred to as the "Queen of Pop." Britney Spears was often called the "Princess of Pop", and Michael Jackson was known as the "King of Pop." In a similar way, Elvis Presley was referred to as the "King of Rock n' Roll" in his days, and The Beatles are still recognized as one of the most legendary pop groups worldwide. Currently, the Jonas Brothers and Lady GaGa are well known acts in the pop music genre. Find great deals on Selena Gomez tickets at TicketNetwork!
