Last year, Selena Gomez  announced that, just like her boyfriend (Justin Bieber) and best friend (Taylor Swift), she was coming out with a fragrance. Then six months later, she put out a message to all her fans , asking for their help in choosing the specific scents. (Eventually, the polls determined that the top notes would be raspberry; the heart would be purple freesia; the bottom would be vanilla.) And now, the time is finally nearing — the time where Selenators can actually purchase the perfume for themselves.
But before we reveal when it will be released, check out Selena’s sexy ad for the product:
As for the bottle itself (pictured on the bottom right corner above), Selena tells  Us Weekly ,
“I wanted it to be tall so it stands out. The design of the bottle is almost like a gown so it represents me on the carpet. The lips are fun… it makes it more youthful and you can play with it.”
To get “Selena Gomez” the perfume, check Macy’s and/or macys.com  – starting this May! Are you going to buy the fragrance? What do you think of the ad? Is it too sexy or just right?
