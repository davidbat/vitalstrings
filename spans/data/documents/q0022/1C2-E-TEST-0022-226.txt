Justin Bieber's lady love seems to have tinted her tresses!
Selena Gomez made an appearance at a Hotel Transylvania press event in LA today, and we almost didn't recognize her! The Spring Breakers star lightened her locks, and she's a brunette beauty no more! It also looks like her hair might have grown a couple inches with the help of hair extensions...
The former Disney star looks like a totally different girl, and we're sure The Biebs won't mind canoodling with a fiery redhead instead!
