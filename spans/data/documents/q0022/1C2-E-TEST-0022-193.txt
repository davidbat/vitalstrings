SELENA GOMEZ - WHO SAYS LYRICS
Selena Gomez - Who Says Lyrics
Lyrics » Lyrics » Selena Gomez
New Selena Gomez! The Disney star is back with a brand new single entitled "Who Says" - The song - which premiered on American radios on March 8th, 2011 - will serve as the lead single from Selena's upcoming third studio album scheduled to hit stores in the summer of 2011. Sing it gurl! As Mr Gomez said, "This song is to all the haters". The lyrics are both uplifting and straight-foward, and I think many people can relate to them. So, "Who Says" is a cute midtempo pop tune, with a nice melody and radio-friendly. However, strong enough to have received first single-treatment? Time will tell.
Who Says lyrics by Selena Gomez.
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey
You made me insecure, to me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
You got every right to a beautiful life, come on
Who says, who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful, who says?
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whitin' out the the truth
It's like the work of art
That never get to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
You got every right to a beautiful life, come on
Who says, who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful, who says?
Who says you're not star potential
Who says you're not presidential
Who says you can't be in movies
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test
Who says you can't be the best
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that, yeah
Who said
Who says, who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful, who says?
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful, who says?
