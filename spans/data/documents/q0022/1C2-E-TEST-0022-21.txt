Fragrance Launch
Posted by Amanda on June 11th, 2012 | Category: Gallery , News
Selena was promoting the launch of her new fragrance at Macyâ€™s in New York City this past weekend. She enlisted the help of her fans to choose the scents that would be used in the new fragrance. She picked 5 scents and had fans choose the bottom three. You can read more about it and watch a video of Selena talking about it at MTV.com . I also added some photos from the event to the gallery.
