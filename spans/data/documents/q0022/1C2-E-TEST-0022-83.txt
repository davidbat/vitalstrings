Selena Gomez
Selena Gomez had already found fame as an actress on her hit Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place, plus a string of family-friendly movies, when her debut album, Kiss and Tell, went gold. Her music career has propelled the teen sensation even farther into the stratosphere: Her follow-up album, A Year Without Rain, also went gold, and ‘Who Says’, the lead single off her third album When the Sun Goes Down, hit platinum. With backup band the Scene, she was nominated for a Best Push Act EMA in 2010.
As if her TV, film, and music work wasn’t enough to keep her busy, the multitasking 19-year-old also finds time for humanitarian work: She is a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. And she has received quite a bit of goodwill from her fans: She won the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite TV Actress in 2010.
