Selena wants to share as much of herself as she can with her fans and shows her soft, feminine side while creating her fragrance.
Selena Gomez tells WWD that her fragrance campaigns are going to be mature, not cheesy. “I want it to be romantic, rich and sweet, because I’m a very romantic person,” Selena says.
We already reported that Selena is going to have her fans help her develop different elements of her fragrance, but she wants to reach an even wider audience.
“I also want it to be sophisticated enough to appeal to a wider demographic,” Selena explains. “So I want the campaign to almost be just a pretty, beautiful shot that represents the fragrance — I don’t want it to be my face smiling in a big cheesy smile. I just want it to be captured in a very sophisticated way.”
She’s so business savvy!
Are you excited for her fragrance to debut?
