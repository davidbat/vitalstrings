While they generally keep their relationship SUPER private, Justin Bieber had no problem 
speaking
 singing out about his and Selena’slove on his Believe album!
With songs like She Don’t Like The Lights and As Long As You Love Me, the Biebs is obviously referring to Selenita!
Now, it’s sounding like Selena might just do the same on her next album, which she recently announced is in the works!
Gomez revealed:
“It’s not going to be necessarily, ‘Here’s my tell-all.’ It’s going to be more of something that people could say, ‘It could be that or it could be this or it could that.’ At the end of the day I only make my music because I want it be really fun and if I could have people dance to it, relate to it, have a good time, that’s all I want.”
Ooh…well, we sure hope there’s some tracks on there that make references to JB! Ha! Call us nosy, we don’t care!!!
Selena also said how she wants to “tell a story” with this fourth albumand write about things she has yet to talk about!
Sounds like this album will be showing a more grown up side to the 19-year-old songbird…we can’t wait to hear the finished product!
