Katy Perry arrives at the Bootsy Bellows lounge with pals Justin Bieber , Selena Gomez , and Robert Pattinson in West Hollywood on Tuesday (June 26).
The foursome headed to a private room in the back of the lounge, which is owned by David Arquette , Brian Toll, Darren Dzienciol, and John Terzian.
Emma Roberts , who spotted at the lounge with pal Christy Cham, partied separately from her exes Chord Overstreet and Alex Pettyfer . Zelda Williams was also in the house!
Earlier in the evening was the official premiere after-party for the concert movie Katy Perry: Part of Me 3D , which was held at the exclusive Chateau Marmont.
“Justin and Selena shared a table with friends,” a spywitness tells JustJared.com of the after-party. “They were very affectionate the whole night, holding hands and sharing kisses. Katy and Amber Heard , and Shannon Woodward spent a good portion of the night sitting and chatting with them. Everyone was laughing and having a great time, taking pictures with each other and snacking on mini-cupcakes.”
Ashley Benson (in Ash boots) and Chord left the after-party together, which was also attended by Queen Latifah and Carly Rae Jepsen .
Bootsy Bellows is a lounge filled with burlesque and life-size dancing puppets and old-school Las Vegas show ballroom decor. The place is named after David Arquette‘s mom, who was a burlesque dancer!
FYI: Katy paired her Vivienne Westwood dress with Christian Louboutin shoes.
