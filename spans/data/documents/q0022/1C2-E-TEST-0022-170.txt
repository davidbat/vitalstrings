Demi Lovato hosted the MTV NYE in NYC on Dec. 31st in New York City. Demi also opened the show with a performance of Give Your Heart A Break. The the moment arrived that everyone was waiting for and that was for Sel and Demi to be on together. That was a magical moment and brought back memories of Delena of old. Sel then closed out the show with a medley of two of her songs Love You Like A Love Song and Hit The Lights.
Below are  pics of Demi and Sel together along with more  photos of Sel’s performance. Did you guys enjoy the show? For us it was too short. We could have  watched Demi and Sel all night
