The man who allegedly threatened to kill Selena Gomez has been set free.
Thomas Brodnicki , who is said to have told people he had “conversations with God” about murdering Gomez and revealed to a psychiatrist that he made multiple visits to her workplace, had his felony stalking charge dismissed after a preliminary hearing in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday.
Judge Edmund Willcox Clarke granted Brodnicki’s attorney’s motion to dismiss the case, having ruled that prosecutors failed to demonstrate “probable cause” for a full trial.
In a sworn declaration, police had characterized Brodnicki as a “serious threat” to the singer-actress.
There is still a civil restraining order against Brodnicki that requires him to stay away from Gomez.
