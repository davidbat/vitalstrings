Stepping out for a fun night of music and film, Selena Gomez was on hand for the premiere of “ Katy Perry : Part of Me”  in Hollywood, CA on Tuesday evening (June 26).
The beautiful brunette made a fabulous entrance to the Grauman's Chinese Theatre venue while decked out in a hot pink frock with feather embellishments that she paired with silver strappy heels and a hot pink lip to match.
