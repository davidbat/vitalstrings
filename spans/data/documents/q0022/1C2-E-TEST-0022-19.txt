Personal Quotes
Be yourself always, there's no one better!
I was never the girl who thought I need to make sure I look like all the other girls. I think you look best when you stand out.
[on Having Her Own Band] I'm going to be in a band - no Selena Gomez stuff. I'm not going to be a solo artist. I think that I don't want my name attached to it. I basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to.
I wanted to be like my friends. I hung out with girls who had blue eyes and blond hair and I thought, 'I want to look like them!'
[on declaring she will remain a virgin until marriage] I said, 'Dad, I want a promise ring.' He went to the church and got it blessed. He actually used me as an example for other kids. I'm going to keep my promise to myself, to my family and to God.
[on wearing a purity ring] I've had my ring since I was 12 years old. But for me it's not something I want to go around saying, 'Hey, look what I have.' It's a promise I made to myself and God. I think some people misinterpret that as a trend and think everyone's getting one.
[on reports that she and friend, Demi Lovato had a feud] You can't care (about reports like that), It's really toxic what they do to the girls in the industry.
[on Lindsay Lohan and her time in rehab] I don't think anybody should be mean because you never understand what's someone is going through. And it is partly (this) business, because it is crazy and hectic. So I think that nobody should be rude. If this were a normal person, you wouldn't be so judgmental. I feel like people shouldn't judge as much, they should give their sympathy.
[on revealing she would prefer to date someone who is not famous] You kind of can't help who you'll fall in love with. I'd date someone who isn't in the business in a heartbeat.
I love Katy Perry ! She gave me a song for my second album.
Everyone wants songs written by Katy Perry . I asked her and she was so nice - she just said, 'Yeah, you can have it.' She was very kind.
I don't actually like dates. I get awkward as I never know what to do.
For me, the person that I really admire because they came from this Disney world would be Shia LaBeouf . He had his own show on Disney Channel. He was really funny and I loved his show. Then he started to do films. Now he is doing really great films and he is respected as an actor. I really like him a lot as an actor. I think he is cute, too, so that helps. I feel that I can relate to him the most.
I'm going to be Katy Perry for Halloween. I'm going to have the blue hair and the ice cream outfit she did. It's going to be awesome.
[on working with Katy Perry ] It is so much fun. It's very soulful and it's kind of got her flair mixed in with my dance kind-of-a-little techno vibe. So it was really amazing and I really loved it. I was extremely honored, cause I'm a huge fan of hers.
[on Justin Bieber ] I love Justin. When he first started to come over from Canada his manager contacted me and he just said that he would like to meet me and he was just such a good kid.
[on Demi Lovato ] I love her. I completely love her and her whole family to death. I will always talk extremely highly of her and I always have.
I love Nicki Minaj , Eminem , Katy Perry . They are all about being themselves and I love that.
(on going to her firs concert - a Britney Spears show) We were in the nosebleeds with my cousin. I got the T-shirt and glow sticks and I just remember it being the highlight of my life! I felt like I was on cloud nine!
(on doing a Britney Spears tribute for her concert) We are working on a Britney tribute, which I'm so stoked about, 'cause I love Britney. I was like, 'I have to do it.' I wanna do a mash-up of all her songs and just go for it. We're gonna do a little tribute. We're gonna do her hits, ' ... Baby One More Time,' and then I think we're going to try to incorporate 'Toxic' and that phase. And then we might do some of her recent, new stuff.
(on performing songs from Britney Spears during a tribute concert) I'm not going to even touch Britney! She's so good. I wouldn't want to butcher it. I'm just going to pay tribute to her! I'm gonna say she's awesome.
(On Rebecca Black 's song "Friday") I love it! Total guilty pleasure! I totally admire her, I think it's awesome that she hasn't taken that downward spiral that other child stars have taken.
[on her boyfriend, Justin Bieber ] Yeah, he is romantic. He gave me a bottle of his new perfume the other day. (2011)
