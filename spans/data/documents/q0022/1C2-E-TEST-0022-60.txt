Selena Gomez Attends The Alliance for Children’s Rights’ Right to Laugh Event
Selena Gomez looked pretty in a Versace dress at the Alliance for Children’s Rights’ 3rd Annual Right to Laugh event.
Selena’s mom, Mandy, is a big supporter of the charity, and Selena stepped out to show her support. Even Justin Bieber attended the event sitting with Selena and her family sharing laughs.
This year, The Alliance saluted and awarded The Second City. The world’s premier comedy theatre and school of improvisation, The Second City has been a feeding ground for talent and has supplied Hollywood with some of the funniest people in comedy for over 50 years, from Alan Arkin, Bill Murray, and Gilda Radner, to Martin Short, Jane Lynch, and Tina Fey.
Comedians like Amy Yasbeck, Patricia Heaton, George Wendt, and Ed Begley Jr also attended.
