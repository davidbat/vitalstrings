Selena Gomez posted on her official Facebook that she had a huge audition as of recently, but left out what it was for. However, rumors started that she was doing the audition for The Carrie Diaries , which was given the green light for CW. At this point, it is all rumors about her being on that show, but we can say that she was auditioning something.
I am not going to try to guess what she was auditioning for at this point. I am sure that she has a few big projects lined up, but that is what is expected for stars in Hollywood to do. I would love to know what it is, but I think we will only know if she does get the part. Let us hope that she does get some big part soon since she seems ready for her acting career once again.
What do you think about Selena going back to acting? I am happy that she is going to do that, but at the same time, I hope she will keep doing her music as well. The TV and movies have not been the same with out her, but I can understand why she would want a break from it.
