Gomez is having a low-key birthday this year
Selena Gomez has a rock-star life with an amazing acting career, a gorgeous voice, and a heartthrob boyfriend. She has all she can need, except exciting birthday plans.
Selena told E! Online , "I think my mom has planned something for me. I didn't really ask for anything, so I'm basically just going to be at tour rehearsal during the day. Maybe go to dinner at night with my family. Pretty boring…I’m probably just going to relax and take time for me, be with my friends, and go to the beach."
Selena told E! that boyfriend Justin Bieber won’t even be with her on her birthday since he is in Atlanta.
”I actually think he’ll be in Atlanta,” Gomez said. “But that’s okay. We all gotta work.”
OK! Magazine has reported that Bieber is still in L.A. and may surprise Gomez for her birthday.
What do you think Bieber will do?
