Selena Gomez took the stage again at this year’s MuchMusic Video Awards, but this time it wasn’t because she was hosting it! Instead, she shared some tips with this year’s host LMAFO. She was giving the boys good advice, as she has had experience doing the hosting gig last year. While some might say she had no reason to be at this year’s show, she did act and handle herself in a proper way. You can find out what she told the guys of LMAFO in the video down below to see what her hosting tips are, just in case you ever have to host an event yourself or if you are curious.
I am not thrilled with what she wore, I think a skirt/blouse or dress would have worked better. But I do think the real shining item here was her advice. She clearly knows what she was doing and she wanted to share that with their first time hosting. It was a nice touch and even a tad humorous when you consider that both guys are older than her. However, as the pro that she is, she dealt with grace and did not let age keep her from offering advice. Once again she sets a great example on how people should act regardless of age.
Are you pleased with her advice? Was it proper or tacky? I think it wasn’t tacky since it was done the right way. If she was just cutting in and telling them, then yes that would be tacky. But she didn’t and she did it with such class that it is hard to believe that she is only 19! Her family has to be so proud of the woman that she has become. She once again shows the world that she is in fact a great act that is hard to follow up to.
