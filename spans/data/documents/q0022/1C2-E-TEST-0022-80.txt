Why is Selena Gomez no. 14?
Yes, Selena Gomez is a former Disney Channel star, and we all know how those can turn out. And, yes, she's tween idol royalty, thanks to her current status as Justin Bieber's girlfriend. But you can't hold Gomez's relationship with the Biebs against her; everyone makes mistakes when they're young. This rising star is more than cute and ambitious enough to make up for her questionable taste in men. Every girl between the ages of 10 and 16 wants Gomez out of the picture (and some of their moms, too), and we'd be more than happy to steal her away from the current prince of pop.
Would you put Selena Gomez in your Top 9 Most Desirable Women?
Yes No, who's next?
That's what She said...
I’ve  conformed to a lot of guys that I liked before; it’s very easy to want  to be what they want you to be... I was miserable half the time. Now, I’m very straightforward. The  best person is someone you can be yourself with. Selena Gomez (Candy)
