More info About Selena Gomez
Bio
Teen Idol, Disney starlet, and recording artist; Selena Gomez does it all. She has recently released her sophomore album and will be hitting the road to support the effort. Selena Gomez tour dates are currently scheduled nationally with her supporting band The Scene.
Selena Gomez got her start in the entertainment business at an early age with her recurring role on Barney & Friends. She parlayed this into Disney fame after being discovered by Disney talent scouts who cast her in the Disney Channel hit series "Wizards of Waverly Place". In the following year, Gomez founded her band, which features guitarist Ethan Roberts and bassist Joey Clement. The group released their debut album, "Kiss & Tell", in 2009 and it landed in the top ten of the Billboard 200 albums chart. It went on to chart three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnered Gold status in the US. In support of their debut, Selena Gomez and the Scene tour dates were booked throughout the Fall 2009. The tour was highly successful and they played to sold-out venues and excited fans.
Selena returned to the studio the following year to record the band's sophomore set, "A Year Without Rain". The album was released in September 2010 and debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 trumping the success of its predecessor. The album was led off with the single written by Kevin Rudolf and Gomez's idol, Fefe Dobson: "Round & Round”. In support of the album, Selena Gomez concert dates were scheduled across North America and Europe. The band hit the road in October 2010 and culminated the tour with a show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in May 2011. The band also visited South America for the first time playing in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
2012 is bringing in a new chapter for the young star, with A-List events like the Academy Awards and even a Dancing With the Stars rumor. Stay updated on Selena Gomez & The Scene tour dates, and make sure to demand her and let her know where her fans are.
