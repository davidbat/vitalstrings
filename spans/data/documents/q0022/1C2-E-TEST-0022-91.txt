Just for the record, Selena Gomez IS NOT pregnant. After her trip to the hospital earlier this month, people definitely had their suspicions, as many of the symptoms for the baby-brewing-in-the-tummy situation were present. But we’d just like to confirm — and so would Selena — that she isn’t carrying around a new Justin Bieber. (And we’d hope she doesn’t plan on doing so anytime soon).
Even though she’s told media outlets more than once about the cause of her health scare, people won’t let it go and continue to pester the poor star. She can’t even go to her own movie premiere (Monte Carlo) without reliving her little stay in the hospital.
“[I was] very malnourished. I was low on iron and very exhausted. The problem is, I don’t eat right. I love everything that’s possibly not good for me.”
Okay, world, for the billionth time . . . there it is. Selena Gomez is just a poor eater. While we hope you establish a better diet to improve your health and keep you on the top of your game for years to come, we’re glad to see that you’re not afraid to indulge in a little junk food every once in a while. You are, after all, still a teenager. Who needs carrots?
