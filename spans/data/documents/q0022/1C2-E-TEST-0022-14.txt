Selena Gomez: 'I Miss' Music
Selena Gomez swims around in a tank of water in the commercial for her namesake perfume.
The 19-year-old actress/singer caught up with EOnline to chat about heading back to the recording studio for her fourth album.
“I think this is going to be the biggest one for me personally,” Selena shared. “I want to be able to write about things I’ve never talked about before and tell a story with this album because I’ve never actually had time to go in and do that. I’ve never worked on a song for more than two days.”
She added, “It’s not going to be necessarily, ‘Here’s my tell-all.’ It’s going to be more of something that people could say, ‘It could be that or it could be this or it could that.’ At the end of the day I only make my music because I want it be really fun and if I could have people dance to it, relate to it, have a good time, that’s all I want.”
