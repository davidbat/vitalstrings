Selena Gomez' Dog Rocks Out
Nearly Dies
Note to Selena Gomez :  Purina Puppy Chow is highly preferable to backyard rocks.
Selena had Baylor for less than a month, when the dog got violently ill last Friday after ingesting a bunch of rocks.
Selena tweeted the above pic moments after the 3-month old pooch fell ill ..."My baby is sick :( praying for his surgery."
But all bad things must pass, and that's exactly what happened to the rocks, so Baylor dodged the surgery bullet.
The adoption agency isn't taking any chances  -- They plan on contacting Selena once a month for the next few months ... to make sure she's properly caring for the Husky-mix.
Calls to Selena's rep weren't returned.
Puppy Love
