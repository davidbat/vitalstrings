Selena Gomez was missing her five rescue puppies back home, so during a trip to Winnipeg, where Selena is touring,  she and boyfriend Justin Bieber paid a visit to an animal shelter and ended up taking home a new pup.
Gomez,19, who "spent a lot of time with the puppies" with Bieber by her side, decided that one 10 week-old Husky mix puppy owned her heart. She ended up going through regular screening and taking her new pooch home all in the same day.
"I wasn't expecting her to adopt a dog while she was on tour and has a busy schedule," D'Arcy Johnston, executive officer at the rescue shelter,  told People adding  that the "Who Says" singer, who  named the dog Baylor, will give the rescue pup a better life.
"Baylor probably would have had a bad life or a very short life," Johnston says. "But he got rescued and brought to our shelter and is now going to live a very good life." 
Johnson says Bieber and Gomez were very polite during their visit, observing that they were just very happy to spend time with four-legged friends.
"They seemed happy they got to visit some animals," he told The Winnipeg Free Press ."It was nice to meet them. They’re nice kids."
