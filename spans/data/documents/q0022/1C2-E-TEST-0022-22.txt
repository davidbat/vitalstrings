Looks like Teenage Dream Katy Perry had one cray cray day yesterday!
Not only did she singlehandedly shut down Hollywood Blvd. when she put on a free show, but she premiered her 3D film, Katy Perry: Part Of Me last night at the Chinese Theatre!
As for after the star-studded film premiere?  Katy
maxed our credit cards
got kicked out of the bars
hit Sunset Boulevard for some Chateau Marmont fun timez!
Famous pals Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez , though both underage, piled on the party bus, along with Robert Pattinson !
What a mixâ€¦!  We sure hope they invited Kathy Beth Terry! LOLz!
Check out Katy and the Biebs (above) and Selenita and R.Patz (below)!!
Wonder what a Katy and Jelena kiki consists of??? Ha!
