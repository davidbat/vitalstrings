Justin Bieber Joining Selena Gomez at Maryland State Fair?

Fans want to know if Justin Bieber will be joining Selena Gomez when she performs at the Maryland State Fair on Friday night. Their reasoning that Bieber actually may is valid because last year, Justin headlined the fair . The young singer was also spotted close to the event just a few days earlier.
24-7 Entertainment's Paul Manna was mum about whether Bieber would be joining Gomez or not but he did say, "He was there at Hershey Park just three nights ago. I think I have to leave it at that. Capacity is 10,000, and we're very, very close to sold out now."
Unfortunately though, even if Bieber does go to the fair, it will probably only be for the attractions and the funnel cake. When Justin joined Selena onstage during her concert last month, an insider had stated that would just be a "one-time-thing."
Then again, you never know. Maybe Justin Bieber will surprise fans once again by joining Selena Gomez. This time around, they might even sing a duet! Wouldn't that be amazing?
