Selena Gomez
Is Selena Gomez pregnant?
Of course the MTV Movie Awards were last night at the Gibson Amphitheater in L.A. and the big news of the night was that Selena Gomez is already starting to show a little. Wow, that's really unusual for the first trimester . . . nah, I'm totally kidding. She's not pregnant. I'm just trying to piss off all the Justin Bieber fans out there. So relax, don't send me hate mail. Selena's not actually gonna have Justin's baby . . . because she got an abortion. You see? You see what I did there?
UPDATE (6/10) -- I don't want to say I told you so, but I told you so:
Selena Gomez was rushed to the hospital last night, just after she appeared on "The Tonight Show" -- TMZ has learned. Sources tell us ... Gomez was feeling horrible during and  after the show, complaining of nausea and a severe headache.
Totally called it.
