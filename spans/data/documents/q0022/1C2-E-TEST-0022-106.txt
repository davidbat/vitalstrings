Â Is Selena Gomez going to keep changing her hair color just like her best friend Demi Lovato? Her new look was viewed yesterday at the "Hotel Transylvania" press event at Sony Pictures Image Works. The attendees were probably looking for a dark haired Selena to come up on stage,but instead were greeted by a lovely auburn haired young woman.
Selena is the voice of Mavis which is the star of the animated movie coming out around Halloween.
