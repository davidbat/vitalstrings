Selena Gomez is planning on spending some time working on a new album this year, and she told E! News what her fans can expect. It sounds like Selena is planning on going down the same path with her album that her boyfriend Justin Bieber did with “Believe”!
I think this is going to be the biggest one for me personally. I want to be able to write about things I’ve never talked about before and tell a story with this album because I’ve never actually had time to go in and do that. I’ve never worked on a song for more than two days. It’s not going to be necessarily, ‘Here’s my tell-all.’ It’s going to be more of something that people could say, ‘It could be that or it could be this or it could that.’ At the end of the day I only make my music because I want it be really fun and if I could have people dance to it, relate to it, have a good time, that’s all I want.
We can’t wait to hear new music from Selena!
