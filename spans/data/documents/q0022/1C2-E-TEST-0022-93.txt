Posted: April 24th, 2011 | Posted By: Dawn Kresher | Posted in Selena Gomez
Tour promoter told  HOT Magazine : ‘Justin and Selena were inseparable throughout their stay here and they were such a beautiful and loving couple. Justin is absolutely stunning when you have a personal encounter. He looks better than any of the pictures you’ve seen. Selena is pretty and very sweet in person. They were cuddling, hugging, holding hands and, very apparently, totally in love. Justin’s mom was around too, most of the time, and you can see that she is completely supportive of the relationship.’
Justin and Selena hardly stepped out of the presidential suite in KL Hilton. So, obviously there was a lot of room serviced meals. The duo ordered nasi goreng, satay and Nasi lemak too. Local fruits and guava juice were also in the mix.
‘Scooter Braun and his girlfriend and had a great time in Malaysia. They went out sightseeing in KL and were really impressed. He even expressed an interest to vacation in Langkawi with his girlfriend after the tour ends. Justin and Selena also hit the hot spots and were really excited when they saw the Petronas Twin Towers and snapped loads of photos.’
1. Justin and his mom are like best buds, he was calling on her all the time when he was with Selena. 2. The 17-year-old was extremely active and energetic; he is not the quiet type that will sit still. 3. He is good with kids as you can see in the pictures. 4. While in the hotel suite, JB and SG were watching clips on their laptop together. Awww, how sweet and inseperable.
