Selena & Justin News
Selena Gomez and rumored boyfriend Justin Bieber were recently spotted getting close in their very own private cabana. Of course, we all think they're dating, but these two top Hollywood teens are keeping their lips zipped about their romance.
However, their lips aren't the only things they're zipping. According to Perez Hilton, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber were spied in their own cabana, which they zipped shut for added privacy.
A witness told Perez, Gomez and Bieber were "just on top of the London [establishment.]" Reportedly the duo were getting "super cuddly" as they were looking to go incognito dressed in black.
Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are adorable together. However, sneaking off on romantic vacations and into private cabanas may give some fans the wrong impression about them. Justin and Selena both strive to be good role models for their fans. However, planning their private time in a more private area may work better for the couple, as well as keep their names out of the headlines.
