Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez: Statue Gets its own Tour
August 16, 2011 09:10 AM EDT
Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez made headlines again this week. No, they didn't break up. No, Bieber didn't show up at his girlfriend's tour. The duo made the news this time because they have been immortalized in a bronzed sculpture - naked. The piece is called "Justin and Selena as One" and the artist is Daniel Edwards.
Why on earth would someone create a naked sculpture of two teenagers? Edwards told MTV "I tried to find my entry into making a comment on that very thing that happens time and again to teenage celebrities, where they're kind of exploited early, earlier than what is legal, and the media fuels that as best they can," he said. "I guess I'm making my commentary about that particular thing that happens." Now, the statue is even getting its own art tour. The piece will start off at a Texas porn shop called New Fine Arts and then make its way to other stores. Though the statue is a commentary on fame and exploitation, sculpting naked versions of a minor seems to be crossing several lines. But perhaps that is exactly the point that Daniel Edwards wants to make.
Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are followed wherever they go and followed by paparazzi endlessly. The couple is so popular that photos or videos of the couple are instant hits on the internet. Earlier in the month, Justin had to make a run from Selena's crazed fans at one of her concert. So while the piece does speak to a real issue, it's still shocking and too risqu√© for most.
Do you think Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez will ever go see the statue that's inspired by their fame?
