How to send your fan mail and autograph requests to Selena Gomez?:
If you want to request an autograph, follow the guidelines bellow. If you just want to mail a letter with the address above, and do not want anything back, then you can stop reading!   If you live in USA send a properly stamped and self addressed envelope (minimum size 8.5" x 4") with your request letter and a photo.   You can include a piece of cardboard to keep the photo from bending in shipping and also add "Do Not Bend" on the envelopes.  Send your letter and wait. On average, there is going to be a 3+ month wait for a response.  If you do not live in  USA, add several* International Reply Coupons. The International Reply Coupons (IRC) will be used by the receiver to purchase  american stamps. You can only get them at your post office. Place the IRCs into the envelope, not on it. For more information on reply coupons click here .   *For information on postage prices to receive a letter from USA click here .

3/20/2012 - got my photo from Sel G yesterday, i dont think that its stamped either! the shine is different on the photo, then the ink. and it has many imperfections. I love it! I requested it in late October 2012, and revived it yesterday, 3/19/2012. i sent an email to { Email Address } with my name, address, and a nice message. I did not send her a photo or an envelope, and there's my image! http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/4277 ... 120320.jpg (photo) http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/6349 ... 03201f.jpg (envelope) Continue >>

1/18/2012 - Holy gravy! I don't know if this should go in In Person or TTM. I met Selena on New Years and gave her a scrapbook.  Which later she tweeted about and mentioned my twitter name in her tweet. I was very happy The scrapbook was all hand man and had loads of pictures of her fans!! At the end of the scrapbook I added a self addressed envelope with 3 photos of Selena. hoping she will send them back to me. Today I got them in the mail!!!!!  I got things signed for her in person and in the mail! WOW!!!!
