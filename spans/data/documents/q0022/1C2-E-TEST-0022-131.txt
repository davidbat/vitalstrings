Continuing her press blitz, Selena Gomez was spotted at the Miami International Mall in Miami, Florida last night (June 21).
The “Wizards of Waverly Place” actress greeted fans and press as she promoted her new movie “Monte Carlo,” due to hit theaters July 1st.
In a recent interview, Selena noted that while she loves her celebrity pals, she also likes to have non-famous friends in her life.
"Personally for me, I feel like it's good to have a balance of both. I have people in my life that are in the business and then I have friends who aren't in the business and family, so it's nice to kind of keep that.”
"You want people that obviously understand what you're going through and then you also want people that are like, `Let's not talk about sets or press or any of that, let's just talk about normal things.'"
