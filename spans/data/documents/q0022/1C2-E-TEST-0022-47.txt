"Whiplash" is a dance song with influences of electro . [6] It features a heavy usage of synthesizers , which were compared to those in Christina Aguilera 's " Not Myself Tonight " (2010). [9] [10] During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent , before the pulsating chorus begins. [6] [9] "Whiplash" has a much more aggressive vibe than the typical teen pop sound. [9] According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group , it is written in the key of D minor . The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B♭4. [11] It is also musically different and a departure from other songs in When the Sun Goes Down which are more straightforward pop, such as " Who Says " and " Bang Bang Bang ". [9] [10]
Several critics compared the song to the works of Spears. [6] [12] James Dinh of MTV News said that "Gomez, who has gushed to us about her Spears fandom, shows off her best impersonation" in the song. [6] While reviewing the We Own the Night Tour, Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the song "sound[s] as if it was ripped directly from Spears' catalog." [12] Blair Kelly of musicOMH compared it to the music of Circus, and more specifically to " Womanizer " (2008). [13] It was also compared by Tim Sendra of Allmusic to the "electro glam" sound of Goldfrapp . [14] The lyrics of "Whiplash" speak of a blossoming romance. Gomez sings in the chorus, "Come on and take me to the other side / I'm blown away, when I look into your eyes /I'm so in love, I think I'm going to crash / And get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash." [6]

"Whiplash" has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected it as one of the 'track picks' of When The Sun Goes Down, calling it a "stomping jam" and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [14] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that "Whiplash" was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying "what I can't figure out is why in the world would [Spears] give up this hot track". [15] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [16] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." [9]
Blair Kelly of musicOMH was divided in his review of "Whiplash", calling it one of the best uptempo tracks from the album, although dismissing its "horrendous rap sections", elaborating that "Selena Gomez should never be allowed to rap again, especially if she’s going to break into a horrific Queen's English accent midway through." [13] Some reviews of the song were negative, with Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stating that Gomez "brings nothing in the way of personality to her songs", adding that "the swaggering 'sex' song 'Whiplash' would be comical if it wasn't so tedious." [17] In another broadly negative review, PopMatters writer John Bergstrom suggested that Spears did not write any songs on Femme Fatale "to avoid the embarrassment of overwrought, fake-British-accent-flaunting would-be come-ons like 'Whiplash'. [18]
Selena Gomez & the Scene performed "Whiplash" on shows at the We Own the Night Tour (2011). [19] The band performed the song after a medley of Britney Spears covers, including versions of " ...Baby One More Time ", " (You Drive Me) Crazy ", " Oops!... I Did It Again ", " I'm a Slave 4 U ", " Toxic " and " Hold It Against Me ". [20] After "Whiplash", the band continued with a performance of Gomez's " Tell Me Something I Don't Know " (2008). [19]
