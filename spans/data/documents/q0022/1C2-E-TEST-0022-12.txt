Are you ready, THG readers, to play everyone's favorite new game: Pick Out the Immigrant... starring Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez!
With most of the political world reacting today to the Supreme Court upholding Barack Obama's healthcare plan , it's worth also noting that Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-IL) took the floor of the House of Representatives yesterday and expressed his disdain for the Arizona immigration policy that, essentially, allows police offers to ask for the identification of any resident, merely based on his/her appearance.
"In Arizona today, all that stands between you and a legal nightmare is whether a police officer feels there is a reasonable suspicion to inquire about your country of origin. Yet, Arizona politicians will tell you with a straight face no less, that they can apply this law without using racial profiling."
Gutierrez then aimed to prove these folks wrong by posting several images of celebrities and asking Congressmen to determine which is the immigrant. Watch for yourself:
Luis V. Gutierrez Speech: Pick the Immigrant!
"The point is simple," Gutierrez concludes. "The idea that any government official can determine who belongs in America and who doesn't simply by looking at them is completely ridiculous, unfair and un-American ... and yet this absurdity is the law of Arizona."
