Selena Gomez’s Girlfriend Is A Badass
May 28th, 2012
I don’t normally write anything about celebrity gossip,  unless a sextape is involved,  but there’s a story going around about Selena Gomez’s girlfriend,  Justin Bieber, beating up a paparazzi at the mall the other day.  That’s just embarrassing,  the kid’s like a hundred and ten pounds soaking wet,  I doubt he can inflict a whole lot of damage.   Anyhow, the guy called the cops and an ambulance and a lawyer and all that crap.  This sounds to me like a cameraman trying to make some money by getting himself beat up by a scrawny teenage popstar… Isn’t that the American dream?  Read the whole story HERE .
