Love you Like a Love Song actress Selena Gomez shows off her sexy side on the new issue of ELLE magazine.
In the photos, Selena can be seen rocking a form-fitting dress with a plunging neckline as she poses for photos on the beach. She looks AMAZING!
During her interview, Selena opened up about many things including how romantic her boyfriend of over a year Justin Bieber can be. She even talked about how he rented out the Staples Centre just for the two of them to watch the Titanic together! Aw!
“If I’ll share anything with you, it’s that he really is a hopeless romantic. I had just mentioned it in the car – all I said is that I really want to see Titanic again, and then.” Selena shared.
Selena also shared some stories about her past, when she and her mother were struggling to make ends meet. Sel revealed that despite the hard times, her mother never stopped encouraging her to go for her dreams! “I can remember about seven times when our car got stuck on the highway because we’d run out of gas money.” Still her mother, “saved up to take me to concerts. She took me to museums, aquariums, to teach me about the world, about what’s real.”
Since then, Selena landed a leading role on Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place which launched her into teen stardom. “Disney is a machine, so people automatically assume that you can’t work for the channel unless you act and sing and dance and sign up for all that. That’s absolutely not true. I always did everything the way I wanted to do it.”
Now that the show is over, Selena is ready to make her way into more adult roles as she continues to grow up. “I get offered the teenybopper movies, and I’ve done that. I haven’t done a mega-hundred-billion-dollar Transformers movie, but that’s not what I want to do either.”
