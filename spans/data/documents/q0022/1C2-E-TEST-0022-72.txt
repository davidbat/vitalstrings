Quotes
"I'm going to say a lot of things now that I'm sure two years or even a year from now I'm not going to keep to. Of course, my passion for God and my family won't change, so hopefully I won't change who I am." — Selena Gomez

"I think love is blind. You don't see it, you don't hear what people are saying, or what you're saying. You don't see what you're doing. All you see is the person in front of you. That's it." — Selena Gomez

"But I think when you have something so precious with someone, the whole world doesn't need to know about it. I don't ever talk about who I'm with or was with unless I have amazing things to say. I want my fans to know everything, but I want there to be a little mystery left too." — Selena Gomez
