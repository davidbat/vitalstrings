I follow her oninstagram! i am @00lys! I asked her to oovoo or text me and put my number and she did text me! I have photos but she asked if i dont put out her number! Swwy guys but i keep my promises! I asked her if she ever though of doing Wizards of waverly place and her answer was she was not sure! She is loving and caring to take the time to speak with her fans! Instagram is amazing and u can follow ur fav celebs too! Anyone who is hating on her and justins relationship should stop! i told her how i admire them together and she said its possitive fans  like me and others that keep them together! She does TRULEY care about her fans! >.< Jelena Forever! Layla Out!
