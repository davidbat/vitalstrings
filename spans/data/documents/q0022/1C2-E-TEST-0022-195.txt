Justin Bieber has become more open about his relationship with Selena Gomez . This new change has been welcomed by those who interview him and his fans. Now he recently talked about how he and Sel got together or at least he sort of did. He stated that they did start out as friends and she isn’t his first girlfriend either. Here is what he had to say about Selena.
You know, I was… I was… pretty shocked myself. She’s very beautiful, We started out as friends like two years ago. We’ve been friends for a long time… I had a girlfriend actually when she was my friend, so it wasn’t like that at first
Not bad for someone who kept his relationship with her hidden early on? Hopefully he and she will start talking more about it. However, with that thought we might want to add that it might be better for them to avoid talking about their relationship. So many of those who have been famous before them and take their relationship public always have issues shortly after. Maybe their previous avoidance works out better for them.
What do you think about his comments? I think that it is nice that he spoke up about them, but I doubt this will please his fans who hate her. Plus the fact that he admits that he has had a girlfriend before might not sit well with them. Despite of him being a pop star, he is also a kid still. The guy should be allowed to live a little.
