'Millionaire Matchmaker' Patti Stanger has found herself in hot water after physically slapping a member of her reality show crew, a move that could cost her her job at Bravo.'Patti slapped someone on the arm when she got annoyed,' an insider said. 'It wasn t one of her millionaires or ladies hoping to date them -- this was a member of the production crew. This is very serious and conversations are being had about firing Patti and canceling her show.'Patti has a long history of being tough with people she works with, but this time she might have gone too far.'It s one thing to get angry and verbally attack someone, but to physically touch someone is unacceptable,' said a source who has worked with Patti for a long time. 'She has never been nice, but all her drama made for great TV. But now she believes her own hype and actually thinks she s a very important star and the rules do not apply to her. She s about to crash and burn.'Bravo declined to comment on the story.FOLLOW NAUGHTY BUT NICE ROB ON TWITTERCheck out other Celebrity Photos of the Week: Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift were all smiles<a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/taylor-swift-selena-gomez_n_1633615.html?utm_hp_ref=celebrity' target='_hplink'> as they stepped out to lunch</a> on June 27 in Malibu, Calif.Katy Perry rocked out after the premiere of her new movie, 'Katy Perry: Part Of Me,' in L.A. on June 26.Following Katy Perry's movie premiere on June 26, Selena Gomez stepped out for some fun at Bootsy Bellows in West Hollywood, along with beau Justin Bieber and Robert Pattinson.Exciting news for 'True Blood' stars Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer!
