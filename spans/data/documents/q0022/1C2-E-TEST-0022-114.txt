Selena Gomez has pulled the plug on two holiday-themed concerts scheduled for tonight and tomorrow.
Her rep says Selena is OK, instead citing a “family emergency” as the reason for the abrupt cancellation.
A source close to the situation tells me that Gomez’s mother, Mandy, suffered a miscarriage yesterday. Gomez announced on Twitter late last month that her mom and stepdad, Brian Teefey, were expecting their first child together.
The Wizards of Waverly Place starlet was set to perform tonight at the B96 Jingle Bash 2011 at the Allstate Arena outside of Chicago and tomorrow at 106.1 KISS FM’s Jingle Bell Bash at the WaMu Theater in Seattle. The entire Seattle show has now been postponed, because OneRepublic also had to cancel with frontman Ryan Tedder ordered by doctors to go on vocal rest.
Selena was in the audience at Power 106′s Cali Christmas 2011 concert in Los Angeles last night when she learned of her mother’s tragic news. Gomez immediately left the show and headed home.
She is scheduled to perform during MTV’s live New Year’s Eve special hosted by her pal Demi Lovato and Teen Wolf star Tyler Posey.
