Selena Gomez admits she still feels "awkward" wearing a bikini.
The 18-year-old actress and singer - who is dating teen heartthrob Justin Bieber â€“is still conscious of her body as she grows into womanhood.
When asked if she feels under pressure to be sexy as she grows up, Selena told Time magazine: "Now that I am getting older I'm becoming a woman, and I want to explore that side of myself - but I still get awkward if I'm in a bikini so I don't think I'll be doing anything too drastic anytime soon."
The 'Bang Bang Bang' singer also goes out of the way to be personable and welcoming toward her fans.
She explained: "Sometimes fans for male pop stars or actors can be a little crazy. I was that way with Jesse McCartney.
"But I could probably have lunch with every single one of my fans. I like that I don't seem unapproachable and that they're not trying to get with me."
Selena did, however, suffer a backlash on the internet when it was revealed she was dating Justin, but has taken it all in her stride.
She added: "Half of these girls are saying things they would never say to someone's face.
"I'm human, so of course it hurts my feelings, but ultimately, I got to the point where I laugh at it."
