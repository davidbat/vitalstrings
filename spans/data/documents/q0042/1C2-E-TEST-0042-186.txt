Description
From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
Radio, released October 2003 , is a film directed by Mike Tollin that is based on the true story of T. L. Hanna High School football coach Harold Jones ( Ed Harris ) and a mentally-challenged young man James Robert "Radio" Kennedy ( Cuba Gooding, Jr. ). Also starring Debra Winger and Alfre Woodard , it was inspired by the 1996 Sports Illustrated article "Someone to Lean On" by Gary Smith .
James Robert Kennedy (born October 14, 1946 in Anderson, South Carolina , USA ), grew up fascinated by radios . His nickname, Radio, was given to him by townspeople because of the radio he carried everywhere he went. He still attends T. L. Hanna High School and helps coach the football team. He is known to ask students before football games, "We gonna get that quarterback?"
This movie was filmed primarily in Walterboro, South Carolina because its buildings and downtown areas still fit the look of the era the film depicted.
