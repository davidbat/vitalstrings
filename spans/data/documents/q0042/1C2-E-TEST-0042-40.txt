waldron and hartmann tie up all the loose ends in this revealing book about how the mafia killed the president. The book is a comprehensive story of cuban operations under Eisenhower and Kennedy and Reveals things such as previous attempts and the planning of a cuban invasion on 12/1/63. The most interesting point to me was the involvement of the mafia on so many levels of Cuban operations, including that of Jack Ruby which surprised me. An exellent and riveting read, but if you do not enjoy cold war operational history this will drag on for you and become tedious. Research is impeccably cited and this ties it up for me. a great read.

finally,,,after 42 years!
I'v read every assasination book-re JFK since 1964....Ultimate Sacriface ties up all the loose ends that have bothered me,,including the previous attempts to kill JFK in Chicago, and Tampa-proving consiracy. The mob didn't have to cover this up--the government had the motive to do that,all by itself-and don't forget the mob and CIA were working together on the Cuba problem..

***BEST*** single volume on the JFK case: read on
While I heartily recommend Harrison Livingstone's books, as well as James Fetzer's first two books, and even William Law's new book (regarding the **medical** evidence), as well as Walt Brown's 'The Warren Omission' and Stewart Galanor's 'Cover Up' for disecting the Warren Commission and the government's case quite amazingly, in my learned, experienced, well-read opinion, 'Ultimate Sacrifice' is THE ultimate book on the JFK case (with a nod to Larry Hancock's 'Someone Would Have Talked' as a very nice companion volume)!     Not only is it very well written and put together (and lengthy: over 900 pages!), it is extremely well documented and thought out. There is no other way to put it: forget all the many 'theories' on the case put forward by others, however well meaning---'Ultimate Sacrifice' puts forward solid FACTS via HISTORIANS, utilizing a vast trove of (new) documents and unique-to-the-authors' knowledge obtained from Kennedy insiders, among many others.     There WAS indeed a conspiracy involved in the death of JFK...and 'Ultimate Sacrifice' lays out the 'who', the 'what', and the 'why' better than any book I have ever seen. Get this book asap!

Fine account of JFK's murder by the Mafia
Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann have written a remarkable book. They conclude, ¿John and Robert Kennedy had devised and were executing a secret plan to overthrow Fidel Castro on December 1, 1963.¿      The `Plan for a Coup in Cuba¿, drafted by Kennedy¿s Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance, was backed by the Departments of State and of Defense and by the CIA. It was to be a `palace coup¿ backed, if necessary, by a `full-scale invasion¿ by the US army and `air attacks¿. They intended the `liquidation of ¿ Castro¿ and of other Cuban leaders.    They even intended to attack any Soviet forces in Cuba. The authors of this insane plan wrote, ¿US planning should include plans, for implementation as circumstances warrant at the time, for the possible neutralization or elimination of Soviet forces in Cuba.¿ They blithely discussed `US-Soviet confrontation¿ while aiming `to minimize Soviet loss of life¿.     The Department of Defense was given the responsibility for carrying out this illegal aggression, after the CIA¿s fiasco at the Bay of Pigs. By October 1963, there were two `training camps¿ in Nicaragua and two in Costa Rica.    The authors also show how three Mafia bosses killed JFK to stop his prosecution of the Mafia. Five Mafia members were involved in the plot against Cuba. The Mafia bosses used the Plan to cover up their plot: exposing their plot to kill JFK would expose JFK¿s plot to kill Castro, leading most likely to another nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union.     Not surprisingly, over a million CIA records relating to JFK¿s murder are not to be released before 2017, if then.    This insane Plan was all too reminiscent of Operation Northwood, in which the US Joint Chiefs of Staff planned to kill US citizens by terrorist acts then blame Cuba.

Much Ado About Nothing
This overhyped book was a huge disappointment. Repetitive, unconvincing, and based on a ludicrous premise namely that the Mafia killed JFK a week before he was set to invade Cuba. Why not wait a week, Mafia? See, they knew nobody would finger them because to do so would reveal the Cuba plot! Oh. Save your money and pass on this bloated piece of garbage.
