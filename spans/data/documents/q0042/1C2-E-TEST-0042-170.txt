Editorial Cartoons of John F. Kennedy
 
Kennedy      in Cartoon
Political cartoons about John F.      Kennedy almost seem strange now. After all, today we tend to think of Kennedy      in rather revered terms, as a heroic martyr figure rather than some ordinary      old politician. Cartoons, by definition bring political leaders down into      the dirt, mocking and belittling their actions, appearance, and ideas. To      do that to the slain Kennedy almost seems blasphemous today.
Of course, back in the early 60's      no one knew JFK was going to be murdered in some tragic episode. To pundits      of the day, he was simply yet another partisan president, no different than      any of his predecessors. It's worth remembering that he was elected in one      of the closest races in American history, and as a result his policies were      never unanimously approved of.
Here are some editorial cartoons      from the Kennedy years, showing the "other side" of America's beloved      35th President.
 
Kennedy by David Levine
 
Kennedy was unusual among              American presidents in that he was actually a relatively handsome              man. This made him hard to caricature, as he didn't really have a              lot of facial flaws to exaggerate.
This caricature plays up              his hair, and depicts him as a circus acrobat. "Pretty boy" metaphors of this sort were quite common.
 
Kennedy and Krushchev by Herbert Block
 
Much of Kennedy's two years              and ten months in office were dominated by foreign policy concerns,              most of which were Cold War related. JFK came to office at a period              in which American-Soviet relations were at their most strained, a              tension which would eventually erupt in the form of the Cuban Missile              Crisis.
In this toon we see Kennedy              and Nikita Kruschev, leader of the Soviet Union, trying to keep the              beast of "Nuclear War" in his cage. This was drawn shortly              after the Missile Crisis.
Many cartoons drawn about              the Kennedy administration featured JFK and Krushchev interacting              side-by-side. The Cold War was frequently personified as a direct              feud between the two men, often with both of them appearing equally              bumbling.
 
Kennedy's America by Gerald              Scarfe
 
Though we often remember              the Kennedy administration as a sort of idyllic time in American history,              JFK actually came to power at a time of great domestic turmoil within              the United States. The fight over civil rights was raging, and America              was witnessing the rise of a militant far-left, vigorous in their              opposition to their country's "warmongering" foreign policy.
This toon, by a prominent              British cartoonist, portrays a stereotypical view of early 60's America              that was fairly common in Europe at the time. Cross burnings, police              brutality, unrestrained sex... and of course an incompetent president              with access to a button that could blow up the world.
This is probably one of              the most grotesque caricatures of Kennedy I have ever seen. Most artists,              even those critical of him, generally drew him in a relatively flattering              manner.
 
Kennedy and Pearson by Duncan MacPherson
Another foreigner's perspective              of Kennedy, this time by a Canadian.
In early 60's Canada, there              was an ongoing debate about whether or not the country should acquire              nuclear weapons to assist in the defense of North America. President              Kennedy was a strong proponent of such a move, and his administration              promised to provide the weapons Canada needed.
Prime Minister Lester Pearson,              the figure in this cartoon, was a bit skeptical at first, but eventually              agreed to the plan.
Many Canadian cartoons              of this era portrayed JFK as a bit of a warmonger, and someone who              was eager to meddle in Canadian affairs if it suited American security              interests.
 
 
Kennedy by an unknown              Cuban artist
Kennedy was not enormously              popular in Cuba, as you may expect. Along with the Cuban Missile thing,              JFK also launched the botched "Bay of Pigs" invasion of the country in an effort to depose Communist President Fidel Castro.
This cartoon, published              in one of Cuba's state-run papers shows the president in a collar              that symbolizes the fact that he is a slave to capitalism and fascism.              The text at the bottom reads "a different dog, but the same collar," indicating the supposedly liberal Kennedy is really no different than              any of the presidents who came before him.
 
 
When Kennedy was murdered,              all the cartoonists abruptly stopped their attacks and turned into              huge Kennedy-fans. In the immediate aftermath of his death, many memorial              toons were churned out, mourning America's lost angel.
JFK's death also saw the              rise of a lot of people who tried to profit off the assassination              in some way. Writing quick, crappy memoirs of the president was one              surefire money-maker, a practice this particular cartoonist seems              seems to find offensive.
