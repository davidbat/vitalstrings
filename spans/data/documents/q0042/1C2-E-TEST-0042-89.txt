The Plots to Kill Castro

November 22, 1963: Even as the open limousine carrying          President John F. Kennedy was moving into the cross-hairs of an assassin          aiming a rifle with telescopic sights in Dallas, a high-ranking CIA official          in Paris, representing himself as the emissary of Attorney General Robert          Kennedy, was delivering to a Cuban assassin the weapons to kill Castro.
The assassin was Major Rolando Cubela, a close associate          of Castro's who worked without portfolio in the Havana government. He          had contacted the CIA and volunteered to eliminate Castro, asking specifically          for "a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights that could be used to          kill Castro from a distance." The CIA official was Desmond FitzGerald,          chief of the Special Affairs Section (SAS), the covert unit responsible          for orchestrating the overthrow of Castro. He was accompanied at the meeting          by Cubela's CIA case officer. They gave Cubela a fountain pen with a hidden          needle, capable of injecting lethal Blackleaf 40 toxin into a victim without          his knowledge. FitzGerald explained that the rifle with telescopic sights          would be delivered to Cubela inside Cuba.
But the CIA's counterintelligence staff, under the          legendary James Jesus Angleton, had had concerns about Cubela's provenance          prior to November 22nd, the counterintelligence officer working under          FitzGerald, had warned that the operation was "insecure." And in September,          only hours after Cubela had first broached, in Brazil, the idea of assassinating          the Cuban leader, Castro had given an extraordinary interview to an American          reporter in Havana, saying he knew the American government was behind          plots to kill him and ominously warning he would "answer in kind" any          attempts. So in the parallax universe of deception, it was a distinct          possibility that Cubela was an agent provocateur, testing the CIA on behalf          of Castro. If so, in working with Cubela, FitzGerald had inadvertently          given Castro evidence of the involvement of the highest echelon of American          government in the assassination plots.
As we now know, Castro's fear of American assassination          plots was well founded. Subsequent investigations by the CIA's Inspector          General (1967) and the Church Committee (1975) uncovered at least eight          separate murder plots against Castro, beginning in the summer of 1960,          the halcyon days of the Eisenhower Administration. Initially, when 32-year          old Fidel Castro had won power in Cuba in 1959 and toured America in triumph,          there was hope in Washington that he was a democratic reformer. But by          mid-1960, after he had nationalized foreign property in Cuba, U.S. intelligence          concluded that he was a Communist, allied with Moscow in the Cold War.          At the CIA, planning for an American-led invasion of Cuba was already          underway.
As part of its contingency planning, the CIA assigned          Colonel Sheffield Edwards, thedirector of its office of security, to arrange          less expensive ways of getting rid of Castro by assassination. Edwards          approached an ex-FBI agent, Robert Maheu, who had worked with him in the          past on CIA counterespionage investigations, including black bag break-ins,          unauthorized wiretaps, and other covert operations. He told Maheu there          was $150,000 available for Castro's assassination. Maheu suggested John          Roselli, a Mafioso who recruited his two mob bosses, Sam Giancana from          Chicago and Santo Traficante from New Orleans. The advantage to employing          the Mafia for this sensitive mission, aside from the mob's contacts in          the Cuban underworld, was providing the CIA with credible cover. If the          assassins were killed or captured, it would seem plausible to the public          that the Mafia had ordered the "hit" because Castro had taken away its          brothels, casinos, and other enterprises in Havana. In return, by cooperating          with the CIA, the three Mafiosi got protection against FBI investigations          into their domestic criminal enterprises.
Rosselli proposed a simple plan: through its underworld          connections in Cuba, the Mafia would recruit a Cuban in Castro's entourage,          such as a waiter or bodyguard, who would poison Castro. The CIA's Technical          Services Division, informally known as its "workshop," was given the job          of producing and testing on monkeys an untraceable poison. It came up          with a botulinus toxin that the CIA's Office of Medical Services then          injected into Castro's favorite brand cigars. It also produced simpler          botulinus toxin pills that could be dissolved in his food or drink. But          the deputized Mafia contacts failed to deliver any of the poisons to Castro.          As Rosselli explained to the CIA, the first poisoner had been discharged          from Castro's employ before he could kill him, while a back-up agent got          "cold feet."
While the Mafia continued its unsuccessful machinations,          John F. Kennedy became President and, in April 1961, launched the Bay          of Pigs invasion, an attack on a swamp in Cuba by CIA-trained Cuban exiles          that ended in disaster. Furious at this humiliating failure, Kennedy summoned          Richard Bissell, the head of the CIA's covert operations, to the Cabinet          Room and chided him for "sitting on his ass and not doing anything about          getting rid of Castro and the Castro regime" (as Bissell recalled). Richard          Helms, who succeeded Bissell, also felt "white heat," as he put it, from          the Kennedys to get rid of Castro.
By then, the Kennedys had set up their own covert structure          for dealing with the Castro problem the Special Group Augmented, which          Attorney General Robert Kennedy and General Maxwell Taylor effectively          ran and which, in November 1961, launched a secret war against the Castro          regime, codenamed Operation Mongoose. Secretary of Defense Robert Strange          McNamara, who was not a formal member of this group but attended meetings,          later testified: "We were hysterical about Castro at about the time of          the Bay of Pigs and thereafter. And there was pressure from JFK and RFK          to do something about Castro." It was a "no holds barred" enterprise,          as Helms termed it, for which the Special Group Augmented assigned such          "planning tasks" as using biological and chemical warfare against Cuban          sugar workers; employing Cuban gangsters to kill Cuban police officials,          Soviet bloc technicians, and other targeted people; using agents to sabotage          mines; and, in what was called Operation Bounty, paying cash bonuses of          up to $100,000 for the murder or abduction of government officials.
It was in this heightened atmosphere that the Richard          Bissell turned to a super-secret, codenamed ZR/RIFLE, which was meant          to give the CIA to on-demand "executive action" capacity that could be          used against defectors and, as a "last resort," could be used to assassinate          foreign leaders. The head of this program was William "Two Gun" Harvey,          who had proved himself a dedicated hands-on cold warrior as the CIA station          chief in Berlin in 1960. For the Castro assignment, he was instructed          by Bissell to work through Rosselli, who was still believed to have underworld          agents inside Cuba, and finally put ZR/RIFLE to the test by killing Castro.
Harvey had a serious security problem, however, with          Rosselli's two associates, Maheu and Giancana. They had invited the unwanted          attention of the FBI by citing their CIA connection to block an unrelated          criminal investigation into a wiretap Giancana had planted in a girlfriend's          hotel room in Las Vegas. Through this intervention, J. Edgar Hoover learned          about their "dirty business" in Havana. Compromising this sensitive operation even further, Hoover also found out that another girlfriend of Giancana's          named Judith Campbell Exner was also a girlfriend of President Kennedy's          during this period. Hoover then briefed Attorney General Kennedy on the          Mafia-CIA liaison as well as the more personal liaison between Exner and          the President. And on April 10, 1962, Hoover wrote a memo for the files          that Kennedy told him that the CIA had briefed him that it had retained          Maheu to offer Giancana "$150,000 to hire some gunmen to go into Cuba          and to kill Castro." Although this maneuver by Hoover greatly vitiated          the possibility of total deniability for the Attorney General, it mentioned          only Maheu and Giancana, not Rosselli. So the plan could proceed.
As a first step, later that April, Harvey ordered Rosselli          to break off all contacts with Maheu and Giancana. Then he gave Rosselli          four new lethal pills which "would work anywhere and at any time with          anything." Rosselli, who was to use his putative Cuban agents to slip          a pill into Fidel Castro's beverage, volunteered that he would use the          others pill on Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, and Che Guevara, his revolutionary          colleague. He also asked Harvey for a cache of rifles, pistols, radios,          and explosives for a three-man Cuban team that he claimed was now preparing          to penetrate Castro's bodyguards. Harvey personally drove the cache in          a U-Haul truck to a parking lot in Miami, where it was picked up by Rosselli's          men. Despite this bravado, the ZR/RIFLE phase of the assassination plans          did not fare any better than the earlier plots. The pills again failed          to reach their target, and the weaponry disappeared.
That November, as part of the deal by Kennedy and Soviet          leader Nikita Khrushchev to remove the Soviet missiles that ended the          confrontation, which almost ignited a nuclear war with the Soviet Union,          Kennedy pledged not to invade or infiltrate Cuba, and Operation Mongoose          was nominally ended. There was also a change in nomenclature and personnel.          The name of the CIA unit responsible for covert actions against Cuba was          changed from JM WAVE to the Special Affairs Section, and Harvey was replaced          in early 1963 by Desmond Fitzsgerald. The mafia connection was also dispensed          with Harvey telling Rosseli the operation was over.
Desmond FitzGerald, a socially adept veteran of the          clandestine cold war, whose rugged good looks and name led many people          in Washington to mistakenly believe he was a distant relative of John          Fitzgerald Kennedy, ran things very differently from Harvey . He preferred          the technological ingenuity of CIA's workshop to underworld hitmen. After          it was established from Castro's psychological profile that he was avid          diver and sea shell collector, hehad the division build a booby-trapped          seashell that would explode if someone tried to remove it from the ocean          floor. The idea was to place it where Castro frequently swam underwater          in the hope that he would see it and attempt to bring it to the surface.          If so, he would be blown up, and it would appear he had been killed by          a derelict mine. It would leave no witnesses, and unlike hitmen, no assassin          that could be captured. And if he ignored it, nothing would be lost. The          workshop, however, decided that the construction of a lethal sea-shell          that would not explode accidentally or be lost was technically too difficult.          The CIA went back to the drawing board.
The next idea out of the workshop was a killer gift          for Castro a wet suit whose breathing apparatus was impregnated with tubercle          bacilli and other deadly germs. The concept was that the bacilli and other          evidence would be destroyed by the seawater, and the Cubans would not          be able to determine how Castro contracted tuberculosis. Again, this device          would leave no witnesses. The problem was to find a means of delivering          it. At the time, James Donovan, an American lawyer, was negotiating the          release of the Cuban exiles captured in the Bay of Pigs disaster. Castro          had apparently let Donovan know that he would like a wet suit. The CIA's          idea was that somehow Donovan, who was not privy to its machinations,          would give the contaminated suit to Castro. But before it could be delivered,          Donovan, acting on his own, coincidentally gave Castro a pristine wet          suit. The plan then had to be aborted.
All along, the Kennedy administration had been struggling          to find a means to get rid of Castro by one means or another, and even          though Kennedy had pledged to cease its attacks on Cuba to end the missile          crises, Robert Kennedy continued to press the CIA for tangible results.          Richard Helms testified that Robert Kennedy frequently bypassed the chain          of command and directly called FitzGerald (as he had previously called          Harbey). The pressure described by Helms was relentless. So when Major          Roland Cubela came to Brazil with a Cuban delegation and, on September          7, 1963, made contact with a CIA officer and volunteered to kill Fidel          Castro, it was an offer Fitzgerald was in no position to refuse.
Cubela was already known to the CIA. In late March          1961, when the planning for the Bay of Pigs invasion was moving into high          gear, he had approached the CIA and offered to defect, but little came          of that initial contact. The CIA knew he had the access for the mission.          He was a personal friend of Castro's and saw him in the privacy of his          office as well as at government functions. He also had experience as an          assassin. Before Castro came to power in 1959, Cubela had killed Batista's          chief of military intelligence, Blanco Rico, on behalf of Castro. To be          sure, the SAS' counterintelligence chief had concluded that Cubela was          "insecure." Nevertheless, Fitzsgerald decided the rewards outweighed the          risks.
Cubela had made an extraordinary request that the CIA          case officer in Brazil reported to FitzGerald. Cubela, now code-named          AM/LASH, wanted to meet personally with Attorney General Robert Kennedy          and be assured that the Kennedy Administration was behind the operation.          Such a meeting was out of the question, but FitzGerald, ever resourceful,          sought an alternative way of satisfying Cubela's demand. With the approval          of his superiors in the CIA chain of command, he arranged to meet personally          with Cubela and claim to be acting as a special emissary for Robert Kennedy.
The contact plan for the meeting stated: "FitzGerald          will represent himself as personal representative of Robert F. Kennedy          who traveled to [Paris] for specific purpose of meeting AM/LASH and giving          him assurances of full support with the change of the present government."          Although FitzGerald would not use his real name, he was physically recognizable          from press photographs and identifiable as a social friend of the Kennedys.          Top-ranking executives of the CIA usually did not meet operatives themselves          that was the function of case officers but in this situation, FitzGerald          made an exception. Their first meeting took place on October 29th 1963.          FitzGerald explained he had been sent by Robert Kennedy. To further convince          the assassin of his bona fides, FitzGerald wrote a "signal" into a Presidential          speech, a phrase that described the Castro regime as a "small band of          conspirators" that needed to be "removed" which would serve as an unambiguous          alert to Cubela when President Kennedy himself delivered those very words,          which he did in Miami on November 18th. The next meeting, where FitzGerald          would deliver a weapon, was scheduled in Paris.
That meeting took place in a hotel room in Paris in          the late afternoon of November 22nd. FitzGerald arrived with Cubela's          case officer. He handed over the ingeniously crafted poison pen to Cubela          and explained that the longer-range weapon, the rifle with telescopic          sights, was en route to Cuba. It was only at the end of that star-crossed          rendezvous that FitzGerald learned that his commander-in-chief, and friend,          had been gunned down in Dallas by another assassin using a rifle with          telescopic sights. So ended the thousand days of the Kennedy Administration,          and, with Lyndon Johnson's succession, so ended the CIA's assassination          attempts against Castro, all of which turned out to be ineffectual.
How much did Castro know about these plots at the time?          The interview in which Castro stated that he knew the American government          was attempting to murder Cuban leaders and suggested that, unless they          ceased, he would retaliate in kind, took place on September 7, 1963 only          hours after his long-time associate Cubela had received, in Brazil, confirmation          of the plots from the CIA's willingness to recruit him. Unless the timing          was a remarkable coincidence, Castro appears to have known about Cubela          supposedly secret liaison with the CIA. And if that was the case, he could          also have learned that the CIA was constructing sophisticated weapons          to poison him and shipping sniper's rifles to Cuba to shoot him. He could          also have known that the Kennedys were sufficiently involved to send a          personal representative to reassure the assassin a representative close          enough to President Kennedy to write a signal into his speech. Castro          would then himself have been delivering a message to the Kennedys with          the timing of his extraordinary interview on September 7th.
Cubela's motives entangling the CIA in yet another          assassination plot, and attempting to provoke Robert Kennedy to give his          personal seal of approval, remain murky. After the plans were called off,          Cubela returned to Havana rather than defecting to the U.S. The fact that          he was never prosecuted by the Cubans for attempting the assassination          he was proposing to the CIA, even though it became public knowledge, suggests          he may have been acting on behalf of Castro to determine the involvement          of the upper echelons of the American government or even to gain evidence          in the form of traceable weapons made in the CIA's work shop. In 1966,          Cubela was convicted for post-1964 subversion in Cuba, but unlike more          than 500 other Cuban officials who were executed for similar crimes, he          was granted clemency when Castro personally intervened on his behalf.          After a prison sentence, he was allowed to resettle in Spain in 1977,          where he has lived ever since.
