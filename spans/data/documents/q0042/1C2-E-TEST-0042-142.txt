After the Missiles of October: John F. Kennedy and Cuba, November 1962 to November 1963.
In analyzing U.S. relations with Cuba during the Kennedy administration, scholars have understandably focused on dramatic events and policies--the Bay of Pigs invasion Bay of Pigs Invasion, 1961, an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles, supported by the U.S. government. On Apr. 17, 1961, an armed force of about 1,500 Cuban exiles landed in the Bahía de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) on the south coast of Cuba. , the U.S. campaign of terrorism and sabotage known as Operation Mongoose Military history records at least four operations named Operation Mongoose:

Less attention has been given to the state of U.S.-Cuban relations in the aftermath of the missile crisis and during the last year of President John E Kennedy's life. Scholars have assumed, however, that Kennedy was in the process of reevaluating his hostile policies toward Cuba and indeed his entire cold war stance. In his seminal essay, "The Education of John F.

But the frightening missile crisis had been a turning point.

The Church Committee discovered, however, that the assassination plots continued after the missile crisis.

 of the CIA's Directorate of Plans had assured Cubela that the CIA operated with the approval of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The Church Committee further disclosed that on June 19, 1963, President Kennedy approved a sabotage program against Cuba. The CIA was subsequently authorized to carry out thirteen major sabotage operations in Cuba, including attacks on an electric power plant, an oil refinery, and a sugar mill (U.S. Congress 1975, 170-80; Thomas 1995,297-309).

But Schlesinger, who deplored Robert Kennedy's role in Operation Mongoose, conceded that when it came to Cuba, the attorney general was "ever the activist," constantly exclaiming that the administration "must do something about Castro" (p. 543).

He further opined that, as Roman Catholics, John and Robert Kennedy could not "conceivably countenance a program of assassination" (p. 498). According to Schlesinger, President Kennedy pursued a dual-track policy toward Castro of ideological antagonism and accommodation. Whether Schlesinger understood that the attorney general was scheduled to meet with a cadre of Cuban coup plotters on November 22, 1963, cannot be ascertained from his biography (Weiner 1997; Steel 2000, 92-94).
Paterson (1989) tried to make sense of this conflicting evidence in his essay "Fixation with Cuba." Paterson had available to him the published record and additional documents that he had obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Paterson essentially accepted Schlesinger's dual-track thesis that Kennedy "showed some interest in accommodation at the same time he reinvigorated anti-Cuban programs" (p. 152). But Paterson displayed uncertainty about what "dual-track" policy meant. Speaking through the Cubans, Paterson noted that Kennedy played a "double game"; in Castro's words: "How can you figure him out?" (p. 152). Paterson ended his essay with a series of questions, wondering whether Kennedy truly wanted to improve relations with Cuba. He would have to abandon his "intense, sometimes personal, three-year war against Castro" and accept "the legitimacy of a radical revolution in the U.S. sphere of influence" (p. 154). Paterson concluded that "it does not seem likely" that Kennedy would have normalized relations with Cuba in the post-1963 period.
Two influential studies published in the late 1990s have also offered commentary on the Cuban policies of President Kennedy. In The Kennedy Tapes, May and Zelikow (1997) included an extensive analysis of Kennedy's policies in their compilation of the audio transcripts of the administration's secretly recorded deliberations during the missile crisis. The editors resurrected the popular "finest hour" thesis. The tapes demonstrated that a cool, careful president dominated the meetings of October 1962 and that the nation was "fortunate" that Kennedy was the person "charged with managing the crisis" (p. 696). As for the aftermath, May and Zelikow depicted Kennedy's subsequent anti-Castro policies as "petty harassment" (p. 665), calculated neither to bring down Castro nor to drag the United States into an open or direct intervention in Cuba. In their fascinating study "One Hell of a Gamble," Fursenko and Naftali (1997) informed their survey of the missile crisis with some documents from the archives of the former Soviet Union. The authors partially accepted the Paterson argument that the "Cuban missile crisis did not reconcile John Kennedy to living forever with Fidel Castro" (p. 319). But they essentially agreed with Divine, holding that Kennedy focused on improving the strategic relationship with the Soviet Union and achieving the limited test ban treaty. In particular, Fursenko and Naftali noted that Robert Kennedy contacted the Soviet Union in May 1963 through a "back channel" communication and ensured it that the United States "did not plan any intervention into Cuba now" (p. 319). But under the weight of new documentary evidence A type of written proof that is offered at a trial to establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact that is in dispute.

Reviewing the new documents on the missile crisis and its aftermath released by the Historical Office of the Department of State, Naftali concluded that the "Cuban missile crisis did not weaken the president's resolve to eliminate his Castro problem before the 1964 election" (pp. 1159-60).

The new documentary evidence on U.S.-Cuban relations sustains Paterson's pessimistic judgment about the future of U.S.-Cuban relations as they stood in late November 1963. In fact, the evidence demonstrates that the Kennedy administration pursued an aggressive, belligerent policy toward Cuba in the year after the missile crisis.
The U.S. approach to Cuba derived from the way the Kennedy administration interpreted its pledge to the Soviet Union not to invade Cuba in the aftermath of the missile crisis. In his letter to Soviet chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev on October 27, 1962, Kennedy directly and concisely offered a noninvasion pledge for the removal of missiles from Cuba.(2) But that pledge was never guaranteed by a formal document in the United Nations. In early November, Kennedy and his advisers, such as Under Secretary of State George W. Ball and CIA director John A. McCone, curtly dismissed a proposal by UN Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson This article is about Grover Cleveland's Vice-President. For the 1952 and 1956 Democratic Presidential candidate, see Adlai Stevenson II. For the U.S. Senator from Illinois during the 1970s, see Adlai Stevenson III.  to seek a comprehensive settlement in which the UN Security Council would guarantee the noninvasion pledge and the removal of offensive weapons systems from Cuba and in which all sides would give reciprocal guarantees to refrain from subversion and sabotage. In Ball's words, Stevenson's proposal would leave Castro in a "good position," with a "guarantee with no obligations."(3)
After October 27, the Kennedy administration always conditioned its noninvasion pledge with the provisos that Cuba must cease being a source of Communist aggression, that the United States reserved the right to halt subversion from Cuba, and that the United States intended "that the Cuban people shall some day be truly free."(4) But because it judged that Cuba would never conform to Verb 1. conform to - satisfy a condition or restriction; "Does this paper meet the requirements for the degree?"

At his news conference on November 20, 1962, announcing the lifting of the naval quarantine of Cuba, Kennedy declined to give an unequivocal public pledge not to invade the island. As Kennedy privately told the National Security Council ( NSC NSC

Our objective is to preserve our right to invade Cuba in the event of a    civil war, if there were guerrilla activities in other Latin American    countries or if offensive weapons were introduced into Cuba. We do not want    to build up Castro by means of a non-invasion pledge.(5)
Kennedy would later remark that he would rather have "Soviet units in Cuba than to give a formal no-invasion assurance."(6) He further asserted that he would not "rat" on his agreement with the Soviets, "but we were not going to tie on to a non-invasion pledge in a way which allowed Castro to operate from an invulnerable in·vul·ner·a·ble

The resolution would, in Ball's words, permit the administration "to do pretty much what we please," for the president and his advisers understood that the United States could count on persuading two- thirds of the members of the Organization of American States Organization of American States (OAS), international organization, created Apr. 30, 1948, at Bogotá, Colombia, by agreement of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti,  ( OAS OAS

Kennedy made manifest his policy on Cuba in a combative, three-hour meeting with Soviet leader Anastas Mikoyan Anastas Hovhannesi Mikoyan (Armenian Անաստաս Հովհաննեսի Միկոյան; (November 25 O.S.  on November 29, 1962. Kennedy repeatedly assured Mikoyan that it was not the intention of the United States to invade Cuba. Kennedy observed that he did not live in "the early days of the twentieth century" and that an invasion was "not a solution to the Cuba problem." But Kennedy would not give the Soviet Union an unconditional pledge. The Soviet Union, Kennedy instructed, should be satisfied that
the most important thing has been achieved: the Soviet Union knows that the    United States does not intend to invade Cuba and the United States knows    that the Soviets have removed missiles from Cuba. This is the gist of the    agreement between the two Heads of State.
The president added that he would not sign any agreements with Castro. Cuba remained "a springboard for subversion." Cuba might even become a site for an arms buildup by Chinese Communists. First Deputy Mikoyan constantly retorted that U.S. conditions gave "the United States the right to judge the actions of another government and in fact to invade Cuba as it pleases." The Soviets had adhered to the October 27 agreement, whereas the United States added conditions. Mikoyan found the U.S. draft proposal "insulting to Castro." Mikoyan supported Castro's demand that the "agreement cut both ways," for Cuba was subjected to subversion by counterrevolutionaries based in U.S. ports, especially Miami. Kennedy denied that the United States or any other nation in the Western Hemisphere trained Cubans for military action against Cuba.(9) The meeting broke up without agreement. There would be no formal U.S.-Soviet understanding to end the Cuban missile crisis.(10)
Hours before sitting down with Mikoyan, Kennedy ordered the Department of State "to prepare a plan which would keep the heat on Castro and bolster other regimes in the Caribbean." Department officers replied that they would act as soon as Mikoyan left New York New York, state, United States

By early December, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy McGeorge "Mac" Bundy (March 30, 1919–September 16, 1996) was United States National Security Advisor to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson from 1961–1966, and was president of the Ford Foundation from 1966–1979.  circulated a memorandum that contained an overt program of diplomatic and economic opposition to Cuba and a covert one of extensive sabotage against Cuba. As Bundy explained, the immediate objective was to weaken the regime, but "our ultimate objective with respect to Cuba remains the overthrow of the Castro regime and its replacement by one sharing the aims of the Free World."(12) The Kennedy administration was giving substance to the president's unscripted un·script·ed

Between December 1962 and May 1963, the administration plotted against Cuba on various fronts. On December 17, Kennedy asked what could be done about the rising price of sugar, which benefited Cuba. Studies by the Departments of State and Agriculture gloomily concluded, however, that global market conditions accounted for the increase to ten cents Ten Cents has several meanings:
Ten Cents, a worth of a dime
Ten Cents, a fictional character in TUGS
 per pound and that the United States could not unilaterally set world market prices for sugar.(14) Kennedy also urged his national security team to prepare for an invasion of Cuba, asking "are we keeping our Cuban contingency invasion plans up to date?" Kennedy wanted to send troops to Cuba quickly in case of a general uprising, informing military officials that he wanted them to shorten the eighteen-day preparation period from alert to full-scale invasion.(15) He further speculated that "the time will probably come when we will have to act again on Cuba." In January, he suggested that the United States could use Cuba "the same way the Russians have used Berlin." Acting against Cuba might, Kennedy opined, "be a more satisfactory response than a nuclear response."(16) Kennedy continued to see the utility of using Cuba as a diplomatic hostage. In April, he told the NSC that "we might be in a position to act against Cuba if Khrushchev made no move to halt the deterioration in Laos." He called for raising "the pressure somewhat in Cuba," pointing out "that we could hardly continue to carry out a mild policy in Cuba at the time the Communists are carrying out an aggressive policy in Laos."(17)
The Kennedy administration did more than talk about Cuba during the first half of 1963. Exile groups, such as Alpha 66 and the Second Front of Escambray, staged hit-and-run raids on the island and on ships transporting goods to and from Cuba. The raiders purchased arms in the United States and launched their attacks from the Bahamas. The Kennedy administration publicly declared it could not stop these raids, although Attorney General Robert Kennedy privately admitted "we can slow down the raids if we wish and later stop them entirely if we so desire." Responding to Soviet complaints, the Kennedy administration instructed the exiles to cease attacking Soviet ships in the Caribbean.(18) But it supplemented the raids with new sabotage efforts, because, in the words of Desmond Fitzgerald of the CIA, "the president would like some noise level in our sabotage program for morale purposes."(19) On April 9, 1963, Kennedy personally approved the sabotage of cargoes on Cuban ships and the crippling of ships. He also authorized inciting Cubans to harass, attack, and sabotage Soviet military personnel in Cuba "provided every precaution is taken to prevent attribution."(20) Two days later, the CIA received permission from the administration's Cuban Coordinating Committee to attack a railway bridge, petroleum storage facilities, and a molasses molasses, sugar byproduct, the brownish liquid residue left after heat crystallization of sucrose (commercial sugar) in the process of refining. Molasses contains chiefly the uncrystallizable sugars as well as some remnant sucrose.  storage vessel. These new attacks would, in the committee's view, "meet the President's desire for some noise level and for some action in the immediate future."(21)
The Kennedy administration reinforced its covert attacks with economic warfare economic warfare
Use of economic measures by governments engaged in international conflict. These may include export and import controls, shipping controls, trade agreements with neutral nations, and so on. . As Secretary of State Dean Rusk David Dean Rusk (February 9, 1909 – December 20, 1994) was the United States Secretary of State from 1961 to 1969 under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the second-longest serving Secretary of State, behind Cordell Hull.  explained to the cabinet in early 1963, the administration intended "to tighten the noose around the Cuban economy," to isolate Cuba from the hemispheric community, and to make Cuba a "complete pariah." Rusk bragged that Cuba's trade with the Atlantic community The Atlantic Community is a German-American project to apply Web 2.0 ideas to transatlantic foreign policy strategy. Launched in April 2007 as a project of the Atlantic Initiative, the Atlantic Community aims to facilitate discussion between young thinkers and established members  had dropped by one-third from 1961 to 1962. In January 1962, 128 "free-world" ships had docked in Cuban ports, whereas in January 1963 only 12 ships had docked. Rusk applauded the "economic chaos" that had ensued in Cuba. The Kennedy administration also subsequently began the process of ejecting Cuba from the International Monetary Fund.(22)
Despite these measures, the Kennedy administration remained frustrated about Cuba. In late April, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara For the figure skater, see .

McNamara served as U.S. Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968, during the Vietnam War.  told colleagues that "the elimination of Castro was a requirement," and that if present policies could not accomplish that objective, then new policies must be developed. The attorney general responded by proposing a study of a program with the objective of overthrowing Castro in eighteen months.(23) The administration's fury mounted when Castro spent the entire month of May in the Soviet Union, frequently meeting with Chairman Khrushchev (Fursenko and Naftali 1997, 329-35). Bundy confessed that he was coming to believe that the administration could not set a certain date for Castro's overthrow. McNamara brought up the idea, often suggested by Robert Kennedy, of staging an attack on Guantanamo, blaming Castro, and then exploiting the situation. NSC officers would subsequently inspect the military readiness of the Guantanamo garrison, speculating that Castro might retaliate against the increasing U.S. pressure.(24) The administration also launched studies on developments "if Castro were to disappear from the scene." Noting that the Cuban Revolution depended on Castro's elan, one CIA study observed that "the regime's remarkable dependence on his person points to a major vulnerability."(25)
Covert War
As the Church Committee revealed, the Kennedy administration intensified its war against Cuba from June 1963 onward. The CIA offered an integrated program of propaganda, economic denial, and sabotage against Cuba. The agency assumed that the United States did not currently intend to invade Cuba or provoke an invasion. The integrated program sought "to encourage dissident elements in the military and other power centers of the regime to bring about the eventual liquidation of the Castro/Communist entourage."(26) On June 19, Kennedy, dubbed "Higher Authority" in CIA parlance, approved the program, expressing "a particular interest" in external sabotage operations.(27) NSC officers kept the president and the attorney general apprised of the details of U.S.-supported raids by Cuban exiles.(28)
Higher Authority conducted a major review of the program on November 12, 1963. McCone delivered an upbeat assessment. Cuba still belonged to Castro, and the Cuban strongman retained the loyalty of the military. But Castro's "grip was weakening," and the CIA was attempting to exploit dissension and dissidence dis·si·dence

The agency had identified forty-five potentially wavering military officers and was in direct contact with three "Heroes of the Revolution." McCone further claimed that the external attacks had helped stimulate 109 incidents of internal sabotage. He predicted that future external raids would have "an important bearing on the ultimate willingness of key military personnel to participate in a conspiracy." New targets would include major economic assets of Cuba such as large oil refineries This is a list of oil refineries. The Oil and Gas Journal also publishes a worldwide list of refineries annually in a country-by-country tabulation that includes for each refinery: location, crude oil daily processing capacity, and the size of each process unit in the refinery.  and electric power plants. The CIA also planned the underwater demolition The destruction or neutralization of underwater obstacles; this is normally accomplished by underwater demolition teams.  of docks and ships. Kennedy briefly inquired about the efficacy of the attacks and then authorized a continuation of the program. Higher Authority's aggressive sibling "commented that he believed the program had produced a worthwhile impact on Cuba during the past five months and that it was useful in the United States as an indication that something was being done."(29)
When, in September 1963, Soviet leader Khrushchev protested these attacks, Kennedy deflected the complaints, asserting that "it is not the United States, but the behavior of the Castro regime that is to blame for the difficulties in the Caribbean area.(30) The Cubans allegedly spread subversion and revolution throughout the hemisphere. Havana certainly exhorted Latin American revolutionaries, such as the Movement for the Revolutionary Left in Venezuela, and invited them to Cuba to study and train. But the United States had no hard evidence of direct Cuban support, in the form of arms or troops, of insurgent INSURGENT. One who is concerned in an insurrection.

U.S. intelligence analysts also understood that Khrushchev made clear to Castro in May 1963 that the Soviet Union would not support armed insurrection in Latin America.(31) And they were informed that Castro had repeatedly suggested, through a variety of intermediaries, that he was interested in a rapprochement with the United States.(32) As such, the Kennedy administration needed evidence to justify its continuing war against Cuba.
That evidence surfaced on a Venezuelan beach in early November 1963, when Venezuela announced that it had discovered a cache,, of Cuban arms, allegedly left for insurgents Insurgents, in U.S. history, the Republican Senators and Representatives who in 1909–10 rose against the Republican standpatters controlling Congress, to oppose the Payne-Aldrich tariff and the dictatorial power of House speaker Joseph G.

In February 1963, after meeting with President Romulo Betancourt, Kennedy wrote to McCone that "it is obvious that the Communists in Venezuela support Castro. Do we have any information that could be presented in a public forum, such as the OAS, that would indicate that the link between anti-Betancourt terrorists and Castro is direct?" (Rabe 1996, 76). And on November 12, at a meeting with Higher Authority, it was agreed that the CIA, in conjunction with the Department of Defense, "should concentrate on attempting to catch Castro red-handed delivering arms to Communist groups in Latin American countries List of American countries

According to Richard Helms Richard McGarrah Helms (March 30, 1913 – October 23, 2002) was the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from 1966 to 1973. He was the only director to have been convicted of lying to Congress over Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) undercover activities. , a pleased Kennedy said, "Great work. Be sure to have complete information for me when I get back from my trip [to Dallas]. I think maybe we've got him now" (Beschloss 1991, 666-67).
The Cuban intervention in Venezuela surprised intelligence analysts in Washington, for Castro had not previously exported arms, although they also noted that Castro reportedly stated "he would like very much to get rid of `Betancourt and company." Betancourt had called for the overthrow of Castro and discussed the assassination of Castro with U.S. officials (Rabe 1999b, 104-8). In fact, some have subsequently questioned the validity of the discovery. Joseph Burkholder Smith (1976, 381-84), who had once served as the CIA chief of station in Caracas, implied that CIA operatives, responding to presidential pressure, engaged in a form of " black propaganda Propaganda that purports to emanate from a source other than the true one. See also propaganda. " and planted the arms. Philip Agee (1975, 322, 364-65), a former CIA operative who had turned against the agency, also recalled that he immediately suspected that the Caracas station, working with Venezuelan agents, planted the arms (see also Beschloss 1991, 692). Perhaps unknown to them, some substance underlay their suspicions. In May 1963, the CIA submitted a paper to the NSC on additional actions against Cuba. One proposal called for a "deception operation involving the laying down of arms caches containing Soviet, Czech and Chicom arms in selected areas of Latin America, ostensibly os·ten·si·ble

Kennedy's last public word on Cuba came on November 18 in a speech in Miami.(36) Schlesinger (1978, 554) suggested that Kennedy gave a conciliatory con·cil·i·ate

Hersh (1997, 440), citing interviews he had with lawyers on the Church Committee, noted that the CIA inserted in the speech a reference to Castro as a "barrier" to be removed. CIA operatives claimed that the reference was a signal of encouragement to AM/LASH. Schlesinger denied any CIA contribution to the speech. The documentary record supports Hersh's assertion. On December 19, 1963, Bundy informed Johnson that the Kennedy speech "was designed to encourage anti-Castro elements within Cuba to revolt," especially in the armed forces.(37) In the speech, Kennedy also resurrected the Roosevelt Corollary The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine was a substantial alteration (called an "amendment") of the Monroe Doctrine by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. Roosevelt's extension of the Monroe Doctrine asserted the right of the United States to intervene to stabilize  to the Monroe Doctrine Monroe Doctrine, principle of American foreign policy enunciated in President James Monroe's message to Congress, Dec. 2, 1823. It initially called for an end to European intervention in the Americas, but it was later extended to justify U.S. , now dubbed the " Kennedy Doctrine The Kennedy Doctrine refers to foreign policy initiatives of the 35th President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, towards Latin America during his term in office between 1961 and 1963. ." As part of its "international responsibility," the United States, Kennedy vowed, would intervene to prevent a second Cuba in the hemisphere (Rabe 1999b, 95-98).
As he intensified his war against Cuba, Kennedy indeed opened indirect lines of communication "Lines of Communication" is an episode from the fourth season of the science-fiction television series Babylon 5. Synopsis

But neither the Daniel nor the Attwood initiative can be characterized as a meaningful diplomatic effort. Daniel met with Kennedy in Washington on October 24, 1963, and then interviewed Castro on November 19 and November 22. Kennedy told Daniel that the United States primarily objected to Cuba's subversive activities in Latin America. Kennedy assured the journalist that the United States could coexist with "economic collectivism collectivism

Kennedy had previously made similar statements about the flexible nature of U.S. policies in conversations with Brazilian officials and Prime Minister Cheddi Jagan Cheddi Jagan, also known as Cheddi Berret Jagan (March 22, 1918 – March 6, 1997), was the chief minister (1957-1964) and president (1992-1997) of Guyana.

On November 5, Robert Kennedy set preconditions for negotiations, requiring "some fundamental steps such as the end of subversion in Latin America and removing Soviet troops in Cuba before any serious discussion can take place about a detente."(39) One week later, Bundy, speaking for the president, informed Attwood that the United States wanted Cuba to renounce its subversion in the hemisphere and its "submission to external Communist influence." But fulfilling these conditions "may or may not be sufficient to produce a change in the policy of the United States." Bundy emphasized that it should be made clear to Cuba "that we are not supplicants in this matter." Kennedy further denied Attwood permission to accept a Cuban invitation to travel to Cuba for discussions.(40) The Kennedy administration also showed no interest in Castro's repeated request that the United States cease its campaign of sabotage and terrorism against Cuba.(41)
Kennedy did not pursue a dual-track policy toward Cuba during the last thirteen months of his administration. The United States would entertain only proposals of surrender. At the minimum, the administration required that Castro sever his ties with the Soviet Union and renounce his commitment to revolution.

The Department of State warned that any approval of a Communist Cuba would strengthen Latin American Communists, threaten foreign investments, provoke a regional capital flight, and undermine the Alliance for Progress.(42) As Bundy once put it, it was fine to talk to Castro, but "things would have to get rougher for Castro before he would consider any deal with us which we could accept."(43) The Kennedy administration never renounced its policy of either overthrowing Castro or plotting his death.
