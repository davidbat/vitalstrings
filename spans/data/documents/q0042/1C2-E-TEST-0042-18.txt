If the Cuban Missile Crisis was the most                          dangerous passage of the Cold War, the most dangerous                          moment of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the evening of                          Saturday, 27 October 1962, when the resolution of the                          crisis—war or peace—appeared to hang in the balance. While                          Soviet ships had not attempted to break the U.S naval                          blockade of Cuba, Soviet nuclear missile bases remained                          on the island and were rapidly becoming operational, and                          pressure on President Kennedy to order an air strike or                          invasion was mounting, especially after an American l                          -2 reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba that Saturday                          afternoon and its pilot killed. Hopes that a satisfactory                          resolution to the crisis could be reached between Washington                          and Moscow had dimmed, moreover, when a letter from Soviet                          leader Nikita S. Khrushchev arrived Saturday morning demanding                          that the United States agree to remove its Jupiter missiles                          from Turkey in exchange for a Soviet removal of missiles                          from Cuba. The letter struck U.S. officials as an ominous                          hardening of the Soviet position from the previous day's                          letter from Khrushchev, which had omitted any mention                          of American missiles in Turkey but had instead implied                          that Washington's pledge not to invade Cuba would be sufficient                          to obviate the need for Soviet nuclear protection of Castro's                          revolution.
On Saturday evening, after a day of tense                          discussions within the "ExComm" or Executive Committee                          of senior advisers, President Kennedy decided on a dual                          strategy—a formal letter to Khrushchev accepting the implicit                          terms of his October 26 letter (a U.S. non-invasion pledge                          in exchange for the verifiable departure of Soviet nuclear                          missiles). coupled with private assurances to Khrushchev                          that the United States would speedily take out its missiles from Turkey, but only on the basis of a secret understanding,                          not as an open agreement that would appear to the public,                          and to NATO allies, as a concession to blackmail. The                          U.S. president elected to transmit this sensitive message                          through his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy,                          who met in his office at the Justice Department with Soviet                          ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.
That meeting has long been recognized as                          a turning point in the crisis, but several aspects of                          it have been shrouded in mystery and confusion. One concerned                          the issue of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey: U.S. officials                          maintained that neither John nor Robert Kennedy promised                          to withdraw the Jupiters as a quid pro quo, or concession,                          in exchange for the removal of the Soviet missiles from                          Cuba, or as part of an explicit agreement, deal, or pledge,                          but had merely informed Dobrynin that Kennedy had planned                          to take out the American missiles in any event. This was                          the version of events depicted in the first published                          account of the RFK-Dobrynin meeting by one of the participants,                          in Robert F. Kennedy's Thirteen Days: A Memoir at the                          Cuban Missile Crisis, posthumously published in 1969,                          a year after he was assassinated while seeking the Democratic                          nomination for president. While Thirteen Days depicted                          RFK as rejecting any firm agreement to withdraw the Jupiters,                          this was also the first public indication that the issue                          had even been privately discussed.
With Dobrynin obviously unable to publish                          his own version—he remained Moscow's ambassador in Washington                          until 1986, and Soviet diplomats were not in the habit                          of publishing tell-all exposés prior to glasnost—the                          first important Soviet account of the event to emerge                          was contained in the tape-recorded memoirs of deposed                          Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, which were smuggled to                          the West and published in 1970 (after Khrushchev's death,                          additional installments saw print in the West in 1974                          and 1990). The account of the RFK-Dobrynin meeting in Khrushchev Remembers, in the form of a paraphrase                          from memory of Dobrynin's report, did not directly touch                          upon the secret discussions concerning the Jupiters, but                          did raise eyebrows with its claim that Robert F. Kennedy                          had fretted to Dobrynin that if his brother did not approve                          an attack on Cuba soon, the American military might overthrow                          him and seize power." The second volume of Khrushchev's                          memoirs (Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament),                          published posthumously in 1974, touched only briefly on                          the Robert Kennedy-Dobrynin meeting, but included the                          flat statement (on p. 512) that "President Kennedy said                          that in exchange for the withdrawl of our missiles, he                          would remove American missiles from Turkey and Italy,"                          although he described this "pledge" as "symbolic" since                          the rockets "were already obsolete."
Over the years, many scholars of the Cuban                          Missile Crisis came strongly to suspect that Robert Kennedy                          had, in fact, relayed a pledge from his brother to take                          out the Jupiters from Turkey in exchange for the Soviet                          removal of nuclear missiles from Cuba, so long as Moscow                          kept the swap secret; yet senior former Kennedy Administration                          officials, such as then-National Security Advisor McGeorge                          Bundy and then-Secretary of State Dean Rusk, continued                          to insist that RFK had passed on no more than an informal                          assurance rather than an explicit promise or agreement.
The first authoritative admission on the                          U.S. side that the Jupiters had actually been part of                          a "deal" came at a conference in Moscow in January 1989,                          after glasnost had led Soviet (and then Cuban) former                          officials to participate in international scholarly efforts                          to reconstruct and assess the history of the crisis. At                          that meeting, former Kennedy speechwriter Theodore Sorensen                          (and the uncredited editor of Thirteen Days) admitted,                          after prodding from Dobrynin, that he had taken it upon                          himself to edit out a "very explicit" reference to the                          inclusion of the Jupiters in the final deal to settle                          the crisis.
Now Dobrynin's original, contemporaneous,                          and dramatic cable of the meeting, alluded to in some accounts by Soviets (such as Anatoly Gromyko, son of the                          late foreign minister) with special access, has been declassified                          and is available at the archives of the Russian Foreign                          Ministry. It is reprinted in translation below, along                          with relevant excerpts from the other publications mentioned                          above. The Dobrynin cable's first publication in English,                          a copy obtained by the Japanese television network NHK,                          came last year in an appendix to We AII Lost the Cold                          War, a study by Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Stein, whose                          commentary is also excerpted.

Robert F. Kennedy's (edited) Description
I telephoned Ambassador Dobrynin about 7:15                            P.M. and asked him to come to the Department of Justice.                            We met in my office at 7:45. I told him first that we                            knew that work was continuing on the missile bases in                            Cuba and that in the last few days it had been expedited.                            I said that in the last few hours we had learned that                            our reconnaissance planes flying over Cuba had been                            fired upon and that one of our U-2s had been shot down                            and the pilot killed. That for us was a most serious                            turn of events.
President Kennedy did not want a military                            conflict. He had done everything possible to avoid a                            military engagement with Cuba and with the Soviet Union,                            but now they had forced our hand. Because of the deception                            of the Soviet Union, our photographic reconnaissance                            planes would have to continue to fly over Cuba, and                            if the Cubans or Soviets shot at these planes, then                            we would have to shoot back. This would inevitably lead                            to further incidents and to escalation of the conflict,                            the implications of which were very grave indeed.
He said the Cubans resented the fact that                            we were violating Cuban air space. I replied that if                            we had not violated Cuban air space, we would still                            be believing what Khrushchev had said— that there would                            be no missiles placed in Cuba. In any case, I said,                            this matter was far more serious than the air space                            of Cuba—it involved the peoples of both of our countries                            and, in fact, people all over the globe.
The Soviet Union had secretly established                            missile bases in Cuba while at the same time proclaiming                            privately and publicly that this would never be done.                            We had to have a commitment by tomorrow that those bases                            would be removed. I was not giving them an ultimatum                            but a statement of fact. He should understand that if                            they did not remove those bases, we would remove them.                            President Kennedy had great respect for the Ambassador's                            country and the courage of its people. Perhaps his country                            might feel it necessary to take retaliatory action;                            but before that was over, there would be not only dead                            Americans but dead Russians as well.
He asked me what offer the United States                            was making, and I told him of the letter that President                            Kennedy had just transmitted to Khrushchev. He raised                            the question of our removing the missiles from Turkey.                            I said that there could be no quid pro quo or any arrangement                            made under this kind of threat or pressure and that                            in the last analysis this was a decision that would                            have to be made by NATO. However, I said, President                            Kennedy had been anxious to remove those missiles from                            Italy and Turkey for a long period of time. He had ordered                            their removal some time ago, and it was our judgment                            that, within a short time after this crisis was over,                            those missiles would be gone.
I said President Kennedy wished to have                            peaceful relations between our two countries. He wished                            to resolve the problems that confronted us in Europe                            and Southeast Asia. He wished to move forward on the                            control of nuclear weapons. However, we could make progress                            on these matters only when the crisis was behind us.                            Time was running out. We had only a few more hours—we                            needed an answer immediately from the Soviet Union.                            I said we must have it the next day.
I returned to the White House....

Khrushchev's Description
The climax came after five or six days, when                            our ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, reported                            that the President's brother, Robert Kennedy, had come                            to see him on an unofficial visit. Dobrynin's report                            went something like this:
"Robert Kennedy looked exhausted. One                            could see from his eyes that he had not slept for days.                            He himself said that he had not been home for six days                            and nights. 'The President is in a grave situation,'                            Robert Kennedy said, 'and does not know how to get out                            of it. We are under very severe stress. In fact we are                            under pressure from our military to use force against                            Cuba. Probably at this very moment the President is                            sitting down to write a message to Chairman Khrushchev.                            We want to ask you, Mr. Dobrynin, to pass President                            Kennedy's message to Chairman Khrushchev through unofficial                            channels. President Kennedy implores Chairman Khrushchev                            to accept his offer and to take into consideration the                            peculiarities of the American system. Even though the                            President himself is very much against starting a war                            over Cuba, an irreversible chain of events could occur                            against his will. That is why the President is appealing                            directly to Chairman Khrushchev for his help in liquidating                            this conflict. If the situation continues much longer,                            the President is not sure that the military will not                            overthrow him and seize power. The American army could                            get out of control."'

Sorensen's "Confession":
...the president [Kennedy] recognized that,                            for Chairman Khrushchev to withdraw the missiles from                            Cuba, it would be undoubtedly helpful to him if he could                            say at the same time to his colleagues on the Presidium,                            "And we have been assured that the missiles will be                            coming out of Turkey." And so, after the ExComm meeting                            [on the evening of 27 October 1962], as I'm sure almost                            all of you know, a small group met in President Kennedy's                            office, and he instructed Robert Kennedy—at the suggestion                            of Secretary of State [Dean] Rusk—to deliver the letter                            to Ambassador Dobrynin for referral to Chairman Khrushchev,                            but to add orally what was not in the letter: that the                            missiles would come out of Turkey.
Ambassador Dobrynin felt that Robert Kennedy's                            book did not adequately express that the "deal" on the                            Turkish missiles was part of the resolution of the crisis.                            And here I have a confession to make to my colleagues                            on the American side, as well as to others who are present.                            I was the editor of Robert Kennedy's book. It was, in                            fact, a diary of those thirteen days. And his diary                            was very explicit that this was part of the deal; but                            at that time it was still a secret even on the American                            side, except for the six of us who had been present                            at that meeting. So I took it upon myself to edit that                            out of his diaries, and that is why the Ambassador is                            somewhat justified in saying that the diaries are not                            as explicit as his conversation.

... Later [on Saturday], accepting a proposal                            from Dean Rusk, [John F.] Kennedy instructed his
brother to tell Ambassador Dobrynin that while there                            could be no bargain over the missiles that had been                            supplied to Turkey, the president himself was determined                            to have them removed and would attend to the matter                            once the present crisis was resolved—as long as no one                            in Moscow called that action part of a bargain. [p.                            406]
...The other part of the oral message                            [to Dobrynin] was proposed by Dean Rusk: that we should                            tell Khrushchev that while there could be no deal over                            the Turkish missiles, the president was determined to                            get them out and would do so once the Cuban crisis was                            resolved. The proposal was quickly supported by the                            rest of us [in addition to Bundy and Rusk, those present                            included President Kennedy, McNamara, RFK, George Ball,                            Roswell Gilpatrick, Llewellyn Thompson, and Theodore                            Sorensen]. Concerned as we all were by the cost of a                            public bargain struck under pressure at the apparent                            expense of the Turks, and aware as we were from the                            day's discussion that for some, even in our own closest                            councils, even this unilateral private assurance might                            appear to betray an ally, we agreed without hesitation                            that no one not in the room was to be informed of this                            additional message. Robert Kennedy was instructed to                            make it plain to Dobrynin that the same secrecy must                            be observed on the other side, and that any Soviet reference                            to our assurance would simply make it null and void.                            [pp. 432-441
.. There was no leak. As far as I know,                            none of the nine of us told anyone else what had happened.                            We denied in every forum that there was any deal, and                            in the narrowest sense what we said was usually true,                            as far as it went. When the orders were passed that                            the Jupiters must come out, we gave the plausible and                            accurate—if incomplete—explanation that the missile                            crisis had convinced the president once and for all                            that he did not want those missiles there....

Dean Rusk:
Even though Soviet ships had turned around,                            time was running out. We made this very clear to Khrushchev.                            Earlier in the week Bobby Kennedy told Ambassador Dobrynin                            that if the missile were not withdrawn immediately, the crisis would move into a different and dangerous                            military phase. In his book Khrushchev Remembers, Khrushchev                            states that Robert Kennedy told Dobrynin that the military                            might take over. Khrushchev either genuinely misunderstood                            or deliberately misused Bobby's statement. Obviously                            there was never any threat of a military takeover in                            this country. We wondered about Khrushchev's situation,                            even whether some Soviet general or member of the Politburo                            would put a pistol to Khrushchev's head and say, "Mr.                            Chairman, launch those missiles or we'll blow your head                            off!"
...In framing a response [to Khrushchev's                            second letter of Saturday, October 27], the president,                            Bundy, McNamara, Bobby Kennedy, and I met in the Oval                            Office, where after some discussion I suggested that                            since the Jupiters in Turkey were coming out in any                            event, we should inform the Russians of this so that                            this irrelevant question would not complicate the solution                            of the missile sites in Cuba. We agreed that Bobby should                            inform Ambassador Dobrynin orally. Shortly after we                            returned to our offices, I telephoned Bobby to underline                            that he should pass this along to Dobrynin only as information,                            not a public pledge. Bobby told me that he was then                            sitting with Dobrynin and had already talked with him.                            Bobby later told me that Dobrynin called this message "very important information."

Dobrynin's Cable to the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, 27 October 1962:
TOP SECRET Making Copies Prohibited Copy No.                            I
CIPHERED TELEGRAM
Late tonight R. Kennedy invited me to                            come see him. We talked alone.
The Cuban crisis, R. Kennedy began, continues                            to quickly worsen. We have just received a report that                            an unarmed American plane was shot down while carrying                            out a reconnaissance flight over Cuba. The military                            is demanding that the President arm such planes and                            respond to fire with fire. The USA government will have                            to do this.
I interrupted R. Kennedy and asked him,                            what right American planes had to fly over Cuba at all,                            crudely violating its sovereignty and accepted international                            norms? How would the USA have reacted if foreign planes                            appeared over its territory?
"We have a resolution of the Organization                            of American states that gives us the right to such overflights,"                            R. Kennedy quickly replied.
I told him that the Soviet Union, like                            all peace-loving countries, resolutely rejects such                            a "right" or, to be more exact, this kind of true lawlessness,                            when people who don't like the social-political situation                            in a country try to impose their will on it—a small                            state where the people themselves established and maintained                            [their system]. "The OAS resolution is a direct violation                            of the UN Charter," I added, "and you, as the Attorney                            General of the USA, the highest American legal entity,                            should certainly know that."
R. Kennedy said that he realized that                            we had different approaches to these problems and it                            was not likely that we could convince each other. But                            now the matter is not in these differences, since time                            is of the essence. "I want," R. Kennedy stressed, "to                            lay out the current alarming situation the way the president                            sees it. He wants N.S. Khrushchev to know this. This                            is the thrust of the situation now."
"Because of the plane that was shot down,                            there is now strong pressure on the president to give                            an order to respond with fire if fired upon when American                            reconnaissance planes are flying over Cuba. The USA                            can't stop these flights, because this is the only way                            we can quickly get information about the state of construction of the missile bases in Cuba, which we believe pose                            a very serious threat to our national security. But                            if we start to fire in response—a chain reaction will                            quickly start that will be very hard to stop. The same                            thing in regard to the essence of the issue of the missile                            bases in Cuba. The USA government is determined to get                            rid of those bases—up to. in the extreme case, of bombing                            them, since, I repeat, they pose a great threat to the                            security of the USA. But in response to the bombing                            of these bases, in the course of which Soviet specialists                            might suffer, the Soviet government will undoubtedly                            respond with the same against us, somewhere in Europe.                            A real war will begin, in which millions of Americans                            and Russians will die. We want to avoid that any way                            we can, I'm sure that the government of the USSR has                            the same wish. However, taking time to find a way out                            [of the situation] is very risky (here R. Kennedy mentioned                            as if in passing that there are many unreasonable heads                            among the generals, and not only among the generals,                            who are itching for a fight'). The situation might get                            out of control, with irreversible consequences."
"In this regard," R. Kennedy said,' the                            president considers that a suitable basis for regulating                            the entire Cuban conflict might be the letter N.S. Khrushchev                            sent on October.26 and the letter in response from the                            President. which was sent off today to N.S. Khrushchev                            through the US Embassy in Moscow. The most important                            thing for us,' R. Kennedy stressed, "is to get as soon                            as possible the agreement of the Soviet government to                            halt further work on the construction of the missile                            bases in Cuba and take measures under international                            control that would make it impossible to use these weapons.                            In exchange the government of the USA is ready, in addition                            to repealing all measures on the "quarantine," to give                            the assurances that there will not be any invasion of                            Cuba and that other countries of the Western Hemisphere                            are ready to give the same assurances—the US government                            is certain of this."
"And what about Turkey?" I asked R. Kennedy.
"If that is the only obstacle to achieving                            the regulation I mentioned earlier, then the president                            doesn't see any unsurmountable difficulties in resolving                            this issue," replied R. Kennedy. "The greatest difficulty                            for the president is the public discussion of the issue                            of Turkey. Formally the deployment of missile bases                            in Turkey was done by a special decision of the NATO                            Council. To announce now a unilateral decision by the                            president of the USA to withdraw missile bases from                            Turkey—this would damage the entire structure of NATO                            and the US position as the leader of NATO, where, as                            the Soviet government knows very well, there are many                            arguments. In short. if such a decision were announced                            now it would seriously tear apart NATO."
"However, President Kennedy is ready to                            come to agree on that question with N.S. Khrushchev,                            too. I think that in order to withdraw these bases from                            Turkey," R. Kennedy said, 'we need 4-5 months. This                            is the minimal amount of time necessary for the US government                            to do this, taking into account the procedures that                            exist within the NATO framework. On the whole Turkey                            issue," R. Kennedy added, "if Premier N.S. Khrushchev                            agrees with what I've said, we can continue to exchange                            opinions between him and the president, using him, R.                            Kennedy and the Soviet ambassador. ''However, the president                            can't say anything public in this regard about Turkey,"                            R. Kennedy said again. R. Kennedy then warned that his                            comments about Turkey are extremely confidential; besides                            him and his brother, only 2-3 people know about it in                            Washington.
"That's all that he asked me to pass on                            to N.S. Khrushchev," R. Kennedy said in conclusion.                            "The president also asked N.S. Khrushchev to give him                            an answer (through the Soviet ambassador and R. Kennedy)                            if possible within the next day (Sunday) on these thoughts                            in order to have a business-like, clear answer in principle. [He asked him] not to get into a wordy discussion, which                            might drag things out. The current serious situation,                            unfortunately, is such that there is very little time                            to resolve this whole issue. Unfortunately, events are                            developing too quickly. The request for a reply tomorrow,"                            stressed R. Kennedy, "is just that—a request, and not                            an ultimatum. The president hopes that the head of the                            Soviet government will understand him correctly."
I noted that it went without saying that                            the Soviet government would not accept any ultimatums                            and it was good that the American government realized                            that. I also reminded him of N.S. Khrushchev's appeal                            in his last letter to the president to demonstrate state                            wisdom in resolving this question. Then I told R. Kennedy                            that the president's thoughts would be brought to the                            attention of the head of the Soviet government. I also                            said that I would contact him as soon as there was a                            reply. In this regard, R. Kennedy gave me a number of                            a direct telephone line to the White House.
In the course of the conversation, R.                            Kennedy noted that he knew about the conversation that                            television commentator Scali had yesterday with an Embassy                            adviser on possible ways to regulate the Cuban conflict                            [one-and-a-half lines whited out]
I should say that during our meeting R. Kennedy was very upset; in any case, I've never seen                            him like this before. True, about twice he tried to                            return to the topic of "deception," (that he talked                            about so persistently during our previous meeting),                            but he did so in passing and without any edge to it.                            He didn't even try to get into fights on various subjects,                            as he usually does, and only persistently returned to                            one topic: time is of the essence and we shouldn't miss                            the chance.
After meeting with me he immediately went                            to see the president, with whom, as R. Kennedy said,                            he spends almost all his time now.

Lebow and Stein comment,
We All Lost the Cold War (excerpt):
The cable testifies to the concern of John                            and Robert Kennedy that military action would trigger                            runaway escalation. Robert Kennedy told Dobrynin of                            his government's determination to ensure the removal                            of the Soviet missiles in Cuba, and his belief that                            the Soviet Union "will undoubtedly respond with the                            same against us, somewhere in Europe." Such an admission                            seems illogical if the administration was using the                            threat of force to compel the Soviet Union to withdraw                            its missiles from Cuba. It significantly raised the                            expected cost to the United States of an attack against                            the missiles. thereby weakening the credibility of the                            American threat. To maintain or enhance that credibility,                            Kennedy would have had to discount the probability of                            Soviet retaliation to Dobrynin. That nobody in the government                            was certain of Khrushchev's response makes Kennedy's                            statement all the more remarkable.
It is possible that Dobrynin misquoted                            Robert Kennedy. However, the Soviet ambassador was a                            careful and responsible diplomat. At the very least,                            Kennedy suggested that he thought that Soviet retaliation                            was likely. Such an admission was still damaging to                            compellence. It seems likely that Kennedy was trying                            to establish the basis for a more cooperative approach                            to crisis resolution. His brother, he made clear, was                            under enormous pressure from a coterie of generals and                            civilian officials who were "itching for a fight." This                            also was a remarkable admission for the attorney general                            to make. The pressure on the president to attack Cuba,                            as Kennedy explained at the beginning of the meeting,                            had been greatly intensified by the destruction of an                            unarmed American reconnaissance plane. The president                            did not want to use force, in part because he recognized                            the terrible consequences of escalation, and was therefore                            requesting Soviet assistance to make it unnecessary.
This interpretation is supported by the                            president's willingness to remove the Jupiter missiles                            as a quid pro quo for the withdrawal of missiles in                            Cuba, and his brother's frank confession that the only                            obstacle to dismantling the Jupiters were political.                            "Public discussion" of a missile exchange would damage                            the United States' position in NATO. For this reason,                            Kennedy revealed, "besides himself and his brother,                            only 2-3 people know about it in Washington." Khrushchev                            would have to cooperate with the administration to keep                            the American concession a secret.
Most extraordinary of all is the apparent                            agreement between Dobrynin and Kennedy to treat Kennedy's                            de facto ultimatum as "a request, and not an ultimatum."                            This was a deliberate attempt to defuse as much as possible                            the hostility that Kennedy's request for an answer by                            the next day was likely to provoke in Moscow. So too                            was Dobrynin's next sentence: "I noted that it went                            without saying that the Soviet government would not                            accept any ultimatum and it was good that the American                            government realized that."
Prior meetings between Dobrynin and Kennedy                            had sometimes degenerated into shouting matches. On                            this occasion, Dobrynin indicates, the attorney general                            kept his emotions in check and took the ambassador into                            his confidence in an attempt to cooperate on the resolution                            of the crisis. This two-pronged strategy succeeded where                            compellence alone might have failed. It gave Khrushchev                            positive incentives to remove the Soviet missiles and                            reduced the emotional cost to him of the withdrawal.                            He responded as Kennedy and Dobrynin had hoped.
