INTRODUCTION
At midday, and                        again in the early evening of October 16, 1962, John F.                        Kennedy called together a group of his closest advisers                        at the White House. Late the night before, the CIA had produced                        detailed photo intelligence identifying Soviet nuclear missile                        installations under construction on the island of Cuba,                        some ninety miles off the Florida coast; now the president                        and his men confronted the dangerous decision of how the                        United States should respond.
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara outlined three possible courses of action for the president: "the                        political course of action" of openly approaching Castro,                        Khrushchev, and U.S. allies in a gambit to resolve the crisis                        diplomatically, an option that McNamara and others considered                        unlikely to succeed; "a course of action that would involve                        declaration of open surveillance" coupled with "a blockade                        against offensive weapons entering Cuba"; and "military                        action directed against Cuba, starting with an air attack                        against the missiles." Much of the conversation that day                        centered on the military option and the hazardous unknowns                        of Soviet retaliation, including the possibility of nuclear                        escalation. "I don't believe we have considered the                        consequences," McNamara told the president. "I don't know                        quite what kind of a world we live in after we've struck                        Cuba, and we, we've started it.... How, how do we stop at                        that point?" (1)
Thankfully, the Kennedy administration never                        had to answer that extraordinary question. Ultimately, President                        Kennedy chose to initiate a naval blockade against Soviet                        ships carrying missile equipment. His strategy proved successful;                        the Soviets withdrew the missiles end nuclear war was averted.
Three decades later, however, Soviets, Cubans,                        and Americans learned how close the world had come to a                        nuclear conflagration. At a unique conference held in Havana,                        Cuba, in January 1992—attended by former Kennedy administration                        members, Soviet participants in the crisis, and a Cuban                        delegation led by President Fidel Castro—Soviet General                        Anatoly Gribkov informed participants that, in addition                        to their intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the Soviets                        had deployed nine tactical missiles in Cuba to be used against                        any U.S. invasion force. Even more significant, General                        Gribkov stated that Soviet field commanders in Cuba had                        the authority to fire those tactical nuclear weapons without                        further direction from the Kremlin! (2)
What might have happened had the United States                        invaded Cuba, as some advisers had recommended to President                        Kennedy throughout the missile crisis? "We can predict the                        results with certainty," former secretary of defense McNamara                        answers in his Foreword to this book: "no one should believe                        that had United States troops been attacked with tactical                        nuclear warheads, the United States would have refrained                        from responding with nuclear warheads. And where would it                        have ended? In utter disaster."
LEARNING ABOUT THE MISSILE CRISIS
Thirty-six years after the respective actions                        of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Cuba brought                        the world to the brink of the unthinkable, new and important                        information about the Cuban missile crisis continues to                        emerge. No event during the Cold War has generated more                        popular and scholarly attention; indeed, with hundreds of articles, books, and essays already written on this episode,                        it has become perhaps the most studied international confrontation                        of the twentieth century. And so it should be, for the missile                        crisis represents the one time that world leaders and the                        international community stared down what Kennedy speechwriter                        Theodore Sorensen called "the gun barrel of nuclear war,"                        the death of history as we know it. Despite the end of the                        Cold War, the process of exploration and discovery remains                        necessary to understand more fully what caused this crisis                        and, more important, to learn how to avoid such potentially                        cataclysmic events in the future. "Having come so close                        to the edge," observes Kennedy's national security adviser,                        McGeorge Bundy, "we must make it our business not to pass                        this way again." (3)
Toward that goal, the National Security Archive                        began a concerted campaign in 1987 to advance the historical                        record on the missile crisis. The objective was to build                        a major collection of declassified U.S. government documents,                        through the systematic use of the Freedom of Information                        Act (FOIA), and to make them available to scholars, students,                        journalists, and concerned citizens in order to enhance                        the public discussion over what actually happened in 1962                        and why. In the early 1970s, many key internal documents                        had been made public at the John F. Kennedy Presidential                        Library. But thousands of other secret documents remained beyond the access of the public at large. Despite the passage                        of time, the U.S. government refused to declassify these                        documents, citing reasons of national security.
In the aftermath of the missile crisis, the                        papers from all the national security agencies involved                        were scattered throughout the executive branch. Some important                        records, for example, were found in a shopping cart in the                        basement of the State Department. Other documents, however,                        were gathered together and centralized. Researchers at the                        National Security Archive discovered, through interviews                        with former U.S. officials, that in 1965 the Johnson administration                        had retrieved some seventy-five files from various agencies                        and stored them in Room 7512 on the seventh floor of the                        State Department. This mini-archive of approximately three                        thousand records, totaling ten thousand pages in all, included                        contingency plans, military scenarios, minutes of Kennedy's                        Executive Committee, intelligence reports, analyses, chronologies,                        cables, and a wide variety of other highly sensitive State                        Department, Defense Department, National Security Council,                        and Central Intelligence Agency documents on the missile                        crisis.
In April 1987, the National Security Archive                        filed a series of FOIA requests for these files. (4) When the State Department proved unresponsive, the Archive                        filed a FOIA lawsuit nine months later seeking to compel the release of all requested documents. Pursuant to that                        suit, by mid 1989 the State Department had declassified                        two thousand documents in full or in part. These documents,                        supplemented by hundreds of additional declassified records                        obtained through other FOIA requests by Archive analysts                        and other scholars of the missile crisis, or from presidential                        and military libraries, were published in the National Security                        Archive's microfiche documents collection, The Cuban                        Missile Crisis, 1962: The Making of U. S. Policy. Since                        the publication of that collection in 1990, the Archive                        has continued to pursue and obtain the declassification                        of hundreds of important State, Defense, CIA, and NSC documents                        relating to the Cuban missile crisis.
REVISING THE HISTORY OF THE CRISIS
The availability of previously classified                        material has enabled scholars both to challenge the conventional                        wisdom and to revise long-standing historical interpretations                        of the events that took place before, during, and after                        October 1962. Despite the wealth of books and articles published                        on this subject, until only a few years ago the historiography                        of the crisis was built around the memoirs of former Kennedy                        administration officials, in particular Robert Kennedy's Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis.                        Similarly, scholarly works on the crisis were dominated                        by Graham Allison's seminal book, Essence of Decision,                        which drew heavily on the official memoirs to cast the episode                        as the "classic" model of crisis management.
The declassified U.S. records have allowed                        scholars to highlight the inevitable distortions, limitations,                        and inaccuracies in the narratives of former Kennedy administration                        officials, and to augment and supplement these officials'                        memories. The most striking example of this dynamic occurred                        between 1987 and 1992, during a series of retrospective                        conferences sponsored by Harvard and Brown universities                        and organized by professor James G. Blight, which brought                        together former policymakers and scholars from the United                        States, the Soviet Union, and Cuba to reconstruct the perilous                        events of 1962 and to reevaluate why they happened. (5) Applying a research technique that he calls "critical oral                        history," Blight used the documents to supply facts and                        details that the former policymakers had distorted or forgotten                        while the participants supplied the missing context of the                        documents. (6) The result was a new body                        of information that provides a much fuller picture of events                        and fundamentally alters how the scope and meaning of the                        missile crisis has been and will be considered.
The very definition of the missile crisis                        has changed. Rather than a sudden episode, the crisis now                        emerges as the culmination of deteriorating relations between                        the United States and the Soviet Union, and between the                        United States and Cuba. Moreover, no longer can the confrontation                        be understood as confined to Robert Kennedy's "thirteen                        days," beginning with the discovery of Soviet missiles in                        Cuba on October 16 and ending with Khrushchev's decision                        to withdraw the missiles on October 28. A series of letters                        between Kennedy and Khrushchev, declassified and released                        to the National Security Archive in January 1992, demonstrates                        that the crisis lasted through late November of 1962, at                        the very least.
New revelations about the missile crisis have                        also undermined its image as a paradigm of successful crisis                        management. For years Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.'s description                        of President Kennedy's decision-making as "so brilliantly                        controlled, so matchlessly calibrated" reflected a mythology                        that the successful outcome of the missile crisis derived                        from Kennedy's masterful management of both the making and                        implementation of U.S. policy. (7) In reality,                        as Robert McNamara notes, the decision-making process in                        Washington, as well as in Moscow and Havana, was characterized                        by "misinformation, miscalculation, and misjudgment." Despite                        management efforts, according to Theodore Sorensen, the                        crisis "came close to spinning out of control before it                        was ended." (8)
For example, during the crisis, U.S. officials                        mistook a number of Soviet political and military actions as deliberate "signals" from the Kremlin when, in fact,                        they had not been cleared by Khrushchev. Unbeknownst to                        the White House, officials of the CIA and the U.S. military                        undertook, in the midst of tense negotiations, a number                        of threatening operations— among them the dispatch of covert                        sabotage teams into Cuba—which were similarly misunderstood                        by the Soviets and Cubans. There were also dangerous accidents,                        such as the straying of a U.S. aircraft into Soviet airspace                        at the height of the crisis. This combination of unauthorized                        military and covert actions, misinterpreted military and                        political signals, and significant failures in intelligence—all                        of which threatened to set a war in motion—not only challenges                        earlier depictions of this event as a model of a "controlled                        crisis" but calls into question the fundamental assumption                        that severe international crises can, in fact, be "managed"                        at all.
The new documentation, combined with recent                        testimony by Soviet and Cuban officials, also sheds light                        on what is perhaps the most important puzzle of the missile                        crisis, namely, what motivated the Soviets to deploy nuclear                        weapons in Cuba. The declassified record shows that U.S.                        officials were well aware that their deployment of Jupiter                        missiles near Soviet borders in Turkey and Italy in 1959                        would be deeply resented by Soviet officials; even President                        Eisenhower noted that it would be a "provocative" step analogous to the deployment of Soviet missiles in "Mexico or Cuba. (9) A declassified military history of the Jupiter system reveals                        that the rockets became operational in April 1962—an event                        that may have contributed to Khrushchev's proposal, made                        the very same month, to deploy similar weapons in Cuba. (10)
In addition, the documents lend credence to                        Khrushchev's claim that a primary Soviet motivation was                        the defense of Cuba against a U.S. invasion. For years,                        U.S. analysts have dismissed this as a face-saving, after-the-fact                        rationale that enabled the Soviets to declare victory in                        the confrontation rather than admit defeat. But formerly                        top-secret documents, released to the National Security                        Archive in January 1989, provide a detailed description                        of a 1962 U.S. covert action program known as OPERATION                        MONGOOSE, which combined sabotage, infiltration, and psychological                        warfare activities with military exercises and contingency                        operations for a possible invasion to overthrow the Castro                        government. Guidelines for OPERATION MONGOOSE, tacitly approved                        by President Kennedy in March 1962, noted that the "final                        success" of the program would "require decisive U.S. military                        intervention." Although Kennedy never formally authorized                        an invasion, former administration officials acknowledge                        that Cuban intelligence had infiltrated the CIA's exile                        groups and learned of plans for a potential invasion—which,                        ironically, was scheduled for October 1962.
If the new documents illuminate how the crisis                        began, they also clarify how it ended. For years, conservative                        analysts have alleged that, in return for the Soviet withdrawal                        of the missiles, Kennedy made a secret deal with Khrushchev                        not to invade Cuba. The recently declassified Kennedy-Khrushchev                        correspondence published here, reveals that no such U.S.                        commitment was made. Khrushchev repeatedly urged Kennedy                        to "formalize through the U.N." a noninvasion pledge to                        end the crisis. The letters show Kennedy repeatedly refused,                        citing the Soviets' inability to meet U.S. inspection and                        verification demands. Highly classified State Department                        memoranda, released in April 1992 to the National Security                        Archive, reveal the Kennedy administration's internal arguments                        against finalizing an agreement on the crisis: a settlement                        would limit the United States in its ongoing efforts to                        overthrow Fidel Castro. In the end, U.S. officials preferred                        free rein to intervene in Cuba over an international accord                        that would settle the Cuban missile crisis.
USING THIS DOCUMENTS READER
This book is an effort to tell the story of                        the Cuban missile crisis through a selection from the many                        documents that were generated by these extraordinary events.                        Not every interested person has the time or resources to                        sift through the vast quantity of secondary and primary                        materials available; this book is designed, then, to provide                        access to some of the most important declassified documentation,                        thereby permitting the broader public to explore, understand,                        and discuss this critical episode. Those who want to study                        the crisis further are urged to consult the comprehensive                        bibliography included in this volume, and to make use of                        the National Security Archive's holdings of over four thousand                        documents, totaling some eighteen thousand pages.
The records in this documents reader are drawn                        from the Archive's indexed microfiche collection, The Cuban                        Missile Crisis, 1962: The Making of U. S. Policy, and from                        hundreds of other documents subsequently obtained through                        the Freedom of Information Act. Most of these documents                        are original photoreproductions; a few have been transcribed—for                        example, Khrushchev's letters to Kennedy—for reasons of                        legibility or length. Almost all of the selected documents                        were once highly classified internal U.S. government records;                        however, important public communiqués or speeches                        have been included to render as complete an account of events                        as possible. Important documents generated by the Soviet                        and Cuban governments are also included.
The documents are divided into four sections,                        each of which is prefaced by a contextual introduction,                        in which the documents are cited by number. Generally, the                        records are organized chronologically, although in a few                        cases, materials on one specific aspect of the missile crisis                        have been gathered together for continuity. Those readers                        who prefer to start with a comprehensive overview of events                        are urged to read the chronology at the back of the book                        in order to place the individual documents in the broader                        context of events.
Admittedly, the documents reproduced here                        do not present a complete picture of the extraordinary events                        surrounding the missile crisis. For reasons of space limitations,                        we were forced to select records that, in our judgment,                        represented important aspects of the crisis, and in some                        cases to edit them for length. Even more important, the                        vast majority of these documents are U.S. government records                        that reflect only the view from Washington. The recent conferences                        in Moscow and Havana have contributed critically needed                        Soviet and Cuban information and perspectives to the history                        of the crisis. To date, though, few Soviet or Cuban documents                        have been released. Until these nations' archives are opened                        to the public, U.S., Soviet, and Cuban historians will be                        unable to present anything approximating a full account                        of the crisis, and books on the crisis will necessarily                        remain incomplete.
Public discourse on the Cuban missile crisis,                        however, need not wait, for there is more than enough accessible                        information to advance our collective education and sustain                        an ongoing discussion on how to prevent similar confrontations                        in the future. In his memoir, Thirteen Days, Robert                        Kennedy ascribed the successful outcome of the crisis to                        the ability of the president and his aides to discuss, consider,                        and reconsider the most prudent U.S. approach: "The fact                        that we were able to talk, debate, argue, disagree, and                        then debate some more was essential in choosing our ultimate                        course." (11) A broader public discussion                        of issues such as intervention, nuclear weapons, and the                        use of military power is similarly essential to chart the                        future foreign policy course of the nation. We hope this                        volume will contribute to just such a debate.
