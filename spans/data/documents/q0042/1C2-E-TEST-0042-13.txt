Summary
Seventeen years in the making-drawing on exclusive interviews with members of the Kennedy administration and of the Kennedy's Cuban inner circle among dozens of others, complementing the information mined from thousands of recently declassified files-Ultimate Sacrifice is a landmark in historical research, compilation, and reporting, meticuloously assembling all of the formely out-of-reach or concealed pieces, to explain for the first time, the full and detailed context which gave rise to the Kennedy assassination. In doing so, authors Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann not only shed new light on one of the most tumultuous eras in modern American history, but definitively solve the mystery of its greatest political tragedy.
