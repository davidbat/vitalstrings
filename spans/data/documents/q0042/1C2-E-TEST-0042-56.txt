JFK and the First Time UN Inspections            for Weapons of Mass Destruction Led to         Tragedy
An Excerpt             from "Ultimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a             Coup in Cuba, and the murder             of JFK" by Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann

As the war in Iraq continues, it's important to look at the first           time a President's problems with UN inspections for weapons of mass           destruction led to a tragic result. The President was John F. Kennedy,           but his story has taken decades to emerge, due to years of government           secrecy. The follow excerpt is Chapter 1 of Ultimate Sacrifice: John           and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the murder of           JFK, by Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann. Based on thousands of documents           declassified in recent years, and interviews with JFK associates such           as his Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the book shows that Castro's refusal           to allow the UN inspections led JFK to begin a "Plan for a Coup           in Cuba" that included a possible invasion by US military forces.           The decades of secrecy surrounding JFK's coup plan proves Santayana's           adage that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to         repeat it." -- Lamar Waldron

CHAPTER ONE: The Cuban Missile Crisis and         C-Day
ALTHOUGH THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS is largely remembered as a stunning           success for the United States, the little-known reality is that it           left President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert with a sense           of unfinished business and the need for a permanent solution to the           problem of Cuba. In fact, the Missile Crisis was never fully resolved,           because of Fidel Castro’s refusal to allow UN inspections for nuclear           weapons, to ensure that all the Soviet missiles had been removed. However,           decades of misinformation about JFK’s supposed pledge not to invade           Cuba to end the Crisis is so pervasive that it is important to finally           put it to rest. This chapter not only documents that JFK made no such           pledge, but shows how the failure to fully resolve the crisis led to         the creation of the C-Day coup plan the following year.
JFK’s Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, explained to us in 1990 that           JFK never agreed not to invade Cuba, the reason being that Castro refused           to allow UN weapons inspectors into Cuba in the fall of 1962.1 Those           inspections had been part of JFK’s deal with Russia’s Nikita Khrushchev           to end the tense nuclear standoff of the Cuban Missile Crisis. At the           time, we were surprised to hear this from Rusk, because almost every           history book or media report about the Cuban Missile Crisis cited JFK’s           so-called no-invasion pledge as a key reason for ending the Crisis.           However, we quickly found confirmation of what Rusk had told us.
A transcript of President Kennedy’s November 20, 1962 prime-time           TV news conference provided the first confirmation. That night, JFK           declared that he would “give assurances against an invasion of Cuba”           only when “adequate arrangements for [UN] verification had been established.”           JFK emphasized that “the Cuban Government has not yet permitted the           United Nations to verify whether all offensive weapons have been removed”           and that “serious problems remain.”2 (While researching           JFK’s comments, we also found that he had been the first president           to use the term           “weapons of mass destruction,” as well as the concept of “UN inspections”           for them, and he used both phrases during the Missile Crisis.3)
A year after we talked to Dean Rusk, presidential historian Michael           Bechloss discussed the supposed “no-invasion pledge” in his 1991 book, The           Crisis Years. Making use of the new documents about the Missile           Crisis that were being declassified, Bechloss was one of the first           major historians to question the existence of the pledge. He said JFK           “may have deliberately avoided such an unambiguous commitment,” and           that JFK “watered down the pledge” by adding conditions that “had the           effect of neutralizing” it. Bechloss concluded that JFK did not “rule           out further American efforts to topple the Castro regime, including           invasion.”4
More documents about the Missile Crisis and the so-called no-invasion           pledge continued to be declassified, and by 1992 it was clear that           the pledge had never gone into effect, as Rusk had said. The National           Security Archive, located at George Washington University and the world’s           largest nongovernmental library of declassified documents, was a           major force in getting the new files released.5 The Archive           published the documents in a massive volume called The Cuban Missile           Crisis,           1962 that included an analysis by historians Laurence Chang and           Peter Kornbluh.6
Chang and Kornbluh confirm that “for almost thirty years after the           Cuban Missile Crisis, the myth persisted that Kennedy had struck a           secret deal with Khrushchev binding the US to a commitment not to invade           Cuba. But the recent declassification of the remaining correspondence           between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and of internal State Department memoranda,           reveals that no such deal was ever made.” They explain that “President           Kennedy’s pledge not to invade Cuba . . . was conditioned on the implementation           of adequate inspection and verification procedures.” They quote JFK’s           letter to Khrushchev on October 27, 1962, in which JFK said that “upon           the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations           to ensure . . . these commitments . . . [the US would] give assurances           against an invasion of Cuba.” But as Chang and Kornbluh document, “Cuba           did not allow on-site inspection” to verify that all the Russian missiles           had been removed, so the pledge never took effect.”7
The National Security Archive historians present many pages of declassified           documents confirming what Dean Rusk told us in 1990. The documents           are especially interesting in light of the recent events in Iraq: The           actions of George W. Bush, Saddam Hussein, and UN Secretary General           Kofi Anan in the fall of 2002 regarding weapons of mass destruction           parallel very closely the actions—and even the words—of JFK, Fidel           Castro, and UN Secretary General U Thant in the fall of 1962.
The documents show that Dean Rusk was one of the US officials who           encouraged JFK not to make a firm no-invasion pledge in 1962, in order           to allow the US more flexibility in getting rid of Castro. As the book           states, “Internal State Department memoranda declassified in April           1992 reveal that US officials who saw the Missile Crisis as a great           opportunity to overthrow Castro lobbied hard against any pledge that           would inhibit future US policy toward Cuba.” A strategy paper from           Rusk’s State Department dated November 7, 1962 called for “maximal           US strategy . . . directed at the elimination . . . of the Castro           regime,” even as the Missile Crisis was winding down. Chang and Kornbluh           say that Rusk’s position was that “the latitude to overthrow Castro           . . . was more important than a concrete resolution to the most dangerous           international crisis of the twentieth century.” During the crisis,           Rusk wrote to JFK adviser John McCloy—appointed to the Warren Commission           a year later—saying “Our interest lies in . . . avoiding the kind of           commitment that unduly ties our hands in dealing with the Castro regime           while it lasts.”8
As the days passed in November 1962, neither JFK nor Khrushchev wanted           to return to the tense standoff of October, but neither man was able           to find a solution to the problem. JFK complained in a letter to Khrushchev           on November 15, 1962 that “There has been no United Nations verification           that other missiles were not left behind and, in fact, there have been           many reports of their being concealed in caves and elsewhere, and we           have no way of satisfying those who are concerned about these reports.”9
At his November 20, 1962 prime-time press conference, JFK was asked:           “Is it your position, sir, that you will issue a formal no-invasion           pledge only after satisfactory arrangements have been made for [UN]           verification?”10 After JFK made it clear that that was           indeed the case, he was asked by a reporter “If we [the US] wanted           to invade Cuba .           . . could we do so without the approval of the United Nations?” JFK           essentially said yes, replying that the US “has the means as a sovereign           power to defend itself . . . in a way consistent with our treaty           obligations, including the United Nations Charter.” JFK said that while           he hoped “to always move in concert with our allies,” he reserved the           right to act “on our own if that situation was necessary to protect           our survival or integrity or other vital interests.”11
But Khrushchev was unable to get Fidel Castro to allow the UN inspections.           A leading Cuban journalist at the time, Carlos Franqui, said that Castro           “could never accept the idea of an inspection of any kind           by any agency . . . because that would have finished him off” by making           him look weak.12 So, on November 21, 1962, JFK notified           Khrushchev that the Missile Crisis was over—but with the issues of           UN inspections           and a no-invasion pledge still unresolved. JFK wrote Khrushchev that           “I am now instructing our negotiators [at the UN] in New York to move           ahead promptly with proposals for a solution of the remaining elements           in the Cuban problem,” meaning the UN inspections in Cuba. JFK said:           “I regret that you have been unable to persuade Mr. Castro to accept           a suitable form of [UN] inspection or verification in Cuba . . . but,           as I said yesterday, there need be no fear of any invasion of Cuba           while matters take their present favorable course.” As The Cuban           Missile Crisis, 1962 notes, “in the end there was no formal resolution           of the Missile Crisis.”13
Since there never were any UN inspections in Cuba, JFK and his cabinet           made it clear, both in their private meetings and to a Congressional           committee, that there wasn’t a no-invasion pledge.14 As           Dean Rusk told us, without the UN inspections, the Cuban Missile Crisis           never           really ended. JFK and members of his administration felt that they           had to do something to make sure all the missiles were gone and wouldn’t           be reintroduced, since their efforts at the UN had proven fruitless.           By the spring of 1963, JFK and his key advisers were looking at new           ways to topple Castro. However, Rusk agreed that the American public—and           possibly the Soviets—had assumed that there was such a pledge, which           made the Kennedys’ efforts in 1963 all the more risky. That’s why they           needed a legitimate—or seemingly legitimate—”coup,” not just an assassination           or a full-out US invasion while Castro was still in power. They didn’t           want to risk a nuclear confrontation with the Soviets, so any US military           action against Cuba would have to take place under very special circumstances.           It would have to appear to be a peace-keeping mission, in response           to a “palace coup” against Castro, to quote a recently declassified           memo.15 As Dean Rusk explained to us, Castro’s refusal           to allow the UN inspections led directly to what became the Kennedys’           plan for a           coup in Cuba.
The problem of Cuba remained a growing thorn in the side of JFK into           the spring and summer of 1963. The New York Times reported           on May 10, 1963 that a Senate subcommittee said that at least 17,000           Soviet           troops           remained in Cuba, including 5,000 combat troops. Worse, the report           said that concealed missile sites were “quite possible,” a charge that           JFK couldn’t completely refute without the UN inspections that Castro           wouldn’t allow. Hawkish sub-committee chairman John Stennis was demanding           that JFK take “positive” steps to make getting the Communists out of           Cuba his highest priority.16
A few weeks later, the Times reported             that CIA Director John McCone had testified to Congress that “only             onsite [UN] inspection can completely confirm” the “end of the           [Cuban] missile threat.”17 A June 14, 1963 secret National           Intelligence Estimate             said that while it was “unlikely that the USSR” would “reintroduce             strategic [nuclear] missiles into Cuba . . . we cannot, however,           rule out such an attempt.” Moreover, the US might not be able to find           the             missiles if they were reintroduced, since the report said it would             be “possible” for the Soviets “to adopt improved measures of concealment             and deception . . . to avoid providing many of the indicators that             US intelligence would be relying on” to detect any new missiles.18 We             could not always depend on U-2 spy planes to do the job, since they             were now sometimes being approached by Soviet MiG jets. This forced             the U-2s to abort, since procedures “call for aborts when Cuban aircraft             [come] within 40 miles of U-2 and at altitude in excess of 40,000           feet.”19 Finally,             U-2s were useless if new Soviet missiles were put in caves or underground             sites.
However, JFK had already been planning to take some type of action           to prevent the reintroduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba and to resolve           the problems with Castro once and for all. White House memos declassified           just a few years ago show that in late April 1963, the Kennedy administration           was beginning a major push to eliminate Castro, setting the stage for           C-Day. The April 23, 1963 notes from a National Security Council subcommittee           on Cuba say that Defense “Secretary McNamara . . . made clear his belief           that the elimination of the Castro regime was a requirement.” McNamara           suggested a program that would create “such a situation of dissidence           within Cuba as to allow the US to use force in support of anti-Castro           forces without leading to retaliation by the USSR on the West.” Then           “the Attorney General proposed . . . a list of measures we would take           following . . . the death of Castro” and “a program with the objective           of overthrowing Castro in eighteen months.” JFK adviser Ted Sorenson           listed one of the “objectives raised at the meeting” as being to “develop           a program to get rid of Castro.” Another objective was to provide “support           for dissident elements in Cuba.”20 This was the second           meeting of the “Standing Group of the National Security Council,”           a subcommittee           recently formed to focus solely on Cuba.21 It was just           one of several such groups, all under the control of Bobby Kennedy.
The notes from a different Cuba subcommittee two days later develop           the plans further. These April 25, 1963 notes say that CIA Director           McCone talked about creating “a feasible climate for a successful attempt           to fragment the Castro organization.” The CIA’s point man on Cuba,           Desmond FitzGerald, said at the meeting that “we will have to be able           to assure” high Cuban officials who might be willing to overthrow Castro           for the US “that the US will be sympathetic to possible successors”           to Castro “even though such people maybe have been former Castro supporters.”           FitzGerald also discussed “support to selected Cuban exile groups .           . . as being one of the key points of the possible new program.”22
The third of the seven government committees that investigated aspects           of the JFK assassination was the Rockefeller Commission, which found           that “McCone once stated one ultimate objective of our policy toward           Cuba should be ‘to encourage dissident elements in the . . . power           centers of the regime to bring about the eventual liquidation of           the Castro/Communist entourage and the elimination of the Soviet           presence from Cuba’” [emphasis in original].23
In directing the Cuban subcommittees             in these actions to topple Castro, Bobby Kennedy was not acting on             his own. Investigative journalist Gus Russo, who has numerous CIA           sources, documented that “although Robert Kennedy assumed the task           of dealing             with the nuts and bolts of policy implementation, this by no means             implies that the younger brother was operating without JFK’s implicit             agreement. When Robert Kennedy issued his April 23, 1963 directive             seeking studies aimed at overthrowing Castro in 1964, he was merely             echoing the President’s own words.”24
A “Memorandum for the President” from that time period foreshadows           many of the key elements of the C-Day coup plan. Though addressed to           President Kennedy, the memo also had a section where the Defense           Department, the CIA, and Bobby Kennedy’s Justice Department could all           check their “concurrences” with the policy. This 1963 memo—finally           declassified in 1997, due to our efforts and those of other researchers—makes           it clear that the administration’s “ultimate objective with respect           to Cuba remains the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime and its           replacement by one com- patible with the objectives of the US.” The           memo foreshadowed C-Day, saying “We should seek to create conditions           conducive to incipient rebellion to which we could then respond” [emphasis           in original].25
The memo makes it clear that after a “rebellion,” the US should “respond           with open military support . . . and Special Forces, up to the full           range of military forces.” This would come in response “to a request           for assistance from any anti-Castro . . . group . . . in Cuba which           demonstrates an ability to survive, [and] which seriously threatens           the present [Castro] regime.” The memo notes that “US military forces           employed against Cuba should be accompanied by US military-trained           free Cubans.”26 Cuban exiles trained by the US military           would soon be a key part of C-Day. These April 1963 meetings were not           the first           time           the Kennedys had targeted Castro with a broad plan of covert action.           The previous year, President Kennedy and the National Security Council           had approved “OPERATION MON- GOOSE,” a large program involving the           US military and other agencies including the CIA. Robert Kennedy was           actively           involved, though he did not dominate it to the extent he would dominate           C-Day the following year. For decades, OPERATION MONGOOSE has been           described as primarily a relentless and escalating campaign of sabotage           and small           Cuban exile raids that would somehow cause the overthrow of Castro.           Only in recent years have newly released documents and accounts shown           that MONGOOSE also included plans for an invasion of Cuba in the fall           of 1962. The military was heavily involved with MONGOOSE, and suggested           a variety of often outrageous plans to justify the military invasion,           such as blaming the sinking of a ship or the crash of an airliner—or           a US space capsule—on the Cubans, or staging a phony attack on Guantanamo.           In recent years, historians have begun to focus on the Soviet and Cuban           response to MONGOOSE, and whether it actually helped to trigger the           Cuban Missile Crisis. MONGOOSE was quietly terminated in early 1963           after a demonstrable lack of results.
The April 1963 meetings and memos were in response to a lack of progress           in efforts against Castro that had followed in the wake of MONGOOSE.           Some of those programs were known to the Kennedys and their Cuban subcommittees.           One was AMTRUNK, a CIA program conceived three months earlier by New York Times journalist Tad Szulc, a close friend of JFK.           It was an attempt to find disgruntled military officials in Cuba who           might be willing to recruit higher military officials in a plot to           overthrow Castro. Detailed in a later chapter, AMTRUNK was making little           progress. In addition, the CIA had been supporting dozens of Cuban           exile groups for years, but most were ineffective, and the Kennedys           were starting to scale back their support and shut down the groups’           raids on Cuba.
The CIA had two other major operations against Cuba that were being           hidden from the Kennedys in April 1963. One was CIA backing for the           violent Cuban exile group Alpha 66, which even attacked Soviet ships           in Cuban waters, a dangerous act during the Cold War. Even as JFK denounced           Alpha 66 and tried to clamp down on its leadership, he didn’t realize           that the CIA was actually directing the group’s activities. The other           major operation was the CIA’s ongoing plots with Mafia boss Johnny           Rosselli to assassinate Castro. The CIA-Mafia plots began in 1959,           had been ramped up in the summer of 1960 prior to JFK’s election, and           continued even after the CIA had assured Bobby Kennedy in May 1962           that they had been stopped. These plots were still active in the spring           of 1963, with two well-documented attempts. The CIA-Mafia plots with           Rosselli were part of the CIA’s ZRRIFLE “Executive Action” program,           which employed a European assassin recruiter codenamed QJWIN, whose           real name is still classified by the CIA. This program was first uncovered           by the Senate Church Committee in the mid-1970s.
CIA Director John McCone, a recent JFK appointee, was kept in the           dark about the unsanctioned CIA operations as much as JFK was. CIA           officials who were aware of them, the highest of whom appears to have           been Deputy Director for Plans Richard Helms, had far different ideas           on overthrowing Castro by 1963 than did the Kennedys. Historian Arthur           Schlesinger, Jr., a JFK aide at the time, wrote that “the CIA wished           to organize Castro’s overthrow from outside Cuba, as against the White           House, the Attorney General’s office and State who wished to support           an anti-Castro movement inside Cuba. The CIA’s idea was to fight a           war; the others hoped to promote a revolution.” Although our sources           and documents indicate that Schlesinger did not know about the plan           for a coup in Cuba, he worked closely enough           with the Kennedys to accurately describe their feelings about Cuba.27 The           Kennedys wanted a change in Cuba to be part of a political solution,           whether by a genuine coup or (by the fall of 1963) a negotiated agreement           with Castro, whereas Helms and other CIA offi- cials acted as if assassination           of Castro by any means at any time was justified.
Since none of the             CIA’s sanctioned or unsanctioned actions were having much effect           by April 1963, the Kennedys were very receptive just a few weeks later             when one of the highest officials in Cuba contacted a Kennedy ally             and offered to stage a coup against Castro, if the Kennedys would           back             him.28 The offer fit perfectly with what the Kennedys             were already looking for—a way to “get rid of Castro” by supporting             “dissident elements             in Cuba,” which would “allow the US to use force . . . without leading             to retaliation by the USSR.”
