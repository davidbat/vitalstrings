The            Cold War, 1956 - 1969 . / The Cuban Missile            Crisis
Why did Kennedy react as he did to the Soviet deployment of            missiles on Cuba?
On October 15th, 1962, an American spy plane flying over Cuba took            a series of photographs. Analysis of the photographs confirmed what            CIA agents had feared for several weeks. The Soviet Union had missile            sites on Cuba.

Why is America worried about missiles being placed            on Cuba?
Cuba was now an ally of the Soviet Union. In 1961 the            US had backed a failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government. Missiles            on the island would be able to reach far inside mainland America. Analysis            of the photographic evidence suggested that these missiles were not            just Surface To Air (SAM) missiles that are purely defensive in nature            but medium range nuclear missiles: which were considered to be offensive            weapons. This poses a few questions: What motives have the Soviet Union            and Cuba got for placing offensive weapons on the Island? and What should            be done about the development?
Timeline of the Cuban Missile Crisis
American                Response / Action
Reason for this                action being taken
October 15th - Photographs taken by a U2 spy plane are analysed by military                  experts. They show that missile sires are in place in Cuba. President                  Kennedy is informed. He calls a meeting of top officials (held                  the next day) to discuss the situation.
Kennedy needed to know what the exact                situation was and what the options were.
October 16th - Kennedy asks whether the missiles are operational and what his                advisors think the options, and their consequences would be. Kennedy                asks his advisors to continue surveillance flights and to begin                preparations for an air strike on Cuba and an invasion.
Knowing whether or not the missiles                  are operational informs Kennedy what timescale he has to work                  within. Asking for a range of options gives him a choice. Continued                  surveillance ensures that information is up to date and accurate.
Kennedy's options at this point were:
Air Strikes to take out the missile sites
Invade Cuba
Negotiate a deal with the Soviet UnioDo nothing as the US                    had more than enough missiles to counter this new threat.
Place Cuba under Quarantine to stop missiles arriving
Use Nuclear Weapons against Cuba or the Soviet Union
October 17th - Ongoing U2 flights over Cuba. Advisors consider the options and                make intial plans for each of them.
Kennedy is covering all options here                and giving himself and his team thinking time.
October 18th - CIA analysts report that there is evidence of medium range weapons                  on Cuba, not just short range missiles. This hardens the line                  of those advocating an immediate military response. Under Secretary                  of State, George Ball, comments that such action would be: "without                  giving Khrushchev some way out." President Kennedy meets                  with Gromyko, who assures him that there are only defensive weapons                  on Cuba.
Gromyko was the Soviet Foreign Secretary.                Having this discussion allows Kennedy to open up diplomatic channels                which has the potential to reach a settlement without provoling                conflict. It also alerts the Soviet Union to the fact that America                are aware of the missiles and considering their options.
October 19th - President                Kennedy meets with the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, and                the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They discuss military                options.
Again, Kennedy is thinking through                  the various options available to him and making sure that things                  are in place to enact whichever option he decides is the correct                  course of action.
October 20th - President Kennedy cancels appointments and visits, citing                ill health. He orders preparations for a defensive quarantine of                Cuba to begin. A television appearance about the crisis is booked..
America was undergoing mid term elections                  at this time so President Kennedy and other leading politicians                  would be expected to be on the campaign trail. He needed to be                  able to focus on the Cuban Missile Crisis without alarming the                  public, so citing a minor health issue is used to prevent the                  public being concerned.
The television appearance is booked because reporters were aware                  of the crisis. Some of them had been approached by Soviet spies.                  Kennedy needed to make the story public himself so that the situation                  wasn't inflamed by the press.
October 21st - General Maxwell Taylor advises that an air strike might not take                out all of the missiles. Kennedy orders the quarantine to go ahead.                The media are warned that any leaks of the crisis may lead to Soviet                action.
Choosing to place Cuba under Quarantine                  is risky - the Soviets might ignore the blockade and provoke armed                  response - but not as likely to result in all out war as alternative                  actions would take. It also provides time for the Soviet Union                  to come to the negotiating table.
October 22nd - Leaders of Congress are shown photographic evidence of the missile                sites. Marines are sent to reenforce the base at Guantanamo Bay.                Kennedy goes on live television and announces the presence of the                missiles to the nation. The US military is put on DEFCON 3.
Kennedy needs to ensure that leading                  politicians are aware of the situation. This is especially important                  given the elections that are about to take place.
Guantanamo Bay is a US base on Cuba. If there is military action,                  the base will become a very important strategic site - and be                  under immediate threat.
DEFCON 3 is a security alert level. It places the armed forces                  at readiness for war.
October 23rd - The quarantine line is in place. Robert Kennedy is sent to talk                  to Ambassador Dobrynin. Khruschev sends Kennedy a letter that                  says that the quarantine leads to a "serious threat to peace                  and security of peoples". Kennedy changes the quarantine                  line from 800 to 500 miles from Cuba.
Changing the Quarantine line from 800                to 500 miles provides the Soviet Uunion and America with crucial                extra time to avoid bringing the crisis to a head.
October 24th - All but one Soviet vessels on route to Cuba slow down or change                course. US forces are placed on DEFCON 2.
Placing US forces on DEFCON 2 puts                  them at the highest state of readiness that they have been since                  the end of the Second World War. It means that if the one ship                  still on course at full speed does not comply with the Quarantine                  restrictions, that force could be deployed immediately.
October 25th - Kennedy writes to Khruschev laying the blame for the crisis in                the hands of the Soviet Union. The Executive Committee of the National                Security Council proposes offering a deal - no missiles in Cuba                in return for US missiles being withdrawn from Turkey.
Writing to Khruschev keeps diplomatic                  channels open. It makes it clear that there are things that are                  and are not acceptable to the United States and provides scope                  for a response. Discussing deals at EXCOMM shows that this is                  part of a diplomatic effort to secure a peaceful solution to the                  crisis.
October 26th - Former KGB spy Aleksandr Fomin proposes a halt to the building                  of the missile sites in return for a public guarantee that the                  US will never invade Cuba. Kennedy receives a letter from Khruschev                  that proposes exactly the same thing.
Talking to Fomin shows that the US were                willing to consider many options. It sends a message that they are                willing to reach an agreement.
October 27th - A new letter from Khrushchev arrives, proposing a public trade                of Soviet missiles in Cuba for U.S. missile in Turkey. A U2 spy                plane is shot down over Cuba. Dobrynin and Robert Kennedy meet again                to discuss a solution. President Kennedy tells Khruschev that he                will make a public statement saying that the US will never invade                Cuba.
Kennedy's reaction to the shooting                  down of the U2 spy plane was calm and considered. Many advisors                  would advocate an immediate retaliatory response. That would almost                  certainly have resulted in follow up actions being taken by the                  Cubans / Soviets. Ongoinf diplomatic talks at the height of the                  crisis show that there is a determination to reach a peaceful                  conclusion to the crisis.
October 28th - Khruschev                announces on Radio Moscow that the missiles are being withdrawn.                Secretly, Kennedy agrees to withdraw US missiles from Turkey.
Opting to make the withdrawal of missiles                from Turkey secret is a political move by Kennedy. He doesn't appear                to have made concessions to the Soviet Union which is vital to his                parties chances in the mid-term elections. The fact that the Soviets                allow this to be kept secret suggests that they were happier to                work with Kennedy than with his political opponents.
