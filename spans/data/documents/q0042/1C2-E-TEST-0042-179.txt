Cuban Missile Crisis - John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum
The   Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962 : A Reading List (2002)
This   reading list is composed of titles cataloged in the Kennedy Library's   printed materials collections. The Kennedy Library applies special   local modifications to standard Library of Congress Subject Headings.   This is so that researchers who use our archival holdings may focus   more closely on titles that may contain important information about   issues of the Kennedy administration. This list contains more than 225   titles indexed under the library's Cuban Missile Crisis heading. It   does not include undergraduate student papers, novels, or general   biographies of President Kennedy and other participants. 
Nearly   all of these publications are based on research conducted in the   Kennedy Library's document collections, or on publications, microfilm   collections, World Wide Web sites, and other institutions that contain   copies or facsimiles of portions of Kennedy Library document holdings.
