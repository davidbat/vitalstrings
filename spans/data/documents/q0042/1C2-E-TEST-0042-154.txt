John F. Kennedy - Foreign affairs
Kennedy's record in foreign affairs has also been subjected to         conflicting interpretations. His aides, several of whom are highly         skilled writers, have defended him for piloting the United States safely         through international crises not of his own making and for beginning the         process of détente with the Soviet Union. They have praised him         for having a less rigidly ideological view of the world than his         immediate predecessor and for accepting a world of diversity, improving         America's standing in the Third World. Kennedy's critics,         many of whom are on the political left, have charged him with being as         much of a cold warrior as Eisenhower and, if anything, less prudent         about the application of American power and more provocative and         adventuristic. The universalistic language of his inaugural address was         applied, they insist, and the world was a more dangerous place as a         result.
In the absence of full access to diplomatic records in this country and         abroad, it is not yet possible to resolve this debate on Kennedy fully,         but certain studies by dispassionate analysts, such as Graham         Allison's study of the Cuban missile crisis, lend support to the         more friendly view of Kennedy. The president certainly made mistakes in         foreign policy, and he raised more hopes than he fulfilled. But he         demonstrated a relatively cosmopolitan and sophisticated view of the         world, grew in office, and had a feel for diplomacy, which has sometimes         been lacking in American presidents.
In contrast to several presidents, Kennedy came to office with a         preference for foreign affairs. Issues of war and peace had interested         him since his youth, and the awesome responsibility of being president         in the nuclear age only reinforced that interest. "Domestic         policy," Kennedy often said, "can only defeat us; foreign         policy can kill us." He believed, with considerable historical         justification, that miscalculation had been the route to war several         times in the twentieth century. In Kennedy's view, it was         essential to prevent such miscalculation in the future, for there could         be no winners in a nuclear war. His military strategy, called flexible         response and managed by his highly reputed secretary of defense, Robert         S. McNamara, was designed to reduce the chances of war by         miscalculation. By building up conventional forces and tightening up         command and control procedures, Kennedy and McNamara hoped to provide         time for diplomacy in the event of miscalculated Soviet military         aggression.
Like several other modern presidents, Kennedy tried to be his own         secretary of state, though it is not clear that he originally intended         to be. Rather, he hoped to avoid being overly dependent on one person         for foreign policy advice; he perceived Truman to have been dependent on         Dean Acheson and Eisenhower on John Foster Dulles. Dean Rusk, who became         Kennedy's secretary of state through a process of elimination,         was hardworking, articulate, and loyal but apparently not highly         influential with Kennedy, who, according to his brother Robert, came to         depend more on the national security assistant, Mc-George Bundy, and his         small staff than he did on Rusk and the State Department.
Kennedy became president at a time when Communism seemed to be gaining         ground. The Soviet Union had taken the lead in space exploration, had         developed missiles that made the United States vulnerable to nuclear         attack, and was using more belligerent rhetoric. Communism and         revolution were also on the rise in the world's former colonies,         including Cuba, which lay ninety miles from American shores. Just prior         to Kennedy's inauguration, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made         a speech promising to support wars of national liberation, and such wars         were under way in Southeast Asia. As a candidate for president, Kennedy         had stressed the growing Communist menace abroad, and as president, he         aimed at thwarting it and meeting new challenges that arose during his         time in office. This meant that much of his foreign policy was reactive,         though in his last year he showed some initiative in trying to reduce         Cold War tensions and improve American-Soviet relations.
Kennedy was sometimes trapped in anti-Communist logic partly of his own         making, as in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion that occurred soon         after he became president. This was a CIA-sponsored invasion of Cuba by         thirteen hundred Cubans who had become disaffected with the revolution         led by Fidel Castro. Kennedy had reservations about proceeding with the         plan; he was worried about its chances of success and about how it might         affect his image and the country's to be involved in a foreign,         antirevolutionary invasion. For the latter reasons, he refused to         authorize overt American involvement in the fighting. But he failed to         cancel the operation because it would have been politically embarrassing         to call off an anti-Castro effort that had been hatched in the         Eisenhower administration, especially when Allen Dulles heartily         endorsed it. Kennedy foolishly allowed himself to believe that the         United States would be able plausibly to deny involvement in such a         large-scale and well-publicized operation. He also allowed himself to be         swept along by sheer bureaucratic momentum, and he failed to demand an         adequate military review of the invasion plans.
When the invasion came on 17 April 1961, Murphy's Law prevailed:         If anything can go wrong, it will. Most of the invaders were captured,         later to be ransomed to the United States; over a hundred were killed;         and some were rescued at sea by the United States Navy. Kennedy was         stunned and wondered how he could have been so stupid. The invasion plan         had turned out to have been based on false, unrealistic assumptions.         Some of the invaders and their supporters later grumbled that Kennedy         had fatally undermined the plan by denying United States air cover, but         retrospectively it appears far more likely that air cover would only         have prolonged the inevitable. Castro's military forces were too         strong and his regime too popular for a counterrevolution to prevail.         The American denial, far from being plausible, became instantly and         totally implausible. Kennedy had worried about appearances, but he now         appeared naive, weak, or aggressive, depending on where one stood.
About the best that can be said for Kennedy in this instance is that he         did a good job of picking up the pieces. He publicly accepted total         responsibility for the failure, and he consulted with both Eisenhower         and Nixon. These steps helped minimize political fallout. He took care         to avoid recriminations within the government, appointing a panel of         inquiry that included Allen Dulles and the chief of naval operations,         who were in effect investigating themselves; Kennedy thus signaled the         military and the CIA that he was not looking for scapegoats. After an         appropriate interval, Kennedy did make high-level personnel changes in         both the CIA and the military, and he strengthened oversight and         coordinating functions. In time, he came to regard the Bay of Pigs as an         object lesson in the need for a president to have firm operational         control during international crises and not to place too much faith in         the experts. This lesson served him well during the Cuban missile         crisis.
On the other hand, the Bay of Pigs did not teach Kennedy to stay out of         the internal affairs of foreign countries, only to keep down the "noise level." Prodded by Robert Kennedy and Maxwell         Taylor, the president's military adviser, the CIA continued to         seek Castro's removal, which the CIA interpreted to mean         assassination. Although the assassination efforts failed, their         discovery by Castro, it has sometimes been speculated, triggered         retaliation in the form of President Kennedy's assassination.         Although the Bay of Pigs taught Kennedy the need to control the CIA,         later investigations made it clear that he was much less than completely         successful in achieving it.
The Bay of Pigs also reinforced Kennedy's belief in the need for         a better nonconventional or counterinsurgency capability in order to         prevent future Castros from obtaining power in the first place. Thus,         American advisers taught Latin American governments, including ones far         to the right, techniques for crushing leftist opposition. To South         Vietnam, where the United States already had a substantial commitment to         the anti-Communist government of Ngo Dinh Diem when Kennedy took office,         he increased American aid and eventually sent sixteen thousand military         advisers, some of whom saw combat, to train Diem's troops in         counterinsurgency warfare against the threatening guerrilla forces that         had begun to operate there. When Diem, a Catholic, repressed Buddhist         monks, who were part of the country's religious majority, he         became an embarrassment to the United States. Kennedy's         subordinates, if not Kennedy himself, gave a green light to a coup by         South Vietnamese generals in the fall of 1963, which resulted in         Diem's assassination. Kennedy was shocked and disturbed by         Diem's death, though not by the coup, which in effect only         further tied American prestige to the success of anti-Communist forces         in South Vietnam. That was Kennedy's legacy to Lyndon Johnson,         and there is, of course, no way of knowing whether Kennedy would have         handled Vietnam any differently than his successor did.
Although he supported counterinsurgency warfare, Kennedy recognized in         Vietnam and elsewhere the supremacy of politics over force, and he was         skeptical of solutions that required direct American military         involvement. Laos, which probably took more of Kennedy's time         than any other issue in his first several months in office, had the         potential to become another Bay of Pigs. It was in utter crisis in 1961,         an obscure and murky battleground of political factions, personalities,         feudalism, tribal culture, and social revolution set against the         background of the Cold War. Eisenhower had backed a conservative group,         but Kennedy, according to Schlesinger, believed that "the effort         to transform it into a pro-Western redoubt had been ridiculous and that         neutralization was the correct policy." Kennedy nevertheless came         close to sending American troops there, and he gave the impression that         he would send them; but in the end he managed to arrange a cease-fire         and eased the way toward neutralization.
Kennedy often tried to pressure allies endangered by revolution to         institute reforms in order to enhance their domestic popularity and the         viability of their governments. Yet because these endangered governments         often had a lot to lose from the reforms themselves and because they         knew that stopping Communism was the higher American priority, they         could ignore Kennedy's pressure with impunity. Thus, the Alliance         for Progress, the highly touted aid program for Latin America that         Kennedy proposed in March 1961, achieved far less social and economic         reform than the president had hoped, but the ideals that surrounded the         Alliance gave him an unusual degree of personal popularity in Latin         America. Similarly, his expressed ideals, youth, and opposition to         colonialism enhanced his personal prestige and America's image in         the new nations of Africa.
Toward the Soviet Union itself, Kennedy's policies differed         little at the start of his administration from those of Eisenhower. Like         Eisenhower, Kennedy held a summit conference with Khrushchev, though in         contrast to the hopeful spirit that accompanied Eisenhower's         summits but evaporated soon afterward, a grim mood emerged from         Kennedy's meeting with the Soviet premier in June 1961. The         meeting was intended to allow the two men simply to get to know each         other, but when Khrushchev challenged him verbally, Kennedy had little         choice but to respond in kind.
Repeatedly, during Kennedy's first two years as president, the         Soviets made threatening noises about West Berlin and, in August 1961,         even built a wall around it to keep East Germans from emigrating.         Kennedy responded through words and deeds, including at one point         calling up American military reserves. He upheld America's         longstanding commitment to defend that city and its access to the West.         Finally, in 1963, Soviet pressure receded. When Kennedy traveled to West         Berlin on 26 June 1963, he received the most overwhelming public         reception of his life. A sea of faces chanted his name and a vast         audience roared its approval when he said, "Today, in the world         of freedom, the proudest boast is 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' "
Given Soviet provocations over Berlin in particular, it is not         surprising that Kennedy called for a significant buildup in         America's conventional forces and that he accelerated an         expansion of America's missile program that had begun under         Eisenhower. Retrospectively, some of Kennedy's own national         security advisers regarded the missile buildup as a mistake, an example         of the ratcheting effect in the arms race, whereby America built up its         forces on the basis of Soviet capabilities, which America interpreted as         intentions, and the Soviets then matched the American buildup. It does         seem clear that Kennedy accelerated missile deployments more on the         momentum of his election campaign charges of a missile gap than he did         on the basis of hard intelligence. Information gathered from satellite         reconnaissance and from a Soviet spy showed irrefutably that there had         been an intelligence gap rather than a missile gap. Kennedy had McNamara         acknowledge the missile gap's demise off the record, but Kennedy         neither reversed the American buildup nor educated the public on the         true nature of the gap.
It has sometimes been argued that the Soviets decided to install         missiles in Cuba in 1962 because they were worried about the American         buildup. It has also variously been argued that they were seeking a         quick and inexpensive strategic advantage, that it was a tactical move         which they thought they could get away with because Kennedy was weak,         that they were merely trying to protect their client in Cuba from         American invasion or subterfuge, or that they did it for some         combination of these and other reasons. There can be little question         that it was a provocative act and that any American who might have been         president when it occurred was bound to respond to it.
Ever since Castro's Communist sympathies had become clear, Cuba         had been a sore point in American politics, for Americans were         uncomfortable with a Communist government so close at hand. The failure         of the Bay of Pigs invasion had made Kennedy and his party vulnerable to         charges from the political right. When Soviet military personnel and         equipment began to arrive in Cuba in the summer of 1962, the Republican         campaign committee announced that Cuba would be "the dominant         issue of the 1962 campaign." Several Republicans specifically         charged that missile sites were being constructed, and Congress         overwhelmingly passed a resolution initiated by the Republican         leadership expressing American determination "by whatever means         may be necessary, including the use of arms, . . . to prevent in Cuba         the creation or use of an externally supported military capability         endangering the security of the United States." Kennedy reassured         the public that offensive weapons would not be permitted in Cuba and         that Soviet representatives had repeatedly assured him that they were         not installing such weapons in Cuba.
When, in mid-October, Kennedy received incontrovertible photographic         evidence that the Soviets were building launching sites for         intermediate-range missiles, he simply had to stop them. Some people,         both at the time and since, have discounted the strategic significance         of the missiles on the grounds that it did not matter whether a missile         was launched from the Soviet Union or from Cuba. Others emphasized the         increased accuracy that the Soviets would have gained from having         missiles in Cuba and the possibility that they were seeking a         first-strike capability.
More important to Kennedy than technical military considerations were         political ones, both international and domestic. Kennedy had to worry         about how the Soviets might interpret a capitulation by him on this         issue. If they had miscalculated this badly on missiles in Cuba, would         they next miscalculate on Berlin, for example, where he would not back         down, with the result a nuclear war? If Kennedy did nothing about the         missiles, moreover, his political position in the United States would be         compromised or destroyed. He would be impeached, Robert Kennedy said. At         the very least, the Republicans would mercilessly exploit his weakness         in the upcoming congressional elections.
Kennedy wondered about not whether to seek the missiles' removal,         but how to achieve that end. For two weeks, an ad hoc group of high         government officials deliberated in secrecy about that question. They         were divided between those who favored a quick air strike to achieve a         fait accompli and those who favored a naval blockade to pressure the         Soviets into removing the missiles themselves. Kennedy rejected the air         strike because it placed the United States in the position of launching         a sneak attack when the onus of world opinion deserved to be on the         Soviets and because it might trigger military retaliation. Neither some         of the top military commanders nor Democratic congressional leaders were         pleased with Kennedy's choice, but on 21 October he proceeded to         announce the imposition of a naval blockade, which he called a         quarantine, in a crisp and carefully worded television speech.
The crisis was joined, and the world held its breath to see what the         Soviets would do. During the tense days that followed, Kennedy         personally kept a close watch on the blockade. He decided to let certain         tankers and a passenger ship through, but he ordered a Soviet-chartered         ship boarded and inspected as a sign of his determination. At the United         Nations, Ambassador Adlai Stevenson publicly grilled his Soviet         counterpart. Meanwhile, Kennedy and Khrushchev communicated privately by         cable and through emissaries. In these communications, Kennedy         demonstrated considerable skill and forbearance, ignoring a tough         message from Khrushchev and responding to a more conciliatory one.         Kennedy carefully avoided humiliating Khrushchev. He gave written         assurances against an invasion of Cuba, and his brother Robert told the         Soviet ambassador that within a short time after the crisis was over,         the United States would remove from Turkey certain missiles that the         Soviets wanted removed and that had no bearing on American security. On         28 October, Khrushchev relented and began removal of the missiles. The         crisis passed.
In later years, some people downgraded the severity of the crisis by         saying that the outcome was a foregone conclusion because the United         States enjoyed a huge military advantage over the Soviet Union in the         Caribbean. That is, of course, easy to say in hindsight. The United         States and the Soviet Union had never gone "eyeball to         eyeball" like this before, so everyone was justified in feeling         tense waiting for Khrushchev to blink. Everything was at stake, and the         world breathed a sigh of relief when the Soviets backed down.
The crisis impelled Kennedy to take new initiatives in seeking an end to         the Cold War. At American University on 10 June 1963, he gave one of the         most important speeches of his presidency; it marked the beginning of a         spirit of détente. Kennedy called for a reexamination of American         attitudes toward the Soviet Union and said that both sides in the Cold         War had "a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and         in halting the arms race." He declared:
In the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all           inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish           our children's future. And we are all mortal.. . . We must deal           with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history           of the last eighteen years been different.
He proposed complete disarmament, to be achieved through stages, the         first of which would be a ban on atmospheric nuclear tests. As a         demonstration of good faith, he promised that the United States would         not conduct any further atmospheric tests as long as other countries         refrained from doing so.
Khrushchev told Averell Harriman, Kennedy's representative at the         test ban talks, that he thought Kennedy had made the "greatest         speech by any American President since Roosevelt." The         negotiations proved successful, at least in banning atmospheric, though         not underground, tests. In August, Kennedy sent the treaty to the         Senate; it was the first arms control agreement between Washington and         Moscow. The Joint Chiefs of Staff gave it only grudging approval, and         certain military spokesmen vociferously opposed ratification. The         public, though, was solidly behind it, and the treaty was ratified on 24         September by a comfortable margin above the required two-thirds. It was         only a small step toward disarmament and an end to the Cold War, but         Kennedy liked to say that great journeys began with small steps. No         other accomplishment gave him greater satisfaction.
