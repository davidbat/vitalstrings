John Fitzgerald Kennedy takes the oath of office and becomes the 35th            President of the United States of America, January 20, 1961. At age            43, he is the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic ever elected,            winning by one of the smallest margins of victory, only 115,000 popular            votes. Lyndon B. Johnson, 51, is his Vice President.

Just five days after taking office, the President holds his first news            conference, televised live from the State Department auditorium. His            easy-going style and quick wit instantly endear him to many reporters            and to the American people watching at home.
From the beginning and throughout his presidency, international tensions            and political conflicts are a major preoccupation. Left - His first            meeting with Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Andrei Gromyko. Mid -            During a news conference discussing the problems of Laos in Southeast            Asia, the President states, "The security of all Southeast Asia            will be endangered if Laos loses its neutral independence." He            orders more military aid including U.S. armed forces to the area. Right            - Addressing the NATO chiefs of staff at the State Department he pledges            a strengthening of conventional forces and an effective nuclear capability.
Following the Bay of Pigs debacle, a private conversation between President            Kennedy and former President Eisenhower at Camp David, Maryland. April            22, 1961.
Bay of Pigs refers to the attempt made by over            1200 anti-Castro Cuban rebels to land on the southern coast of Cuba            and overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro, April 17, 1961. Although trained            and backed by the U.S. government, the invasion failed as the rebels            were attacked by Cuban military forces and received no support from            the U.S. military or anti-Castro people in Cuba. As a result, they were            quickly defeated and put in prison, causing a major embarrassment to            the Kennedy White House. At a press meeting on April 20th, the President deflected much of the criticism by commenting on some of            the lessons he learned from the failed mission, saying "the forces            of Communism are not to be underestimated."
Shortly after this, in early June, the President traveled to Vienna,            Austria, where he met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschev for the first            time. During two days of meetings, Khruschev sized-up the young President            and underestimated his resolve, resulting later in the October Missile            Crisis of 1962.

Following the later            launch into orbit of John Glenn, the President visited Cape Canaveral            in Florida and presented Glenn with NASA's Distinguished Service Medal.            Right - Astronaut Glenn shows the President the space capsule in which            he traveled into orbit and circled the earth three times.
In September  1962 the President delivered            a speech at Rice University in which he pledged the U.S. would put a            man on the moon "before the end of this decade." Seven years            later, July  1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.
At the request of his brother Robert, standing behind him, the President            signs three tough new anti-crime bills targeting organized crime. The            bills prohibit telephone betting, interstate transportation for purposes            of racketeering and commercial transportation of betting equipment.

The whole world then waits to see what will happen.
