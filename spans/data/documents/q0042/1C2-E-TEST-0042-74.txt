NOV. 2010:  LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO PRODUCE & STAR IN LEGACY OF SECRECY FILM!
Warner Brothers, which also released Stone’s JFK, plans to have Leo’s Legacy film ready for the 50th anniversary of JFK’s murder in 2013. Also, one or more documentaries based on Legacy will cover additional material about JFK’s murder, Cuba, the CIA, Watergate, and Martin Luther King’s assassination.
Here’s the full story in Variety .
Robert Kennedy, National Security, the Mafia, and the Assassination of Martin Luther King
NOV. 2009:  NOW UPDATED WITH DRAMATIC NEW REVELATIONS!  The new trade paperback has three new chapters, an expanded photo-document section, and updated text throughout.
Bombshells in the new trade paperback are featured in a new Discovery Channel special, "Did the Mob kill JFK?" produced by NBC. It premiered November 22, 2009, on the Discovery Channel (US), and was produced by NBC. Authors Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann are extensively interviewed in the documentary, which will continue to air on Discovery. (Check discoverychannel.com for listings.)
The updated trade paperback’s new information completes the story of how the top secret plan of John and Robert Kennedy to stage a coup against Fidel Castro on December 1, 1963--with the help of Cuban Army Commander Juan Almeida--was used by three powerful Mafia bosses to murder JFK.
Documented from the National Archives for the first time is Watergate burglar Bernard Barker’s decades-long work for the Mafia, even as Barker aided the CIA with the coup plan. This let Barker sell out the coup plan to his mob bosses and help to assassinate JFK in a way that forced top US officials to withhold key information from the Warren Commission and the press, to prevent a nuclear confrontation with Russia.
This legacy of secrecy also allowed two men who confessed their roles in JFK’s murder to be involved in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, in 1968. The trade paperback also contains important new information about the FBI informant who obtained the JFK assassination confession of godfather Carlos Marcello, which the Bureau kept secret for twenty years.
Check back on November 23, 2009 for more updates to this site.
 
The rifle fire in Dallas that killed John F. Kennedy didn’t just start a frantic effort to find his assassins. JFK’s murder also launched a flurry of covert actions by officials like Robert F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Helms to hide the fact that the United States was on the brink of invading Cuba as part of a JFK-authorized coup only ten days away. The plan’s exposure could have cost the life of JFK’s coup leader, Cuban Army Commander Juan Almeida, and led to a nuclear confrontation with the Soviets, just a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis. But the cover-ups by these top officials also had the tragic effect of preventing a full investigation of JFK’s assassination, spawning a legacy of secrecy that would impact Presidents, Congress, and U.S. foreign policy for the next forty-five years.
Legacy of Secrecy details the secret attempts of Robert F. Kennedy and his aides to expose his brother’s killers, while protecting Commander Almeida. It shows how RFK continued his war against the Mafia by focusing increased attention on the Mafia bosses behind JFK’s assassination, until his own murder. RFK’s associates continued his quest, almost exposing the truth several times. But like a deadly, high-stakes chess game—at the height of the Cold War—they were blocked each time by three Mafia chiefs and a handful of CIA operatives. Legacy details each step taken by mob bosses Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, and Johnny Rosselli to hide their involvement in JFK’s murder, and the tragic results that followed. The long shadow of secrecy surrounding both JFK’s murder and the coup plan set the stage for the murder of Martin Luther King, ultimately driving two Presidents from office, and bringing about the murders of five Congressional witnesses in the mid-1970s.
Legacy of Secrecy tells the full story. . .
. . .of JFK’s murder and the tragic results of the cover-ups that followed, as revealed by two dozen associates of John and Robert Kennedy, backed by thousands of files at the National Archives.
The result of twenty years of research, it finally tells the full story long withheld from Congress and the American people, by exposing for the first time:
• Uncensored FBI files revealing the clear confession of Mafia godfather Carlos Marcello to arranging JFK’s assassination, and meeting with Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.
• New disclosures about the JFK assassination confessions of Marcello’s partners — Tampa godfather Santo Trafficante and Mafia don Johnny Rosselli — plus admissions from two of their associates who helped them kill JFK.
• How the three Mafia chiefs had a dozen mob associates infiltrate John and Robert Kennedy’s top-secret "Plan for a Coup in Cuba," set for December 1, 1963—and used parts of the coup plan to kill JFK in Dallas on November 22, 1963.
• Why Robert Kennedy and top U.S. officials withheld crucial information to prevent a confrontation with the Soviets and protect JFK’s ally high in the Cuban government: Commander Juan Almeida, who is still listed as Cuba’s #3 official today.
• How officials like J. Edgar Hoover and the CIA’s Richard Helms also used the opportunity to cover-up their own misjudgments, misdeeds, and intelligence failures, setting the stage for further tragedies.
• The names of the two Georgia men who paid James Earl Ray to assassinate Martin Luther King, why they wanted Dr. King killed, and how Ray contacted them in Atlanta the day after King’s murder.
• Why the FBI withheld files from Congress showing that Marcello brokered the contract on Dr. King, and the connection Rosselli had to James Earl Ray.
• How Robert Kennedy’s efforts to bring JFK’s killers to justice was thwarted by his own murder, raising new questions about RFK’s slaying by focusing on Sirhan Sirhan’s criminal ties and the confession of a Rosselli associate.
• The roles played by a dozen veterans of the JFK-Almeida coup plan — such as E. Howard Hunt — in Watergate. Legacy of Secrecy explains what the burglars were really looking for, why Nixon risked his Presidency to get it, and how Watergate triggered the downfall of Marcello and Rosselli.
• How Congressional investigations of Marcello, Trafficante, and Rosselli for JFK’s murder were stymied by the murders of five witnesses, including Rosselli and Jimmy Hoffa.
