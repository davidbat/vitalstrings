Bobby Kennedy, 40 years later
Thu Jun 5, 2:11 AM ET
LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Forty years ago, on June 5, 1968,             Robert F. Kennedy was brimming with the confidence of a young, charismatic             and liberal political star.
He had just won the California Democratic primary,             giving him a strong chance to win the party's presidential nomination,             rising out of the shadow of his brother John F. Kennedy, the president             murdered less than five years before. And in a split second, its             was all over: a deranged Palestinian shot him dead in a Los Angeles             hotel as he reveled in his victory.
The assassination of Bobby Kennedy plunged the United             States into deep trauma.
It came in the wake of the devastating Tet offensive             against US and South Vietnamese troops in Vietnam, which showed the             US was not winning the war and forced then-president Lyndon Johnson,             also a Democrat, to concede that he was too weak to seek the White             House in that November's election. And it followed by two months             the April 4 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King             in Memphis, Tennessee, which sparked riots across the country.
Johnson's decision to bow out from the race opened             the door to Kennedy to jump in the battle against liberal anti-war             hero, senator Eugene McCarthy, and Johnson's more conservative vice             president Hubert Humphrey that March. But Kennedy, who also took             a stance against the increasingly unpopular war, had the advantage             of youth -- he was just 42, his powerful name, his experience as             attorney general under his brother, and then nearly four years as             senator from New York.
The primary in California, the country's most populous             state, was key, and Kennedy came out of it with a big advance, putting             him ahead of McCarthy and with the possibility of catching up with             Humphrey. But what for many was the second Kennedy "dream" was             again cut short. As he entered the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel             to thank supporters, Sirhan Sirhan pulled out a pistol and at close             range shot Bobby several times, including once in the head.
Kennedy died the next day, leaving behind wife Ethel,             10 children and an 11th soon to be born, and a clan and the nation             in shock at yet another Kennedy tragedy.

The photograph of a young assistant chef, holding up             the candidate's bloodied head as he lay on the floor, was seen around             the world.
Boris Yaro, then working for the Los Angeles Times,             recalled in 1998 that he went not on assignment but as a fan to take             pictures. "To me, Bobby represented what was left of the             Camelot era of American politics, and I wanted him to win.
"I wanted a picture of him for my wall -- something               that said a new era was aborning." But as his victory became               apparent, suddenly "there               were a couple of explosions that seemed to light up the entire room," Yaro               recalled.
"The crowd around Bobby parted and there was               a man with a contorted face and a revolver, and shots were still               being fired."
"I froze. 'No,' I said to myself. 'Not again.               Not another Kennedy.'"
In the struggle to subdue Sirhan, Yaro himself grabbed             at the gun before someone else took it away. He took his pictures             and went back to the newspaper.
"After all the questions were over in the newsroom,               I walked back to my cubbyhole darkroom in the photo department               and, out of sight of everybody, I cried hot tears of anger.
"I cried for me and you and all the world. Bobby               would cling to life for another day, but the truth was already               there: Camelot was lost."
Forty years later, the desire for another "Camelot" has             filled supporters of Illinois Senator Barack Obama, likened to the             Kennedy brothers by some from the Massachusetts clan themselves.             In January both John F. Kennedy's brother Senator Edward Kennedy             and the slain president's daughter Caroline suggested Obama was his             spiritual heir. But also, in what came to be seen as an ugly comparison,             Obama's now-vanquished rival Hillary Clinton in May made reference             to their close-quarters battle and the fact that the 1968 race changed             radically when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. The reference provoked             outrage that Clinton was suggesting something nefarious, and she             quickly apologized.
Sirhan, a Christian-born Palestinian who first said             he killed Kennedy over his support for Israel, but whose sanity was             later questioned, was given a life sentence in a California prison,             where he remains today.
