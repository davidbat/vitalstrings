November 22, 1963: Even as the open limousine                        carrying President John F. Kennedy was moving into the cross-hairs                        of an assassin aiming a rifle with telescopic sights in                        Dallas, a high-ranking CIA official in Paris, representing                        himself as the emissary of Attorney General Robert Kennedy,                        was delivering to a Cuban assassin the weapons to kill Castro.
The assassin was Major Rolando Cubela,                        a close associate of Castro's who worked without portfolio                        in the Havana government. He had contacted the CIA and volunteered                        to eliminate Castro, asking specifically for "a high-powered                        rifle with telescopic sights that could be used to kill                        Castro from a distance." The CIA official was Desmond FitzGerald,                        chief of the Special Affairs Section (SAS), the covert unit                        responsible for orchestrating the overthrow of Castro. He                        was accompanied at the meeting by Cubela's CIA case officer.                        They gave Cubela a fountain pen with a hidden needle, capable                        of injecting lethal Blackleaf 40 toxin into a victim without                        his knowledge. FitzGerald explained that the rifle with                        telescopic sights would be delivered to Cubela inside Cuba.
But the CIA's counterintelligence staff,                        under the legendary James Jesus Angleton, had had concerns                        about Cubela's provenance prior to November 22nd, the counterintelligence                        officer working under FitzGerald, had warned that the operation                        was "insecure." And in September, only hours after Cubela                        had first broached, in Brazil, the idea of assassinating                        the Cuban leader, Castro had given an extraordinary interview                        to an American reporter in Havana, saying he knew the American                        government was behind plots to kill him and ominously warning                        he would "answer in kind" any attempts. So in the parallax                        universe of deception, it was a distinct possibility that                        Cubela was an agent provocateur, testing the CIA on behalf                        of Castro. If so, in working with Cubela, FitzGerald had                        inadvertently given Castro evidence of the involvement of                        the highest echelon of American government in the assassination                        plots.
As we now know, Castro's fear of American                        assassination plots was well founded. Subsequent investigations                        by the CIA's Inspector General (1967) and the Church Committee                        (1975) uncovered at least eight separate murder plots against                        Castro, beginning in the summer of 1960, the halcyon days                        of the Eisenhower Administration. Initially, when 32-year                        old Fidel Castro had won power in Cuba in 1959 and toured                        America in triumph, there was hope in Washington that he                        was a democratic reformer. But by mid-1960, after he had                        nationalized foreign property in Cuba, U.S. intelligence                        concluded that he was a Communist, allied with Moscow in                        the Cold War. At the CIA, planning for an American-led invasion                        of Cuba was already underway.
As part of its contingency planning,                        the CIA assigned Colonel Sheffield Edwards, thedirector                        of its office of security, to arrange less expensive ways                        of getting rid of Castro by assassination. Edwards approached                        an ex-FBI agent, Robert Maheu, who had worked with him in                        the past on CIA counterespionage investigations, including                        black bag break-ins, unauthorized wiretaps, and other covert                        operations. He told Maheu there was $150,000 available for                        Castro's assassination. Maheu suggested John Roselli, a                        Mafioso who recruited his two mob bosses, Sam Giancana from                        Chicago and Santo Traficante from New Orleans. The advantage                        to employing the Mafia for this sensitive mission, aside                        from the mob's contacts in the Cuban underworld, was providing                        the CIA with credible cover. If the assassins were killed                        or captured, it would seem plausible to the public that                        the Mafia had ordered the "hit" because Castro had taken                        away its brothels, casinos, and other enterprises in Havana.                        In return, by cooperating with the CIA, the three Mafiosi                        got protection against FBI investigations into their domestic                        criminal enterprises.
Rosselli proposed a simple plan: through                        its underworld connections in Cuba, the Mafia would recruit                        a Cuban in Castro's entourage, such as a waiter or bodyguard,                        who would poison Castro. The CIA's Technical Services Division,                        informally known as its "workshop," was given the job of                        producing and testing on monkeys an untraceable poison.                        It came up with a botulinus toxin that the CIA's Office                        of Medical Services then injected into Castro's favorite                        brand cigars. It also produced simpler botulinus toxin pills                        that could be dissolved in his food or drink. But the deputized                        Mafia contacts failed to deliver any of the poisons to Castro.                        As Rosselli explained to the CIA, the first poisoner had                        been discharged from Castro's employ before he could kill                        him, while a back-up agent got "cold feet."
While the Mafia continued its unsuccessful                        machinations, John F. Kennedy became President and, in April                        1961, launched the Bay of Pigs invasion, an attack on a                        swamp in Cuba by CIA-trained Cuban exiles that ended in                        disaster. Furious at this humiliating failure, Kennedy summoned                        Richard Bissell, the head of the CIA's covert operations,                        to the Cabinet Room and chided him for "sitting on his ass                        and not doing anything about getting rid of Castro and the                        Castro regime" (as Bissell recalled). Richard Helms, who                        succeeded Bissell, also felt "white heat," as he put it,                        from the Kennedys to get rid of Castro.
By then, the Kennedys had set up their                        own covert structure for dealing with the Castro problem                        the Special Group Augmented, which Attorney General Robert                        Kennedy and General Maxwell Taylor effectively ran and which,                        in November 1961, launched a secret war against the Castro                        regime, codenamed Operation Mongoose. Secretary of Defense                        Robert Strange McNamara, who was not a formal member of                        this group but attended meetings, later testified: "We were                        hysterical about Castro at about the time of the Bay of                        Pigs and thereafter. And there was pressure from JFK and                        RFK to do something about Castro." It was a "no holds barred"                        enterprise, as Helms termed it, for which the Special Group                        Augmented assigned such "planning tasks" as using biological                        and chemical warfare against Cuban sugar workers; employing                        Cuban gangsters to kill Cuban police officials, Soviet bloc                        technicians, and other targeted people; using agents to                        sabotage mines; and, in what was called Operation Bounty,                        paying cash bonuses of up to $100,000 for the murder or                        abduction of government officials.
It was in this heightened atmosphere                        that the Richard Bissell turned to a super-secret, codenamed                        ZR/RIFLE, which was meant to give the CIA to on-demand "executive                        action" capacity that could be used against defectors and,                        as a "last resort," could be used to assassinate foreign                        leaders. The head of this program was William "Two Gun"                        Harvey, who had proved himself a dedicated hands-on cold                        warrior as the CIA station chief in Berlin in 1960. For                        the Castro assignment, he was instructed by Bissell to work                        through Rosselli, who was still believed to have underworld                        agents inside Cuba, and finally put ZR/RIFLE to the test                        by killing Castro.
Harvey had a serious security problem,                        however, with Rosselli's two associates, Maheu and Giancana.                        They had invited the unwanted attention of the FBI by citing                        their CIA connection to block an unrelated criminal investigation                        into a wiretap Giancana had planted in a girlfriend's hotel                        room in Las Vegas. Through this intervention, J. Edgar Hoover                        learned about their "dirty business" in Havana. Compromising                        this sensitive operation even further, Hoover also found                        out that another girlfriend of Giancana's named Judith Campbell                        Exner was also a girlfriend of President Kennedy's during                        this period. Hoover then briefed Attorney General Kennedy                        on the Mafia-CIA liaison as well as the more personal liaison                        between Exner and the President. And on April 10, 1962,                        Hoover wrote a memo for the files that Kennedy told him                        that the CIA had briefed him that it had retained Maheu                        to offer Giancana "$150,000 to hire some gunmen to go into                        Cuba and to kill Castro." Although this maneuver by Hoover                        greatly vitiated the possibility of total deniability for                        the Attorney General, it mentioned only Maheu and Giancana,                        not Rosselli. So the plan could proceed.
