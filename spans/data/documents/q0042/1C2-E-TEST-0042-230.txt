He was 21 when he married his 16-year-old neighbor, Norma Jean                   Baker, in 1942. Jeanne Carmen, Marilyn's closest friend in                   Hollywood, Mickey Rooney, who co-starred with Marilyn in one                   of her earliest films, 1950' "The Fireball," Cyd Charisse,                   the brilliant, beautiful dancer who co-starred in Marilyn's                   unfinished final film, 1962's "Something's Got to Give," and                   columnist and author James Bacon, first reporter on the scene                   when Marilyn's body was found, and so close to Marilyn, he                   was once her lover.
An                       Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963 by                       Robert Dallek --Drawing upon previously unavailable material                       and never-before-opened archives to tell for the first                       time how sick Kennedy was, what medications he took and                       concealed, and how severely his medical condition affected                       his actions. We learn the real story of how Bobby was selected                       as Attorney General. Dallek reveals what Jack's father                       did to help his election to the presidency, and follows                       evidence to show what path JFK would have taken in the                       Vietnam entanglement. Never shying away from Kennedy's                       weaknesses, Dallek explores his strengths. The result is                       a portrait of a bold, brave, human.
Jack                       Anderson: JFK, the Mob & Me -- Jack Anderson                       one of the most respected and accomplished investigative                       journalists details his close relationship with John F.                       Kennedy and his belief the Mafia was involved in his assassination.                       Anderson's theory is bolstered by close contacts with important                       Mob bosses in the 1950s, '60s and '70s, and revelations                       of organized crime's relationships with Castro, Cuba, and                       the CIA. Extensive footage documents the relationships                       Anderson claims were at the heart of the tragedy, and interviews                       with Anderson sources shed light on the theory. Revisit                       the discoveries that led Anderson to the conclusion embraced                       by conspiracy theorists worldwide. Oliver Stone tells how                       Anderson's work influenced his Academy- Award winning JFK.

Marilyn                 Monroe - The Diamond Collection -- DVD -- VHS --
5 Marilyn Monroe films plus the documentary The Final Days.                 Bus Stop (1956) stars Monroe as a singer who finds herself                 trapped at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere during a blizzard. How                 to Marry a Millionaire (1953) was built around Monroe, Lauren                 Bacall, and Betty Grable, who play friends with a plan to find                 and marry rich men. Monroe plays an ambitious showgirl in 1954's There's                 No Business Like Show Business, which brings together Ethel                 Merman and Irving Berlin to celebrate vaudeville. Howard Hawks's                 1953 musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes stars Monroe and                 Jane Russell as friends who go to Paris looking for mates. The                 Seven Year Itch (1955) is a memorable laugh machine. A married                 man left alone during a hot summer, matched by Monroe's zesty                 comic flair, and the scene in which her white dress is blown                 skyward by a passing subway train has entered the encyclopedia                 of great movie images. In The Final Days, producer-director                 Patty Ivins chronicles Monroe's final, aborted feature film, Something's                 Got to Give, which was ultimately shut down after the star                 was dismissed from the production. Beyond Monroe's fragile emotional                 and physical health, this profile examines the financial crisis                 facing her studio as well as the mounting frustration as Monroe's                 absences drove the shoot over budget. The documentary concludes                 with a 40-minute reconstruction of footage completed for the                 feature, which would subsequently be reshot as a vehicle for                 Doris Day and James Garner, Move Over, Darling.

Milton's                       Marilyn: The Photographs of Milton H. Greene
by Milton H. Greene, James Kotsilibas-Davis
Milton Greene "the greatest photographer of women." Milton's                 Marilyn appears as enchanting gypsy, saloon girl, barely clad                 ballerina, innocent high school yearbook heartthrob, and screen                 siren in incendiary scarlet dress. He also captures privileged                 glimpses of her private life: clowning with her boyfriend Brando,                 backstage on films, frolicsome in a swimming pool. In some shots,                 she wears no makeup. In others, she's tipsy; she used to travel                 with Greene under the name Zelda Zonk. Rock                 Hudson spurned the costar role in Bus Stop because producer Milton                 Greene rebuffed                 Rock's sexual proposition. Greene was Monroe's                 business partner and mentor until he outlived his usefulness,                 and this book adds interesting news to Barbara Leaming's intelligent                 bio Marilyn Monroe.

Marilyn                         Monroe by Barbara Leaming
Barbara Leaming,                         a literary star among movie-star biographers, offers                         the last thing you'd expect in a book on Marilyn Monroe:                         new information from verifiable sources. Sure, lots of                         the tragedy is familiar: an abused, confused girl from                         an orphanage with a mother in a madhouse rises from sexual                         party favor for homely showbiz men to the movie superstar                         who pushes them around, until she crashes, a victim of                         self-loathing and drug addiction. The thing about a tragedy                 is that its heroine isn't a victim--she's responsible for her                 fate. Digging up hard facts from sources like UCLA's 20th Century                 Fox collection and diary-like first drafts of Arthur Miller's                 semiautobiographical work, Leaming makes                 sense of Monroe's motives. She solves Monroe's suicide with clues                 from the star's psychiatrist's letters in the Anna Freud collection.                 Her last overdose may have happened because her shrink went to                 dinner with his wife and she felt abandoned. But Monroe wasn't                 a candle in the wind. She burned with ambition and knew how to                 craft a persona and play power games--with moguls and with the                 commie-busters hounding her husband Miller. Leaming analyzes                 the Miller-Monroe-Elia Kazan love/hate triangle, sizes up the                 Kennedy connection, busts her acting coach Lee Strasberg as "chillingly                 mercenary," and shows how her life entangled her art, film by                 film.

Marilyn                       Monroe: The Complete Last Sitting by                       Bert Stern
The more than 2,500 shots that make up this tribute                 to Monroe were taken by renowned fashion photographer Bert Stern                 over the course of a 3-day sitting-the last time Marilyn would                 pose in front of a camera. Six weeks later, she was found dead                 in her home. The images project a haunting, dreamlike quality.                 Marilyn was known to possess an ability to transform herself                 into whatever role she was to play. In these pages she is goddess,                 siren, child, woman, femme fatale and dream date. Yet there is                 an air of desperation about these photos. Stern looks back on                 that sitting, offering a revealing, naked portrait of Marilyn -a                 vulnerable, confused woman who at the apex of her career, relinquished                 control of her life.
