"It                        doesn't matter how bad your day is going, he comes up and                        gives you a hug and says 'I love you' and the bad day is                        washed away." - Allison Boozer, 2002 (Teacher of                        Special Education, T.L.

Over what exact period of time does the film's story                        take place?
In                        real life, Coach Harold Jones first lured Radio onto the                        field with a bottle of soda (not a water bottle) in 1964.                        The film's story was condensed to take place over the course                        of one year from 1976 to 1977. Director Michael Tollin explained, "What we decided to do was to take a year right in                        the middle of this sweeping four decades, and show the convergence                        of events that led to Radio becoming an integral part of                        society in this small town. We intentionally wanted to be                        vague about it because the film is loosely inspired by Radio's                        story, which has gone on for so many years and continues                        to this day. That gives it a timeless quality and allowed                        us to focus more on the development of the relationship                        between the two central characters. Rather than make a biography,                        I see Radio as a story about two very different men                        who are united by their humanity." -SonyPictures.com
Who gave James Robert Kennedy the nickname 'Radio'?
The folks in his hometown gave him this nickname because                        of his fascination with the device that he took everywhere                        with him since he was a little boy. Each year, coach Harold                        Jones buys him a new radio for Christmas. Like in the film,                        coach Jones delivers Radio's many Christmas and birthday                        presents to him using the bed of his pickup truck.
Did some of the boys on the team really tie Radio up                        and lock him in a small storage room next to the field?
No, this likely did not happen. It is however, a variation                        on equally cruel pranks that some of the students pulled                        on Radio. Perhaps even worse was the real occasion when                        a group of kids pulled down Radio's pants and painted his                        lower backside with paint thinner, which burned him rather                        severely. On another occasion, they told him to pull the                        lever on a fire alarm, which resulted in him being hulled                        off to jail. -Sports Illustrated
What is really wrong with Radio?
As his mother in the film, actress Sharon Epatha Merkerson,                        stated, there is no name for what is wrong with Radio. It is almost certainly a genetic disorder, because both his                        father and his younger brother, Cool Rock (George Allan                        Kennedy), share the same defect. Cool Rock, who is two years                        younger than Radio and shares a bedroom with him, still                        can't be understood when he attempts to speak. Although,                        unlike Radio, he hasn't been loved and cared for by an entire                        school for over 30 years.
In                        the film, is coach Jones' story about the boy kept locked                        under a house true?
During                        an emotional moment in the film, coach Harold Jones (Ed                        Harris) told his daughter, Mary Helen, about a mentally                        handicapped young boy who was kept locked in an open area                        under a house. He said that he would see the boy when he                        was delivering newspapers many years earlier. In the "making                        of the film" on the Radio DVD, screenwriter Mike Rich                        explained that he and coach Jones had a conversation about                        the boy. Director Michael Tollin also stated on the DVD                        that it was in fact true, and that it took coach Jones years                        to open up about what he had witnessed.
So, what made coach Harold Jones invite Radio into his                        life and into the lives of those at T.L. Hanna?
When coach Jones was growing up in Anderson, S.C., a mentally                        disabled boy lived across the street. Jones defended the                        boy from anyone who picked on him. Also, while working at                        his grandfather's theater, it was Jones who would sneak                        in a retarded man and give him a box of popcorn. -Sports                        Illustrated
Who has looked out for Radio's health and physical well                        being?
In                        the Sports Illustrated article, assistant coach Honeycutt                        remarked, "Radio would be dead by now if not for coach                        Jones." It was coach Jones who took Radio to the doctor every year,                        modifying Radio's diet when his blood pressure and cholesterol                        readings were far too high, in addition to making sure his                        medical and dental bills were paid.
Did                        Radio really get left behind for a road game, having to                        stand and watch as the bus pulled away?
This did happen. It was in 1974 when coach Jones was only an assistant (he did not make head coach of varsity until                        the 1980s). However, it wasn't the principal who forbid                        him from going. It was coach Fraser, the head coach then,                        who decided that the bus was too crowded for Radio to make                        the journey to Northwestern High. The team lost the game                        27-20. After that day, Radio was taken to every game, and                        the T.L. Hanna Yellow Jackets went all the way to the state                        final that year. -Sports Illustrated
When did Radio's mother actually pass away in real life?
Although                        the depiction of the day that Radio's mother died is accurate,                        in real life she did not pass away until August of 1994.                        Upset with grief, Radio smashed two holes in a wall of his                        house. Police came to restrain him. With the absence of                        his mother, Radio would have no one to be with him in the                        evenings. Fortunately, Radio's brother Walter and his wife                        Pat began taking care of him after school. Hanna and coach                        Jones did the rest. -Sports Illustrated
Did coach Harold Jones really quit coaching football                        to spend more time with his family?
This is more than likely an element of fiction created to                        emphasize Radio's effect on the coach in the film. In reality,                        I found no record of coach Harold Jones quitting                         coaching for any period of time. In 1998, principal Mike Sams asked                        the athletic director and head football coach of 14 years                        to step down from his position. "I just decided after                        looking at everything over the last couple of years that                        it was time to go in a different direction," said Sams.                        Coach Jones, upset by the news, responded by saying, "I                        was asked to resign or retire, and I refused, so I guess                        you have to say I was fired." Sams said that they wanted                        to hire someone who had more experience dealing with other                        sports.

How did Cuba Gooding Jr. feel about playing Radio?
After                        viewing footage of the real Radio, Cuba Gooding Jr. made                        the following observance, "The man has an abundance                        of energy, but different from the kind of energy I had in                        movies like Jerry Maguire. In a very open and uncensored                        way, he demonstrated a great joy in being alive, and that                        pleasure was infectious to all those around him. I couldn't                        wait to get into that mindset."
What inspired director Michael Tollin to turn the story                        of Radio into a feature film?
While on a ski vacation in Aspen, Colorado in 1996, director/producer                        Michael Tollin picked up an issue of Sports Illustrated,                        in which he read Gary Smith's article on James Robert Kennedy                        (Radio) titled "Someone to Lean On." It was the springboard that inspired him to obtain the rights                        and to begin working on getting a film version to the screen.                        Perhaps what encouraged him most was his previous work with                        the mentally challenged. In 1990, Michael Tollin led a group                        of 12 Special Olympians on a trek up Mt. Kilimanjaro, and                        through the expedition, he came to fully realize the remarkable                        potential of such individuals. Tollin, a sports enthusiast,                        was also nominated for an Academy Award for his documentary Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream, for which he won a                        Peabody Award. He has created other sports-themed films,                        including Hardball and Varsity Blues. -SonyPictures.com
