PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy and his fiancee plan to be married this week at a private wedding ceremony at the Kennedy family’s Cape Cod compound.

Gene Healy, author of The Cult of the Presidencyâ€”Americaâ€™s Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power, suggests: â€œIn an age when Americans periodically swoon for imperial presidents, a little sacred cow-tipping would be a public service.â€ The made-for-television mini-series, The Kennedys, recently airing on ReelzChannel is a case in point. Unceremoniously cancelled earlier this year by The History Channel as not a good â€œfitâ€ for â€œthe History brand,â€ the project was controversial almost from its inception. This had to do completely with the hypersensitivity of a vast array of myth-guardians who stand perpetual watch over the Kennedy family, as well as the...
