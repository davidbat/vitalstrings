Kennedy and Cuba
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has ruled Cuba since 1959 and outlasted all of his enemies.
On January 1, 1959, guerrilla leader Fidel Castro succeeded in overthrowing the dictator Fulgencia Batista. While initially the U.S. had offered support and encouragement to Castro, that quickly soured as Castro began expropriating lands owned by such companies as United Fruit. Castro struck a deal in February 1960 to purchase oil from the USSR, and when U.S. refineries in Cuba refused to process that oil, he expropriated their facilities. This led the US to break off diplomatic relations.
Soon, U.S. leaders were contemplating the overthrow of Castro by force.  Kennedy inherited the plan begun under Eisenhower for a CIA-run invasion using Cuban exiles. In April 1961, the Bay of Pigs operation was launched, and it quickly ended in disaster.  U.S. hostilities to Cuba didn’t end, however. Operation Mongoose, run out of the White House by the Special Group, managed sabotage and other covert operations. In 1962, the Soviet Union secretly installed nuclear missiles in Cuba; when these were discovered the two superpowers went "eyeball to eyeball," and all-out nuclear war was narrowly averted.
During all this time, various plots to assassinate Castro were undertaken by CIA-led operatives. And even while these plots were still in the works, the Kennedy administration initiated secret contacts with Castro to try to reach an accommodation. These contacts ended with Kennedy’s death.
Is there a connection between Kennedy's death and the covert war against Cuba? Some experts point to Fidel Castro and his reasons for wanting to do away with Kennedy. But the war on Cuba, and perceived laxity on JFK's part in fighting it, also inflamed those in the Cuban exile community, the CIA, and in organized crime who were vehement opponents of Castro. And these groups had already been brought together in plots to eliminate Castro. So did these men, exasperated with Kennedy's failure at the Bay of Pigs, and his perceived weakness in the later Cuban Missile Crisis, turn their guns on JFK?
