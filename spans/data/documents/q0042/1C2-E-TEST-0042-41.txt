Add up all the lengthy and outwardly high quality publications on the JFK case and you have many hundreds if not thousands of well presented views on one of the world's most celebrated unsolved murders. But they cannot all be right can they ! This one is certainly not ! If you are new to the case this is a good starting point in that it is reasonably detailed in its coverage of the days events and gives an interesting overview of the possible political motives of would be conspirators over the months before Dallas. The failing of the book (and the failing of many books on this case) is that it relies heavily on secondary sources of evidence and also on subsequently disproved theories. It is in many ways then a book about books. The central theory on the assassins is that put forward by the late eighties Central TV documentary by Nigel Turner - "The men who killed Kennedy". This I am afraid was long ago put to shame on the realisation that one of the would be assassins was on a submarine on Nov 22nd 1963 and another was blind in one eye. Don't be persuaded by the myth that JFK could not have been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. This book takes a lot of risks with evidence, relies heavily on conjecture and places huge emphasis on outdated theories. If you want a more rounded overview go to Anthony Summers for the pro conspiracy view and Gerald Postner or Mel Ayton for the Oswald did it view. By the way for all those buffs out there few books seems to mention that the so called magic bullet that hit Governor Conally was tumbling when it hit him in the back. It had therefore hit something else before. Think about it ! This book doesn't. But it's a reasonable read.
