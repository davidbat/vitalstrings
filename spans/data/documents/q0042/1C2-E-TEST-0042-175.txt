Castro              Ordered Kennedy's Assassination,
According to a German Documentary
German filmmaker Wilfried Huismann spent years digging into the assassination              of US President John F. Kennedy. His documentary "Rendezvous              With Death -- Why Kennedy Had to Die," about Cuban leader Fidel              Castro's role in the murder is set to premiere Friday, January 6,              2006 on German public TV.
In an interview with Germany's international braodcaster Deutch Welle,              Huismann says he spent three years researching for his documentary              in Mexico, the United States and Cuba.
He found strong ties between Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who murdered              Kennedy, and Fidel Castro. Several witnesses are shown in the film,              including Cuban former secret agents, U.S officials, and a Russian              intelligence source. Huismann also did some research in Mexican security              archives.
"Oswald had been an agent for the Cuban intelligence services              since November 1962. He was a political fanatic and allowed himself              to be used by the Cuban intelligence services to kill John F. Kennedy," Huismann added.
The film, shown to journalists in Berlin on Wednesday, says Oswald              traveled to Mexico City by bus in September 1963, seven weeks before              the Kennedy shooting, and met agents at the Cuban embassy there who              paid him $6,500.
Oscar Marino, a former Cuban agent and a key source for the documentary,              told Huismann that Oswald himself had volunteered for the assassination              mission and Havana had exploited him.
"Oswald was a dissident. He hated his country…Oswald offered              to kill Kennedy," Marino said in the film.
He said he knew with certainty that the assassination was an operation              of the Cuban secret service G-2, but would not say if it was ordered              by Fidel Castro.
"It was a Cuban reaction to the repeated attempts of the Kennedy              brothers, above all the younger Kennedy, Robert, to get rid of Fidel              Castro through political assassination -- a duel between the Kennedys              and the Castros, which, like in a Greek tragedy, left one of the duelists              dead," Huismann said to DW journalist Jose Ospina Valencia.
After Kennedy's death on Nov. 22, 1963, Huismann says, Lyndon B. Johnson              found out that the US had a secret, illegal murder program focused              on Fidel Castro. He hadn't been informed before that. He knew that              Castro knew, and he was afraid that the discovery of these mutual              assassination attempts could force him to carry out an invasion of              Cuba, which he believed could result in a third -- nuclear -- world              war. And as a conservative pragmatist, he decided within a few hours,              in agreement with Robert Kennedy, to drop the whole thing and to ban              FBI and CIA officials from pursuing the trail leading to Cuba.
Laurence Keenan, an officer of the Federal Bureau of Investigation              (FBI) who was sent to Mexico City immediately after Kennedy's death              to investigate a possible Cuban connection, said he was recalled after              just three days and the probe was aborted.
"This was perhaps the worst investigation the FBI was ever involved              in," Keenan said. "I realized that I was used. I felt ashamed.              We missed a moment in history."
Questioned about a possible prosecution of Castro for his alleged              responsibility in the Kennedy's murder, the filmmaker said it could              never happen.
"In my opinion, even the conservative Bush government wouldn't              take any political or legal steps to avenge the crime. Then they'd              also have to put the American politicians on trial who were involved              in assassinating foreign statesmen. They include Alexander Haig, who              testified as a witness in my film, and others who are still alive," Huismann said.
