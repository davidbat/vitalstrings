8-Unclassified
DESTROY WHEN NO LONGER NEEDED
a. To discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.
b. To employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passage to assets. Our play should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (i) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (ii) politically interested, (iii) financially interested, (iv) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (v) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher Knebel article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing than Epstein's and comes off badly where contested by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)
4. In private or media discussion not directed at any particular writer, or in attacking publications which may be yet forthcoming, the following arguments should be useful:
a. No significant new evidence has emerged which the Commission did not consider. The assassination is sometimes compared (e.g., by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell) with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attacks on the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new culprits have been convincingly identified, and there is no agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, A.J.P. Taylor, D.C. Watt) now believe was set by Van der Lubbe on his own initiative, without acting for either Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the blame on the Communists, but the latter have been much more successful in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.)
b. Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the recollections of individual eyewitnesses (which are less reliable and more divergent -- and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and less on ballistic, autopsy, and photographic evidence. A close examination of the Commission's records will usually show that the conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were discarded by the commission for good and sufficient reason.
c. Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States, esp. since informants could expect to receive large royalties, etc. Note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and John F. Kennedy's brother, would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy. And as one reviewer pointed out, Congressman Gerald R. Ford would hardly have held his tongue for the sake of the Democratic administration, and Senator Russell would have had every political interest in exposing any misdeeds on the part of Chief Justice Warren. A conspirator moreover would hardly choose a location for a shooting where so much depended on conditions beyond his control: the route, the speed of the cars, the moving target, the risk that the assassin would be discovered. A group of wealthy conspirators could have arranged much more secure conditions.
d. Critics have often been enticed by a form of intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love with it; they also scoff at the Commission because it did not always answer every question with a flat decision one way or the other. Actually, the make-up of the Commission and its staff was an excellent safeguard against over-commitment to any one theory; or against the illicit transformation of probabilities into certainties.
e. Oswald would not have been any sensible person's choice for a co-conspirator. He was a "loner," mixed-up, of questionable reliability and an unknown quantity to any professional intelligence service.
f. As to charges that the Commission's report was a rush job, it emerged three months after the deadline originally set. But to the degree that the Commission tried to speed up its reporting, this was largely due to the pressure of irresponsible speculation already appearing, in some cases coming from the same critics who, refusing to admit their errors, are now putting out new criticisms.
g. Such vague accusations as that "more than ten people have died mysteriously" can always be explained in some more natural way: e.g., the individuals concerned have for the most part died of natural causes; the Commission staff questioned 418 witnesses (the FBI interviewed far more people, conducting 25,000 interviews and reinterviews), and in such a large group, a certain number of deaths are to be expected. (When Penn Jones, one of the originators of the "ten mysterious deaths" line, appeared on television, it emerged that two of the deaths on his list were from heart attacks, one from cancer, one was from a head-on collision on a bridge, and one occurred when a driver drifted into a bridge abutment.)
5. Where possible, counter speculation by encouraging reference to the Commission's Report itself. Open-minded foreign readers should still be impressed by the care, thoroughness, objectivity and speed with which the Commission worked. Reviewers of other books might be encouraged to add to their account the idea that, checking back with the Report itself, they found it far superior to the work of its critics.
Jim Garrison's autobiography "On the trail of the Assassins"
Garrison conducted the only prosecution of a conspirator in the Kennedy                assassination (which was ultimately unsuccessful). His autobiography is                a fascinating expose of how the coup was conducted, who benefitted, who                covered it up, and how the lone prosecution was sabotaged by covert interests                and the media. Oliver Stone's famous film "JFK" is based on                Garrison's story.
today in America too much emphasis is given to secrecy, with regard to                  the assassination of our President, and not enough emphasis is given to                  the question of justice and to the question of humanity.
These dignified deceptions will not suffice. We have had enough of power                  without truth. We don't have to accept power without truth or else leave                  the country. I don't accept either of these two alternatives. I don't                  intend to leave the country and I don't intend to accept power without                  truth.
I intend to fight for the truth. I suggest that not only is this not un-American,                  but it is the most American thing we can do--because if the truth does                  not endure, then our country will not endure.
In our country the worst of all crimes occurs when the government murders                  truth. If it can murder truth, it can murder freedom. If it can murder                  freedom, it can murder your own sons--if they should dare to fight for                  freedom-- and then it can announce that they were killed in an industrial                  accident, or shot by the "enemy" or God knows what. ....
"I think that there are still enough Americans left in this country                  to make it continue to be America. I think that we can still fight authoritarianism--the                  government's insistence on secrecy, government force used in counterattacks                  against an honest inquiry--and when we do that, we're not being un-American,                  we're being American. It isn't easy. You're sticking your neck out in                  a rather permanent way, but it has to be done because truth does not come                  into being automatically. Individual men, like the members of my staff                  here, have to work and fight to make it happen--and individual men like                  you have to make justice come into being because otherwise is doesn't                  happen.
"What I'm trying to tell you is that there are forces in America                  today, unfortunately, which are not in favor of the truth coming out about                  John Kennedy's assassination. As long as our government continues to be                  like this, as long as such forces can get away with such actions, then                  this is no longer the country in which we were born."
-- excerpt from closing statement of Jim Garrison in                  the prosecution of Clay Shaw for participation in the conspiracy to murder                  President Kennedy, February 28, 1969

PLAYBOY: Many of the professional critics of the Warren Commission                  appear to be prompted by political motives: Those on the left are anxious                  to prove Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy within the establishment;                  and those on the right are eager to prove the assassination was an act                  of "the international Communist conspiracy." Where would you                  place yourself on the political spectrum -- right, left of center?
GARRISON: That's a question I've asked myself frequently, especially                  since this investigation started and I found myself in an incongruous                  and disillusioning battle with agencies of my own Government. I can't                  just sit down and add up my political beliefs like a mathematical sum,                  but I think, in balance, I'd turn up somewhere around the middle. Over                  the years, I guess I've developed a somewhat conservative attitude --                  in the traditional libertarian sense of conservatism, as opposed to                  the thumbscrew-and-rack conservatism of the paramilitary right -- particularly                  in regard to the importance of the individual as opposed to the state                  and the individual's own responsibilities to humanity. I don't think                  I've ever tried to formulate this into a coherent political philosophy,                  but at the root of my concern is the conviction that a human being is                  not a digit; he's not a digit in regard to the state and he's not a                  digit in the sense that he can ignore his fellow men and his obligations                  to society. I was with the artillery supporting the division that took                  Dachau; I arrived there the day after it was taken, when bulldozers                  were making pyramids of human bodies outside the camp. What I saw there                  has haunted me ever since. Because the law is my profession, I've always                  wondered about the judges throughout Germany who sentenced men to jail                  for picking pockets at a time when their own government was jerking                  gold from the teeth of men murdered in gas chambers. I'm concerned about                  all of this because it isn't a German phenomenon; it's a human                    phenomenon. It can happen here, because there has been no change                  and there has been no progress and there has been no increase of understanding                  on the part of men for their fellow man. What worries me deeply, and                  I have seen it exemplified in this case, is that we in America                    are in great danger of slowly evolving into a proto-fascist state. It                    will be a different kind of fascist state from the one of the Germans                    evolved; theirs grew out of depression and promised bread and work,                    while ours, curiously enough, seems to be emerging from prosperity.                    But in the final analysis, it's based on power and on the inability                    to put human goals and human conscience above the dictates of the state.                    Its origins can be traced in the tremendous war machine we've built                    since 1945, the "military-industrial complex" that Eisenhower                    vainly warned us about, which now dominates every aspect of our life.                    The power of the states and Congress has gradually been abandoned to                    the Executive Department, because of war conditions; and we've seen                    the creation of an arrogant, swollen bureaucratic complex totally unfettered                    by the checks and balances of the Constitution. In a very real and terrifying                    sense, our Government is the CIA and the Pentagon, with Congress reduced                    to a debating society. Of course, you can't spot this trend                  to fascism by casually looking around. You can't look for such familiar                  signs as the swastika, because they won't be there. We won't build Dachaus                  and Auschwitzes; the clever manipulation of the mass media is                    creating a concentration camp of the mind that promises to be far more                    effective in keeping the populace in line. We're not going                  to wake up one morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms                  goose-stepping off to work. But this isn't the test. The test is: What                  happens to the individual who dissents? In Nazi Germany, he was physically                  destroyed; here, the process is more subtle, but the end results can                  be the same. I've learned enough about the machinations of the CIA in                  the past year to know that this is no longer the dreamworld America                  I once believed in. The imperatives of the population explosion,                    which almost inevitably will lessen our belief in the sanctity of the                    individual human life, combined with the awesome power of the CIA and                    the defense establishment, seem destined to seal the fate of the America I knew as a child and bring us into a new Orwellian world where the                    citizen exists for the state and where raw power justifies any and every                    immoral act. I've always had a kind of knee-jerk trust in my                  Government's basic integrity, whatever political blunders it may make.                  But I've come to realize that in Washington, deceiving and manipulating                  the public are viewed by some as the natural prerogatives of office.                  Huey Long once said, "Fascism will come to America in the name                  of anti-fascism." I'm afraid, based on my own experience, that fascism will come to America in the name of national security.
