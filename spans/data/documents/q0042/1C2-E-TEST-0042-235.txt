To         Think About:
1.   Study         Source A.  Why was Cuba so         important for the Americans?
2.   Take each of the causes of the Cuban Missiles crisis, and explain how it caused the crisis.
   
   
Events
14       Oct:      U2 spy-plane       takes pictures of Missile bases in Cuba - experts tell Kennedy he has 10       days before they are operational.
 
16       Oct:      Kennedy set up a       Committee of the National Security Council to advise him.
22       Oct:      Kennedy announced that he was mounting a naval blockade of Cuba.
 
B52 nuclear bombers were deployed, so that one-eighth of them were        airborne all the time.   That night, Oleg Penkovsky – a        Western spy working in Russia – was arrested.   His last message read;        ‘Soviet attack imminent’.
23       Oct:      Khrushchev explained        that the missile sites were ‘solely to defend Cuba against the attack of        an aggressor’.   20 Russian ships were heading for Cuba.
24       Oct:    
Khrushchev accused America of piracy.   He warned that Russia would get ready ‘a fitting reply to the       aggressor’.  
25        Oct:     The first Russian ship reached the naval blockade.   It was an oil       ship and was allowed through.   All the       other Russian ships (carrying missiles) turned back.   Secretly, the US        government offered to remove US missiles in Turkey in exchange for those        in Cuba.
26       Oct:    
Russia was still building the missile bases, and Kennedy started        planning a military attack on Cuba - until, at 6pm, Khrushchev sent a telegram to Kennedy, offering to dismantle the sites if Kennedy would lift the        blockade and agree not to invade Cuba - the Americans        comment: ‘the other fellow just blinked’.   The Kennedy brothers saw        the Russian ambassador, and again mentioned removing the missiles in        Turkey.
27       Oct:     Before Kennedy could reply, Khrushchev sent another letter ,       demanding that Kennedy also dismantle American missile bases in Turkey.   On the same day, a U2 plane was shot down over Cuba.  
                   It looked as if war was about to happen.
                   Kennedy ignored the plane incident.   He also ignored Khrushchev’s second letter – he       wrote simply that would lift the blockade and agree not to invade Cuba if       Khrushchev would dismantle the missile bases.
    He       also offered secretly to dismantle the Turkish missile bases.
28       Oct:     Khrushchev       agreed.   The crisis       finished.
20       Nov:     Russian bombers left Cuba, and Kennedy lifted the       naval blockade.
 
Listen to Kennedy and his advisers         discussing how to         react ( audio / transcript ) !!!
They         decided that their options were:
1.   Nuclear         Strike?   It would cause a nuclear war.
2.   Conventional         attack?   There were Russian troops in Cuba, and it would probably lead to         a war with Russia.
3.   Use         the UN?   Too slow.
4.   Do         nothing?   The missile bases were too dangerous.
5.   Blockade?   This would stop the missiles getting to         the missile bases, but it was not a direct act of war.
