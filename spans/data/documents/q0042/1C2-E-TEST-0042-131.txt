Factual errors:  In the movie, Kruschev's acceptance of peace contains the line "you and I should not now pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the harder you and I pull, the tighter the knot will become..." The quote goes on at some length and can be seen in the message coming in over the teletype.

It did not appear in his October 27, 1962 acceptance of the American conciliation terms. See more  »
