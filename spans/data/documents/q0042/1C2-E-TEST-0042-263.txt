Click for Serrano Interrogation. MP3 format
This is the official LAPD audio tape of the lie detector test given to witness Sandy Serrano who claimed she saw a woman in a polka dot dress running from the Robert Kennedy assassination exclaiming "We shot him". The interviewing officer, LAPD Detective Hank Hernandez, was rumored to have intelligence connections, which would explain his having administered a lie detector test to the dictator of Venzuela just prior to doing the same to Sandy Serrano. This audio tape excerpt of the interview was obtained by Serrano's lawyers when she sued the LAPD.
I include this audio sample here to prove an historical tendency for law enforcement officials with intelligence connections to harass and intimidate witnesses. There is no confusing whatsoever that Hernandez' intent is to convince Sandy Serrano to alter her story. Hernandez spent 50 minutes trying to get Sandy to alter her story. This tape covers only a small portion of what went on.
Given this prior proof of such practices, claims by present witnesses of attempts to coerce their testimony in regards to the Vincent Foster affair cannot easily be dismissed.
The above image is a scan of the actual LAPD teletype that announced the arrest of Sirhan Sirhan. Notice that it mentions the woman in the polka dot dress that Detective Hank Hernandez told Sandy Serrano did not exist!
