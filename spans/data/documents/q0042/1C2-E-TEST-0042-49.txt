Robert F. Kennedy: (April 4, 1968 on the campaign trail in Indianapolis, Indiana) Martin Luther King has been shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee. [audience shrieks]  For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel, in my own heart, the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.  It is not the end of violence, it is not the end of lawlessness and it's not the end of disorder; but the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.
