[snipping earlier portion of interview]
Martin:
All right.  Now, Vietnam began in the first--on the 3rd of January started appearing rather prominently in the papers and, of course, still is, and was all through '63.  Do you want to talk about it now?  Do you want to wait till we come and pick up the coup later?  In, on, in January, the Vietnamese killed three Americans and shot down five helicopters.
Kennedy:
Viet Cong, you mean.
Martin:
That's right.  That's what I mean, I'm sorry, Viet Cong.  A little later Mansfield said that we were, this thing was turning into an American war and wasn't justified by our national interest; we hadn't any business going in so deep, but we kept going in deeper.  The president sent Maxwell Taylor and McNamara out there. And then, and Lodge, he appointed Lodge as the ambassador--and you remember the hassle between the CIA and Lodge.  The president brought the CIA fellow back, and, in the end, there was the coup against the Diem brothers.  Do you want to discuss the whole thing now?  You must have been in on a good deal of this.
Kennedy:
Yes.  Well, yeah, what do you want to start with?
Martin:
All right.  At the beginning we seemed to have our lines crossed.  I mean, the majority leader in the Senate, Mansfield, was saying this was not an American war, and he didn't think it was--that our--it should be--not, not--should not be an American war. He didn't think our heavy commitment there was justified.  How'd you feel about it; how'd the president feel about it; and at what point did we get our lines straightened out?
Kennedy:
Well, I don't think that . . .
Martin:
Did I make myself clear?
Kennedy:
No, I don't think that fact, Senator Mansfield or somebody in the Senate takes a position, necessarily means .. .
Martin:
Well, he was majority leader.
Kennedy:
Yeah, but, you know, he's frequently taken that, those, that line or that position on some of these matters.  I don't think that the fact he has an independent view from the executive branch of the government, particularly in Southeast Asia, indicates that the lines aren't straight.  I, no, I just, I think every. . . . I, the president felt that the. . . .  He had a strong, overwhelming reason for being in Vietnam and that we should win the war in Vietnam.
Martin:
What was the overwhelming reason?
Kennedy:
Just the loss of all of Southeast Asia if you lost Vietnam.  I think everybody was quite clear that the rest of Southeast Asia would fall.
Martin:
What if it did?
Kennedy:
Just have profound effects as far as our position throughout the world, and our position in a rather vital part of the world.  Also, it would affect what happened in India, of course, which in turn has an effect on the Middle East.  Just, it would have, everybody felt, a very adverse effect.  It would have an effect on Indonesia, hundred million population.  All of these countries would be affected by the fall of Vietnam to the Communists, particularly as we had made such a fuss in the United States both under President Eisenhower and President Kennedy about the preservation of the integrity of Vietnam.
Martin:
There was never any consideration given to pulling out?
Kennedy:
