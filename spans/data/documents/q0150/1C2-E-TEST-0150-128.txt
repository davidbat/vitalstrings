What is kilogray?
Kilogray is a derived metric (SI) measurement unit of absorbed radiation dose of ionizing radiation, e.g. X-rays. The SI prefix kilo stands for one thousand. The kilogray is equal to one thousand gray (1000Gy), and the gray is defined as the absorption of one joule of ionizing radiation by one kilogram (1 J/kg) of matter, e.g. human tissue. read more... »
What is surface density or areal density measurement?
The surface density of a two-dimensional object, also known as area or areal density, is defined as the mass of the object per unit of area. The derived SI unit of the surface density measurement is kilogram per square meter (kg/m²). The surface density is used to measure the thickness of paper, fabric and other thin materials. read more... »
