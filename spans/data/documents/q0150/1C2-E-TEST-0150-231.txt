I need to know the formula for converting Cubic Yards into pounds or tons
The formula depends on the density or specific gravity of the substance.  One cubic yard of feather is lighter than 1 cubic yard of iron.  For example 1 cubic yard of water weight about 1686 lbs.  This could be taken as a rough approximation for most water-based liquids.
