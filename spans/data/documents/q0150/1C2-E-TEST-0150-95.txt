APEX Self-Dumping Hoppers
One operator        can effectively transport and dump bulk materials by simply adjusting        the forks on the lift truck carrying the hopper to the proper        dumping height, releasing the safety latch, and swinging the        release handle upward. The self-dumping, self-righting, self-locking        features do the rest and the hopper is ready for the next load.
Both pallet,        skid-mounted and caster-mounted hoppers are designed to permit        stacking without the use of special attachments. Stacking feature        is fully supported by resting on the lower hopper (standard thru        2 cu. yd).
