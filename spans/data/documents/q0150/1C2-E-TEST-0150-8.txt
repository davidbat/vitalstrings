A cubic yard is a measurement of volume. One cubic yard (yard^3) means you have a space that is one yard long by one yard wide by one yard tall.
Volume = length x width x height
1 yard^3 = 1 yard x 1 yard x 1 yard
This is the same for any space to volume relationships (examples):
1 foot^3 = 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot
1 acre^3 = 1 acre x 1 acre x 1 acre
