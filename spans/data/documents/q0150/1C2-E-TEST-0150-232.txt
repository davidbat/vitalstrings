05 Kioti CK30HST, 01 JD4300HST
one cubic yard loader bucket
Ever wish your loader bucket was WAY bigger, like when you
want to haul trash or firewood?  Well I've been there...often.
So I decided to build a replacement bucket for my loader, a bucket
that could carry 1 cubic yard of material (heaped).  Of course,
this won't be a cy of rocks or wet dirt, and it lends itself to manual
loading, not driving into a pile.
I needed to make this strong enough, yet not so heavy that I use
up most of my loader lifting capacity empty.  If I built this of 1/8" steel
and thicker edges, It would probably weight 600-700lb.  Too much.
The result is a bucket that is probably 300+ lb, constructed mostly of
1.5x1.5x1/8 angle and .060 galvanized sheet.  It is welded to 2x4
rectangular tubing so I can drive my pallet fork attachment into it
for easy use.  The paint job will have to wait for warmer, less humid
weather.
My use of this Kioti CK30's loader is what I call fork-centric.  Since my
primary FEL use is lifting stuff, I have custom-built dedicated forks,
built for strength and light weight.  They do not adjust side-to-side, but
I have not found that to be a significant limitation.  Attachments fit on
the forks, which is opposite to putting attachmnts on the loader bkt.
