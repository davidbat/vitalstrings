This bucket can fit two Greyhound buses side-by-side. It is fromThe Big Muskie, the biggest walking dragline ever built -- (Bucyrus Erie) BE4250W -- that operated from 1969 until 1991. The bucket is now located here: http://www.noblecountyohio.com/muskie.html
Note: Being from England, he refers to this as being a "crane" instead of a dragline which is a form of a crane. (Shovels are not cranes.)

(Excerpt) After more than a half century of mining coal, Central Ohio Coal Co.s scorecard is an impressive one.... The men and women who worked here moved more than 2.5 billion cubic yards of earth -- 10 times more than was excavated for the construction of the Panama Canal -- while mining more than 132 million tons of coal for the generation of electric power.

The Big Muskie along with other draglines and equipment surface mined coal at the Muskingum Mine of Central Ohio Coal Co. (a wholly owned subsidary of American Electric Power - AEP), southwest of Zanesville, Ohio -- in  Morgan, Muskingum and Noble counties -- south of Interstate 70 and east of Interstate 77. The mine is part of the 34,000 acre tract known as the AEP ReCreation Land: http://www.aep.com/environmental/recreation/recland/ Location map: http://www.morgancounty.org/tourism/editor/AEP.png
The Muskingum Mine began in the 1950s. These are satelite images of the area in 1973, 1985 and 1990 - http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Muskingum/Muskingum
This was one of the world's largest mobile earth-moving machines after Marion Power Shovel 6360 called The Captain at the Captain coal mine in Illinois and the German bucket-wheel excavators of the Bagger 288 and Bagger 293 family.
Big Muskie cost $25 million in 1969, which is $150 million today adjusted for inflation. It removed over 608 millon cubic yards (465 milion m3) of overburden down to as much as 185 feet deep -- this is twice as much earth as was moved during the construction of the Panama Canal -- uncovering over 20 million tons of coal. It was 151.5 feet wide, 222.5 feet in height, and 487.5 feet in length (46.2 by 67.8 m by 148.6 m) with the boom down. It took over 200,000 man hours to construct over a period of about two years.

Big Muskie was powered by electricity supplied at 13,800 volts via a trailing cable, which had its own transporter/coiling units to move it. The electricity powered the main drives, eighteen 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) and ten 625 horsepower (466 kW) DC electric motors. Some systems in Big Muskie were electro-hydraulic, but the main drives were all electric.[3] Big Muskie used the equivalent of the power for 27,500 homes. The machine had a crew of 5, and worked around the clock.
