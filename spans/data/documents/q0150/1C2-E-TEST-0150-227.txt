 
 
Length (in feet) times Width (in feet) times Depth (in inches) divided by 324 equals the cubic yards needed.
 
 
Example:  If there is a flower bed that is 5 feet wide 22 feet long and you want to have 4 inches of mulch you will do the following:
 
(5 x 22 x 4)/324   =  1.35 cubic yards of mulch
  
 
A cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  If a bag of mulch is 2 cubic feet you will need just over 18 bags of mulch for your flower bed.
