"2 parts of sand and 1 part cement to make 1 cubic metre..."
In order to make 1 cubic metre , the quantity of sand, gravel and cement will be as follows. The person will need to mix 4 parts of gravel/stone with 2 parts of sand and 1 part cement to make 1 cubic metre . Jack Hamilton

Someone said: 1:2:4 for 3000psi Concrete Design. To make 1 cu. m of  concrete @ 3000 psi, you will need @ least 8.2 bags of cement (for 88 lbs per bag), 0.44 cu.m of sand and 0.88 cu.m of gravel. Note: mixture proportion varies depending on concrete design. JPBrazan

Someone said: as far as i can remember, 50 kg of cement = 1 cu ft in volume per bag cement. specific gravity of cement = 3.15 or equal to 3150 kg/ cu mtr without voids. there are 35.28 cu ft in 1 cu mtr...50 kg/ bag x 35.28=  1764 kg wt of cement in 1 cu mtr loose volume. therefore 1764/3150= 56% solid in a unit volume of cement which is equal to .56 cu ft in a solid state of concrete. with the same idea with sand and gravel. 1:2:4 is equal to 8 cu ft mix. but of of course loose volume you must know the sp gr and unit wt. maybe 1 cu ft sand without voids = .70 cu ft x 2= 1.40 cu ft w/out voids,, 1 cu ft of gravel maybe .60 cu ft x 4= 2.40 cu ft without voids.. therefor when we mix cement sand gravel 1:2:4 = .56cuft cement,   1.40 cu ft sand,   2.40 cu ft gravel= 4.36 cu ft solid without voids..therefore 1 cu mtr = 35.28/ 4.36= 8.09 mixtures to be made..roughly 8 bags...but due to hydration volume of water will complete this mix..use wt of water / wt of cement = .40 or .40 x 50 kg =20 kg water = to 20 liters ..
