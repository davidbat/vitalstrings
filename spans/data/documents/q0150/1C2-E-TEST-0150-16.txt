Countries such as America, Canada and the UK use cubic yards for volume measurements. Cubic foot measures the amount that something can hold e.g. How much water the fish tank or swimming pool can hold etc. Gardeners and landscapers may also be familiar with this type of measurement as items such as soil, packing supplies, wheel barrows, storage cylinders and cement are sold by the cubic foot. A cubic yard is three feet wide, three feet deep and three feet high, so to work out how many cubic feet is in one cubic yard, the formula will be: 3X3X3. Therefore, the answer to your question is: 27 cubic feet equals one cubic yard. Being able to calculate the volume of an object can prove to be a very useful thing when you need to buy something as it may help to lessen stress. We’ve all, at one point, bought something from the store only to find that it doesn’t fit into the designated spot we originally wanted. Frustrating, isn’t it? The best thing to do is to search how certain items are converted and write this down before heading to the stores. We’ve already established that one cubic yard is equivalent to 27 cubic feet, but do you know that to measure the capacity of a swimming pool, you need to firstly calculate by the cubic foot before converting it into gallons? Don’t be caught out and do your research next time you need to purchase something. Taking a measuring tape, notepad (with all your measurements) and calculator with you might also be a wise idea!
