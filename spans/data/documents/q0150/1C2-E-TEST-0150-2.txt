Instructions
1
Find the cubic yards of concrete needed to add an additional driveway stall that is 44 feet long, 8 feet wide and has a thickness of 4 inches (after pouring the concrete).
2
Convert the thickness measurement of 4 inches to feet. Since 12 inches = 1 foot, you divide the 4 inches by 12 inches and get .33 feet.
3
Use the formula (Length X Width X Thickness) to find the cubic footage. From Step 1 and Step 2, Length= 44 feet, Width= 8 feet and the Thickness=.33 feet.  Use the formula to get 44 feet X 8 feet X .33 feet = 116.16 cubic feet.
4
Calculate the cubic yards for this project by converting the cubic feet in Step 3. Since one cubic yard is equal to 27 cubic feet you then divide 116.16 by 27 i.e., (116.16รท 27) = 4.3 cubic yards. You need 4.3 cubic yards of concrete for this driveway project.
Tips & Warnings
When using the formula in Step 3, make sure that  the units of measure for length, width and thickness are all in the same units. Make the necessary conversions by using your conversion tables (see the Resources); then you just apply the formula.
