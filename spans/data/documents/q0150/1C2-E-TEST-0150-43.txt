I can give you a weight to volume conversion factor for any of the above.

Could I get the conversion factors for earth: moist- excavated, wet-excavated, dense?
Thanks
Re: tons to cubic yards

Earth, moist, excavated - 90 pounds/cubic foot
Earth, wet, excavated - 100 pounds/cubic foot
Earth, dense - 125 pounds/cubic foot
The above is according to Reade.
Multiply the volume in cubic feet by the above number, and you will get pounds.

I was wondering if you could forward me the weight to volume conversion factor
Thanks

For weight to volume, you just divide by the above number.
Instead of multiplying to go from volume to weight.

I'm trying to find out how much it will cost me to fill 630 square feet with Pea Gravel (small, dry) to a depth of one or two inches (depending on cost!).  One place sells it by the ton and the other by the yard, but I don't know how much of either I will need.  Please help!

I will calculate the cubic yards you need.
630 square foot * (1 inch / 12) foot = 52.5 cubic foot
630 square foot * (2 inch / 12) foot = 105 cubic foot
52.5 cubic foot = 1.94 cubic yard
105 cubic foot = 3.89 cubic yard
So you would need between 2 and 4 yards, depending on if you wanted it 1 or 2 inches thick.
As to how many tons that is, I can only estimate because I do not know the density of pea gravel. Regular ole gravel has a density of about 100 pounds/cubic foot, which would mean you need between 2.6 and 5.25 tons depending on whether you want it 1 or 2 inches thick.

:)Thanks so much for the info.  I can now compare apples to apples in pricing.

I need help converting 1 ton of fine dry sand to cubic yards.  ???
Thanks,
Re: tons to cubic yards
by Robert Fogt on 09/06/05 at 22:26:40
Dry sand has a density of 100 pounds/cubic foot
1 ton = 2000 pounds
2000 pounds / 100 pounds/cubic foot = 20 cubic foot
20 cubic foot / 27 = 0.74 cubic yard
So 1 ton is about 3/4 of a cubic yard

Robert,
Thanks for the help.  I am not sure how I got anything done before the Internet and guys like you were around to help.
Cheers,

Hi,
I would like to order enough dirt to make a swale on the side of my home. I asked the builder how much he would charge for a truckload of dirt. He replied back that a truckload of sifted dirt is about 5 tons. Price is $250. Can anyone tell me if that is a good price, and how many yards of sifted dirst = 5 tons?
Thanks,

I do not know your exact type of dirt, but fullers dirt is about 42 pounds per cubic foot, making 5 tons to be about 9 yards.
I do not know if the price is good though.
