There's no magic to quickly accurately figuring concrete yardage. Figuring concrete is as simple as length x width divided by the square footage that can be covered by one yard of concrete. For example, at 4 in. thick, one yard will cover 81 sq ft. So here are the basic thicknesses designed by most architects/engineers.
1
Decide how thick your concrete is, then divide.
If the concrete is 4 inches thick, divide the square footage by 81 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 6 inches thick, divide the square footage by 54 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 8 inches thick, divide the square footage by 40 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 12 inches thick, divide the square footage by 27 to determine cubic yards.

If you have a thickness in between on of these, divide 1 in by 324 and add to the thickness below the one that you are figuring Example: You're looking for 5 in. thick divide length x width by 81. Divide length x width by 324 and add them together.

Adding 1/2 yard to this will help make sure you never run short or send concrete back,
