Are you trying to convert cubic feet into cubic yards? If so just divide cubic feet by 27.
To convert feet into cubic yards, you would need the other two dimensions.
length X width X height

40 feet x 4 feet x .5 feet = 80 cubic feet of cement.
80 cubic feet / 27 = 2.96296 cubic yards.
(and just in case you're curious, that would weigh about 7,520 pounds)
