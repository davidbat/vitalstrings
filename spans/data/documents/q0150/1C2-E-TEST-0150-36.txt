If this is not possible have students measure the classroom and estimate how much concrete would be needed to put a 3-foot wide concrete sidewalk around the perimeter of your classroom. 6. [optional] Have students bring in their recipes for concrete that they used in science class. Each group should have three or four different mixes with different percentages of ingredients. Put students in the same groups as they were assigned in science class and have them draw pie charts (circle graphs?) for each separate mix. Ask each group to write a brief explanation of why it is important to keep ratios constant when mixing any product, whether concrete, paint colors, or cookies.

Excerpt: ...  of the earliest pollution problems brought to the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the case of the Sioux Lake in eastern South Dakota. For years a small paper plant located nearby had been discharging waste containing carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) into the waters of the lake. At the time the EPA learned of the situation, the chemical was entering at a rate of 16 cubic yards /year. The agency ordered the installation of lters designed to slow (and eventually stop) the ow of CCl4 from the mill. Implementation of this program took exactly three years, during which the ow of pollutant was steady at 16 cubic yards /year. Once the lters were installed, the ow declined. If t is time measured in years since the EPA learned of the situation, between the time the lters were installed and the time the ow stopped, the rate of ow was well approximated by Rate (in cubic yards /year) = t2  14t + 49 (a) Graph the rate of CCl4 ow into the lake as a function of time, beginnin ...

Excerpt: ... that the SF Bay holds about 5 million acre-ft of water and that Flow through Golden Gate is about 10 million acre-ft/yr (http:/members.aol.com/Tenaya21/Ecology/LectureNotes/lec1 3.html). So the residence time is about 0.5 yr, or 4,400 hr. For the sediment, the annual outflow through the Golden Gate has been estimated at about 4.2 x 106 cubic yards = 3.2 x 106 m3/yr. This is from Fig. 5-11 in the SF RWQCB report (actually a table not a figure). The inflow is about 8.1 x 106 cubic yards = 6.1 x 106 m3/yr, so there is a net gain of sediments into the bay. Thus let's assume that the residence time is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than for water or about 4,400,000 hr. For the mass transfer coefficients, we will use those provided in the model. We could refine them to account for the properties of Arochlor 1242.  Next we need to estimate the mass flux of PCBs entering the SF Bay.
