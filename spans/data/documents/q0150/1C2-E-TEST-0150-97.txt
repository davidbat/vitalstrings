Cubic Yard Box Compactor: A336-1001-8PB
American Compactor, Inc. has developed a pneumatic          powered compactor for cubic yard boxes
which are 3' x 3' x 3'. Many companies are beginning to use these boxes          instead of 55 gallon drums.
Frequently, as with drums, customers have a need to compact the material          in the container.
This compactor is equipped          with an 8" pneumatic cylinder which is able to exert 6,000 pounds          or
2,724 kg of force at 120 psi air pressure. It is very easy to use. The          box must be centered under the
ram plate and then the palm buttons are pressed to begin the compaction          cycle. The time it takes for
an entire compacting cycle is a fast 25          seconds.
These compactors were designed          with safety in mind. The actuator is a two-hand, no tie-down safety
circuit that provides output only when both palms are pressedwithin two          tenths of a second. If the
buttons are released, the compaction plate is automatically retracted.          The purpose of this control
mechanism is to meet O.S.H.A. requirements for certain specific customer          safety applications.
There are numerous uses for          these units. Hazardous waste materials are ideal applications as well
as semi-solid matter. Customers have realized major cost savings by compacting          used paint filters,
rags and wipes, paint masking material, and disposable clothing and gloves          into cubic yard boxes.
Not only does this insure compliance with the Environmental Protection          Agency, waste disposal
expenses are reduced dramatically.
The Smash It TM Pneumatic          Compactors are effortless to use. There are no loud noises, they are
quiet. With the rapid cycle time, one is able to efficiently use whatever          human resources are available.
