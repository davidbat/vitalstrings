For 30 years I've been batteling my husband's heavy metal wheelbarrow. Now that I'm older and less strong I don't even try anymore. It is hard to balance empty and impossible full. This sturdy little cart is the perfect soluthion. My husband laughed when it arrived. Now, I have to be the early bird and get the cart first or I'll find he has commandeered it for the day.  When I have a heavy bag to move, such as mulch, I find this cart perfect. I lay down the cart, flip in the bag and easily stand the cart. No more lifting for me when it comes to yard clean up and just about every thing else.

I bought this as a gift for my Mother, and she is very happy with it. She says it rolls much easier than she expected and likes the wide wheels. I would rate it a good value relative to other carts I've seen.
