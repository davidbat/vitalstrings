Understanding the measurements
Simply begin by understanding that 12 inches in length equals one foot in length.
36 inches, or three feet, equal one yard in a straight line measurement. This is a one dimensional measurement.
Now picture a square that is one yard long by one yard in width. This two dimensional area equals one square yard.
One cubic yard is three demensional, one yard long by one yard in width and one yard on depth. 
Step 2
The math
One cubic yard is equivalent to 27 cubic feet. A cubic foot is 12 inches long by 12 inches wide by 12 inches deep. You might try to picture 12 square feet pieces, all one inch thick, placed on top of each other. It is easiest to work in cubic feet and change to cubic yards from that number.
For example: if you need to fill in an old in-ground swimming pool with dirt for a garden, start with the measurements in feet. The pool is 20 feet long by 10 feet wide and 8 feet deep.
Multiply the length X the width X the depth. 20 feet X 10 Feet X 8 feet equals 1600 cubic feet. Now divide your answer by 27 to obtain cubic yards. 1600 cubic feet divided by 27 equals 59.26 cubic yards of dirt will be needed to fill this area.
Step 3
Second Example
Measurements may not always be in feet so they must be converted to obtain cubic yards.
If you want to build a concrete patio you would need to figure out the cubic feet of concrete needed. The patio area is 10 feet by 10 feet by 4 inches in depth. All measurements must be in equal units of measurement. 4 inches is .33 feet, one third of a foot.
Multiply 10 feet by 10 feet by .33 feet for an answer of  33 cubic feet. Now divide your cubic foot answer by 27 to obtain cubic yards.
You need 1.22 cubic yards of concrete to build this patio.
Step 4
While the amount of concrete needed for the patio may seem like a small number it helps to picture the amount it really is.
Picture 27 boxes one foot in length by one foot in width by one foot in depth.
It is a lot of concrete.

Tips & Warnings   
When calculating cubic yards all the measurement units must be the same. Inches must be converted to feet or feet can be converted to inches.
If you start with all measurements in inches you must divide your first answer by 12 to obtain cubic feet and then divide by 27 to obtain cubic yards.
Reference units
 9 inches = 3/4 foot or .75
 8 inches = 2/3 foot or .66
 6 inches = 1/2 foot or .5
 4 inches = 1/3 foot or .33
 3 inches = 1/4 foot or .25
 3 feet = one yard
