A cubic yard is      one yard cubed, or twenty seven cubic feet. It is the standard      measurement that Caputo Recycling uses for selling bulk mulch      and bulk top soil. The cubic yard is a valuable unit of      measurement to help assure that you are getting the value you      expect when purchasing landscaping materials.
When purchased,      these materials are loaded with a large front-loader bucket into      the customer’s truck or trailer. In the above left photo, you      can see pat in front of the front loader bucket which contains      two cubic yards. The accepted standard of measurement in the mulch      industry is the cubic yard.
One cubic yard, two inches    deep, covers 162 square feet.
Two cubic yards of mulch fills a standard pick-up truck bed.
Two cubic yards, two inches deep, covers 324 square feet.
Ten cubic yards cover 1620 square feet at two inches depth.
