Encyclopedia: Yard   (Site not responding. Last check: 2007-10-28)
The yard derives its name from the word for a straight branch or rod, although the precise origin of the measure itself is not definitely known.
One postulate was that the yard was derived from the girth of a person's waist, while another claim held that the measure was invented by Henry I of England as being the distance between the tip of his nose and the end of his thumb.
The modern yard is a compromise between the old British and American standards, and is calibrated against the metre.

How many cubic feet are in a cubic mile?   (Site not responding. Last check: 2007-10-28)
Since there are 3 feet in a yard you could cover the bottom of the big box with 3 rows of small boxes, each row 3 boxes long.
Since the cubic yard box is 3 feet high it takes 3 layers to fill it with cubic foot boxes.
Since the cubic mile box is 5280 feet high it takes 5280 layers to fill it with cubic foot boxes.
