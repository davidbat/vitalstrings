12 Cubic Yard Container
Ideal Uses:
Over 80% of our 12 cubic yard dumpsters exceed 13 yards in actual volume. Its 6000 lb. weight limit makes it ideal for the following applications:
a large kitchen demolition
large garage or basement cleanout
deck demo (10′ x 30′ — disassembled)
fencing material and yard cleanup
roofing material (20 square max — extra charges apply) + trash
Please note: We do not carry more than 1/2 cubic yard of heavy materials (ie. concrete, rock, dirt, asphalt, lath plaster, etc.). Exceeding container weight limits will result in extra charges.
The 12 yard dumpster easily fits the shown refuse.
A 12 yard container with 2 couches and 2 overstuffed chairs still has an additional 6+ yards for miscellaneous trash.
Eighty percent of SAM’S 12 yard roll-offs are over 13 yards in capacity.
Protection for faux finishes, stamped concrete and new surfaces is available.
The 12 yard container can be placed in tight spaces unsuitable for larger dumpster.
