27 cubic feet. Your answer is how many cubic yards you need. So lets say that you have a stone driveway, and it is 50' long, 25' wide, and you want to put down stone at a depth of 1'. You multiply the length (50) by the width (25) by the depth (1). In doing this you come up with 1250 cubic feet. You now divide 1250 by 27(total cubic feet in a yard) and your answer is 46.3. So you would need 46.3 cubic yards to cover your driveway with 1 foot of stone.
