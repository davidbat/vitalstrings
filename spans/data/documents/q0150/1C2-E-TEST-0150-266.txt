England:
 
England had its own metric system for a very long time. These consisted on feet, yards, inches, miles etc for length. Just like in the SI, the units were multiplied by each other. For example: yd · yd · yd was yd3. In 1985 the English changed officially to the standard metric systems. More information in The Weights and Measures Act 1985 (Metrication) (Amendment) Order 1994 .
 
United States:
 
The United States had their own metric system for a very long time. The United States converted to the international standard metric system under pressure of the industry in 1988. This was decided in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act Of 1988. More information in The United States and The Metric System .
 
History of SI:
 
SI is the abbreviation for Système International d'Unités. It is the standard metric system nowadays. The SI originated in France. In 1790 the French Academy of Science got an instruction of the National Assembly to design a new standard of units for the whole world. They decided that the system should be based on the follow conditions:
 
The units in the system should be based on invariable quantities in nature
All units, except the basic units, should be derived from the basic units
Multiplying of the units should go in factors of ten (decimals)
 
Only in 1875 the world began to show some interest in the French development. The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), nowadays called: Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM). was founded, because more and more countries were interested in the French system. In 1960, on the 11th CGPM, the system was officially named International d'Unité.

The institution that controls the units in The Netherlands is Nederlands Meetinstituut (NMi) .
