Re: one cubic yard loader bucket
DFKrug -
I checked out your home made loader bucket. You did a very fine job on it's construction using strong, yet light weight building materials and techniques. I really like the way you've got all that nice split wood stacked in there. It sure comes in handy to be able to move large bulky loads around like that.
I am willing to bet that you are you pleased with it's performance.
Great Job,
