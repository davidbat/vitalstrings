Just another quick bit of information courtesy of our friends at RSmeans . With wildly fluctuating costs of building materials, it's more important now than ever to keep your finger on the pulse of these costs as they move. Note too that costs range for different markets .
The median for concrete hovers right around $110 per cubic yard. Note that this is plain concrete with no admixtures or specialty additives in the mix. The cost of concrete has risen continually during all of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 of about 4% annualized. According to RSMeans , there are indications that the price may hold steady or possibly drop for the remainder of 2009.
