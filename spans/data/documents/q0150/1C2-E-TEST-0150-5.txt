Soil Building Systems - Cubic Yard Calculators
Mulch
Mulches provide a protective            layer over the root system of plants, which protects the plants from            harsh weather conditions in the summer and winter months. This protective            layer also provides a barrier to enhance the moisture retention within            the beds below (improves moisture retention by 25% on average). In addition,            it enhances the aesthetic value of the beds by creating a uniform appearance.

Compost
Compost is a nutrient-rich material for            plants created from decomposed organic matter. Compost is added to existing            soil (by tilling or blending) to create a fertile and robust environment            allowing plants to grow and flourish.

Bedding Mixes
Bedding Mixes are available            in various compost ratios depending upon your installation and planting            objectives. The mixes are designed to supply the appropriate amount            of nutrients to your plants while keeping the soil open for easy root            growth, proper aeration, and maintaining optimum moisture retention.            SBS bedding mixes contain precisely measured blends of heat-sterilized            fully composted organics, screened deep sand and finely screened soil.            Depending upon your specific application and preference, the bedding mix            you choose may additionally contain decomposed cotton burrs or dairy            compost. SBS mixes require little or no tilling, for easy installation.

Tree Mixes
Tree Mixes are designed to be used when     transplanting container trees, regardless of being small, medium or large trees.  Providing     a good soil for the tree roots to venture into is one of the keys to a long living and     healthy tree.  These soil mixes have sufficient drainage characteristics yet provide     a stable and welcoming medium for trees to root in for years to come.

Dirt/Clay
Dirt can be used to build the base of            a berm, to fill a hole, or to build up around the foundation of a house.            In addition it can be mixed with organic compost to make a rich soil            blend. SBS does not recommend planting directly into this excavated            black dirt, as it can be very clay based and alkaline.
