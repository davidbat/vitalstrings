Cubic Yard Calculations
Cubic Yard Calculations
Calculating Cubic Yards for Square / Rectangular Areas:
Length x Depth x Width (all expressed in feet) = cubic feet divided by 27 = cubic yards.
NOTE:  1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet (3'x3'x3').
 Calculating Cubic Yards for Circular Areas:
Radius squared x 3.14 (Pi) x depth (all expressed in feet) = cubic feet divided by 27 = cubic yards. 
NOTE:  1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet (3'x3'x3')
Example:  A 50-foot diameter circular area, 4 inches deep.  NOTE:  The radius is 1/2 of the diameter, so the calculation should be:  25' x 25' x 3.14 x .33 = 648 cubic feet divided by 27 = 24 cubic yards.
