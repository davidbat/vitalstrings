TelecommutingMom: This would depend on the type of dump truck. An average size dump truck would probably hold about 5 cubic yards but they could hold as little as a couple of cubic yards to as many as 20 cubic yards.

Rick T: The amount of cubic yards a dump truck can carry would depend on the size of the dump truck.  A small 1 ton dump, for example, could carry up to 5 yards of material if there are sides built up on it.  However, if the material is heavy, the truck would be limited by the weight.  A large tandem axle dump truck, can usually hold approximately 13 yards of material.  Then there are single axle dump trucks that can carry approximately 6 yards.
