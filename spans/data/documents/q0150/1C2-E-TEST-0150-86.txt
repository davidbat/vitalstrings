Re: square feet to cubic yards
You need a thickness measurement as well  ie square is 2 measurements, cube is 3
since 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet ( 3'x3'x3')
Let's say you are using sand 12" thick over 800 square feet,
You'll need a common denominator so 12" = 1 foot thick
1X800 = 800 cubic feet/ 27 cubic feet(feet in a cubic yard)
= 29.62 cubic yards at 1 foot thick
if it's 1" thick.. it's 29.62x1/12  (since 1 " is 1/12th of a foot)
= 2.47  cu yds
if it's 4" thick.. it's29.62 x 4/12 (4/12=.333) so it's 29.62 x .333
= 9.86 cu yds
Now.. if you're using topsoil... for under sod or for a garden factor in compression. add about 15%
