I need some clarification so that I can answer your question.
What shape is your pond? Oval, Rectangular, Round? How flat is the bottom of your pond? Rim length of 1082 is this in feet? Is this the circumference? 4-1 slope with 12.5 depth in the center would mean that your pond would be 50 feet across the top if you drew a straight line from one edge to the other.
