Converting units is easily done if it is looked at the same way as solving a problem. The method used is called dimensional analysis. Also called the unit factor method, it is a useful technique that is based on the fact that multiplying by one does not change the value. Units are canceled out the same as canceling number factors. The one rule is that the units that are converting are compatible; .
weight to weight, volume to volume. Converting cubic yards to tons, volume to weight is more difficult unless you know what links the units together. In this case the link is density or mass per unit volume. In SI units, density is expressed in pounds per cubic foot. So first, any volume is represented in cubic feet so there is compatibility between units.
In a cubic yard there are 81 cubic feet. Imagine a cube separated into three blocks across and down. This cube would represent one cubic yard, and it would have a total of nine blocks per side: 3 x 3 = 9. Now if that same block was converted to cubic feet each block would divide into an additional three blocks: 1yd. = 3 ft. for a total of 81 blocks or 9 x 9 = 81.
The first step is to multiply the volume by 81 to convert the cubic yards to cubic feet, for example converting five cubic yards to cubic feet.
(5?yd?^3)/1 x (81?ft?^3)/(1?yd?^3 )=405?ft?^3
The cubic yard units cancel each other out leaving the cubic foot units.
In the second step, multiply the answer by the density of the substance. Look online for the density of most materials. For this example density will equal 100 pounds per cubic foot.
405?ft?^3 x100 lbs/?ft?^3 =40500 lbs
The cubic feet units cancel each other out leaving the pounds.
Finally convert to tons. There are 2000 pounds in one ton.
(40500 lbs)/1=(1 ton)/(2000 lbs)=20.25 tons
The pound units cancel and cubic yards are successfully converted to tons.
