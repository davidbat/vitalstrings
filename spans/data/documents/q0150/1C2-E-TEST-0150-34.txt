Converting square yards to cubic yards is like converting apples to oranges or like converting miles per hour to kilograms.
The square yard is a unit of area, whereas the cubic yard is a unit of volume.
The yard: a unit of distance.
The square yard: a unit of area.
The cubic yard: a unit of volume.
Let's think of some uses for each of those.
The first one's easy. If you want to know how far it is from one goal post on a football field to the other goal post, you would use yards.
If you want to know how much turf you will need to cover the field, you use square yards.
If you want to know how much dirt (or gravel or Jell-O) you would need to cover the whole field to a depth of four inches, you would use cubic yards.
