Benefits of our 9 yard dumpster
A great substitute for a 10 yard dumpster rental.
Placed by smaller, tight-turning trucks, the 9 yard roll-off can fit into many tight locations.
The compact footprint of the 9 yard dumpster takes up less room than most small cars.
In garage placement of all sizes is available in most settings.
It has a 4500 lb. weight limit.
Ideal uses for the 9 yard dumpster:
The 9 yard rolloff is ideal for the following applications:
an average kitchen demolition
a small kitchen plus bath tear out
a medium garage or basement cleanout
deck demo (10′ x 18′ — disassembled)
fencing material and yard cleanup
roofing material (20 square max — extra charges apply) + trash
Please note: We do not carry more than 1/2 cubic yard of heavy materials (ie. concrete, rock, dirt, asphalt, lath plaster, etc.). Exceeding container weight limits will result in extra charges.
A 9 yard container fits 2 large couches and 2 overstuffed chairs…
…and still has an additional 3+ yards of room for miscellaneous trash
Placed by smaller, tight-turning trucks, the 9 yard roll-off can fit into many tight locations.
The center-line quad wheels of the 9 cubic yard dumpster allow placement along the edge of concrete pads and driveways.
In-garage placement of all sizes is available in most settings.
