Re: production rates in sq ft, cubic ft, cubic yards, tons
Help!
I'm looking for production rates based on the following:
Travel speed is 25fpm
Width is variable, but let's use 16ft.
Working time is variable, but let's use 1 hour
Density of material is 1.5ton/cu yd
I would like to know the formula to get sq ft/hr, sq yds/hr, cu yds/hr and tons/hr.  I have an answer, but I'm no math wiz so I just want to make sure I have the correct answer.  Thanks a ton.
