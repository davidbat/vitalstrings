Premium Lawn Fertilizer 7-2-2
“We live in new construction, and of course the builder did not put enough topsoil in our yard. After two years, the grass began to get patchy and brown. I did not want to use a chemical fertilizer, so I tried this. My three-year-old and I threw some fertilizer around the yard with coffee cups, and a week later you could really tell where we put it! The grass in those areas was BEAUTIFUL, lush, and green! I am definetly going to invest in a broadcaster and make it a habit to use this product!”
