A carpet calculator will calculate your measurement in square feet and then change them into square yards. Carpet is typically sold in square yards. If you want to know how many cubic yards your room contains, you need an additional measurement outside of the carpet calculate. A square yard is the length times the width, where as a cubic yard is the length times the width times the height. So to convert square yards to cubic yards, you need to multiply your result by the height.
