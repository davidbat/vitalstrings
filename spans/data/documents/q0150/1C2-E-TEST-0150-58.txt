BACKGROUND
The U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and other Federal          agencies that provide recreation opportunities near bear habitats have          experienced increased problems with bears raiding garbage dumpsters in          campgrounds and other recreation facilities.
Increasing numbers of recreation          users on national forest lands have contributed to the problem by increasing          the volume of food waste at recreation sites such as campgrounds and picnic          sites. In bear habitat areas, the increase of food waste becomes a powerful          attractant to bears. Bears favor the different kinds of foods people eat—bacon,          sausage, and canned fish, and especially sweets like candy, gum, and pancake          syrup—over a healthier wildland diet.
The only way to keep bears          away from food waste mixed in with the garbage is to bearproof the garbage          containers. The most common dumpsters used in recreation areas are the          frontload type that can vary in cubic yard capacity. Garbage dumpsters          typically are designed for urban use where bears are not a problem. Urban-designed          dumpsters are fabricated with light gauge steel and have flimsy lids made          of very light gauge steel or premolded plastic. These materials are not          designed to prohibit bears.
THE          PROBLEM
In 1998, the San Gabriel River Ranger District (SGRRD) of the Angeles          National Forest requested help from the San Dimas Technology and Development          Center (SDTDC) to eliminate trash spillage and damage to dumpsters used          along the San Gabriel River. Jerry Sirski, recreation officer, and Michael          Hansen, recreation assistant at the SGRRD, helped SDTDC develop the criteria          needed to fabricate the bearproof dumpster. The SGRRD has an active bear          population that frequents many recreation areas in the Angeles National          Forest. The district uses 2-cubic-yard frontload dumpsters in the San          Gabriel Canyon recreation area—an area where large numbers of visitors          recreate each year. Bearproofing the existing dumpsters was a critical          step in preventing the local bears from raiding the garbage dumpsters          in campgrounds and picnic sites along the recreation corridor of the San          Gabriel River.
The SGRRD had experienced problems          with bears foraging for food and tipping over the garbage dumpsters in          the parking areas along the canyon. The SGRRD also had a different type          of problem: vandals rolling dumpsters into the riverbed to make room for          more parking. Steel stakes and chains were used to restrain the dumpsters,          but the stakes failed to keep the dumpsters in place.
A related problem was the amount          of time spent to unlock and lock padlocks used to restrain the dumpsters          on one or more stakes. The frontload dumpster truck driver had to get          out of the vehicle, unlock the padlocks, and remove the chains that restrained          the dumpster. After the driver adjusted the dumpster, it was picked up          by the frontloader forks. The driver then exited the vehicle again to          padlock the chains. This process was very time consuming.
Another problem was keeping          the dumpster lids locked to prevent people from disposing of large items          such as mattresses, motors, old furniture, and other large household items.          Only a small (24-inch-by-24-inch) access door was available for garbage          disposal by forest visitors.
THE SOLUTION :        A BEARPROOF DUMPSTER
SDTDC worked with the SGRRD and Boxmaster, a metal fabrication company,        to design and develop a bearproof dumpster to meet the needs of the USDA        Forest Service. The bearproof dumpster is fabricated with 14 gauge steel        with a peaked lid to repel rain and snow. It provides better access by tilting        the door toward the users (see figure 1). The dumpster is fabricated in        two parts—the bottom 2-cubic-yard box that holds the garbage and the        lid that allows the garbage to be emptied into a garbage truck. The dumpster        is mounted on two 2-inch-by-6-inch skids laid flat, which provides a strong        and stable base. The dumpster is also closer to the ground for the convenience        of the user.

The dumpster lid has a built-in          gravity latch that keeps the top locked to the bottom until it is lifted          by a frontload garbage truck and released for dumping (see figure 2).          After the dumpster is emptied, the driver lowers the unit back onto a          U-shaped pipe stand that locks the dumpster in place and prevents any          movement (see figures 3, 4, and 5). Picking up the dumpster and emptying          it into the garbage truck is done in one step while the driver is in the          truck; the driver never has to leave the cab. The lid access door has          a bearproof latch (see figure 6), and the door is rimmed with a continuous          piece of round steel rod around the outside edge, which serves as a bear          claw guard. The garbage access door is counterbalanced to meet accessibility          guidelines (see figures 7 and 8).

TEST RESULTS
After 2 years of field use the dumpsters have proved to be bearproof and          vandalproof. The dumpsters have saved time and money with a collection          process that is fast and nonlabor intensive. Bearproofing these dumpsters          will save bear lives today—and in the future—by keeping bears          away from food brought in by visitors.
COST
The cost of a complete bearproof dumpster, including the pipe stand, is          $800, plus shipping. A retrofit lid for an existing 2-cubic-yard frontload          dumpster is $600 including installation of the lid, plus shipping. Discounts          are offered for large quantities.
