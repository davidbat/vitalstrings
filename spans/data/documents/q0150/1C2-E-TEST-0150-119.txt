2700 square feet = how many cubic yards
Answer
Hi Fred,
A cubic yard measures 3 feet on each side, so 3*3*3 = 27 cubic feet in each cubic yard.
Divide 2700 CUBIC feet by 27 to get CUBIC yards.
Square feet is a measure of area and not of volume. If it really is square feet, then the problem cannot be solved.
