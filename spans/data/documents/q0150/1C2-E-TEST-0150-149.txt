Hi,
Assuming that you mean soil on which plants grow, I would remark that soil is not dirt, it is the source of life on earth.
I will present in metric terms (yard is not very different from meter) and therefore the question may be formulated: does one cubic meter of soil weigh one ton. The same question may be formulated as what is the bulk density or specific weight (sw) of soil. SW of 1 is defined asÂ 1 cubic meter of material weighs 1 ton.
The sw of a densely packed sandy soil may be close to 2. A clay soil, containing organuc matter and well structured, would have a sw of about 1.4. A garden soil containing a large proportion of plant debris may have a sw of 1.0 or less.
