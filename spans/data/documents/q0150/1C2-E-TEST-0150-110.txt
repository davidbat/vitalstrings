How much MM can I make with a cubic yard of compost? It doesn't sound like much. And it costs $50 a cubic yard. Is that a good price?
So, to answer the question:  1 yard of compost = 27 cu ft.  Therefore, at 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, you can make 81 cu ft of MM......or 162 squares that are 6 inches deep.
So, if you have that much to build, then, yup, probably could use the whole yard.  However, I would hate to see the price of a yard of vermiculite.
