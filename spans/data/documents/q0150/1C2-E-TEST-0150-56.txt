Answer:
Cubic yard is a measure of volume. Ton is a measure of weight. How many cubic yards in a ton is going to depend entirely upon the item in question. A ton of feathers will have many more cubic yards than a ton of gravel or dirt.
Having said that, here are some yards per ton conversion for materials you might care about:
Lava Rock (all) = .5 tons (1000 lbs.) per cubic yard
Eastern Sunrise = .9 tons (1800 lbs.) per cubic yard
Crimson = 1.1 tons (2200 lbs.) per cubic yard
Lime Rock (57 & 89) = 1.2 tons (2400 lbs.) per cubic yard
Lime Rock (919) = 1.25 tons (2500 lbs.) per cubic yard
River Rock (all) = 1.325 tons (2650 lbs.) per cubic yard
Granite (all) = 1.325 tons (2650 lbs.) per cubic yard
Marble (all) = 1.35 tons (2700 lbs.) per cubic yard
