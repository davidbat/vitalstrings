Oasis, retreat, escape... a haven from life's pressures and when the seasons change and weather permits, it's something we look for outside; in our gardens, on our terraces or balconies. 
Toronto-based Cubic Yard Design is a leader in realizing this in your outdoor space. 
Our contemporary approach to design will bring your personal style to life in garden spaces as unique as you are.  We tailor each space to be a direct reflection of the character and lifestyle of our client and look forward to helping you create your own oasis... just outside your door.
