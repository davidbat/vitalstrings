To use this calculator, enter the width, length and height in inches or feet (or in feet and inches if you prefer).  If you enter values in both the feet and  inches fields, the two values will be added together.  For instance, if you enter a value of 2 in the "feet" field and a  value of 12 in the "inches" field, the result will be 36 inches (or 3 feet).
Click the Submit button to view the Total Cubic  Yards and Total Cubic Feet in fraction and decimal format.  The Clear button clears all of the fields and resets the values to 0.
