I assume that the numbers you are using for the size of the trailer are in feet.
First task is to figure out the volume of the trailer in cubic feet. The formula is length x width x height.
53 x 8.5 x 9 = 4,054.5 cubic feet
Next task is to convert from cubic feet to cubic yards. One cubic yard is 3 ft long, 3 ft wide, and 3 ft high. The volume of one cubic yard in cubic feet = length x width x height = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. One cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.
Final task is to convert volume of the trailer from cubic feet to cubic yards. This is accomplished by dividing the volume in cubic feet by 27.
4,054.5 (divided by) 27 = 150.016666(repeating), or approximately 150 cubic yards. To be more exact, divide the decimal portion above in to 1 to figure out the fractional remainder.
1 (divided by) .016666 = 6
Your final answer is 150 1/6 cubic yards in the trailer (150 and one sixth cubic yards).
