Units of Conversion: Cubic (Volume) Measure
Basic to the understanding of unit conversion is the understanding of equivalence, the understanding of the multiplicative identity of 1, and how the two are related. For a review of these concepts, click on Review .
You will also need to multiply and reduce fractions. If you have forgotten how to manipulate fractions, visit Fractions for Adults on SOSMath for an in-depth review.
Review the following table of Standard Units of Conversion to see if you can create fractions that have a value of 1. You can click to examples following each table.
Cubic Measure
Example 1:What exactly does 1 cubic foot mean?
Answer:
One cubic foot means 1 foot
1 foot
1 foot or 1 foot
Example 2:Convert 50 cubic yards to cubic feet.
Solution:From the above table you can see a link between cubic feet and cubic yards.
50 cubic yards can be written as 50 x 1 cubic yard.
Since 27 cubic feet is equivalent to 1 cubic yard, the fraction
is equivalent to 1.
Multiply 50 x 1 cubic yard by 1 in the equivalent form
to obtain  50 x 1 cubic yard x
.
Rewrite the above expression as
Multiply the two fractions:
Rearrange the numerator:
Write the above fraction as a product of fractions so that some of the  fractions have a value of 1:
The answer is 1,350 cubic feet, or 1,350 feet3.
A longer way to work the same problem is as follows.
1 cubic yard can be written as 1 yard x 1 yard x 1 yard.
50 cubic yards can be written 50 x 1 yard x 1 yard x 1 yard.
Note that 1 yard can be written as 1 yard x 1 and the 1 can be written as a fraction where the numerator and the denominator are equivalent.
Write 1 yard x 1 as 1 yard x
This can be further simplified to read
Rearrange the fractions within the parenthesis.
Simplify.
The answer is 1,350 cubic feet.
