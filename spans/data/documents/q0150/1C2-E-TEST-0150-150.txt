What is pressure measurement?
The pressure forces on any solid surface by liquid or gas, do not apply to any single point on that surface.  Instead, these forces are spread equally along the whole surface.  Therefore, pressure force on the surface depends not only on level of compression of liquid or gas bound by the solid surface, but by the surface area size as well.  The pressure term was introduced to measure pressure forces acting on surface independently of the surface area size. read more... »
