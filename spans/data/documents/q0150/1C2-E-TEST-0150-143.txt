How to figure out cubic yards & cubic feet????
I'm taking an important construction type test tomorrow, which has some of the above ?'s on it (although they dont have anything to do with what I need to take the test for (drywall), I still have to pass the test to get my ROC license for drywall in Tucson, AZ.
I have done a little research, for example, I went to concretenetwork.com, then slab pour calculator.
entered thickness '6' inches;
entered length '20',
hit calculate
the cubic yards answer it gave me was '14.81' **Is this right?? If so, how do I figure that out? I came up with 40 'but in cubic feet'. And I read somewhere that to divide by 27 to get the cubic feet?  And that doesnt work for me either, is that right?
*I am taking this test first thing tomorrow morning and never knew there would be 'concrete' questions on a 'drywall' test, until I just talked to someone else a little bit ago who had previously taken the test.
So if there are any knowlegable concrete people out there, HELP????
