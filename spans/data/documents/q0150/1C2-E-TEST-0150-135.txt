I take for granted the you had a typo, since square feet is a 2 dimensional measurement (area=length x width), and cubic yards is 3 dimensional (volume=length x width x depth).  Since square yards isn't that common of a measurement in garden and landscaping, I will assume you meant cubic yards, a very common measurement in this field especially when ordering soil or mulch materials.
There are 27 cubic feet (3'x3'x3') in a cubic yard, so assuming that you meant 248 cubic feet, it would be 9.185 cubic yards.
If you meant 248 square feet, there are 9 square feet (3'x3') in a square yard so it would be 27.556 square yards.
