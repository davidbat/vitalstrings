Cubic Yards:
Total Tons*:
(* The tons figure only works for sand and rock products. Any products containing soil, woodchips, peat, etc. would have varying weights and would be ordered by the cubic yard.  )

How to Figure manually:
Length x Width = Square Feet
Square Feet ÷ "X" = Cubic Yards (to find "X," match depth   with number at right)
To convert Cubic Yards to Tons*: Cubic Yards x 1.4 =   Tons
To convert Tons to Cubic Yards*: Tons ÷ 1.4 = Cubic   Yards
*
1.4 is a rule of thumb that will   work for most sand and gravel products (1 yard = 2,800#). Some products such as   soils and mixes may vary due to their different bulk densities (weight per cu.   yd).
Example 1:
2,000 Square Ft.   bunker at 6" deep
2,000 ÷ 54 = 37 Cubic Yards Bunker Sand
37 x 1.4   = 52 Tons
Example 2:
To cover cart path 1,200' x 4' x   3" deep
1,200 x 4 = 4,800 square feet
4,800 ÷ 108 = 44.5 cubic   yards gravel
44.5 x 1.4 = 63 tons
