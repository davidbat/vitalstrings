Earth, wet = 100 lbs/ft3
Earth, dense = 125 lbs/ft3
Since a cubic yard is 27ft3, the weight of a cubic yard varies from 2430lbs to 3375lbs. When you convert from lbs-f to N, you get that the dirt 1.1E4 to 1.5E4 N.
Therefore, one could say that the weight of a cubic yard of dirt is approximately 1.3E4 N. Rather heavy!
