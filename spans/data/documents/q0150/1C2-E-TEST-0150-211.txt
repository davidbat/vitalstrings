This spring I had another 10 yards delivered to build elevated beds in front of the house. I am currently working on a masonry project of retaining walls, steps, etc., and plan to have another ten yards delivered to top off the new beds and align the walk with another elevated bed. There are plenty of other areas I'd like to tweak if I have extra.
Don't worry about overbuying. You can always find a place for extra top soil and it never goes as far as you think it will.
You are the soil master.
Holy crap...how do you move that quantity of dirt?  If you're going one shovel at a time, you sure don't need to worry about any other forms of exercise...
And you're right about the excess...I always find ways to use the extra loam that I end up with.
