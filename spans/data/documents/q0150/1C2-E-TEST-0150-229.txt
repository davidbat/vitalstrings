Squaring Building Lines Example
For pole barns used for a garage, certain farm buildings , and many other uses, a concrete floor is a great addition.
Dirt and gravel floors are cheap but they are also hard to keep clean and maintain. Dirt and gravel floors are subject to erosion when drainage is a concern for your site location.
Since there are no foundation walls in a pole building a floating slab can be poured inside the poles using the skirt board for forms.  The concrete is considered to float because it is totally independent of the building. Changes in temperature and ground movement allow shifting of the foundation with no impact on the poles that support the structure.
A 1" foam expansion joint is placed around the perimeter of the foundation to isolate it from the wall framing of the building.
A typical sturdy slab will include leveling with base material, a 6 mil visqueen (polyethylene) vapor barrier, reinforcing mesh wire, and 4-6" of 3,000 psi concrete.
