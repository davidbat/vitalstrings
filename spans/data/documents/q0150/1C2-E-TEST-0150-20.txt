To determine the amount of materials you need in cubic yards, you must first convert all three dimensions to the same unit of measurement. There are:
27 cubic feet in one cubic yard (3’ x 3’ x 3’)
46,656 cubic inches in one cubic yard (36” x 36” x 36”)
For example, to find the amount of concrete needed for a slab 6” thick by 12’ long by 12’ wide:
Convert the dimension in inches to feet (6” ÷ 12” = 0.5’)
Multiply the three dimensions together to find the number of cubic feet (0.5’ x 12’ x 12 = 72 cubic feet)
Divide the cubic feet by the number of cubic feet in a cubic yard (27) to find the number of cubic yards (72 ÷ 27 = 2.67 cu. yd.).
You can find the same result by converting all three dimensions to yards by:
Convert the dimension in inches to yards (6” ÷ 36” = 0.167 yards)
Convert the dimensions in feet to yards (12’ ÷ 3 = 4 yards)
Multiply the three dimensions together to find the number of cubic yards (0.167 x 4 x 4 = 2.67 cu. yd.)
Or, simply input your dimensions in our handy calculator below, then click “calculate” to find the number of cubic yards.
