From your note that you are pouring a slab that is 20' by 20' and 6" thick and three footings that are 20'         by 12" by 12".
First you need to put all the dimensions in the same           units. I am going to choose feet. Thus the slab dimensions in feet           are 20 by 20 by 1/2.         Hence the volume of concrete in the slab is
20
20
 1/2 =           200 cubic feet.
One yard is three feet so a cubic yard is three feet by three feet by         three feet. 3
 3
 3 = 27         and hence 1 cubic yard is 27 cubic feet. Thus the volume of concrete         in         the slab is
 200/27 = 7.4 cubic yards.
In a similar fashion each footing has a volume of
20
