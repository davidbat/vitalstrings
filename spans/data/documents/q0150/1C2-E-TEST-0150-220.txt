The guy unexpectedly knocked on my door at 6:30PM tonight and it was dark and showering outside.  He was driving a different truck than Wednesday's one.  Nonetheless, this truck is almost identical to the first picture.  And he dumped what amount to 5 yards on the sidewalk next to lamp post.  He used the backhoe (which still sit on my cul-de-sac) to push some of loam that landed on the street back up the sidewalk.
I promptly paid him $210 in cash but not too happy in getting just 5 yards of loam for my money.  Out of nowhere, the guy said to me that he is coming back to my street tomorrow and he can "think of some ways to spread the loam" for me.  I thanked him and will meet him at 8:30AM tomorrow morning.
I had 2 trucks of 5 yards of fills delivered to my house before by a landscape material company.  The delivery truck  (see below) was noticeably smaller and shorter than the above paving truck.  However, the piles on the ground are of about same amount.
