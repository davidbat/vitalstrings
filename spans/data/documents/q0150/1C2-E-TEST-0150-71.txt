How to Measure a Cubic Foot
Surface area of a concrete slab or sand base is directly affected by its thickness. In the photo you see two examples of a measured cubic foot. Since a cubic foot is measured by Length x Width x Thickness, a cube 1 foot long x 1 foot wide x 1 foot thick is therefore 1 cubic foot.
As you reduce the thickness, you increase the surface area (LxW) coverage, like cake batter.
To determine how many cubic feet you need for a hole, measure the length, width and thickness together, all measured in feet. So a 4" thickness is 4"/12" or 0.333 feet. The result of this Length x Width x Thickness multiplication is cubic feet.
Likewise, a cubic yard (yard = 3 feet) is a cube 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet, or 27 cubic feet.
Here's a helpful table that shows how surface area changes as thickness varies for one cubic yard (27 cubic feet) of material:
3" Thickness Provides nominal 100 Square Feet of Surface Area
4" Thickness Provides nominal 81 Square Feet of Surface Area
5" Thickness Provides nominal 65 Square Feet of Surface Area
6" Thickness Provides nominal 55 Square Feet of Surface Area
8" Thickness Provides nominal 40 Square Feet of Surface Area
