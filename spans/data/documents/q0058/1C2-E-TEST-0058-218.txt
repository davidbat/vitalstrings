Give the other researchers a year to pour through Bugliosi's material, if it's flawed, they'll find it. Meanwhile, the "believe me or you're insane" tactic isn't swaying me.

There are lots and lots of open ends on the JFK assassination. I am curious as to how he refutes James Files' confession and the independently gathered physical evidence that he did take a shot from the grassy knoll. Interesting details here .
I suppose the most compelling thing in my mind is that Oswald had no real motive to kill Kennedy. He was an essentially sane person, if rather a sad guy, who was clearly involved in U.S intelligence operations. The JFK Murder Solved materials point to a person who was recruited by the CIA for covert operations and who then turned into a double agent, providing the FBI with details on covert CIA operations. When J Edgar Hoover used Oswald's intelligence to shut down secret training bases in the U.S. used by CIA-supported Cuban nationals, per JFK's orders, Oswald was likely exposed to the CIA as a mole. The placement of Oswald in the assassination scheme with clear tie-backs to Hoover was perhaps the CIA's way of tying Hoover's hands on the investigation - he'd be hard-pressed to lead an investigation in which the purported main suspect lead back to his own operations. So what was Oswald's personal motivation? None. He was there because his CIA leader put him there.
All water under the bridge, except for the fact that the legacy of these operatives lives with us to this very day. To one degree or another the history of the CIA is the core of the history of the U.S. over the past fifty years.
