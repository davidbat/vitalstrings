If you like conspiracies. Here’s a great documentary about the JFK assassination conspiracy.
One of the greatest conspiracy theories in American history is that of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This documentary uses recently declassified information from the Assassinations Records Review Board as well as other evidence that has been widely exposed since the assassination in 1963.
The ‘magic bullet’ theory is looked into and the documentary also looks at such studies as the Warren Report in 1964, HSCA Final Report in 1979 and Gerald Posner’s Case Closed in 1993 to examine whether there is a sufficient case for suggesting the death of John F. Kennedy was due to another party other than Lee Harvey Oswald. The end result and conclusion becomes very concise and is more shocking as well as disturbing than you could imagine. A lot of conspiracies are often slated for being inaccurate or false. This conspiracy has so much evidence in its favour it is almost impossible to dismiss it.
