Posted by admin as conspiracy theory
Part 2 of 3.
This episode (in three parts) explores the popular perception of a ‘conspiracy theory’ and why this common attitude is dangerous to a ‘free and open society’. This episode illustrates how this perception leads to political complacency, effectively undermining democracy substituting it with an illusion of ‘free choice’ underpinned by Hegelian dialectic.
It also examines the crucial role of the media in the ‘free nations of today’, and how secret political agenda’s and institutions (such as the CIA) have molded the role of the media in society over the years.
These concerns are all highlighted in John F. Kennedy’s Speech: “the president and the press” (1961).
