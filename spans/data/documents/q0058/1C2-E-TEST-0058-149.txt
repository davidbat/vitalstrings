Try this link from another thread posted by Blazer2004...http://www.jfkmurdersolved.com/index1.htmThe experts (conspiring) can 'debunk' until the cows come home...It's not going to convince those who believe there was a conspiracy. Vimjams

Anyone seen that new game - JFK reloaded.It's a computer version of the JFK assassination and you are oswald. The demo is crap. You need the buy the full version to start some mayhem. And if you shoot JFK in EXACTLY the same spot as Oswald you win $100,000!!!!!JFK reloaded

You have to get as close to proving the lone gunman theory...IE...making all 3 shots.Yah i dont think Oswald was the one who killed him...mainly cause of these 5 words..Back..and to the left

Also the zepruter film has been tampered and edited so much that it's not at all like the one originally shown. Anyone have that picture of the Italian hit-man wearing the cop outfit? He's seen at the moment he shoots, you can tell the muzzle flash, colorized ofcourse as the photo was in black and white.

The original Zapruder movie is shown on "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" 3 part doco ... The picture you refer to known as the Barbara Mormon Photo reveals the image of "Badgeman" this pic shows the REAL assassin & his name was Sartiz he was from Marseilles, Spain. He was a rather well known hitman whose trademark was explosive tip bullets (which reverse normal effect of small entry-large exit & instead leave large entry & often no exit) When you look at a photo of Sartiz then look at the full blown up badgeman image there IS a SCARY likeness. I believe Oswald shot ... [More]

I'm still amazed that the most famous footage of all time (well you can count Iwo Jima and some others too) is complimented by a photo which shows the exact split-second the muzzle flash went off from the fatal shot assassin. Unbelievable, it's like fate stepped in right there, nature tied everything up!Anyone have the color close-up of the muzzle flash going off?
