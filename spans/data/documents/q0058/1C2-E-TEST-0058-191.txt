Debunking JFK Conspiracy Theories
May 17, 2001 By James McNally
REM was great, I’ll try to post a pic or two tomorrow.
For now, though, here’s a link to an interesting site which attempts to debunk most of the JFK assassination conspiracy theories. There’s a great page about Oliver Stone’s film and how he (and by extension, Jim Garrison) distorted the facts. Very well researched. I’m still not convinced Oswald acted alone, but I’m glad that this site is attempting to bring a little balance to the subject. It is history, after all. (via Metafilter )
