Victim Du Jour
Math and Science says a pinko shot JFK with an Italian made bolt action rifle.  Scored two hits, including a head shot, by firing his weapon 3 times in a few seconds from the snipers nest in the book building.

The math and science of a 2 year old.  As an avid hunter that uses a bolt action rifle, there ain’t no way, no way that this was possible.  I cannot emphasize how impossible this would be.

@Tom
You can win a million dollars if you play the video game JFK reloaded, and prove it wasn’t Oswald who shot JFK.
The History Channel showed how the made a 3D computer animated model of Dealy Plaza, and all the details left out of that Oliver Stone movie.
Only a dumb pothead with a political agenda attached to a conspiracy believes it was someone else.
Who cares if you are a whimpy hunter in Minnesota.  Shooting a deer is easy, the real hunters go to Africa.

@tom I agree with you , now on to victim du Jour if what you say is true then you can answer this one question right? how is it that if all three or four shots can from the school book biulding then why did’nt the one that entered the neck not explode but the one to the head did ? just asking
Victim Du Jour
The History Channel debunked all you potheads.
You are only making a d-bag out of yourself by pretending it wasn’t Oswald.
