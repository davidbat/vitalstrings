I love sfwChan for posting gems like this declaration that Rebecca Black‘s viral, hate-that-you-love-it hit “Friday” is actually an intricately coded commentary on the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. It’s unclear if this is an elaborate, ironic joke or if Anonymous actually put a lot of thought into the post, but a scary number of details match up… (Click to expand.)
Don’t you just love Internet posters with so much time on their hands? Thank you for making me laugh today, sfwChan.
