The Conspiracy Book List
Goto comments Leave a comment
The Conspiracy Book List consists of a fairly good index of books related to conspiracy and conspiracy theories on various current and historical events .
This list is a skeleton. Currently it is in alphabetical order by last name of author. I’ll also make it available in order by title, in order by subject then title, and by subject then title and short description.
I’ll add in information about year first published, & number of pages. (Publisher may or may not be so useful to put in; many books are published by many publishers in their lifetime and current publishers are easy to look up.)
