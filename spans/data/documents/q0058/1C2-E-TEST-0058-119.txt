Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
President Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, Nellie Connally and Governor John Connally, shortly before the assassination. There are many theories regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963; many arose soon after his death and continue to be promoted today. Most put forth a criminal conspiracy involving parties as varied as the Federal Reserve, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the KGB, the Mafia, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover, Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson, Fidel Castro or someone commissioned thereby, Cuban exile groups opposed to Castro, and the military and/or government interests of the United States.
Handbill circulated on November 21, 1963, one day before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. that Oswald was in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, and stated their belief that he acted alone. Critics, even before the publication of the official government conclusions, suggested a conspiracy was behind the assassination. Though the public initially accepted the Warren Commission’s conclusions, by 1966 the tide had turned as authors such as Mark Lane with his best-selling book Rush to Judgment, and prominent publications such as the New York Review of Books and Life openly disputed the findings of the commission. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald assassinated Kennedy. However, the HSCA also concluded that Kennedy was assassinated "probably as a result of a conspiracy." The HSCA also stated: "The Warren Commission failed to
Background
President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as he traveled in an open top car in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963; Texas Governor John Connally was also injured. Within two hours, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder of a Dallas policeman, and that evening arraigned on a charge of murder in the death of officer J.D. Tippit. At 1:35 A.M the following morning, Oswald was arraigned on the charge of murdering the president. On November 24, 1963, while being transferred from the Dallas Police Department to the county jail, Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner. In 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that there was no persuasive evidence

investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President."[1] Other official investigations of the assassination include the Ramsey Clark Panel and the Rockefeller Commission, both of which supported the Warren Commission’s conclusions, and the Jim Garrison investigation, which tried unsuccessfully to convict Clay Shaw of participation in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. Polls since 1966 have consistently reflected the public’s belief that Kennedy was murdered as the result of a conspiracy. For example, according to a 2003 ABC poll, "seven in 10 Americans think the assassination of John F. Kennedy was the result of a plot, not the act of a lone killer — and a bare majority thinks that plot included a second shooter in Dealey Plaza."[2]
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
according to some researchers. Oswald’s rifle, through testing by the FBI, could only be fired three times within the five to eight seconds of the assassination. The Warren Commission, through eyewitnesses, determined that only three bullets were fired as well: one of the three bullets missed the vehicle entirely; one hit Kennedy and passed through Governor John Connally, and the third bullet was fatal to the President. The weight of the bullet fragments taken from Connally and those remaining in his body supposedly totaled more than could have been missing from the bullet found on Connally’s stretcher, known as the "pristine bullet". However, witness testimony seems to indicate that only tiny fragments, of less total mass than was missing from the bullet, were left in Connally.[3] In addition, the trajectory of the bullet, which hit Kennedy above the right shoulder blade and passed through his neck (according to the autopsy), supposedly would have had to change course to pass through Connally’s chest and wrist.[4] Hence, the conclusion by some historians is that more than three shots were fired and that more than one gunman had to be involved.

Witnesses
Nellie Connally was sitting in the presidential car next to her husband, Governor John Connally. In her book From Love Field: Our Final Hours, Connally was adamant that her husband was hit by a bullet that was separate from the two that hit Kennedy.[5] Roy Kellerman, a U.S. Secret Service Agent, testified that, "Now, in the seconds that I talked just now, a flurry of shells come into the car." Kellerman said that he saw a 5-inch diameter hole in the back right-hand side of the President’s head.[6] Lee Bowers was operating a railroad interlocking tower, overlooking the parking lot just north of the grassy knoll and west of the Texas School Book Depository. He reported that he saw two men behind the picket fence at the top of the grassy knoll before the shooting. However, the men had moved in front of the fence by the time the motorcade went by and the shooting occurred.[7] Thirty-five witnesses who were present at the shooting thought that shots were fired from in front of the President — from the area of the Grassy Knoll or Triple Underpass — while 56 eyewitnesses thought the shots came from the Depository, or at least in that

direction, behind the President, and 5 witnesses thought that the shots came from two directions.[8] Clint Hill, the Secret Service Agent who was sheltering the President with his body on the way to the hospital, described "The right rear portion of his head was missing. It was lying in the rear seat of the car."[9] Later, to a National Geographic documentary film crew, he described the large defect in the skull as "gaping hole above his right ear, about the size of my palm."[10] Robert McClelland, a physician in the emergency room who observed the head wound, testified that the back right part of the head was blown out with posterior cerebral tissue and some of the cerebellar tissue was missing. The size of the back head wound, according to his description, indicated it was an exit wound, and that a second shooter from the front delivered the fatal head shot.[11] Rose Cherami (sometimes spelled "Cheramie") was depicted in Oliver Stone’s 1991 movie JFK as a "witness." Rose Cherami was a 41-year-old drug addict and prostitute who was picked up on Highway 190 near Eunice, Louisiana, on November 20, 1963 -- two days before the Kennedy assassination -- by Lt. Francis Frugé of the Louisiana State Police. Cherami told Frugé that John F. Kennedy would shortly be killed. Fruge did not believe her at first, but after some time of adamant speaking by Cherami, he came around. During her confinement, and prior to the time JFK was shot in Dallas, Cherami supposedly spoke of the impending assassination. After Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, Cherami reportedly claimed that she had worked for Ruby as a stripper, that she knew both Ruby and Oswald, and that the two men were "bed partners" who "had been shacking up for years." According to Lt. Frugé, Cherami declined to repeat her story to the FBI. She was killed when struck by a car on September 4, 1965, apparently while hitchhiking, near Gladewater, Texas. Among conspiracy theorists, the story has been considered quite credible since 1979, when an account by investigator Patricia Orr was published by the House Select Committee reviewing the JFK assassination (HSCA). This account was based primarily on the HSCA depositions of Francis Frugé and Victor Weiss, a doctor at the Jackson hospital.[12]

Analysis
Former U.S. Marine snipers Craig Roberts and Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who was the senior instructor for the U.S. Marine Corps Sniper Instructor School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, both said it could not be done as described by the FBI investigators. “Let me tell you what we did at Quantico,” Hathcock said. “We reconstructed the whole thing: the angle, the range, the moving target, the time limit, the obstacles, everything. I don’t know how many times we tried it, but we couldn’t duplicate what the Warren Commission said Oswald did. Now if I can’t do it, how in the world could a guy who was a non-qual on the rifle range and later only qualified ’marksman’ do it?”[13] Kennedy’s death certificate located the bullet at the third thoracic vertebra — which is too low to have exited his throat.[14] Moreover, the bullet was traveling downward, since the shooter was by a sixth floor window. The autopsy cover sheet had a diagram of a body showing this same low placement at the third thoracic vertebra. The hole in back of Kennedy’s shirt and jacket are also claimed to support a wound too low to be consistent with the Single Bullet Theory.[15][16]
More than one Oswald
Claims that Oswald was impersonated by a political decoy appeared very early in the assassination controversy. Professor Richard H. Popkin’s 1966 work The Second Oswald set out a case for an impersonation of the alleged assassin. Much of this was based on eyewitness testimony, but Popkin did have a "star witness" in the person of FBI director J Edgar Hoover, who wrote a memo predating the assassination in which he warned that an impostor could be using Oswald’s personal details.[17] More recently, the work of John Armstrong has purportedly identified the "two Oswalds" as part of an intelligence operation which originally had no connection to the assassination.[18] However, expert analysis by the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that both "Oswalds" had identical handwriting.[19][20] Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassinations had forensic anthropologists examine photos of Oswald (included in the set were photos that

purportedly showed two different "Oswalds"), and all were consistent with a single individual.[21] Finally, it should be noted that in October 1981 Oswald’s body was exhumed at the behest of British writer Michael Eddowes, with a view towards proving a thesis developed in a 1975 book, Khrushchev Killed Kennedy (republished in 1976, in Britain as November 22: How They Killed Kennedy and in America a year later as The Oswald File). The examination positively identified Oswald’s corpse through dental records, and also detected a mastoid scar from a childhood operation.[22] Contrary to reports, the skull of Oswald had been autopsied and this was confirmed at the exhumation.[23] Further information:1981 exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswald

yard west of the grassy knoll. Speculation regarding the identities of the three and their possible involvement in the assassination became widespread in the ensuing years. Photographs of the three at their time of arrest fueled this speculation, as the three “tramps” appeared to be well-dressed and cleanshaven, seemingly unlikely for hobos riding the rails. Some researchers also thought it suspicious that the Dallas police had quickly released the tramps from custody apparently without investigating whether they might have witnessed anything significant related to the assassination,[29] and by the fact that Dallas police claimed to have lost the records of their arrests[30] as well as their mugshots and fingerprints.[31] In 1989, the Dallas police department released a large collection of files that contained the arrest records of various men, three of whom were Harold Doyle of Red Jacket, West Virginia; John F. Gedney, with no listed home address; and Gus W. Abrams, also with no listed home address. The brief report described the men as "all passing through [Dallas]. They have no jobs, etc." and were known to be rail-riders in the area. The previous evening they had slept in a homeless shelter where they were able to get showered and shaved, explaining their clean appearance on the day of the assassination. The three were released four days later on the morning of November 26, but the arresting officer in the tramp photo testified his men were released within a few hours without being booked.[32] When asked in a 1992 interview, Doyle said that he had deliberately avoided revealing himself to the public limelight, saying, "I am a plain guy, a simple country boy, and that’s the way I want to stay. I wouldn’t be a celebrity for $10 million."[33] Gedney independently affirmed Doyle’s sentiment. Abrams had since died (in Ohio in 1987), but his sister also corroborated the events of that day and noted that Abrams "was always on the go, hopping trains and drinking wine."[34] The three were evidently not involved in the assassination in any way. A list of the better known "identifications" of the three tramps alleged by conspiracy theorists includes: Charles Harrelson, the father of actor Woody Harrelson, has been alleged to be the tallest of the three tramps in the photographs. Harrelson at various times before his
Federal Reserve conspiracy
Jim Marrs in his book Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy has alleged that the assassination of Kennedy occurred from fallout over the issuance of Executive Order 11,110.[24] This executive order enabled the Treasury to print silver certificates, bypassing the Federal Reserve System. Executive Order 11,110 was not officially repealed until the Ronald Reagan Administration. Official explanations claim that the executive order was simply an attempt to drain the silver reserves, and did not actually endanger the careers of anyone working at the Federal Reserve.[25] This theory was further explored by U.S. Marine sniper and veteran police officer Craig Roberts in the 1994 book, Kill Zone.[26] Roberts theorized that the Executive Order was the beginning of a plan by Kennedy whose ultimate goal was to permanently do away with the United States Federal Reserve, and that Kennedy was murdered by a cabal of international bankers determined to foil this plan.
The three tramps
Nearly a dozen people were taken into custody in and around Dealey Plaza in the minutes following the assassination.[27] In most of these instances, no records of the identities of those detained were kept.[28] The most famous of those taken into custody have come to be known as the “tramps,” three men discovered in a boxcar in the rail

death both boasted about and denied his role as one of the tramps,[35] E. Howard Hunt, the CIA station chief who was instrumental in the Bay of Pigs invasion, and who later worked as one of President Richard Nixon’s White House Plumbers, was alleged by some to be the oldest of the tramps. At the time of his death, Hunt’s son released tapes of Hunt implicating LBJ in Kennedy’s assassination.[36] In 1975, Hunt testified to the United States President’s Commission on CIA activities within the United States that he was in Washington, DC on the day of the assassination. This testimony was confirmed by Hunt’s family and a home employee of the Hunts.[37] In 1985 however, in Hunt’s libel suit against Liberty Lobby, defense attorney Mark Lane introduced doubt as to Hunt’s location on the day of the Kennedy assassination through depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, G. Gordon Liddy, Stansfield Turner, and Marita Lorenz, plus a cross-examination of Hunt. Frank Sturgis is thought by some to be the tall tramp in the photographs. Like Hunt, Sturgis was involved both in the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Watergate burglary. In 1959, Sturgis became involved with Marita Lorenz, who later identified Sturgis as a gunman in the assassination.[38] Hunt’s confessions before his death similarly implicates Sturgis. Chauncey Holt, also alleged by some to be the oldest of the tramps, claims to have been a double agent for the CIA and the Mafia, and has claimed that his assignment in Dallas was to provide fake Secret Service credentials to people in the vicinity.[39] Witness reports state that there were one or more unidentified men in the area claiming to be Secret Service agents.[40] The House Select Committee on Assassinations had forensic anthropologists study the photographic evidence. They were able to rule out E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, Dan Carswell, Fred Lee Chapman, and other suspects in 1978.[41] The Rockefeller Commission concluded that neither Hunt nor Frank Sturgis was in Dallas on the day of the assassination.[42] Despite these positive identifications of the tramps and the lack of any connection between them and the assassination, some have maintained their identifications of the three as persons other than Doyle, Gedney and Abrams and have continued to theorize

that they may have been connected to the crime.[43][44]
CIA and anti-Castro Cuban exile conspiracy
Original sign with seal from the CIA’s first building on E Street in Washington, D.C. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was frequently mentioned in theories during the 1960s and 1970s, and CIA was involved in many plots to assassinate foreign leaders. Kennedy said to his collaborator Clark Clifford (shortly after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion) that, "Something very bad is going on within the CIA and I want to know what it is. I want to shred the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter them to the four winds."[45][46] Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA during the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba by a small army of Cuban nationals in April 1961. The assassination policy of the CIA had been created under Allen Dulles. Robert Kennedy had been working as Attorney General and was running the intelligence agency through the White House Special Group. The embarrassment of the U.S. government and the CIA due to the failed invasion turned the Kennedy brothers against Richard Bissell and Allen Dulles resulting in the firing of both Bissell and Dulles.

matters worse Allen Dulles decided to volunteer to help investigate President Kennedy’s murder. According to William Corson, Allen Dulles “lobbied hard for the job” as he was not in the prestigious group appointed by Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson finally appointed him.[47][48] Congress began investigating the intelligence agencies by way of the Church Committee. In the weeks following the assassination, major changes were made in the CIA.
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that in 1979, although Oswald assassinated Kennedy, a conspiracy was probable but that the conspiracy did not implicate any U.S. Intelligence agencies. This conclusion was based almost entirely on the analysis of a police dictabelt which supposedly recorded the sound of a fourth bullet being fired in Dealey Plaza. The HSCA also said that President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection in Dallas, and the Secret Service possessed information that was not properly analyzed, investigated or used by the Secret Service in connection with the President’s trip to Dallas; in addition, Secret Service agents in the motorcade were inadequately prepared to protect the President from a sniper.[55] This lack of protection may have occurred because Kennedy himself had specifically asked that the Secret Service make itself discreet during the Dallas visit,[56] undermining claims that the Secret Service "let it happen." It is important to note that if there were U.S. intelligence agencies to be implicated in the murder of a sitting president, that murder would effectively constitute a coup d’état.
CIA assassinations
In 1975 and 1976, the Church Committee published fourteen reports on the formation of U.S. intelligence agencies, their operations, and the alleged abuses of law and of power that they had committed. Among the matters the Church Committee investigated, was the involvement by U.S. intelligence agencies to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of the Democratic Republic of the Congo[49] and Fidel Castro. The CIA provided $42,000 in immediate support money to the plotters on the morning of the assassination of President Diem of Vietnam, which was carried out by Lucien Conein,[50] although Robert S. McNamara and historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., (who was a participant as a White House historian) both stated that President Kennedy went pale when he heard the news about the coup and was shocked that Diem had been murdered.[51] Kennedy and the CIA had a strained relationship following the Bay of Pigs disaster, with Kennedy remarking that he wanted "to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds."[52] However, that animosity was evidently short-lived, as CIA deputy director for intelligence John L. Hegerson would later write that "the [CIA’s] relationship with Kennedy was not only a distinct improvement over the more formal relationship with Eisenhower, but would only rarely be matched in future administrations."[53] While the CIA’s budget has always been classified, ranking CIA official William Colby made it clear when he wrote, "the fact of the matter is that the CIA could not have had a better friend in a President than John F. Kennedy. He understood the Agency and used it effectively, exploiting its intellectual abilities to help him analyze a complex world, and its paramilitary and covert political talents to react to it in a low key way."[54]
Cuban exiles
Richard Helms, a director of the CIA’s Office of Special Operations, had reason to be hostile to Kennedy since when first elected, Kennedy supported invading Cuba and then only later changed his mind about how to approach the matter. After the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba sponsored by the CIA, Kennedy changed his mind about an invasion, earning the hatred of the Cuban exile community. Thus, Helms was immediately put under pressure from President Kennedy and his brother Robert (the Attorney General) to increase American efforts to get rid of the Castro regime. Operation Mongoose had nearly 4,000 operators involved in attacks on Cuban economic targets. The House Select Committee on Assassinations believed evidence existed implicating certain violent Cuban exiles may have participated in Kennedy’s murder. These exiles worked closely with CIA operatives in violent activities against Castro’s Cuba. In 1979, the committee reported this: President Kennedy’s popularity among the Cuban exiles had plunged deeply by 1963. Their

bitterness is illustrated in a tape recording of a meeting of anti-Castro Cubans and right-wing Americans in the Dallas suburb of Farmer’s Branch on October 1, 1963. (37) Holding a copy of the September 26 edition of The Dallas Morning News, featuring a front-page account of the President’s planned trip to Texas in November, the Cuban exile vented his hostility: "CASTELLANOS... we’re waiting for Kennedy the 22d, [the date Kennedy was murdered] buddy. We’re going to see him in one way or the other. We’re going to give him the works when he gets in Dallas. Mr. good ol’ Kennedy. I wouldn’t even call him President Kennedy. He stinks."[57] Author Joan Didion explored the Miami antiCastro Cuban theory in her 1987 non-fiction book "Miami."[58][59]

conspiracy to kill JFK orchestrated by Lyndon Johnson, CIA agents Cord Meyer, Bill Harvey and David Sánchez Morales, as well as a "French gunman," who purportedly shot at Kennedy from the grassy knoll.[64]
Organized crime and the CIA conspiracy
Another possible conspiracy was by Mafia criminals, in retaliation for increasing pressure put upon them by Robert Kennedy (who had increased by 12 times the number of prosecutions under President Dwight Eisenhower). Documents never seen by the Warren Commission have revealed that some Mafiosi were working very closely with the CIA on several assassination attempts of Fidel Castro.[65] Frank Sinatra has been accused of being a "go-between" for these Mafia personalities and the Kennedys.[66] In addition, allegedly Mafia actors had funneled thousands of dollars to the Kennedy presidential campaign through back channels, supposedly in exchange for influence in the White House; in one instance, the money was supposedly used to pay off county sheriffs in the state of West Virginia so that the published slate of local candidates included Kennedy for the West Virginia [67][68] despite the fact that the primary, White House does not have direct and immediate authority over sheriffs in West Virginia. It is also theorized that the Chicago mob helped fix the election returns in the city so that Kennedy would win Illinois’ electoral votes, partly as a favor to JFK’s father, Joseph Kennedy, and that they later felt betrayed by the pressure put upon the Mob by the Kennedy Administration. Judith Campbell Exner, as described in her book My Story in 1977, was having an affair with Jack Kennedy and Sam Giancana and was used to send money back and forth between the mob and the campaign.[68] Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa, and mobsters Carlos Marcello, Sam Giancana, Johnny Roselli, Charles Nicoletti and Santo Trafficante Jr. (all of whom say Hoffa worked with the CIA on the Castro assassination plots) top the list of House Select Committee on Assassinations Mafia suspects.[69] Carlos Marcello allegedly threatened to assassinate the President to short-circuit his younger brother Bobby, who was serving as
E. Howard Hunt
Former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt has been named as a possible participant in several Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories. Separately, he has denied complicity in the murder of JFK while accusing others of being involved. Some researchers have identified Hunt as a figure crossing Dealey Plaza in a raincoat and fedora immediately after the assassination.[60] Others have suggested that Hunt was one of the men known as the three tramps who were arrested and then quickly released shortly after the assassination. In 1976, a magazine called The Spotlight ran an article accusing Hunt of being in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and of having a role in the assassination. Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in 1981, but this was thrown out on appeal, and the magazine was found not guilty when the case was retried in 1985.[61] Shortly before his death in 2007, Hunt authored an autobiography which implicated Lyndon B. Johnson in the assassination. Hunt suggested that Johnson had orchestrated the killing with the help of CIA agents who had been angered by Kennedy’s actions as President.[62][63] A 2007 article published in Rolling Stone magazine revealed deathbed confessions by Hunt to his son which suggested a

attorney general and leading the administration’s anti-Mafia crusade.[70][71] In his memoir, Bound by Honor: A Mafioso’s Story, Bill Bonanno, son of New York Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno explains that several Mafia families had long-standing ties with the anti-Castro Cubans through the Havana casinos operated by the Mafia before the Cuban Revolution. The Cubans hated Kennedy because he failed to fully support them in the Bay of Pigs Invasion; the Mafia hated the Kennedys because, as Attorney General, the young and idealistic Robert Kennedy conducted an unprecedented legal assault on organized crime. This was especially provocative because several of the Mafia "families" had worked with JFK’s father, Joseph Kennedy, to get JFK elected. Both the Mafia and the anti-Castro Cubans were expert in assassination, the Cubans having been trained by the CIA. Bonanno reports that he realized the degree of the involvement of other Mafia families when he witnessed Jack Ruby killing Oswald on television: the Bonannos recognized Jack Ruby as an associate of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.[72] Information released only around 2006 by the FBI indicates that Carlos Marcello confessed in detail to having organized Kennedy’s assassination. [3] The FBI then covered up this information which it had in its possession. This version of events is also supported by the findings of a 1979 Congressional Committee investigation that Marcello was likely part of a Mafia conspiracy behind the assassination, and had the means and the opportunity required. The assassination came less than a fortnight prior to a coup against Castro in Cuba by the Kennedy brothers, related to the Missile Crisis and Bay of Pigs. James Files claims to be a former assassin working for both the Mafia and the CIA who participated in the assassination along with Johnny Roselli and Charles Nicoletti at the behest of Sam Giancana.[73] He is currently serving a 30-year jail sentence for the attempted murder of a policeman.
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
Photo which shows Congressman Albert Richard Thomas allegedly winking at President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard Air Force One following the assassination of President Kennedy and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy’s assassination with the help of his friend attorney Edward Clark. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper’s nest likely belonged to Johnson’s associate Malcolm "Mac" Wallace, and that Mac Wallace was therefore the assassin. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates including Clint Murchison and H. L. Hunt. McClellan’s book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner’s ongoing documentary television series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy. The episode, entitled "The Guilty Men", drew widespread condemnation from both the Johnson family and President Johnson’s former aides following its airing on The History Channel, which subsequently agreed not to air the episode in the future.[75] Madeleine D. Brown, a former mistress of Johnson, has also implicated him in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Brown alleged in 1997 that Johnson along with H. L. Hunt had begun planning Kennedy’s demise as early as 1960. Brown claimed that by its fruition in 1963 the conspiracy involved dozens of persons including the leadership of FBI and the Mafia as well as well-known politicians and journalists.[76] Johnson was also accused of complicity in the assassination by former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt.

Security (KGB), who resided in New York City at the time of the assassination, stated that it was his personal feeling that the assassination of President Kennedy had been planned by an organized group rather than being the act of one individual assassin.[77] Much later, the highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa described his conversation with Nicolae Ceauşescu who told him about "ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill": "László Rajk and Imre Nagy of Hungary; Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu and Gheorghiu-Dej in Romania; Rudolf Slánský, the head of Czechoslovakia, and Jan Masaryk, that country’s chief diplomat; the shah of Iran; Palmiro Togliatti of Italy; American President John F. Kennedy; and Mao Zedong." Pacepa provided some additional details, such as a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organized by KGB and noted that "among the leaders of Moscow’s satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy."[78] New information regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy confidante Mary Pinchot Meyer has led to a reinterpretation of a statement by retired senior CIA official Cord Meyer shortly before his death in 2001. Meyer’s statement seems to suggest that CIA learned many years ago, possibly from a defector, that the KGB organized the assassination of Kennedy, most likely as revenge for the humiliation of the Cuban missile crisis.[79] Documents in the Mitrokhin Archive revealed that the Soviet Union actively promoted conspiracy theories about the assassination as part of a disinformation campaign to undermine public trust in the US government.[80]
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
Julio Fernandez, and he said he was calling her from New Orleans. Julio Fernandez told her that Lee Harvey Oswald had approached his group and offered his services as a potential Castro assassin. Fernandez further claimed that he and his associates had eventually found out that Oswald was actually a committed Communist and supporter of Castro, and that they kept a close watch on his activities until he suddenly came into money and went to Mexico City and then Dallas. Finally, Fernandez told Luce, “There is a Cuban Communist assassination team at large and Oswald was their hired gun.”[81] Luce told the caller to give his information to the FBI. Subsequently, she would reveal the details of the incident to both the Church Committee and the HSCA. Both committees attempted to investigate the incident, but were unsuccessful in uncovering any evidence to corroborate the allegations in question.[82] President Lyndon Johnson informed several journalistic sources of his personal belief that the assassination had been organized by Fidel Castro from Cuba. Johnson had received in 1967 information from both the FBI and CIA that in the early 1960s, the CIA had tried to have Castro assassinated, had employed members of the Mafia in this effort, and that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had known about both the plots and the Mafia’s involvement.[83] It was Johnson’s belief that JFK’s assassination had been organized by Castro as a retaliation for the CIA’s efforts to kill Castro. In October, 1968, Johnson told veteran newsman Howard K. Smith, that "Kennedy was trying to get to Castro, but Castro got to him first." In September, 1969, in a interview with Walter Cronkite of CBS, Johnson said that in regard to the assassination he could not, "honestly say that I’ve ever been completely relieved of the fact that there might have been international connections." Finally, in 1971, Johnson told Leo Janos of Time Magazine that he, "never believed that Oswald acted alone."
Cuban conspiracy
In the early 1960s Clare Booth Luce, wife of publisher Henry Luce was one of a number of prominent Americans who sponsored the anti-Castro movement in the United States. This support included the funding of a motorboat used by exile commandos in their raids against Cuba. In a 1975 interview, Clare Luce revealed that on the night of the assassination, she received a phone call from one of the boat’s crew members. According to Luce, the caller’s name was "something like"

Research Center (commonly called "Dimona")[84] and/or the Israelis were angry over Kennedy’s sympathies with Arabs.[85] Gangster Meyer Lansky[86] and Lyndon B. Johnson often play pivotal roles in this conspiracy theory as organizing and preparing the hit, thus bleeding into and possibly catalyzing many of the other conspiracies as well.[85] In July 2004 Israel’s nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu claimed in the Londonbased Al-Hayat newspaper that the state of Israel was complicit in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Vanunu, a former technician at the Dimona plant who was jailed for 18 years for revealing its inner workings to Britain’s Sunday Times in 1986, made the statement after his 2004 release. He claimed there were “near-certain indications” Kennedy was assassinated in response to “pressure he exerted on Israel’s then head of government, David Ben-Gurion, to shed light on Dimona’s nuclear reactor.”[87]

that President Kennedy’s body arrived at Bethesda in a body bag, which differed from the sheet it was wrapped in at Parkland Hospital. He stated the brain had already been removed by the time it got to Bethesda, and that there was only "half of a handful" of brain matter left inside the skull. According to Nigel Turner, director of the 1988 British television documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy, "There were mysterious men in civilian clothes at the autopsy. They seemed to command a lot of respect and look over my shoulder or over Dr. J. Thornton Boswell’s shoulder, then they’d go back and have a conference in the corner. Then one of them would say ’Stop what you’re doing and go on to another procedure.’ We jumped back and forth, back and forth. There was no smooth flow of procedure at all." As done with all cargo on airplanes for safety, the coffin and lid were held by steel wrapping cables to prevent shifting during takeoff and landing and in case of air disturbances in flight. The casket was also under ample armed guard at all times, a fact that Lifton neglects to mention. In addition, the plane was watched by thousands of people that bathed the far side of the plane in lights and provided a very public stage for any body snatchers.[90][91]
Decoy hearse and wound alteration
David S. Lifton and others have theorized that the coffin removed from Air Force One and placed in a waiting ambulance at Andrews Air Force Base on the evening of November 22, 1963 was empty. The president’s body was taken off the jet out of the television camera’s view. This portion of Lifton’s theory comes from a House Select Committee on Assassinations report of an interview of Lt. Richard A. Lipsey on January 18, 1978 by committee staff members Donald Andrew Purdy Jr. and T. Mark Flanagan Jr. in which Lipsey said that in his capacity as aide to General Wehle, he had met President Kennedy’s body at Andrews Air Force Base. The report stated that Lipsey "placed [the casket] in a hearse to be transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Lipsey mentioned that he and Whele then flew by helicopter to Bethesda and took the President’s body into the back of Bethesda. A decoy hearse had been driven to the front." A decoy hearse carrying an empty casket.[88] Laboratory Technologist Paul Kelly O’Connor[89] was one of the major witnesses supporting David Lifton’s theory that somewhere between Parkland and Bethesda the President’s body was made to appear as if it had been shot only from the rear. O’Connor says
Other published theories
• The Gemstone File: A Memoir (2006),[92] by Stephanie Caruana, posits that Oswald was part of a 28-man assassination team which included three U.S. Mafia hitmen (Jimmy Fratianno, John Roselli, and Eugene Brading). Oswald’s role was to shoot John Connally. Bruce Roberts, author of the Gemstone file papers, claimed that the JFK assassination scenario was modeled after a supposed attempted assassination of President F.D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt was riding in an open car with Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago. Cermak was shot and killed by Giuseppe Zangara. In Dallas, JFK was the real target, and Connally was a secondary target. The JFK assassination is only a small part of the Gemstone File’s account.

caused by an in-and-through shot originating from the grassy knoll. Three shots were fired from three different angles, none of them from Lee Harvey Oswald’s window at the Texas Book Depository. Wrone is a professor of history (emeritus) at the University of WisconsinStevens Point. ISBN 0-7006-1291-2. JFK: The Second Plot (2002) by Matthew Smith explores the strange case of Roscoe White. In 1990, Roscoe’s son Ricky made public a claim that his father, who had been a Dallas police officer in 1963, was involved in killing the president. Roscoe’s widow Geneva also claimed that before her husband’s death in 1971 he left a diary in which he revealed that he was one of the marksmen who shot the President, and that he also killed Officer J. D. Tippit. ISBN 1840185015. The Kennedy Mutiny (2002) by Will Fritz (not the same as police captain J. Will Fritz), claims that the assassination plot was orchestrated by General Edwin Walker, and that he framed Oswald for the crime. ISBN 0-9721635-0-6. Norman Mailer’s Oswald’s Tale: An American Mystery (1995) concludes that Oswald was guilty, but holds that the evidence may point to a second gunman on the grassy knoll, who, purely by coincidence, was attempting to kill JFK at the same time as Oswald. "If there was indeed another shot, it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald’s. Such a gun could have belonged to another lone killer or to a conspirator working for some other group altogether."[93] ISBN 0-679-42535-7. Passport to Assassination (1993) by Oleg M. Nechiporenko, the Soviet consular official (and highly placed KGB officer) who met with Oswald in Mexico City in 1963. He was afforded the unique opportunity to interview Oswald about his goals including his genuine desire for a Cuban visa. His conclusions were (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife’s professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations.

Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
Callahan and Mark Zingarelli explores some of the more obscure theories regarding JFK’s murder, such as "The Coca-Cola Theory." According this theory, suggested by the editor of an organic gardening magazine, Oswald killed JFK due to mental impairment stemming from an addiction to refined sugar, as evidenced by his need for his favorite beverage immediately after the assassination. ISBN 0-671-79494-9. Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK (1992) by Bonar Menninger (ISBN 0-312-08074-3) alleges that while Oswald did attempt to assassinate JFK and did succeed in wounding him, the fatal shot was accidentally fired by Secret Service agent George Hickey, who was riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the Presidential Limousine. The theory alleges that after the first two shots were fired the motorcade sped up while Hickey was attempting to respond to Oswald’s shots and he lost his balance and accidentally pulled the trigger of his AR-15 and shot JFK. Hickey’s testimony says otherwise: "At the end of the last report (shot) I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, and turned to the rear." (italics added).[94] George Hickey sued Menninger in April 1995 for what he had written in Mortal Error. The case was dismissed as its statute of limitations had run out. Mark North’s Act of Treason: The Role of J. Edgar Hoover in the assassination of President Kennedy, (1991) implicates the FBI Director. North documents that Hoover was aware of threats against Kennedy by organized crime before 1963, and suggests that he failed to take proper action to prevent the assassination. North also charges Hoover with failure to work adequately to uncover the truth behind Kennedy’s murder. ISBN 0881848778.
