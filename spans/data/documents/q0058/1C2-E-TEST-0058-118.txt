Was it an accident or a nefarious plot accomplished by the son of an assassin?

The Assassination of JFK, Jr.
There is a fine line between “serious documentary ” and “rabid attack on alleged American Nazis based on spurious claims.” Documentary maker John Hankey apparently never noticed that line when he tripped over it and brought his conspiracy theory into the land of the ludicrous.
It’s not that conspiracy theories are bad things. Some of them inform us or introduce new thinking, others entertain about long-forgotten historic events, while others make us laugh out loud. The theory that John F. Kennedy, Jr., may have been assassinated is an interesting one because of the Kennedy family history and the viewer’s knowledge that it could happen.
The Assassination of JFK, Jr ., does not serve itself well. With animations an eight-year-old could have accomplished with a PCjr. and the inclusion of cartoon characters from The Simpsons and The Fairly Odd Parents , it provokes laughter instead of deep consideration of its premise. Inflammatory claims, outrageous insults, and baseless assertions round out the “evidence.” Because it is all so blatant, The Assassination of JFK, Jr., provides the audience with an entertainment vehicle equal to an Ed Wood movie . It may be bad, but it’s hilariously so.
Tying in the death of JFK, Jr., the assassinations of JFK, Sr., and RFK (yes, even Lincoln !), and the tragedy of 9/11, The Assassination of JFK, Jr., is little more than an overdone rant, like the ravings of a lunatic (if lunatics still rave). Its sole redeeming value is that it may inspire some viewers to do a little research on their own into this American tragedy, ascertaining if the information provided—while stimulating—is factual. As an alternative to watching a ridiculously bad movie for laughs, it amuses; as serious journalism, it fails.
