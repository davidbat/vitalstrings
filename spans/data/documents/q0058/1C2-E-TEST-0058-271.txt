You can find conspiracy theories about just about any historical event if you look hard enough.  I do know that several of the other assasinations and attempted assasinations on American presidents have their own conspiracy theories surrounding them.  I believe there may be a popular conspiracy theory dealing with the attempted assasination on Ronald Reagan.  There is certainly much speculation regarding the assasination of Robert Kennedy also.  I think JFK's assasination and corresponding conspiracy theories are so popular because A). It was one of the largest moments in American history and will never be forgotten and B). JFK's assasination has been shrouded in mystery since the day it happened and there does seem to be many good reasons to think that more went on that day in Dealey Plaza than we have been told about.
