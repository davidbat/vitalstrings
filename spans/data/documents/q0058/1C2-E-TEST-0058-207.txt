The assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy were incidents of infamy that took place five years apart, but two documentary films that investigate inconsistencies in the official reports pertaining to both murders are making their appearance almost simultaneously, and soon.
Oswald's Ghost , directed by Robert Stone , focuses on the implausibility of Lee Harvey Oswald's ability to fire three shots at JFK as his motorcade made its way through Dealey Plaza, while in RFK Must Die: The Assassination of Bobby Kennedy , director Shane O'Sullivan concludes that Sirhan Sirhan was part of a conspiracy when he killed Bobby Kennedy.
Both films treat the deaths of the two leaders as national tragedies that changed the course of history and altered the American outlook.  The films are must-sees.  Watch for RFK Must Die: The Assassination of Bobby Kennedy on DVD on November 20, and for Oswald's Ghost on PBS in January, 2008.
