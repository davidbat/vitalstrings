Just watch the Canadian version of 9/11 and what they uncovered. I watched the Canadian news right after 9/11 happened and continued to watch for months after. It would amaze the American people what information was uncovered. Where Bush was, who he helped get out of our country and why he did what he did and who was involoved in all the underhanded stuff that Bush and his crons took part in.

Lets see here. It’s not enough that the so-called “conspirators” manage blowup both of the Twin Towers and the  Pentagon in order to scare the crap out of American people they then decide that the final coup de grace will be to blow up the 57th tallest building in New York City. So they take the chance getting caught planting explosives in Building # 7 in order to accomplish this final icing on the cake. 
You’ve got to be kidding. These people are nuts and their theories are just as crazy and Building #7 proves the case.  No one in NYC even cared about Building #7 (except the people who worked there) so the idea of it as a ‘target’ for the greatest hit on US territory in absurd on it’s face.  
You can just hear the average American thinking: I wasn’t scared when they blew up the two towers and the Pentagon but when Building #7 came down that sent me over the edge.

No I am not saying they planted bombs and blew up the building at all, but the information that was uncovered is worth a second thought from people who have open minds and don’t believe everything just because the gov tells you that it’s true

Why is it so hard for people to believe terrorism is responsible for the tragedy of 9/11, not the the U.S Govt.? I dont know what anyone else saw that day, but I watched in horror as huge planes slammed into the buildings. I saw reports showing a downed plane in pennsylvania and another crashed into the pentagon. I realise government is hard to trust, but to say the american govt orchestrated this attack is utterly preposterous.

We live in a country where over 60% of the people think we should raise taxes on the wealthy and yet the discussion isn’t even on the table when our “leaders” talk about our economy.  
We live in a country where over 60% of the people want to end the wars we are involved in and shrink the military but the military budget is “exempt”from the discussion.  
It is difficult to not believe in conspiracies when faced with statistics like these.

It is mentioned in this article that one of our jet fighters could have shot down at least one of the hijacked planes!  To me it is inconceivable that one of our fighters would ever shoot down an an American loaded commercial jet liner in American air space unless, it was getting too close to one of our illustrious presidents!

It appears that AP writer Tamara Lush has never heard about Dr. Judy Wood and her 500 page hard cover textbook WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?…
http://wheredidthetowersgo.com/
On 9/11 over a half mile of vertical building height, containing nearly 150 football fields of floor space, was reduced to a near-level field of dust and debris, where rescue workers walked horizontally or rappelled into empty caverns to look for survivors. How was this possible given the standard laws of engineering and physics? The 9/11 Commission Report bypassed this central issue, as did the report of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Contrary to its stated objective of determining ‘why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed,’ the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) made the stunning admission that it did not investigate how the towers fell. Neither the standard view that the Twin Towers collapsed from fire nor the standard opposition view that they were intentionally detonated by thermite explosives explains the evidence, nor do they follow the laws of engineering and physics. Dr. Wood left Clemson to research the 9/11 conundrum full time, and she has focused her research strictly on physical evidence and scientific principles. WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? provides an understandable, credible, and photo-enhanced summary of Dr. Wood’s disturbing findings, which resulted in her lawsuit against the contractors of the NIST report.
Dr. Judy Wood earned a Ph.D. Degree from Virginia Tech and is a former professor of mechanical engineering. She has research expertise in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, deformation analysis, materials characterization and materials engineering science. Her research has involved testing materials, including complex-material systems, in the area of photomechanics, or the use of optical and image-analysis methods to determine physical properties of materials and measure how materials respond to forces placed on them. Her area of expertise involves interferometry.
She taught graduate and undergraduate engineering classes and has authored or co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed papers in her areas of expertise.
In the time since 9/11/01, she has applied her expertise in materials science, image analysis and interferometry, to a forensic study of over 40,000 images, hundreds of video clips and a large volume of witness testimony pertaining to the destruction of the WTC complex. Dr. Wood has conducted a comprehensive forensic investigation of what physically happened to the World Trade Center site on 9/11. And, based on her analysis of the evidence she gathered, in 2007, she filed a federal qui tam case for science fraud against the contractors who contributed to the official NIST report about the destruction of the WTC. This case was filed in the US Supreme Court in Dec 2009. To this day, Dr. Wood’s investigation is the only comprehensive forensic investigation in the public domain.

This story is quite typical in the way that it is written – playing to people’s emotions – like good prose does – rather than actually re-examining the facts – or, even, covering lesser-known facts.
The comments too are fairly typical for internet postings – with many anonymous posters – who shy away from actually discussing or pointing out bits of evidence – and encouraging a re-examination of same – rather, they try to “score points” over one another, or they make judgements about each others’ intelligence – based on a couple of paragraphs of their writing.
For me, the evidence is the key – and the king.
So, for those that have the courage to examine/re-examine, I suggest you use Emmanuel Goldsteins post as a starting point.
Here is a short video I made which, for many, will show them a small selection of evidence relating to the events of 9/11 which are NOT covered in this article and rarely discussed – sensibly – elsewhere.
http://blip.tv/file/3066807
Sensible comments to this link, along the lines of “Hmm that’s interesting” or “I did not know that” would be the most appropriate. However, if my 7 years of experience are anything to go by, there aren’t likely to me many of those.
I do hope people will get their “spider senses” finely tuned for the upcoming psychological onslaught…

My 12 yo nephew disproved the U.S.’s 911 report in a science fair. He built a 3 ft tower with an erector set and set the top of it on fire and continued to heat the top with a welder. Guess what ? It didn’t crumble in free fall speed. Wake up America and use some common sense and physics.

What government is that, the people, average citizens, we elect all the time?  I believe part of what political officals say about certain things but in this case it looks pretty clear cut. Al Qaeda did it and pulled off an incredible long shot. The part of the story that remains a mystery or untold is how and why the FBI. CIA and the Bush White House ignored all the warning signs that could have allowed them to stop it. I read the 9/11 comission report from front to back and it tells about 75% of the story. why? Because Bush didn’t want the truth told and starved the committee of funds. Bush, the FBI and the CIA are idiots and thus could never pull anything off.

JFK’s  assassination was an ‘inside job’ and Oswald was the lackey who took the fall out of his own stupidity. After all Jack Ruby had to shut him up before he could name names.
9-11, I saw the planes in real time crash into the building, they brought down the towers.

#7 came down because it was right next to two giant buildings that had just fallen down a few hours before and showered #7 with debris, they then causght fire.  Bombs?  when the ice storm it in maine and the trees started to break it sounded like gunshots. Ever been in a big earthquake? boom boom boom. Lots of things breaking sound like other things including bombs.
Why would anyone put explosives in the 57th tallest building in NYC? It makes no sense. Taking down the two tallest buildings in the world wasn’t enough?

Office fires and jet fuel?  Offices fires? Please stop……. you forgot the physical damage done when a giant airplane slams into the middle of a tall building.  Read the BDN and see what happens when car and trucks slam into homes and stores. 9/11 was alot of things but calling it office fire is truly crazy.

Perhaps he should have driven his dirt bike into the side of it, or wacked it with a baseball bat to recreate the impact of a 747 jet plane.

I know, it makes no sense.  That’s why people are still looking for answers. There’s no way #7 should have come down like that, in freefall, if it had been so damaged by the strikes.  Maybe in chunks.  Not freefall.  And I guess I respect the opinions of NYFD personnel and others very familiar with the Towers who were in the sub-basements that day.  The first blasts, before the plane hit, came from below them, not above.  But the Commission discounted them.  Why would they lie?  America does not believe in transparency, though her government always talks a good game.

I have read many, many first hand accounts from Ground Zero. I don’t recall on that said FDNY personnel were on site prior to the first plane striking the tower. And, there enough people in the towers that any “explosions” heard should have been felt by people within the building on the first several floors.

So if a plane didn’t hit the towers then why the pictures of the unflattened tire and fuselage, where did they come from?  I watched the video and found it worthless. The pile of debris isn’t high because it’s spread out all over the place. Pile up a stack of chips or coins until it falls….. the spread out like the photos of the dust cloud shows. You people are nuts.

Blowing up the 57th tallest building in NYC makes no sense, but the 57th tallest building coming down makes perfect sense because it was right next to two giant buildings that did fall that day and showered #7 with debris and it caught fire.  
What sub basements were the NYFD in? And when where they there?  the towers? #7, you’re not being clear.  As I recall no NYFD were in the towers before the plane hit at 8:47 am.
What does freefall mean to you?

By coinidence, this morning I read an article in Veterans Today (Aug 20 edition) by Richard Roepke.  It’s a story about a maintenance man (North Tower), a long-term employee who was deemed a hero for bringing so many people out of the Tower.  He was the last one out before it fell.  I encourage you to read it.  He is the person I was speaking of who was in the basement and heard what he considers bombs going off below him.
Guiliani moved the NYFD Headquarters to one of the Towers (not sure which one) after the 1993 bombing, which was one of the big problems for their response that day.  There were a LOT of fire officials there working that morning.  Over the years I’ve read many numerous quotes from firemen who believe there were bombs in the buildings.  I find firemen to be very reliable people who don’t make up stories for the fun of it.
By “freefall” I mean “pancake down”.  Which is what all three buildings did. Some experts say jet fuel was not hot enough to bring all three buildings down.  Some experts say it was.  Just like everything in America.  All the ‘experts’ are divided. Who to believe?
There’s also an interesting list in this article in VT.  It’s a list of all the people who have publicly questioned 9/11 events and who are now dead.
The government lies all the friggin’ time.  Why should we believe it about 9/11?  There should be more skeptics, not fewer.

The plane slammed into the building destroying much of the physical structure with force, did your nephew take that into account.
The structure was compromised by the force of entry, not being lit on fire on top of it.

Ah right – “Nuts” is the automatic conclusion then? To address your comments:
How can an inflated tire survive the fireball(s) unburned?
A “pile of coins” is not the same as 2 x 1350 (approx) foot buildings.
I think you need to study the evidence more closely. I have studied your comments and found them “worthless”.
So, why did Hurricane Erin travel in a straight line towards NYC and end up closest to it on 9/11 – then move away on 9/12? You have to state this is a coincidence because you are not willing to explore the evidence. Your resort to insult/ridicule demonstrates you are not ready to look deeper. Your choice – but as the guidelines suggest – you should not insult.
Heck – you can’t even use your real name! (Unlike me). I describe your comments therefore “anonymous irrelevance”.

I have studied the evidence and went to ground zero 10 days after 9/11 and saw a huge plie of rubble. Remember a building is not solid but mostly empty space.  I saw on live TV a plane smash into the second tower and it blowup.  
Your video asks where’s the plane in a picture of the side of the tower. this says to me you think there were no planes but inflated tires.  the tire survived because it was blown free by the explosion.  anyone can pass their finger through a candle flame and not get burned.   The same way that pe3ople in the towers got blown this way and that but still managed to escape unburned. Stuff happens.
Answer this: were there planes that hit the towers and the Pentagon? 
The video is a mish mash of uninteligible drivel.  Car on fire but no paper on fire. what does that mean? Nothing.  Firemen walking in fire?  so what? Lots of unanswered questions about unrelated events. So what.  
I never hear any of the 9/11 truthers theories about what happened?  they just say: we don’t know but just have unanswered questions. All this study and no theories?

Ruby was a JFK admirer, he loved Kennedy and shot Oswald on asplit second impulse. He walked into the Dallas police headquarters 45 minutes AFTER they were SCHEDULED to have removed Oswald, and 3 minutes after leaving a Western Union Office. It was pure chance.  oswald should have been gone and Ruby if he had planned it would not have been dilly dallying at the Western Union sending money to one of his girls.

according to the 9/11 Comission Report, Gulianni in ’96 moved the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management to the 23rd floor of building #7 not in either one of the towers, ….. the report mentions nothing about NYFD in either tower.  The OEM was suppose to coordinate the NYPD and the NYFD and the port authority. 
Also according to the commission report jet fuel traveled down the elevator shaft of the North Tower and blew out on the 77th, 22nd the West lobby and B4 four stories below the street. this would account for the explosions (bombs) and the fires in those locations.

When the WTC was designed and constructed it was designed to withstand a direct hit from a Boeing 707.
The 707′s Maximum Take Off Weight of a 707 in that day was approximately 222,000 lbs and carried 16,060 US gallons of jet fuel.
Compare that to what struck the WTC Tower 1 and 2 on 9/11/2001 which were Boeing’s  767-222 and 767-223ER (Extended Range).
The 767-222′s Maximum Take Off Weight is 315,000 pounds and carries approximately 16,700 US gallons of jet fuel.
The 767-223ER’s Maximum Take of Weight is 395,000 pounds and carries approximately 24,100 US gallons of jet fuel.
Now I know you are going to say look at the amount of fuel the 767 carries and it is not much more that a 707 and you would be correct. But what you need to look at is the weight difference between the 707 and 767 which is a difference ranging between 91,000  pounds (767-222) and 173,000 pounds (767-223ER)  of additional kenetic energy striking each tower.
Then you need to look at the fireproofing  used on the steel members in both towers which was sprayed on and hardened. How much of this fireproofing was dislodged when the planes struck exposing the steel to an uncontrolled fire (sprinkler system standpipes were severed in the attack) feed by Jet Fuel and the fuel load of an office building itself?
If it makes you happy, go ahead and believe in the various conspiracy theories that abound. As for me, I have seen the results of fire on steel first hand and also trust the independent studies that have been conducted.

The 767-222′s Maximum Take Off Weight is 315,000 pounds and carries approximately 16,700 US gallons of jet fuel.
The 767-223ER’s Maximum Take of Weight is 395,000 pounds and carries approximately 24,100 US gallons of jet fuel.
Now I know you are going to say look at the amount of fuel the 767 carries and it is not much more that a 707 and you would be correct. But what you need to look at is the weight difference between the 707 and 767 which is a difference ranging between 91,000  pounds (767-222) and 173,000 pounds (767-223ER)  of additional kenetic energy striking each tower.
Then you need to look at the fireproofing  used on the steel members in both towers which was sprayed on and hardened. How much of this fireproofing was dislodged when the planes struck exposing the steel to an uncontrolled fire (sprinkler system standpipes were severed in the attack) feed by Jet Fuel and the fuel load of an office building itself?
If it makes you happy, go ahead and believe in the various conspiracy theories that abound. As for me, I have seen the results of fire on steel first hand and also trust the independent studies that have been conducted.

When the WTC was designed and constructed it was designed to withstand a direct hit from a Boeing 707.

“Guiliani moved the NYFD Headquarters to one of the Towers (not sure
which one) after the 1993 bombing, which was one of the big problems for
their response that day. ” – FALSE
Fact – The FDNY Headquarters has never been located at any of the WTC buildings. FDNY Headquarters was and is located in Brooklyn.
~~~~~
“There were a LOT of fire officials there working that morning.” – FALSE
Fact – Prior to the first plane striking the WTC Towers there were no FDNY personnel on site.
~~~~~
“By “freefall” I mean “pancake down”.  Which is what all three buildings
did. Some experts say jet fuel was not hot enough to bring all three
buildings down.” – TRUE & FALSE
Fact – Jet Fuel has a Flashpoint of 100.4 °F and an Open Air Burning Temperature of between 500-599 °F. But that is Jet Fuel only and without anything else burning and we both know that was not the case. In each fire you had in addition to the Jet Fuel plastics, wood, paper, composite materials, foam, fabric, glue, insulation, etc…from the WTC towers and paper, composite materials, foam, fabric, glue, insulation, etc…from each of the two 767′s that morning. Each of those items have different flash point temperatures, open air burning temperature and burn at different rates and add to the fuel load (amount of material that is burning) and increases the ambient temperature of the fire.

I have zero concerns about what happened on 9/11.

You comments are so full of untruths that I can’t even begin to address them.  9-11 conspiracy theories ignore basic physics, the criminal’s that perpetrated it, and helps to muddy the waters of the real conspiracy that changed this country.  The coup d’etat that put a murderer in the White House (LBJ) and kept JFK and Khrushchev’s attempt to end the cold war and the nuclear arms race thirty years earlier than it subsequently happened (although the nuclear arms race – and the spread of nuclear arms to irresponsible terrorist nations is still not over).   That conspiracy (JFK’s assassination) kept the American economy on the war makes money policies for the powers-that-be path even up to now, thanks to George W. Bush’s lies and use of the 9-11 tragedy to wage an unjustified war on Iraq while letting Osama bin Laden get away in the caves of Tora Bora.  Yes Bush used 9-11 as an excuse to do his own warmongering/lying thing, but he didn’t need to create that incident.  American’s enemies were only too willing to do that.  And Bush was more than willing to use it for his own goals.  Quit watering down the importance of the real conspiracies – to keep the deep politics powers-that-be in control of America.

Pick the conspiracies you believe in, verycarefully.  Endorsing any and all conspiracies, merely muddies the waters and makes any and everyone doubting the veracity of their government and their lies, all look like loonies.  Not all conspiracies can be true.  Focus on the true ones, as opposed to the ones promoted by government agents, designed to make people believe that nothing can be believed and everything is true (disinformation), so therefore you can do nothing about any of it.  Or worse yet, give up whatever remaining power citizens have to some “saviour” dictator who will solve everything for us such as Bachmann, Palin, etc.  The powers that be are still ridiculing believers in the JFK assassination conspiracy and promoting all kinds of absurd conspiracies so that no one will believe in any conspiracies.   This is called disinformation and it is still being practiced.  Why not?  It sure worked well with “aliens” and area 54 (which is actually a CIA black ops air base).

Exactly.  They just read rumors on the internet made by people who manufactor those rumors out of whole cloth.  Idiots, or worse disinformation agents wanting people to doubt all conspiracies including the JFK assassination.

So rather than show something that proves Treehugger9 wrong you just “blather” on. You sure have convinced me that he is wrong.

and what ever happened to the black boxes from the 2 planes. you always hear about the recovery of the black boxes in every plane crash.  anyone recall any U.S. media outlets ever publishing the recovery or contents of these black boxes???

I was 17 in ’63, saw Ruby shoot Oswald live on TV, have read all the conspiracy books on the JFK assassination and been to Dallas and the 6th floor museum in the old book depository twice. I’ll debate you anytime. Oswald did it, and acted alone.

To the best of my knowledge the black boxes were never found. But lack of Black Boxes does not equate to conspiracy.
