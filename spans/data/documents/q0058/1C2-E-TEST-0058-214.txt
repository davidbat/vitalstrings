I LOVE THE INTERNET.
I wish it was true - in any case the guy who made that post WINS THE INTERNET for today. Honestly. This is just so good.

Those "facts" about the JFK assassination are not even true.

JFK did not stay at a hotel in Dallas that morning.

I think I prefer the christian version of the song.

Perfectly consistent with the level of reliability we've come to expect from this blog. Samuel Kickin? Really? That doesn't even rhyme with "William Greer".

I do like the scathing rebuke of Andy Towle for accuracy in a COMEDY ITEM, hilarious.

Samuel Kickin? Who the hell is that?! William Greer was the driver of the Presidential Limousine when President Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza. And President Kennedy was not checked-in at any hotel on November 22, 1963. Air Force One landed at Love Field, Dallas at exactly 11:40 am, and was in Dealey Plaza at 12:30nn when the President was shot.
