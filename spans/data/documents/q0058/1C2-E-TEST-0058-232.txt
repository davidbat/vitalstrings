Given that Arlen Specter has decided to leave the Republican Party, I think it’s worth examining Specter’s history to see if he will be an asset or a burden for the Democratic Party.
While Specter is perhaps most famous for coming up with the “single bullet theory” which purports that one bullet entered and exited two people (President Kennedy and Governor Connally) seven times, only to emerge nearly intact, his legislative efforts of late also give cause for concern.
I had a personal experience with Specter, in a way. When the Internet was first opened to the public, I found, by pure chance, a newsgroup discussing the Kennedy assassination. I jumped in with no data whatsoever to voice my completely uninformed opinions, and was roundly criticized.
Properly chastised, I decided I should actually learn some facts before I could contribute in any meaningful way. I went to a local library and found a full set of the Warren Commission volumes.
