JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theories, Death of one of President John F. Kennedy”s mistresses Mary Pinchot Meyer has mystified conspiracy theorists for years.
However, a new book has claimed that the beautiful divorcee, who was close friends with the Kennedys and is widely known for having a lengthy affair with the p*****y President, was shot in a cover-up operation by the CIA.
According to the book, socialite Mary, in her preoccupation with her lover’s assassination and consequent personal investigation, may have gotten so close to the ‘truth’ that the CIA found her to be a threat.
Consequently, agency operatives staged a shooting to make it look like she died due to a S-EX-ual assault that turned violent, alleges the book by Peter Janney, called Mary”s Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision of World Peace.
Irrespective of whether the theory is true or not, there are a number of questionable components to the story of the months leading up to her death on October 12, 1964.
Her ex-husband, Cord Meyer, was a CIA agent himself and the couple were card-carrying members of Georgetown’s starry social set, which included then-Senator John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, the Daily Mail reported.
The couples became close friends, along with Mary”s sister Antoinette (who went by Tony) and her husband Ben Bradlee.
Another couple that they spent time with was Mary’s Vassar classmate Cicely d”Autremont and her husband James Angleton, who was the chief of the counter surveillance for the CIA.
The author has even claimed that the socialite would frequently bring marijuana and LSD to her trysts with the President.
