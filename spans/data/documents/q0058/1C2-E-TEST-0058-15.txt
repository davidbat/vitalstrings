JFK Assassination Web Sites
A Conspiracy?
Just as conspiracy books have been more popular than books supporting the Warren Commission conclusions, there are more conspiracy-oriented web sites than lone-nut oriented web sites.   While many web sites have some Kennedy assassination material, the following specialize in the subject.  This is a somewhat selective list of sites, emphasizing those with the strongest collections of resources.
The Texas Monthly's Dealey Plaza Revisited is a fine balanced introduction to the issues surrounding the assassination from a journal that has become a mainstay of Texas journalism.
The Houston Chronicle likewise has a feature story about the assassination on its web site.  It's well-done visually, but be warned that it contains some significant factual inaccuracies.
The Mary Ferrell Foundation is named in honor of highly respected long-time Dallas area researcher Mary Ferrell, and contains a broad range of resources including essays (mostly conspiracy oriented), photos and (most important) a massive collection of primary source documents.
The National Archives' Kennedy Assassination Records Collection has a search engine that allows locating documents in the Archives' massive holdings.  This makes it easy to order relevant documents from the Archives.  And indeed, simply knowing what documents the government has can be important information.   Give the Feds some credit:  this is a fine resource.
The JFK Lancer site  is a fine source for ordering various materials  on the assassination, and it contains selected articles from The  Assassination Chronicles, as well as a good selection of links to other JFK-oriented sites.
JFK Online has several interesting essays (on Ruby, Silvia Odio, Jean Hill), a good links page, good brief reviews of all the major assassination books, and an excellent collection of unedited statements from assassination witnesses.  It's signal strong point, however, is a very large collection of resources on Jim Garrison and Garrison's New Orleans "investigation" into the murder.
Mike Russ' John F. Kennedy Assassination Information Center is strong on witness testimony, and has the invaluable technical reports of the House Select Committee on Assassinations which address issues such as the nature of Kennedy's wounds and the authenticity of the Backyard Photos.
Max Holland's Washington DeCoded shows the work of a journalist intimately familiar with the history of the 60s and of the ways Washington politics impinged upon and affected how the assassination was viewed and how it was dealt with.
Ralph Schuster's John F. Kennedy Assassination Homepage , from Germany, is further evidence of world-wide interest in the assassination.  Schuster has has a rich variety of offerings, including the Warren Commission Report, Jim Marrs' "Convenient Deaths" list, Walt Brown's index to assassination books, and extensive witness testimonies.
The Real Issues Home Page , shows Mike Griffith, the page's author,  to be a diligent reader of conspiracy books and a prolific writer.   You can find about any aspect of the case interpreted from a conspiracy perspective here.
John Simkin's Spartacus Educational site has in common with Mike Griffith's site (above) a dilligent webmaster who has put a lot of information (and, unfortunately, pseudoinformation) online.  But where Griffith's site is deep, going into issues in great detail, Simkin's site is broad, providing some information on a vast number of suspects, witnesses, and even researchers.
The Academic JFK Assassination Site reflects a course on the JFK assassination taught by Kenneth A. Rahn at the University of Rhode Island. His web site is not just his syllabus, but rather a wide-ranging collection of materials.  Especially interesting are sections on critical thinking, information on Warren Commission critics and collections of materials from researchers such as Tony Marsh and Peter Whitmey.
Lisa Pease' Real History Archives gives you a dose of the really extreme conspiracy view.  Pease believes that a very large conspiracy murdered Kennedy, and continues to cover up the crime.  She includes the mainstream media, much of academia, many  conspiracy authors, all authors who believe Oswald did it alone, and virtually all the posters on USENET newsgroups who don't believe in a conspiracy in her cast of sinister people.  For a scary reminder of where this sort of thinking leads, click here for Lisa Pease' page on the Oklahoma City bombing .  Now removed from her site, she displayed it for over two years.
A site featuring Probe Magazine is a project of Citizens for Truth in the Kennedy Assassination.  The magazine has ceased publication, but the site remains up with a collection of essays that purport to explain "why the country is in the shape that it's in."   The answer, which is not surprising since Lisa Pease (see above) was a staffer with Probe, is that a wide-ranging conspiracy is running things.
David Von Pein has been all over the Internet of late, capably arguing for the lone assassin viewpoint.  His blog, The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: A Lone-Gunman Viewpoint has a lot of resources, including especially video resources.
The Assassination Web is a source for COPA information, COPA videos, and the world's most extensive collection of essays purporting to debunk Gerald Posner's book Case Closed.
Probable Cause Australia is yet another site that shows how multinational is interest in the assassination.  Look for their photos, and reviews of various books about the assassination.
Deanie Richards' JFK Place , a site on the Akron Regional Freenet,  has a large collection of important files on the case.  Both conspiracy and lone assassin material is included.   Not maintained in recent years, it continues to make available useful information.
The DiNardo web site has a lot of text files from the "People's Spellbreaker" radio show.  Most of the conspiracy authors that you can think of have been guests, and the transcripts are here.
Dale Myers' JFK Files web site shows Myers' computer modelling of the shooting in Dealey Plaza, as well as material about the Tippit shooting.
W. Tracy Parnell is a lone assassin theorist whose Lee Harvey Oswald Research Page has several valuable resources.  Parnell is the chief Internet debunker of "two Oswalds" theories.
David Perry, a crackerjack researcher who has debunked many of the stories conspiracy books repeat (although he in fact believes there was a conspiracy), has the John F. Kennedy Assassination Pages where you can learn about him and read several of his articles.
Clintbradford.com has a fine collection of files covering many aspects of the assassination.  The site grew out of Clint Bradford's ATD BBS (now defunct), and is resource-rich.
John Masland's The Nook is a site of interest to people who want to do some real digging,   featuring large databases of Warren Commission Documents,  Warren Commission Witnesses, selected portions of the Warren Report, and a collection of video sound bites.    Not especially recommended for the casual web "surfer," this site will be a huge boon to the serious researcher.
JFK-Dallas, November 22, 1963 is the web site of the Dallas Morning News, and it makes good use of the resources of that newspaper, including photos, video, news stories, and historic front pages.  You'll need to complete a free registration to access the resources.
Tony Marsh's website, The Puzzle Palace , has one thing going for it: Marsh himself, a quirky,  independent-minded and innovative researcher capable of occasional near-brilliant work.
Fair Play was formerly an online magazine put together by John Kelin.   Seldom updated now, the site's archives nonetheless has a wide variety of materials of interest.  Although it often seemed to support some of the most unreliable witnesses (Roger Craig, Perry Raymond Russo), it has also debunked conspiracy fables.   An important feature is Joe Backes' detailed accounts of document releases from the Assassination Records Review Board.  The pioneering JFK assassination page.
Visit my own Best of Assassination Sites page for a list of the offerings  chosen from the sites listed here  that I consider to be outstanding.  This page is not exactly a listing of the best sites, but rather of the best resources.
The following sites lack the depth of resources of the sites listed above, but all have something that the average assassination buff would  want to see:
Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed and the man the conspiracy buffs love to hate, has a home page .  It has  along with materials of the Kennedy assassination  information on Posner's other interests and books.
The Kennedy Detail is a site devoted to the Secret Service agents who protected the president.  Not pushing a conspiracy theory (nor any other theory) it holds considerable interest for assassination buffs.
Julie Jackson is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Franzen, Dealey Plaza witnesses who were on the south side of Elm Street a few yards from the presidential limo when Kennedy's head exploded. Her web site features her father's testimony  an invaluable historical document.
Denis Morissette's web page avoids interpretation and is strong on sources  his own interviews with witnesses, government documents, and early news accounts. It's fascinating and informative.
Here is a site featuring presidential limousines , and selling a video about them.  You might want to buy the video, and you very likely will enjoy the high-quality photos of various presidential vehicles  including the one in which Kennedy was riding when he was shot.
The Cuban Information Archives is a project of researcher Gordon Winslow.  Winslow's work is very specialized: he only studies the Cubans  mostly anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Florida.  And his research is highly reliable.
JFK Resources Online , run by Cheryl Overfield, is more a general "John Kennedy" page than an assassination page.  Very attractive, it certainly merits a visit from assassination buffs, however.
The Men on the Sixth Floor is a web site devoted to promoting a book of the same name, and the conspiracy theory contained in that book.  It's run by Glen Sample and Mark Collom.
Assassination buffs debate endlessly the quality of Oswald's rifle, the ability of a shooter to equal Oswald's "shooting feat" and so on.  So "A Carcano Homepage" is a fine resource.  It separates myth from fact in discussion of the rifle that Oswald bought from Klein's Sporting Goods  and even gives advice on how you might buy one like it!
The Smoking Gun is a large, fascinating site with a corner dedicated to JFK assassination documents.
The Dallas Historical Society may or may not, at any given time, have something about the assassination on its page.  But then, to be interested in the assassination is necessarily to be interested in Dallas.
Who Really Killed President Kennedy? is a site from a radio talk show guy named Art Kevin who was one of a large corps of reporters covering the Clay Shaw trial.  The site has some very interesting video and sound clips.
JFK Assassination Presidential Limousine SS100X is exactly what the name implies: a site dedicated to the car in which Kennedy was riding when he was shot.
Richard Vizzutti's Kennedy and Beyond has a series of photos of the Three Tramps, along with some "identifications" of the men.  Interesting, if not convincing.
The JFK Assassination Conspiracy Soundboard has some interesting audio clips of the media coverage of the assassination.
The Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas has a web page.  It has museum hours, admission, and order blanks for some of the Museum's educational materials.  A recently-added feature is oral-history interviews.
Larry Charbonneau's JFK Page has some good graphic images, and a variety of other interesting files.

Is the Kennedy assassination a "cultist" topic?  Do the people with an intense interest in the assassination display the same intellectual habits as those interested in other "crackpot" phenomena?
You might examine, for example, The Bermuda Triangle Web Page. Does the logic and use of evidence in the Bermuda Triangle literature remind you of the conspiracy literature?
Likewise, the UFO Skeptics Toolkit raises the same question in the context of supposed aliens from elsewhere in the Universe.  Does the rhetoric about a government "coverup" sound familiar?
The notion that NASA faked the landing of astronauts on the moon has had a bit of a revival lately.  But the arguments are as silly as ever.  Philip Plait's Bad Astronomy web site brings a dose of level-headed scientific thinking to this theory.
The events of 9/11 have of course created a whole raft of conspiracy theories.  One of them is from Jim Fetzer, a man well known for his Kennedy assassination books.  Fetzer's page 9/11 Web Sites supports his view that no Boeing 757 hit the Pentagon, but rather a cruise missile did.  Ironically, conspiracist Mike Griffith (see above) takes issue with claims like this, and provides a fine set of links titled "Refuting the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories."
Is Christianity just a big conspiracy?  That's the theme of Dan Brown’s popular novel The Da Vinci Code.  But as history the book is wild and wacky, on a par with the most bizarre conspiracy theories.  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has a web site debunking The Da Vinci Code. And don't say:  "well of course they would do that."  Say of Dan Brown:   "well of course an author hostile toward religion and wanting to make a killing would write such a book."
