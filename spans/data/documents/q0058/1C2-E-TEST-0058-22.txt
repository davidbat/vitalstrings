Cracked on the JFK Conspiracy
JFK conspiracies come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from LBJ did it, to aliens, to he faked it and is living in Mexico, to JFK didn't really exist.
There's even one that a single gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated JFK with only 3 shots, and that Oswald was a disturbed man, whose radical political views and depression led him to shoot the President, but that is absurd, and we will no longer discuss it.
