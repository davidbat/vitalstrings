Abraham           Lincoln/Rothschild
The oil painting of           Lincoln is by artist and sculptor Richard           R. Miller.
  Even thought he acted the tyrant in keeping Maryland from seceding and raised       the Army of the Potomac to "put down the rebellion", there is       evidence that he had a change of heart. Accordingly to many, Lincoln was       converted to Christ after viewing the battlefield at Gettysburg. He later       joined the Presbyterian Church in Washington and had several spiritual       conversations with his close friend and converted priest, Charles Chiniquy.       We read: "I will repeat to you what I said at Urbana, when for the       first time you told me your fears lest I would be assassinated by the       Jesuits: Man must not care where and when he will die, provided he dies at       the post of honor and duty. But I may add, today, that I have a       presentiment that God will call me to Him through the hand of an assassin.       Let His will, and not mine, be done! The Pope and the Jesuits, with their       infernal Inquisition, are the only organized powers in the world which       have recourse to the dagger of the assassin to murder those whom they       cannot convince with their arguments or conquer with the sword.
  "In       the late spring of       the year of 1808 Nancy Hanks, who was of the family lineage of McAdden was       visiting some of her family in the community of Lincolnton, North       Carolina. During her stay in the Carolina's, she visited many neighboring       families she had known for many years; one such was the Springs family.       The sordid details had been omitted but obviously the young Nancy Hanks       had found herself in a compromised position and was forced to succumb to       the lust of A.A. Springs. She became pregnant as a result. There were no       details of a love affair or an act of violence on a helpless female.       Abraham Lincoln was the result of that act, which leads one to wonder if       the name Lincoln was real or fabricated from the area of conception which       was Lincolnton. Was there really a Thomas Lincoln? Since the Springs were       of the race that called themselves "Jewish", Lincoln was part       Jewish and as part of the Springs family, he also became a relative of the       Rothschild family by blood."

  This       is the man I will       present in King Lincoln – not the incarnation of the American Idea, but       an oddly concrete human being who, for some reason, never allowed his       children to meet their grandfather. The Mythic Lincoln is open and       universal, with nothing to hide: the real Lincoln was "secretive," "reticent," "shut-mouthed." The       Mythic Lincoln quoted Scripture and talked like the King James Bible: the       real Lincoln could never bring himself to believe. The Mythic Lincoln       detested cruelty and violence: the real Lincoln accepted 620,000 deaths,       to "save" an ill-defined "Union." The       Imaginary Abe
