Time to Avoid 2013 Capital Gains Hike Is Now
Ask anyone if they believe Vice President Lyndon Johnson was one of the conspirators behind the killing of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, and see what happens.
Perhaps they’ll roll their eyes at just another conspiracy theory. Or maybe sneer at you for even considering such far-fetched malarkey, and call you just as nutty as that “lone nut” assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.
But then someone might surprise you and say: Anything’s possible.
Nearly 50 years since Dallas brought death to JFK, does it even matter if we ever really know what happened that day?
I say it does. But more important than setting history straight – whatever it might be – I believe we are all better off in the end when we occasionally wrap our heads around the seemingly improbable.
As a journalist, I’m supposed to deal with verifiable facts. But just because someone “verifies” a fact, that doesn’t make it so. Other people tell their versions of “facts,” and still others say just how wrong those “facts” are, and so on.
The point is: There’s always more to the story, and everybody has a stake in their version of the truth. And sadly, many people will only believe what they want to believe.
Ever since as a child I watched the sinister Cigarette-Smoking Man lurk in the shadows behind every fictional government UFO cover-up in “The X-Files” sci-fi TV show, I’ve always become wide-eyed at the opportunity to dig deeper for the truth.
I am thrilled whenever I learn that everything I thought I knew gets turned upside down, even if it means questioning those things I’ve been taught growing up. After all, life isn’t about being told what to believe – it’s about discovering for yourself what you do or don’t believe.
It is why I – and apparently many others – can watch shows such as “Ancient Aliens” on the History Channel for hours just to bask in knowing how much we really don’t know about our history, let alone our existence.
Recently, I finished a 600-plus page book -- LBJ: The Mastermind of the JFK Assassination, by Phillip Nelson -- that breathlessly tries to convince its readers that LBJ was a mentally unstable man who had a hand in Kennedy’s murder as the only Machiavellian means to reach the ultimate pedestal of power.
I have no clue who killed Kennedy, but it’s one of life’s mysteries that I can’t get enough of.

What I do know is that there are plenty of bizarre happenings revolving around the president’s death, like the allegation that Johnson appeared to crouch toward the floor in his motorcade limousine moments before the deadly shots rang out.
And for a larger-than-life man who spent three years moping around in JFK’s shadow, LBJ sure seemed all-too-ready to fill Kennedy’s shoes – just as a Congressional investigation was starting to scratch the surface of Johnson’s links to other possible wrongdoings.
I’m always up for defending my right to keep an open mind, especially with my colleague O-D sports reporter John Pitarresi. What begins as a whispering debate over the cherry-picking of such speculation soon boils over into Pitarresi’s growling disgust that I would ever consider such cockamamie nonsense.
And to really get the fireworks flying, just raise the possibility that space aliens built the Egyptian pyramids.
Sure, some people do take conspiracy theories too far. But still I appreciate the risk of thinking everyone will always tell the whole story, as well as the arrogance of believing that I know everything I need to know about something.
It’s been a long time since I’ve heard anyone say that famous line from “The X-Files” — “The truth is out there.” It may be a bit hokey, but I believe the world is a much more exciting place when we never stop searching for the rest of the story.
