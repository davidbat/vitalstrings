Assassination                   Records Review Board Archives
Why           It Matters
We           believe these basic facts in the assassination of President Kennedy           and the wounding of Governor John Connally:
there                   was more than one shooter
there                   has not been a trueor complete investigation of this crime                   by our government
the                   intelligence agencies did not give those investigatory bodies                   the information they should have
the                 assassination case is still open and therefore, research should                 be ongoing.
