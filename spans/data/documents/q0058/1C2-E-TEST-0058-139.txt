After studying this for about 20 years I have found that there is evidence that the Mafia actually had him killed&gt; But why? Well, it is historical fact that the Mafia helped get Kennedy elected by turning out the vote in Chicago. Sam Giancanna was romantically involved with Marilyn Monroe atr the same time as the Kennedy boys (intersting tidbit). In any event, when JFK appointed Bobby as SG and he in turn declared war on the mob, well it was war that he got. I came across a website a few years back that had a mob figure admitting to his involvement and naming names. He even showed a weapon similar to the one that killed Kennedy. Does this make it true? Not in and of itself. But there is no doubt that Kennedy had stirred up a lot of beehives, including the mobs (remeber how the Joe Kennedy made his dime? Bootlegging). A lot of people heard gunshots from the grassy knoll and recent audio evidence supports it. I was in military intelligence (Army) for four years and I can attest to the ability of the Government to keep a secret- the key is to compartmentalize information so few people know how all the pieces fit together. In summary, a patsy was indeed chosen and utilized to carry out this assasination of a U.S. President and nobody was the wiser. As a group of people, we can be extremely stupid and naive.
