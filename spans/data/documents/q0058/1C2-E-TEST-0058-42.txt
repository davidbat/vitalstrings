Abraham       Lincoln/Rothschild
The oil painting of Lincoln       is by artist and sculptor Richard       R. Miller.
"Did         you know that Cherie Booth, England's Prime Minister, Tony Blair's wife is the         great-great-great granddaughter of John Wilkes Booth, the man who allegedly         assassinated Abraham Lincoln?
  Even thought he         acted the tyrant in keeping Maryland from seceding and raised the Army         of the Potomac to "put down the rebellion", there is evidence         that he had a change of heart. Accordingly to many, Lincoln was         converted to Christ after viewing the battlefield at Gettysburg. He         later joined the Presbyterian Church in Washington and had several         spiritual conversations with his close friend and converted priest,         Charles Chiniquy. We read: "I will repeat to you what I said at         Urbana, when for the first time you told me your fears lest I would be         assassinated by the Jesuits: Man must not care where and when he will         die, provided he dies at the post of honor and duty. But I may add,         today, that I have a presentiment that God will call me to Him through         the hand of an assassin. Let His will, and not mine, be done! The Pope         and the Jesuits, with their infernal Inquisition, are the only organized         powers in the world which have recourse to the dagger of the assassin to         murder those whom they cannot convince with their arguments or conquer         with the sword.
  "In         the late spring         of the year of 1808 Nancy Hanks, who was of the family lineage of         McAdden was visiting some of her family in the community of Lincolnton,         North Carolina. During her stay in the Carolina's, she visited many         neighboring families she had known for many years; one such was the         Springs family. The sordid details had been omitted but obviously the         young Nancy Hanks had found herself in a compromised position and was         forced to succumb to the lust of A.A. Springs. She became pregnant as a         result. There were no details of a love affair or an act of violence on         a helpless female. Abraham Lincoln was the result of that act, which         leads one to wonder if the name Lincoln was real or fabricated from the         area of conception which was Lincolnton. Was there really a Thomas         Lincoln? Since the Springs were of the race that called themselves "Jewish", Lincoln was part Jewish and as part of the Springs         family, he also became a relative of the Rothschild family by         blood."

  This is the man I         will present in King Lincoln – not the incarnation of the American         Idea, but an oddly concrete human being who, for some reason, never         allowed his children to meet their grandfather. The Mythic Lincoln is         open and universal, with nothing to hide: the real Lincoln was "secretive," "reticent," "shut-mouthed." The Mythic Lincoln quoted Scripture and talked like the King James         Bible: the real Lincoln could never bring himself to believe. The Mythic         Lincoln detested cruelty and violence: the real Lincoln accepted 620,000         deaths, to "save" an ill-defined "Union." The         Imaginary Abe
