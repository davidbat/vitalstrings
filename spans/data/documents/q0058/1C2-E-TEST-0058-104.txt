Conspiracy in New Orleans?
I got bitten by the conspiracy bug when I saw Oliver Stone's JFK in 1991. The problem is that, even by Hollywood standards, Stone's film takes liberties with the facts. Oliver Stone's Jim Garrison (portrayed by Kevin Costner) is a seeker of truth and justice arrayed against forces he can barely comprehend. How accurate is that image? You be the judge.
