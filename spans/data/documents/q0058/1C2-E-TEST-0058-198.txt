The JFK Speech That Made Rick Santorum Want to “Throw Up” (Video)

I’m really wondering if the goal now of the Republican Party is to get Barack Obama re-elected. Scott Collins reports in the LA Times :
Rick Santorum has not been a frequent presence on the Sunday morning  chat shows during his Republican presidential campaign. But when he  shows up, he really makes an impression.
On Sunday, the former Pennsylvania senator told ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that a 1960 speech by John  F. Kennedy to Baptist ministers in Houston made him want to “throw up.” In the speech, Kennedy, then running for president, tried to reassure critics that, as a Catholic, he would not take orders from the pope and  that he believed in “absolute” separation of church and state.
