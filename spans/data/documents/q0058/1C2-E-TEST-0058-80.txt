Nixon also might have feared that if JFK were reelected in 1964, that Bobby Kennedy would be in prime position to win in 1968 and again in 1972, thus ruining his chances to be president.
- Officer J.D. Tippet was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald in Ocliff, a suburb of Dallas, approximately 2 hours after the president was shot.
- The Warren report written for the J.F.K. assassination, one of the most important cases in the history of the United States, was sloppily written and all of its contents contradicted what the eye witnesses of the murder said happened. However, Earl Warren did justify that it was impossible for Oswald to make the shooting job that he did with 3 bullets, so he introduced the magic bullet theory. This theory states that Oswalds shot moved in several different directions, first it hit Kennedy in the temple, then moved its way into the back of the neck, meanwhile it exited J.F.K. and entered the front seat of the car, and hit Governor Connelly in the rib area, then moved to his wrist, and finally planted itself in the thigh.
All this being said, I think it's clear Johnson was a driving force behind the cover-up that followed the assassination. Some of Johnson's actions in the hours and days following the shooting give me pause and have caused many researchers to suspect Johnson of wrongdoing to varying degrees.
- Gay prisoner, Willie O'Keaf, told district attorney Jim Garrison that he had visited David Ferrie and met up with many of his friends at a homosexual masquerade ball. He was part of a conversation involving Ferrie, Oswald, Clay Shaw, and a bunch of Cubans in which they talked about how they were going to murder Kennedy. Weirdly, O'Keaf was introduced to Oswald, but instead of calling him Lee Harvey, he was using the alias Leon. Oswald.
