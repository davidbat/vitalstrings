Shocking New Theory Surrounding JFK Conspiracy
Dallas, TX  |  Overwhelming evidence of a highly coordinated conspiracy regarding President John F. Kennedy has sparked controversy on the 40th anniversary of his assassination.
"I was pretty shocked," says Texas School Book Depository Sixth Floor Museum tour guide Noel DiGrassi. "It's so obvious, and it's been right in front of our faces all along."
DiGrassi spent just one afternoon in the Dallas Public Library earlier this month and discovered that the conspirators were so smugly confident, they left a long and condemning paper trail.
Implicated are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of authors, book and magazine publishers, screenwriters, directors, filmmakers, theaters, television network executives, souvenir traffickers, lecturers, pollsters, and websites.
And their despicable schemes have all had the same goal: to squeeze every dime possible out of people obsessed with Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.
But how many individuals were actually involved in the plot to kill Kennedy that tragic day in Dallas forty years ago?
"Oh, that's obvious too," DiGrassi says. "It was just Oswald. We all know that."
