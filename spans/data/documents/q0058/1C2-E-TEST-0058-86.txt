Who Killed Kennedy And Why? - Coverups.com
Public interest in the assassination of President          John F. Kennedy has never died down. People around the world want          to know who killed the president and why and how he died. They also          want to know what the killer's hidden motives might have been, and          whether he had acted alone. Their insistent questions led to the          formation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a congressional          group.
In 1978, the House Select Committee came to a conclusion          that many un-official investigators had already reached: that the          president's slaying was the result of a conspiracy. As we have already          seen, a conspiracy means that two or more persons were involved          in a criminal act.
Until that time, the Warren Commissioned Report,          originally released in September 1964, was the only official one.          The report stated that a solitary gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald          was responsible. Working alone, he shot and killed the president.          Oswald was soon captured and held by the Dallas, Texas, police for          two days. Then Oswald himself was slain as he was being transferred          from one jail to another. Oswald's slayer was Jack Ruby.
The Warren Commission decided that Ruby acted for          twisted emotional reasons and that he, too, acted alone. There was          no conspiracy involved in either case. So said the Warren Commission.
The House Select Committee's declaration of conspiracy          inspired a rash of books and at least two movies, as well as several          TV programs. New ones keep popping up, well into the 1990's. Each          book and movie has asserted that its analysis is the only foolproof          one. As yet, however, none of these has been accepted as offering          all the right answers.
Let's look at some of these accumulated ideas and          theories, and perhaps come to some conclusions of our own. Bear          in mind that some of these assertions and accusations sound highly          believable. But remember, too, that no charges have been filed against          anyone, and no arrests have been made. Will there be any in the          future, you ask? Perhaps so; perhaps not.
The JFK assassination data can be divided into        three groups:
 
1. The Method, or Means: How was the president            killed?
2. The Motives: Why was he killed?
3. The Men Involved: Who killed him?
1. THE METHOD OR MEANS:
 
The president was riding in his open limousine,          his back to the Texas School Book Depository, where, on the sixth          floor, Oswald was said to have been perched. His rifle, propped          up by book cartons, was aimed directly at the back of the president's          head.
Ahead and to the right of the president's motorcade          was the grassy knoll. There many spectators stood, ready to cheer          the president as he passed by. Among them, another gunman may have          been waiting for HIS chance to fire.
Oswald was accused of firing several shots from          his position in the Texas School Book Depository. Two of these struck          the president in the back of the head. But a third shot is said          to have entered the president's throat, just above his Adam's apple,          and emerged through the back of his neck.
Did this third shot actually go from the front          of his neck to the back? Doctor's at Parkland Hospital in Dallas,          where the dying president was taken, and doctors at the Bethesda          Naval Hospital, where the dead president was AGAIN examined, disagree.          The Parkland groups say there was an entry wound in his throat.          The Bethesda group, on the other hand, says there was an EXIT wound          in his throat.
Many spectators standing on the grassy knoll at          the time of the slaying reported hearing at least one rifle shot          fired from nearby. They also reported seeing as many as four men          hurrying away from the back of the knoll as soon as the shots were          fired. The Warren investigators quizzed several of these witnesses          but came to no conclusion.
Oswald may have indeed fired the shots that killed          the president, but there is no clear-cut evidence that he ALONE          did so. Nor was he even definitely linked with the sixth-floor window          from where the shots were fired. Only minutes after the shooting,          he was drinking a Coca-Cola. Could he have left the firing site          and composed himself so quickly? Here's another factor to consider:          firing a cheap rifle, as Oswald did, should have left a powder burn          on his cheek. After Oswald was arrested, his cheek was examined:          no such powder burn was found!
After Oswald's death, his palm print was found          on his rifle butt, indicating that it was he who did the shooting.          Some investigators charge, however, that a palm print could have          been transferred from his hand to the rifle butt after Oswald's.          This could have been one of many illegal efforts to tie Oswald to          the crime.
2. THE MOTIVES:
 
Why was President Kennedy assassinated? Many reasonable          speculations have been offered. None, however, has been positively          proven.
One set of theories says that it was the president's          plans for Vietnam that prompted his murder. By 1963 (the assassination          year), the United States was becoming more and more involved in          the Vietnam war. The U.S. had already sent supplies, arms, and several          thousand "advisers" and "instructors."
But the president wanted to go no further in aiding          South Vietnam. He was ready to stop sending aid, even though South          Vietnam claimed to have a democratic government and an army eager          to wage war against North Vietnam. The president said that Vietnam          was too far away from the United States, that South Vietnam's claim          to democracy was false, and that the U.S. had no business sending          American troops to fight in what was really a local war.
So, the theory goes, the president was killed by          those who wanted the United States to become actively involved in          the Vietnam war. Another theory holds that Kennedy was killed because          he failed to help the Cuban exiles in their 1961 attempt to invade          Cuba and overthrow the Communist government of Fidel Castro. And          still another theory claims that, because he did not destroy Cuba          in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, he angered anti-Castro factions          and so was slain.
Another theory involves the president's relationship          with his brother when Robert Kennedy was attorney general. Robert          was a relentless foe of organized crime. The only way to stop the          attorney general was to kill the president. That's what some investigators          think. They accuse the Mafia Leaders and Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamster          Union chief. Mind you, we are talking theory. No real proof exists.
3. THE MEN INVOLVED:
 
The movie "JFK" was first shown in December,          1991, and will probably continue to be shown in theaters, on TV,          and on videocassettes for years to come. "JFK" 's screen          credits acknowledge the help of two books: Jim Garrison's "On          the Trail of the Assassins" and Jim Marr's "Crossfire:          The Plot That Killed Kennedy."
The Garrison book is the partial autobiography          of this former New Orleans district attorney. It is mainly about          his struggle to convict a man named Clay Shaw for involvement in          the Kennedy slaying. The book also tells of Shaw's friendship with          Oswald during the summer of '63 in New Orleans, AKA the Big Easy.          Garrison argues that Shaw's connection with Oswald makes him part          of the Kennedy slaying. Garrison's book ends with the not-guilty          verdict that freed Clay Shaw. "On the Trail of the Assassins" is a true-to-life story, perhaps over-dramatized a bit when Garrison          puts made-up words in his character's mouths. Marr's book is factual,          without a story line as in the Garrison book. It gathers up the          accounts of many investigators, but comes to no final conclusions.
The movie "JFK" is something else again.          It follows the story line of the Garrison book---up to a point,          that is. The stunning conclusion abandons the cautious approach          of the Garrison and Marrs books. Instead, it puts a direct, sweeping          accusation in the mouth of a fictitious character known only as "X."
X proclaims that the conspiracy to kill JFK extends          right up the highest levels of the U.S. government---to the Pentagon,          to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the FBI and the CIA, and to the          White House itself.
The movie's director, producer, and writer are          all one man: Oliver Stone. He is responsible for all these statements,          and more. He goes on to tie in the military with American industry          in a military/industrial alliance.
It should be noted that Stone does not name names,          He only says that certain high-ranking men in these organizations          were responsible for the death of the president. They wanted JFK          killed because he was a threat to their plans.
Stone further claims that American Industry wanted          the Vietnam war to continue for reasons of greed: the more war,          the higher industrial profits.
X's charge of conspiracy reaches up into the White          House. Although X does not directly accuse by name the president          who followed JFK into office, there can be no doubt that he meant          President Lyndon B. Johnson, in office from 1963 to 1969. Johnson          was Kennedy's vice president. Before that, he was the U.S. Senate's          Majority Leader. He ran the Senate with an iron hand.
Kennedy had chosen Johnson as his running mate          because Johnson could produce a winning number of votes. Johnson          expected to take an active role in the Kennedy government. After          entering office in 1961, however, he was largely ignored. His duties          were mostly confined to cutting the ribbon when a new bridge or          park was dedicated.
And Johnson was losing many of his once-loyal Texas          followers. He sat silent, biding his time. That time came, his accusers          say, when the president rode in the open limousine down a Dallas          street, Johnson, his enemies claim, engineered the whole assassination          program.
These are extremely serious charges, but they cannot          be proven. Investigators have not been able to definitively link          LBJ to the killing of JFK. There is no question that Johnson was          an ambitious, powerful politician. Author Craig Zirbel, in his book "The Texas Connection," attempts to prove Johnson's guilt          by eliminating all other suspects. Eventually, only Johnson is left.          Therefore, he must be guilty, according to Zirbel.
As for Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer, new facts have          come to life. Over the years it has been shown that he was a close          associate of many criminals. They would have liked to see the president          and his brother killed so that their illegal and unlawful activities          could expand. But Ruby died, as we know, before he could tell his          story.
