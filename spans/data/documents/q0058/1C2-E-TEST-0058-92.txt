JFK,           9/11 and Conspiracy Theories
by           Maureen Farrell
"There             have been many things swept under the carpet. And I think it's a             shame in a government that you trust - I think it's a shame,             the things that they chose to tell you and the things they choose             not to tell you." -- Sept. 11 widow Julia Sweeney, whose husband Brian           worked in the World Trade Center
"One                 of my greatest shames, as a journalist is that I still don't                 know who killed Jack Kennedy." -- Hunter S. Thompson
Last             January, Mike Ward compared the post-9/11 conspiracy frenzy to what             occurred in the aftermath of JFK’s murder. "Angry speculation           -- focused mainly on government dirty dealings, ulterior motives, and           potential complicity in the attacks -- has risen to a clamor that easily           rivals what followed the Kennedy assassination," he wrote.

Inconsistencies             in the official story always take their toll, particularly when there's             a whiff of a cover-up. And certainly, news that the White           House will edit sensitive documents before handing them over to the           independent commission investigating Sept. 11 makes matters murkier. "The           White House gets to cherry-pick how much access the nation's commission           looking into 9/11 gets to crucial documents. I'm ready to vote for           subpoenas right now," former Senator Max Cleland told CNN, evoking           Warren Commission suspicion deja vu.
While             it's not surprising, as a New York Times/CBS poll revealed, that             77 percent of Americans reject the Warren Commission's findings,           it seems that several government officials did, too. Richard Nixon,           for example, said that the Warren Commission was "the greatest           hoax that has ever been perpetuated," [ BBC ]         while Bill           Clinton reportedly asked Webster Hubble to find answers to two questions: "One,           who killed JFK? And, two, are there UFOs?"
Of course, without history's hindsight, nobody knows if 9/11 questions           will capture the public's imagination the way those surrounding John           F. Kennedy's assassination have. And while some, like Tucker Carlson,           continue to disparagingly refer to "grassy knoll conspiracy theories," a quick glance at this week's TV listings shows exactly how enduring           (and widely believed) such theories are.
Though ABC plans to commemorate the 40th anniversary of JFK’s assassination           by "irrefutably" confirming that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, other           offerings include FOX’s JFK: Case Not Closed, The Discovery Channel's Unsolved History: JFK Conspiracy, Court TV’s JFK Assassination:           Investigation Reopened and Cinemax’s airing of Oliver Stone’s JFK. Starting Nov.           18, The History Channel is featuring Nigel Turner’s The Men Who           Killed Kennedy series, offering nine hours of individual conspiracy           segments over the course of three nights. And on Sun. Nov. 23, they’ll           air JFK           and the Grassy Knoll, with Kennedy assassination authors Gerald Posner,           Mark Lane and David Lifton debating new evidence, which, the listing           explains, "concludes that there may have been another gunman on the           grassy knoll."
Although             there are at least 36 different JFK conspiracy theories, part of             the lasting allure of the Kennedy saga lies in the fact that           new information keeps bubbling to the surface. It seems that while           some fibs (like Condi Rice's assertion that nobody imagined planes           being used as weapons) are uncovered early on, others take longer to           unravel. It took nearly 40 years and a team of British forensic scientists,           for example, to conclude, with 96.3% accuracy, there was most likely           a second gunman on the grassy knoll ("Study Backs Theory of 'Grassy           Knoll,'" the Washington Post ,           March 25, 2001).
Postcards from the Bushy Knoll
While             ex-British minister Michael Meacher has openly wondered if 9/11 wasn’t             conveniently allowed to happen to pave the way for US global           domination [ The Guardian ], it’s doubtful that a majority of Americans             entertain such claims. During a May, 2003 Hardball appearance, for             example, political humorist           Bill Maher reflected what seems to be prevailing attitude towards JFK           and Sept. 11 theories. Uttering a confounded "wow" after           Chris Matthews admitted, "I believe in the single bullet theory," Maher           nevertheless balked when an audience member suggested that Bush might           have purposely dropped the ball on 9/11.
British             officials notwithstanding, for the most part, American politicians           have tried to tiptoe around accusations that "Bush knew." Calling for           the FBI’s Phoenix memorandum and Bush’s Aug. 6, 2001 intelligence briefing           to be handed over to Congressional investigators, Sen. Hillary Clinton           measured her words carefully in May, 2002. "I am simply here today,           on the floor of this hallowed chamber, to seek answers to questions," she           said. "Questions being asked by my constituents. Questions raised           by our newspapers in New York, such as the one with the headline 'Bush           Knew.' The President knew what? My constituents would like to know           the answers to those questions. Not to blame the President or any American.           But just to know. To learn from experience. To do all we can to ensure           that a 9/11 never happens again."
Al             Gore, on the other hand, was more forceful in his Nov. 9, 2003 speech,             when he suggested that Bush was attempting to cover his hide. "In           a revealing move, just three days ago, the White House asked the Republican leadership of the Senate to shut down the Intelligence Committee's           investigation of 9/11 based on a trivial political dispute," he said. "Apparently the President is anxious to keep the Congress from seeing           what are said to have been clear, strong and explicit warnings directly           to him a few weeks before 9/11 that terrorists were planning to hijack           commercial airliners and use them to attack us."
Oddly             enough, George Bush, Sr.'s name was dragged through the Kennedy assassination             muck, too. In an F.B.I. memorandum, dated Nov. 29, 1963,           J. Edgar Hoover reported that the FBI had briefed "Mr. George           Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency" on the post-JFK assassination           reaction of Cuban exiles in Miami. [ InternetPirate.com ]).           And a 1988 Nation article entitled, "The Man Who Wasn't There,           'George Bush,' C.I.A. Operative" suggested that Bush's Zapata           Offshore Oil Company was a front for CIA clandestine operations. "I           know [Bush] was involved in the Caribbean," a CIA operative said,           referring to the Bay of Pigs fiasco. And in an added twist, Lee Harvey           Oswald's suicidal friend, George DeMohrenschildt had "George H.W.           (Poppy) 1412 Ohio, also Zapata Petroleum Midland" listed in his           address book.
Media Trollops Revisited
Though             the press is meant to be a watchdog for "we the people," since 9/11,             it's been clearly complicit in spreading governmental whoppers           about everything from WMD to Jessica Lynch. At times, it spoon fed           us doozies (remember the one about the hijacker’s passport surviving           the fiery crash into the World Trade Center?), while often, it was           merely guilty of sins of omission. 'I'm very disappointed in the press," 9/11 widow Kristin Breitweiser told Salon.com. 'I've been scheduled           to go on 'Meet the Press' and 'Hardball' so many times and I'm always           canceled. Frankly I'd like nothing better than to go head to head with           Dick Cheney on 'Meet the Press.' Because somebody needs to ask the           questions and I don't understand why nobody is."
This             unholy alliance between the media and the government was intact after             the JFK assassination, too. Bertrand Russell's 1964 essay, "16           Questions on the Assassination," for example, charged that the           American media blindly propagated "blatant fabrications" and           largely ignored "world-wide disbelief" in official US government           claims. [ LINK ]
A             1992 Village Voice article entitled "JFK: How the Media Assassinated           the Real Story" further chronicled government’s sins and the media’s           complicity. In a move that rivals the Bush administration’s manipulation           of WMD intelligence, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach determined           what the Warren Commission's findings should be a year before the commission           reached them. "We need something to head off public speculation           or Congressional hearings of the wrong sort." Katzenbach wrote           in a 1963 memo. [ LINK ]
Chronicling             ploys to achieve this end, the Voice outlined tactics that             are startlingly familiar to the post-9/11 propaganda employed           today. "[T]he working press was a lobster in a trap," Bill           Moyers admitted. "Back then, what government said was the news." While           this phenomenon was recently witnessed whenever anyone like Scott Ritter           disputed the official story (Ritter was accused, as Paul Zahn put it, "of           drinking Saddam Hussein's Kool-Aid"), such naivete was more forgivable           during the pre-Watergate era. Because of this, Johnny Carson's reaction           to Jim Garrison's Tonight Show appearance [ Prouty.org ]           was hardly out of bounds.
"The function of the Warren Commission was to make the American           people feel that the [JFK assassination] had been looked into so that           there would be no further inquiries," Garrison told an incredulous           Carson.
"I             just can't understand how you think that these men think they can             get away with it or for what reason they would do it," Carson later           responded.
By             9:00 the next morning, Garrison had received more than 2000 telegrams           from District Attorneys across America, who felt that Carson's "nervous           antagonism," was a sign that Garrison was onto something. Feeling           the need to apologize for Carson's demeanor (which was nevertheless           polite and jovial by today's shout-fest standards), NBC sent out thousands           of form letters saying, "The Johnny seen on TV that night was           not the Johnny we all know and love. He had to play the devil's advocate,           because that makes for a better program."
The Price of Secrecy
Years             ago, Moyers also lent a credible voice to those warning about America's "secret government." Tracing             the advent of our secretive and often grossly unethical national             security state to the           National Security Act of 1947, Moyers chronicled coups, dirty tricks           and other blowback-inciting activities. Citing at least eight documented           plans to kill Castro (including a plan to lace his cigars with LSD),           Moyers also reported on the CIA’s use of the Mafia to conduct assassinations.
"It’s             a chilling thought," Moyers said, "made more chilling by the assassination of John Kennedy. The accusations linger. In some minds,           the suspicions persist of a dark unsolved conspiracy behind his murder.           You can dismiss them, as many of us do, but knowing now what our secret           government planned for Castro, the possibility remains: Once we decide           that anything goes, anything can come home to haunt us." [ InformationClearingHouse.info ]
Interestingly             enough, H. R. Haldeman hinted that Nixon had inside information regarding             the JFK assassination. 'Tell Ehrlichman this           whole group of Cubans [Watergate burglars] is tied to the Bay of Pigs,'           Haldeman quoted Nixon as saying, later adding, "It seems that           in all of those Nixon references to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually           referring to the Kennedy assassination." Others contend that Robert           Kennedy didn't want JFK's death to be fully investigated because it           might uncover the Kennedy White House's plans to assassinate Castro.
Not             surprisingly, Moyers revisited "the Secret Government" in           2002, while reporting on how the Bush administration used Sept. 11           and "national security" as a backdrop to effectively repeal           access to presidential records -- along with the public's right to           know. [ PBS.org ] (National           security was also evoked following the JFK assassination, prompting           Bertrand Russell to ask, "If, as we are told, Oswald was the lone assassin,           where is the issue of national security?)
Given this White House’s unprecedented secrecy -- not to mention ties           to the Project for a New American Century, the Carlyle Group, the Saudis           and Halliburton -- it would be remarkable if people didn’t speculate           about hidden agendas. Rollbacks in the Freedom of Information Act notwithstanding,           perpetual stonewalling of the Sept. 11 investigation adds to the distrust. "Excessive administration secrecy on issues related to the September           11 attacks feeds conspiracy theories and reduces the public’s confidence           in government," Sen. John McCain reminded.
Then,             too, as more Americans awaken to how deeply we’ve been lied to, those             who didn’t even realize that NORAD hadn’t scrambled jets           from Andrews Air Force Base on Sept. 11 must now be wondering why the           commission is having trouble procuring records of NORAD’s activities.           And now that Sept. 11 victims' family members are warning that the           9/11 commission will not be able to render "a full uncovering           of the truth," [ New           York Times ]           even those with minimal interest in the JFK case are bound to see parallels.
And,             as with the JFK assassination, there are simply too many unanswered           questions. How is it that, despite long-standing procedures, the systems           to safeguard America's skies failed to function? Why didn’t the FAA           notify NORAD until 32 minutes after losing contact with Flight 11?           How is it that, though nearly an hour and a half elapsed between Flight             11's fateful detour and the time the Pentagon was hit, military jets             didn't           intervene? How did the FBI miraculously know, hours after the attacks,           to go the flight school where hijackers had trained -– though an agent           told one 9/11 widow that there were too many flight schools to investigate           pre-Sept.11 claims that Al Qaeda operatives were training in America?           And why-oh-why did George W. Bush sit in that Florida classroom, after           learning that a second plane hit the World Trade Center -- and then           repeatedly claim that he saw the first plane hit while watching TV           at the school? The list goes on and on, but at this point, you might         as well be searching for JFK’s stolen brain.
But               who knows? Maybe decades from now, vital information will come to               the forefront and we’ll finally understand exactly what happened             on Nov. 22, 1963 and on Sept. 11, 2001. In the meantime, sentient beings             will wonder why pertinent facts remain hidden, and will continue to             dismiss lame explanations like the magic bullet theory and "they             hate us for our freedoms." Because no matter what Tucker Carlson             says, given the mysteries surrounding JFK's assassination and Sept.             11, the term "conspiracy theory" eventually loses its stigma,             as truth-deprived minds try to fill in the blanks -- even if (as this           week's TV fare suggests) it takes 40 years to do so.
