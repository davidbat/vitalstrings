Jackie O’s JFK Conspiracy Theory
Aug 08
Jackie Onassis recorded a bombshell of an interview with Arthur Schlesinger shortly after her husband John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22nd, 1963.  With all of the personal and highly controversial material she covered in the interview, she demanded that the tapes not be released until 50 years after her death.  Even though Jackie O died only 17 years ago, Caroline Kennedy (her daughter) is allowing the tapes to be released early.  Here are some main points from the recordings:
Jackie O’s own take on the JFK conspiracy theory, believing that JFK’s vice president at the time Lyndon Johnson and other southern businessmen orchestrated President Kennedy’s assassination!
JFK had an affair with a 19-year-old intern at the White House.
Jackie Onassis admitted to affairs with actor William Holden and Gianni Agnelli (founder of Fiat)
I don’t cover conspiracy theories very often on this website, but when it comes from the mouth of Jackie Kennedy Onassis herself I can’t help but believe it’s big news!
“Texas is the reason that the President’s dead!”
