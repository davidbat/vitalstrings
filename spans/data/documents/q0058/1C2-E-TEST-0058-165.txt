Well a lot of the conspiracies on the inside lead very deep into the Cuban missile crisis...and what sparks this is that lee Harvey was receiving massive amounts of money just before the assassination....but it was not labeled to the US government. On the other hand many say that he was hired by the Soviet Union and this was because of his great communistic views and the many years he lived in the Soviet Union. This also makes him a prime target for the US because no one would believe that he would be hired by the government.
