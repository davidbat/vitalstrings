lol were all victims of mind control genius since most our info is taken from the “world wide web” meant to “trap” u. it’s nearly impossible to decipher between truth and lies. not saying i disagree with what hes discovered & maybe it’s aired so sheeple will doubt its legitimacy but having said that we don’t really know because the elite are so damn crafty its sickening. trust everybody but trust nobody.
p.s. i tend to give martyrs a little more attention, they were shut up for a reason

@kylekelly123 youre a victim of mind control friend. they let the “truthers” air their views because it forces gullible people like you to doubt the truth of it. if they stopped the “truthers” you cant say you would be a bit suspicious. they have the advantage since they dont care what we think we know, this isnt proof. and btw you should look up the trouble jesse is in over this show.

jesse and his clan are all terrible actors a 4 year old could see through their charade. i cant say that everything he talks about is false but hes more than likely like all the other so called “truthers” mixing half truths with whole lies. he would not be on the air if he was actually exposing something that would legitimately foil the elites plan. just another puppet!

@scorpio888 I second that… Like Alex Jones, this show just discredits real evidence by association. There are many things that don’t add up about the official 911 story as well tho , but anyone questioning this will automatically be put in the ‘conspiracy freak’ corner… Once you get into the NWO/Freemason stuff , all of a sudden EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.
