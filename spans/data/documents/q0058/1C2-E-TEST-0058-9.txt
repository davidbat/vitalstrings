Let's say Oswald had help -- or was set up.
Who did it?
by Pamela Colloff and Michael Hall
(Texas Monthly, November 1998)
THERE IS NEVER AN ORDINARY DAY AT DALLAS' DEALEY PLAZA, where personal revelations and quiet mourning are as familiar as the downtown rush-hour traffic. But this August afternoon is stranger than usual: A dark blue 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible limousine is sitting in the center lane of Elm Street, which has been blocked off. Stills of the Zapruder film line the sidewalk, serving as the storyboard for the day's activities: a restaging of the century's most famous murder, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, for a television documentary that will try to determine, with the help of lasers, where the shots came from. Three men in white shirts are huddled around the convertible, bending and shifting the limbs of its foam rubber passengers. A gray dummy sits in the back seat, just as Kennedy did, while another -- in John Connally's place -- rests on the jump seat in front of him. "His arm has got to come over more," insists one man, pulling the president's left arm farther across his spongy torso. A film crew circles the scene, while tourists, ballistics experts, conspiracy buffs, and reporters watch the goings-on. "But shouldn't his other hand be over the chrome line?" asks one observer. The men in the white shirts mull this over, glancing first at the film stills and then at the mannequins, before resuming their work. The heat is oppressive, but the comparing and tweaking continues late into the day.
Of course, they will never get it right: the precise slant of a wave, the tilt of a head, the trajectory of a bullet. Elm Street has been closed several times for such reenactments, but there is still no consensus on exactly what happened. There are too many shifting perspectives, inexplicable details, and active imaginations, all aching to make sense of a senseless act. Over the past 35 years, countless theories have evolved, but they discount the overwhelming proof, both physical and circumstantial, that Lee Harvey Oswald was the man who shot Kennedy. "I have sent men to the electric chair with less evidence," said Henry Wade, Dallas County's district attorney in 1963.
In 1964 the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald was Kennedy's assassin, and that he had acted alone. But the official story had troubling inconsistencies: Conflicting eyewitness accounts, discrepancies in the autopsy reports, and the unlikely paths and precision of Oswald's shots all suggested more than one gunman had been at Dealey Plaza. The first cries of foul play came from across the Atlantic, most notably from English writer Bertrand Russell, but it wasn't until 1966, with the publication of Mark Lane's Rush to Judgment and Edward Jay Epstein's Inquest, that the Warren Commission's findings were challenged at home. Life magazine, which had purchased the Zapruder film soon after the assassination, launched a new investigation of the case. The magazine's consultant, former Navy lieutenant Josiah Thompson, argued the following year in Six Seconds in Dallas that a close examination of the film showed the president being shot from several directions, hence a conspiracy.
New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison stepped into the fray in 1967, using the loose ends of Oswald's life -- he had defected to the Soviet Union and sought asylum in Cuba and had tenuous connections to anti-Castro militants -- to speculate that the CIA had somehow been involved. For the most part, the public ignored such cynical talk, but as first Vietnam and then Watergate wore on, its distrust grew. Interest in a more thorough investigation of the Kennedy assassination reached critical mass in 1975, when the Zapruder film was first shown on TV and Senate hearings revealed that the CIA had conspired with the Mafia to kill Fidel Castro in the early sixties. The following year, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was formed, and in 1979 it concluded that while Oswald was indeed the gunman, he had had an accomplice, who shot, and missed, from the grassy knoll. The existence of a conspiracy was confirmed -- by the federal government, no less. The HSCA also hinted at involvement by Cuban exiles or members of the mob, a theory that remained in vogue throughout the eighties. Since 1991, when Oliver Stone's controversial movie JFK used Garrison as its hero and pointed fingers at the CIA, the FBI, Cuban exiles, military intelligence, and munitions profiteers, the specifics of the various theories have been lost, replaced by a sense of overall complicity: Everyone was in on it.
What follows is an overview of the conspiracy oeuvre, though it is hardly exhaustive. We haven't included some of the shadowy figures -- Umbrella Man, the Babushka Lady, Badge Man -- that populate the fringes of conspiracy-think. Nor do we examine the more far-out theories: that Joe DiMaggio, angered at Kennedy's treatment of his ex-wife, Marilyn Monroe, got his Italian friends to knock him off; or that the president, who was already suffering from Addison's disease, staged his own death, ensuring a glorified place in history; or that Frank Sinatra's drummer, Franklin Folley, was somehow involved. Instead, we present the ones that have endured over the years. They are as intriguing as they are implausible, and they raise as many questions as the Warren Commission failed to answer. Underlying all of them are uncanny coincidences, convergences of terrible knowledge, and most important, a desire to believe that there was a grand design -- some kind of meaning and purpose -- behind Kennedy's murder. Thirty-five years later, these narratives have become more appealing than the banal alternative: a lone nut, a good shot, an utterly vain death.
WHEN KENNEDY ASSUMED THE PRESIDENCY in January 1961, he inherited a         federal agency that had spun out of control. The CIA had pursued its own         objectives during the Eisenhower administration -- instigating coups,         inciting rebellions, trying to assassinate foreign leaders -- generally         without White House supervision. When the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion         (which the CIA had orchestrated) proved to be a disaster as well as an         enormous political liability for Kennedy, he fired the director and his         deputies, threatening to "smash the CIA into a thousand pieces and         scatter it to the winds." Rogue agents, fearful he would do just         that, struck first, either by placing CIA sharpshooters at Dealey Plaza         or by enlisting former Marine and spy wannabe Lee Harvey Oswald to do         the job.

Strange Details
CIA director Allen Dulles, whom Kennedy had fired in 1961, later             served on the Warren Commission.
CIA deputy director Charles Cabell, whom Kennedy had also fired,             was the brother of Earle Cabell, Dallas' mayor in 1963.
One of Kennedy's alleged mistresses, Mary Pinchot Meyer, was             married to a CIA official and was murdered in 1964.
Richard Nixon -- who oversaw the CIA's original plan to take back             Cuba from Castro when he was Eisenhower's vice president -- was in             Dallas on the day of the assassination.
Reasons to Believe
If anybody could have planned and concealed a plot as intricate as             the Kennedy assassination, power-hungry CIA agents could; they had             already helped oust heads of state in Guatemala and Iran.
The agency had little congressional oversight in 1963 and was full             of furtive cells, subgroups, and enthusiastic spooks who acted with             impunity and whose modus operandi was "plausible             deniability." Indeed, as Kennedy's motorcade was making its way             through Dallas, a CIA operative in Paris was -- unbeknownst to most             of his higher-ups -- giving a poison fountain pen to Cuban turncoat             Rolando Cubela, who had volunteered to hand it to Fidel Castro.
While in the Marines in 1957 and 1958, Oswald was stationed at             Atsugi Air Base in Japan, the home of the largest CIA station in the             Pacific.
During the Warren Commission's investigation, the CIA withheld             untold amounts of information, notably that the agency and the mob             had jointly tried to kill Castro.
Reasons Not to Believe
There is no evidence that Oswald was ever a CIA operative; at             Atsugi he was a low-level officer who was court-martialed twice and             displayed erratic behavior, once shooting himself in the arm.
Just because the CIA would lie, cheat, steal, overthrow             governments, and try to assassinate other countries' leaders does             not mean that it would kill its own.
Recent Developments
Speculation about the CIA's involvement has always centered on one of         the most intriguing assassination riddles: the identity of the three         tramps, a trio of men arrested in the rail yard behind Dealey Plaza         immediately after the assassination. Photos showed them being led         through the downtown streets by Dallas police officers, yet there was no         record of their arrest. Conspiracy theorists have long believed that         they looked suspiciously like CIA bogeymen E. Howard Hunt and Frank         Sturgis (as well as Charles Harrelson, the assassin of federal judge         John Wood and the father of actor Woody Harrelson). According to the         three tramps theory, these CIA operatives killed Kennedy; after they         were arrested, they were whisked away by unidentified federal agents who         destroyed all records of the incident. But in 1992 Dallas researcher         Mary La Fontaine searched through Dallas Police Department files and         found overlooked arrest records from November 22, 1963. The three tramps         were, in fact, three tramps: Harold Doyle, Gus Abrams, and John         Forrester Gedney.
THE MOB FELT BETRAYED IN 1963. Chicago godfather Sam Giancana had         helped Kennedy win the 1960 election through skulduggery, and Miami         mobster Santos Trafficante had aided the CIA in its assassination         attempts on Castro. But rather than pledging their loyalty, the Kennedys         launched an all-out campaign against organized crime. Attorney General         Robert Kennedy first went after Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa and then         deported New Orleans syndicate boss Carlos Marcello to Guatemala. Pushed         around long enough, and angry at the president for going soft on Castro         -- who had shut down its lucrative Cuban casinos -- the mob made someone         an offer he couldn't refuse. Oswald was either its hit man or its patsy.         Upon his arrest, the mob dispatched Jack Ruby to silence him.

Strange Details
In 1975 and 1976, during the course of congressional             investigations of the mob and the CIA, Sam Giancana was gunned down             in his kitchen, Jimmy Hoffa "disappeared," and Las Vegas             mobster Johnny Roselli -- who had told Jack Anderson that Ruby was             ordered to silence Oswald -- was dismembered, stuffed into an oil             drum, and tossed off the coast of Florida.
Kennedy and Judith Exner, one of Giancana's molls, were introduced             in 1960 by Frank Sinatra and carried on an affair for more than two             years; Exner says she often carried envelopes from the president to             the mobster.
Reasons to Believe
In 1979 the HSCA concluded that Hoffa, Marcello, and Trafficante             all had the "motive, means, and opportunity" to assassinate Kennedy.
Hoffa had told a federal informant that he would like to kill RFK             but that his brother was the more desirable victim because "when you cut down the tree, the branches fall with it."
Marcello -- according to Las Vegas promoter Edward Becker -- once             coolly explained why it was better to target JFK than RFK: "If             you cut off a dog's tail, the dog will only keep biting. But if you             cut off its head, the dog will die."
An FBI informant testified before the HSCA that Trafficante told             him in 1962 that the president "was going to be hit."
In 1992 Frank Ragano, a longtime lawyer for Hoffa and Trafficante,             told the New York Post that the two mobsters and Marcello had             agreed to kill the president. Ragano claimed that Trafficante said             on his deathbed: "Carlos f--ed up. We shouldn't have gotten rid             of Giovanni [John]. We should have killed Bobby."
Oswald's uncle and surrogate father, Dutz Murret, was a bookie in             the Marcello organization, and his mother, Marguerite, dated members             of Marcello's gang.
When Ruby was a teenager in Chicago, he ran errands for Al Capone.             As an adult, he had ties to members of the Giancana, Hoffa,             Marcello, and Trafficante families. In 1959 he visited Trafficante             in his Cuban jail cell, where Castro had thrown the mobster after             the revolution.
Two days before the assassination, a prostitute and heroin addict             named Rose Cheramie told a Louisiana state policeman that she had             been en route to Dallas with two men "who were Italians or             resembled Italians" and were planning to kill Kennedy. After             the assassination, she told Dr. Victor Weiss at East Louisiana State Hospital that "the word in the underworld" had been that             Kennedy was going to take a mob bullet. She also said that Oswald             and Ruby "had been shacking up for years . . . They were             bedmates."
Reasons Not to Believe
The HSCA was ultimately "unable to establish any direct             evidence" of mob complicity.
Chicago FBI agent William Roemer, who spent hours listening to             wiretaps of mobsters after the assassination, said they were "gleeful" but did not talk of a conspiracy.
There is no proof that Ruby was anything more than a small-timer             on the periphery of the Dallas underworld.
Hoffa, Trafficante, and Marcello were cautious men, yet killing             JFK was a rash solution -- one that would only have brought on more             heat from RFK. And why would a bunch of seasoned killers rely on a             loser like Oswald?
Cheramie -- who had spent time in mental hospitals and who had a             history of providing the FBI with false leads -- was in the throes             of heroin withdrawal when she told her story. After the             assassination, she said that she had once worked as a dancer for             Ruby, whom she knew as Pinky, but there is no evidence that she did.             Nor is there reliable evidence that Oswald and Ruby ever knew each             other.

In 1993 Illinois cop killer James Files confessed to Kennedy's         murder. Claiming to have been an Army paratrooper in Laos, a trainer of         Cuban exiles for the Bay of Pigs invasion, and the personal driver for         Chicago mobster Charles Nicoletti, Files said that he fired from the         grassy knoll while Nicoletti shot from the Dal-Tex Building. In 1994 the New York Post ran a story on Files titled "Call This JFK         Tale Knoll and Void."
BY 1963 LYNDON JOHNSON HAD GROWN WEARY of the obscurity of his office         and was concerned that the scandals surrounding his cronies Bobby Baker         and Billie Sol Estes would ruin his hopes for the presidency. When         rumors circulated that JFK was going to drop him from the 1964 ticket,         LBJ worked to stage an elaborate coup on home turf, enlisting loyal         Texas oilmen who feared losing the oil depletion allowance and         warmongers who wanted to step up involvement in Vietnam. One of their         foot soldiers was an angry young man named Lee Harvey Oswald.

John Connally, LBJ's longtime friend and colleague, roomed in             college with Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade, whose             November 24, 1963, press conference made the definitive case against             Oswald.
Eugene Locke, the deputy ambassador to Vietnam under LBJ, once             served as the attorney for Marie Tippit, the wife of Dallas police             officer J. D. Tippit, whom Oswald shot soon after the assassination.
Reasons to Believe
Two days after the assassination, deputy attorney general Nicholas             Katzenbach pushed for the creation of a federal investigatory             commission, partly out of concern that the public might suspect             Johnson's involvement: Historically, assassinations of heads of             state have been carried out by their successors.
Soon after becoming president, Johnson, a hawk, pressed the House             and Senate for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, initiating             a period of increased involvement in Vietnam.
Johnson sealed certain assassination records until 2039, ordered             that Kennedy's limousine be refurbished rather than entered into             evidence, and handpicked each member of the Warren Commission, which             answered ultimately to him.
Reasons Not to Believe
LBJ was fiercely ambitious but not depraved; to believe that he             would order Kennedy's murder requires an extraordinary leap of             logic.
Despite years of speculation -- beginning, most memorably, with             Barbara Garson's popular 1967 play, MacBird!, and amplified             in Oliver Stone's JFK -- there is not one shred of evidence             to support the idea that LBJ had a hand in the assassination.
Recent Developments
The newly released LBJ tapes show that Johnson was by no means the         puppet of warmongers; he clearly agonized over Vietnam and sought         resolution to the conflict. They also reveal a man of more depth, and of         greater conscience, than his detractors have ever given him credit for         -- hardly the portrait of a Judas waiting in the wings.
HUMILIATED BY KENNEDY IN THE CUBAN missile crisis, Soviet premier         Nikita Khrushchev decided to punish him. Scenario 1: Oswald, who lived         in the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1962, was trained in espionage there         and then ordered to make the hit. Scenario 2: Oswald was the patsy in         Khrushchev's game, set up by an Oswald double and KGB operatives who         fired the fatal shots at Dealey Plaza. Scenario 3: Oswald returned home         from the Soviet Union an unwitting assassin, programmed ý la The         Manchurian Candidate to carry out the orders of those behind the         Iron Curtain.

Russian baron and suspected spy George de Mohrenschildt -- who             helped introduce Oswald to the Russian ÈmigrÈ community in Dallas             and was his closest friend before the assassination -- fatally shot             himself in 1977, before he was set to testify before the HSCA.
The uncle of Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova, Oswald's Russian-born             wife, was a ranking officer in the Soviet Ministry of Internal             Affairs.
Reasons to Believe
In January 1960 Oswald was given a rent-free apartment in Minsk,             where an espionage training academy was located. Recently             declassified files show that up to twenty KGB agents shadowed him             and may have manipulated his behavior. ("Maybe they did drop a             few tablets in his glass," a high-ranking KGB official told the             Russian newspaper Izvestia, "but only to make him let             down his guard and be a little more talkative.")
The Russians, who had never before captured a U2 spy plane,             suddenly managed to do so a scant six and a half months after the             defection of Oswald, who had worked as a Marine radar operator in             Atsugi, Japan, where the U2 was based.
On a trip to Mexico City on September 27, 1963, Oswald visited the             Soviet embassy and spoke to KGB agent Oleg Maximovich Nechiporenko             -- who was expelled from Mexico in 1970 for conspiring to overthrow             the government -- and Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, an agent in "wet affairs": sabotage and assassination.
Reasons Not to Believe
Secret agents usually keep a lower profile than did Oswald, whose           pinko leanings -- such as addressing his fellow Marines as "comrades" in the midst of the cold war or reading Das           Kapital in the barracks -- earned him the nickname Oswaldskovich.
It seems unlikely that the KGB would have recruited someone as             unstable as Oswald -- who attempted suicide five days after arriving             in Moscow -- for such a covert operation, since a Soviet-backed plot             to kill Kennedy would have resulted in certain nuclear retaliation             if uncovered.
At Atsugi, Oswald was a low-level soldier with little exposure to             the U2.
A 1981 exhumation of Oswald's body revealed that it was indeed he             who was buried, not his Soviet-trained double, as some conspiracy             theorists suspected.
Marina later recanted her testimony and professed her husband's             innocence, saying that she had been threatened with deportation if             she did not cooperate.
Why would Khrushchev want to get rid of Kennedy in favor of             Johnson, a more zealous anti-communist with closer ties to the             military?
Recent Developments
In 1992 the KGB released dossier #31451: the Oswald file. It         contained few revelations other than the KGB's own suspicions that the         American defector was a CIA operative. There was, however, one         tantalizing detail: After spying on several of Oswald's hunting trips,         KGB operatives concluded that he was a poor shot.
BY THE FALL OF 1963, J. EDGAR HOOVER, had anticipated that his long         tenure as FBI director was coming to an end. Federal law required the         68-year-old to step down on his seventieth birthday, and he knew that         Kennedy was eager to be rid of him. But rather than fading quietly into         the background, Hoover orchestrated an early transfer of power to his         ally LBJ, who, as president, could -- and did -- exempt him from         mandatory retirement, allowing him to lord over the bureau until his         death in 1972. Scenario 1: Hoover knew of various plots to kill Kennedy         but took no action, failing to inform the Secret Service of threats to         the president's life and taking an uncharacteristically hands-off         approach to investigating possible conspirators. Scenario 2: Oswald was         an FBI informant who killed Kennedy on orders from the bureau. Scenario         3: Oswald warned the FBI of plots to kill Kennedy, only to find himself         framed and then silenced by fellow informant Jack Ruby.

Reasons to Believe
The FBI had been keeping tabs on Oswald since at least 1960 but             did not inform the Secret Service that he worked in a building along             the motorcade route.
Ten days before the assassination, Oswald dropped off a             handwritten note at the FBI's Dallas field office for James Hosty, a             special agent who had been trailing him for several months. Hosty             destroyed the note on orders from his superior the day Oswald was             shot but never acknowledged its existence until 1975, when he             explained that it had merely warned him to "stop             harassing" Oswald's wife, Marina. (He had questioned her twice             in early November.) Some speculate that the note really contained             violent threats; others think it was a warning from Oswald that             someone in Dallas was going to kill the president.
Texas attorney general Waggoner Carr told the Warren Commission he             had information that Oswald was an undercover FBI agent, prompting a             top-secret emergency meeting of the commission in January 1964.
Eyewitness accounts of varying reliability placed Oswald in New             Orleans fraternizing with, and even receiving envelopes from, FBI             agents.
The sole investigatory body for the Warren Commission was the FBI,             which intimidated witnesses, suppressed and destroyed evidence that             cast an unflattering light on the bureau, and conducted a shoddy             investigation, even declining to take Abraham Zapruder's super-8             footage when he offered it after the assassination.
According to Hale Boggs, a Warren Commission member: "Hoover             lied his eyes out to the commission -- on Oswald, on Ruby, on their             friends, the bullets, the gun, you name it."
Reasons Not to Believe
The HSCA could never establish that Oswald had worked as an FBI             informant.
Carr's speculations were partly based on a 1964 Houston Post article whose source, Dallas County assistant district attorney Bill             Alexander, later admitted to having concocted the story because he             distrusted the feds.
Why would Hoover -- whose personal files on politicians'             indiscretions filled four rooms of FBI headquarters -- have             preferred murder to blackmail as a means of furthering his own             ambitions?
Recent Developments
In his 1996 memoir, Assignment: Oswald, Hosty said he found         notes he took during Oswald's twelve-hour interrogation at Dallas police         headquarters -- notes that he told the Warren Commission he had         destroyed. Although they shed little new light on Oswald, their sudden         appearance raises questions about what else the FBI has withheld over         the years.
FIDEL CASTRO HAD SURVIVED DOZENs OF attempts on his life by agents of         the U.S. government (some involving poisoned cigars, lethal powders, and         exploding seashells) as well as the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and         other CIA-orchestrated raids. After one too many bazooka attacks, the         dictator said, "Basta!" in the fall of 1963 and struck         back. He found a willing assassin in Oswald, a known communist         sympathizer.

In the summer of 1963 Oswald was planning to relocate his family             to Havana.
Reasons to Believe
In a September 1963 interview with the Associated Press, Castro             called Kennedy a "cretin" and threatened to retaliate             against him: "U.S. leaders should think that if they are aiding             terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders . . . they themselves             will not be safe."
On September 27, 1963, Oswald visited the Cuban consulate in             Mexico City, ostensibly to obtain a visa. Eager to ingratiate             himself with Cuban bureaucrats, he presented himself as "a             friend of the Cuban revolution" and, some speculate, offered             his services as an assassin.
Autulio RamÌrez Ortiz, a hijacker who claimed to have infiltrated             Cuban intelligence in the early sixties, testified before the HSCA             that he saw a file labeled "Osvaldo-Kennedy" at a Cuban             intelligence facility. The file, Ortiz said, contained a photo of             Oswald, a KGB recommendation, and this conclusion: "Oswald is             an adventurer. Our embassy in Mexico has orders to get in contact             with him. Be very careful."
Reasons Not to Believe
Castro had to have known that the U.S. would strike back if his             plot were discovered.
Oswald's visa request at the Cuban consulate was turned down.

According to National Security Agency documents released last year,         the usually unflappable Castro was terrified the U.S. would retaliate         against Cuba in the first hours after the assassination. The NSA         intercepted messages going in and out of Cuba, including one from a         foreign agent who saw Castro's televised speech on the evening of         November 23: "Fidel, emotional and uneasy, tried . . . to refute         the accusations which were then appearing and to twist them so that the         assassination would appear as the work of the Ultra Reaction, of the         extreme racists of the Pentagon, who are fanatical supporters of war         against Cuba and the Soviet Union. Although it was only the third time I         had witnessed a speech by Fidel, I got the immediate impression that on         this occasion he was frightened, if not terrified."
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE KENNEDY administration, Cuban exiles         reserved their contempt for Castro, who had taken away their homeland.         But after the Bay of Pigs invasion, they felt equally betrayed by         Kennedy, who had withheld air support during the operation, leaving         1,500 Cuban soldiers stranded and at the mercy of Castro's army. After         Kennedy thwarted subsequent plans to invade, enraged exiles orchestrated         the president's murder with help from their CIA associates, either in         retaliation for the deaths of their brothers-in-arms or to frame Castro         for Kennedy's murder, thereby forcing a full-scale U.S. invasion.         Oswald, who had tried to infiltrate the anti-Castro movement in New         Orleans, was either the exiles' agent or their patsy.

In August 1963 Oswald approached Carlos Bringuier, a New Orleans         shopkeeper active in the anti-Castro movement, and asked to join his         organization. Four days later Oswald was arrested for disturbing the         peace while passing out pro-Castro leaflets -- an elaborate scheme, some         say, to deflect attention from his involvement in the anti-Castro         conspiracy.
Reasons to Believe
Cuban exile Sylvia Odio told the HSCA that in late September 1963,             three men showed up at her Dallas apartment and convinced her and             her sister that they were members of the cause. Two of the men, "Leopoldo" and "Angelo," were Cubans, while the             third, "Leon Oswald," was an American, described later as             a former Marine, a man who thought Kennedy should be assassinated             because of the Bay of Pigs, a good shot, and "kind of             nuts." Two months later Odio and her sister were shocked when             they recognized the president's assassin: Leon was Lee Harvey             Oswald. The HSCA later termed Odio a "credible" witness.
Cuban exiles viewed the Bay of Pigs as nothing less than             unforgivable treachery on Kennedy's part. At the end of 1962 he             added fuel to the fire when he shut down Operation Mongoose (a CIA             program that was preparing Cuban pilots and soldiers for another             invasion) in exchange for Khrushchev's dismantling of Russian             missiles on the island. By 1963 the Kennedy administration was             cracking down on Cuban exiles, raiding their paramilitary training             camps in Louisiana and Florida.

Oswald was in Mexico City on the day Odio says he visited her.

In 1994 Florence Martino told writer Anthony Summers that on the         morning of November 22, 1963, her husband, John -- an anti-Castro         activist -- said, "Flo, they're going to kill him. They're going to         kill him when he gets to Texas." Then, she said, John got a bunch         of phone calls from Texas. "I don't know who called him, but he was         on the phone, on the phone, on the phone . . ." John Martino, who         had once worked for Santos Trafficante, had been imprisoned by Castro         from 1959 to 1962. (He later wrote a book, I Was Castro's Prisoner.)         After his release he threw in with Cuban exiles and later claimed that         they had framed Oswald. He died in 1975.
SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WERE PAWNS IN A grand scheme to kill the         president. Working on orders from higher-ups -- the FBI or the vice         president -- they (a) provided lax security in Dallas so that         sharpshooters would have a clear shot and/or (b) hijacked the body as         part of an elaborate scheme to alter the corpse, scuttle the autopsy,         and cover up the whole affair.

Strange Details
Into the wee hours on the morning of the assassination, Secret             Service agents drank Everclear at the Cellar, a rowdy beatnik club             in Fort Worth whose owner, Pat Kirkwood, was an acquaintance of Jack             Ruby's.
Secret Service agents Winston Lawson and Forrest Sorrells, who             chose the motorcade route, rode in a covered sedan in front of the             president's convertible.
Reasons to Believe
Although plans for a presidential motorcade in Miami four days             before the assassination were scrapped when a right-wing extremist             told a police informant that Kennedy would be shot "from an             office building with a high-powered rifle," few precautions             were taken in Dallas: Buildings along the motorcade route were not             secured, lookouts were not posted, and the presidential limousine's "bubble top" was removed.
Against regulations, the Secret Service chose a motorcade route             that required a 120-degree turn, an angle that forced Kennedy's             limousine to slow to a crawl as it passed the book depository             building and turned onto Elm Street.
Rather than having four motorcycles stationed on each side of the             president's limo, as Dallas police chief Jesse Curry had suggested,             Agent Lawson ordered that only two motorcycles be on each side and             that they remain by the rear bumper.
After the first two shots were fired, Agent William Greer,             Kennedy's driver, briefly applied the brake rather than the             accelerator, allowing the presidential limousine to come to a near             standstill right before the third and fatal shot was fired.
At Parkland Hospital on the afternoon of the assassination, agents             forced their way past Dallas medical examiner Earl Rose with the             president's coffin in hand, insisting that the autopsy would be             performed not in Dallas, as required by state law, but in             Washington, D.C.
Reasons Not to Believe
Could all of the seventy Secret Service agents assigned to protect             the president in Dallas have turned against him -- and kept silent             about such a conspiracy for 35 years?
Since the president's coffin was never left unattended on Air             Force One, the corpse could not have been tampered with.
Recent Developments
Interest in the Secret Service's possible connection to the         assassination was revived by Menninger's 1992 book, Mortal Error, which claims that Agent George Hickey fired the third and fatal shot         while riding in the presidential follow-up car. According to Menninger's         thesis, when Hickey reached for his AR-15 upon hearing shots, he slipped         off the safety, lost his balance, and accidentally pulled the trigger.
ON NOVEMBER 2, 1963, AFTER SOUTH Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem         began negotiations with North Vietnamese communists, he was shot at         point-blank range, along with his brother and political adviser, Ngo         Dinh Nhu, during a U.S.-backed coup. Seeking revenge, the wealthy and         powerful Diem family -- perhaps led by the widowed Madame Nhu, Saigon's "Dragon Lady" -- settled the score three weeks later in         Dallas.

In 1950, when Diem was forced into exile by Ho Chi Minh, he fled             to a Catholic seminary in New York, where he became friendly with             then-senator John Kennedy.
Kennedy had approved the coup but was assured that an attempt             would be made to evacuate Diem and Nhu from Saigon; he was appalled             to learn that they had been murdered. Eight years later, CIA             operative Howard Hunt doctored State Department files so that             researchers of the Pentagon Papers might "discover" that             Kennedy had arranged Diem's murder.
Allen Dulles, who created the Saigon Military Mission and staffed             it with men who would later help orchestrate the Saigon coup, was a             member of the Warren Commission.
Reasons to Believe
The Diem regime showed no mercy to its foes. Immediately after her         husband's murder, Madame Nhu told American reporters, "Such a cruel         injustice against a faithful ally cannot go unnoticed, and those who         indulge in it will have to pay for it."

If the South Vietnamese were wily enough to pull this off, why didn't         they kill Ho Chi Minh first?

In 1997 Seymour Hersh's The Dark Side of Camelot alleged that         Kennedy not only knew Diem would be murdered but also personally asked         Air Force general Edward Landsdale, a CIA man, to do the job himself.
THERE IS A SECRET GOVERNMENT WITHIN OUR government, a cabal that in         1963 ordered the murder of a popular president, set up a patsy,         installed its own puppet, and orchestrated an elaborate cover-up that         included tampering with the corpse, destroying and suppressing evidence,         and killing witnesses. Heading the cabal were some of the world's most         powerful men: rich and corrupt industrialists, generals, and right-wing         politicians. Down below was an eclectic group of mobsters, spooks,         lowlifes, and anti-Castro extremists, many of whom were headquartered at         544 Camp Street in New Orleans, including Oswald, former FBI agent Guy         Banister, soldier of fortune David Ferrie, and suspected CIA informant         Clay Shaw. Together, in the summer of 1963, they plotted Kennedy's         demise. score three weeks later in Dallas.

Strange Details
Theorists enjoy playing an elaborate parlor game of Six Degrees of         Assassination. One version goes like this: As a teenager, Oswald had         been in the Civil Air Patrol with Ferrie, who had done private         investigative work for mobster Carlos Marcello, whose close associate         Santos Trafficante had been the main mob boss in prerevolution Cuba,         where in 1959 he was imprisoned by Castro, visited by Ruby, and then         bailed out by Cuban turncoat Rolando Cubela, who, on November 22, 1963,         was being briefed in Paris on killing Castro by an agent of the CIA,         whose former director (and future Warren Commission member), Allen         Dulles, had been forced out by Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs         invasion, as had his deputy, Charles Cabell, whose brother Earle was the         mayor of Dallas, which had been papered on November 22 with "Wanted         for Treason" leaflets published by Robert Surrey, an aide to Major         General Edwin A. Walker, who had been the target of an assassination         attempt in April 1963, the chief suspect of which, according to the         Warren Commission, was Oswald. Surrey also played bridge with James         Hosty, the FBI agent who had been shadowing Oswald, whose wife, Marina,         often mocked her husband's lovemaking and told him how attracted she was         to Kennedy, who had had an affair with Judith Exner, girlfriend of         mafioso Sam Giancana, who had helped steal the 1960 election for Kennedy         by stuffing ballot boxes in Chicago, where Ruby had run errands for Al         Capone as a teenager and Banister had helped ambush John Dillinger.
Reasons to Believe
Pressed for time, obsessed with secrecy, and embarrassed by their         awareness of Oswald's existence, both the FBI and the CIA withheld         critical information and did little to investigate possible links         between their own organizations and Oswald, between the CIA and Cuban         paramilitary organizations, between the Mafia and various assassination         players, and between Ruby and the mob, Cubans, and the Dallas police         force.

How could such a labyrinthine plan with so many participants never             be exposed? How could a bunch of inefficient, bungling bureaucracies             work so well and with such determination and unanimity?
Notwithstanding Kevin Costner's noble portrayal of him in JFK,             Garrison -- the chief proponent of this theory -- was a lying,             attention-grabbing megalomaniac with McCarthyite tendencies who had             been dismissed from the National Guard for mental problems. He tried             to prove his theory by taking businessman Clay Shaw to court in 1969             for conspiring to kill the president. The resulting trial was             nothing less than a circus. Garrison sought to prove his case with             an array of peculiar characters, including a man in a toga             identifying himself as Julius Caesar, a heroin addict, and a New             York accountant who said he often fingerprinted his daughter to make             sure she was not an impostor. The prosecution mischaracterized             evidence and bribed, intimidated, and even had witnesses hypnotized.             He ultimately said that there were sixteen assassins at Dealey             Plaza, including the three tramps and a man who popped out of a             sewer. Though he presented plenty of intriguing suspicions, he had             few facts, and it took the jury only 45 minutes to find Shaw             innocent of all charges. The New York Times later called             Garrison's crusade against Shaw "one of the most disgraceful             chapters in the history of American jurisprudence."
Recent Developments
JFK's release forever changed the way Americans view the         assassination. Oliver Stone provided the seamless -- albeit wildly         inventive and historically inaccurate -- story line that lawyer Garrison         had always coveted. If we vaguely believed in a conspiracy before, by         late 1991, 73 percent of Americans were sure of it, while 35 percent         thought the CIA was directly involved. In response, Congress created the         Assassination Records Review Board, whose mandate was to obtain         assassination-related files from often-reluctant agencies like the FBI         and the CIA, declassify them, and make them available to the public. The         upshot was the release of thousands of important items, including the         personal papers of Warren Commission members, a presidential aide's         amateur film of the motorcade, and notes from Oswald's interrogation at         Dallas police headquarters, as well as an archive of more than four         million pages of secret records. Nothing earth-shattering was ever         discovered (the board was shut down in September), though many documents         still remain hidden from view. According to the act that created the         board, all relevant documents must be released to the public by 2017 --         except for ones deemed worthy for further postponement by any sitting         president.
