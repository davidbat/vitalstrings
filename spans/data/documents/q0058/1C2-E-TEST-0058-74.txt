Description
From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
The circumstances surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 quickly spawned suspicions of a conspiracy. These suspicions were mitigated somewhat when an official investigation by the Warren Commission concluded the following year that there was no conspiracy. Since then, serious doubts have arisen regarding the Commission's findings. Critics have argued that the Commission, and even the government, covered-up crucial information pointing to a conspiracy. Subsequent official investigations confirmed most of the conclusions of the Warren Commission. However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) ruled that Kennedy's assassination was likely the result of a conspiracy, with: "...a high probability that two gunmen fired at President." No person or organization was identified by the HSCA as being a co-conspirator of Lee Harvey Oswald . Most current theories put forth a criminal conspiracy involving parties as varied as the CIA , the KGB , the American Mafia , the Israeli government , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover , sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , Cuban president Fidel Castro , anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, the Federal Reserve , or some combination of those entities.
