A Guide to the Major Conspiracy Theories
A Fireside Book, Published by Simon & Schuster
November 1993
The single most compelling event in modern American                            history took place on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas, on                            November 22, 1963. In the thirty years since the murder                            of John F. Kennedy, a staggering number of conspiracy                            theoriesfrom the preposterous to the plausiblehave                            appeared, confirming, denying, contradicting, and debunking                            one another.
WHO SHOT JFK? is designed so the reader can question                            and understand the events and controversy around the                            assassination, and sort through contradictory theories:
» Did Lee Harvey Oswald kill Kennedy? Did he act                            alone?
» Was Castro behind the killing? Was it the KGB?
» Were the killers Bay of Pigs exiles and dissidents?
» Were the Minutemen or Neo-Nazis involved in                            the plot?
» What about Jimmy Hoffa, and his friends in the                            mob?
» Was the murder planned or the killer hidden                            by the CIA?
Here, gathered for the first time, are more than 20                            major theories along with their evidence. WHO SHOT                            JFK? critiques the critics, separates speculation                            from substantial evidence and hearsay from direct testimony,                            and allows the reader to decide who really pulled the                            trigger.
SAYS EDDIE Now out of print, this is a real collector's item. I                            worked it as project editor and art designer, grafting                            a pop-art comic book style onto the material while trying                            to balance irreverencethe only way to approach                            some of these theorieswith a zeal for veracity                            when it came to the serious stuff. The finished book                            isn't going to change anyone's take on the murder, but                            it provides an efficient way of understanding all the                            axes that have been ground over the years, who's been                            grinding them, and why. It's political science as murder                            mystery.
The image of New Orleans mafia boss Carlos Marcello                            is a fantastic example of the artwork that Mark                            Zingarelli provided. Mark came in thinking he'd                            do a couple dozen spot illos, and ended up churning                            out close to 100 illustrations. He really put his heart                            into it.
 
Moments after                    the assassination, the FBI detained four suspects whose presence                    in Dealey Plaza has haunted many conspiracy buffs ever since.                    One suspect was Eugene Brading, a California con-man with active                    associations among the Dallas Mob, and a reputed courier for                    Carlos Marcello. Three exceptionally well-dressed tramps were also picked up in the railroad yards behind the plaza.                    Critics have had a field day attempting to identify these men.                    Some candidates have included Maj. Gen. Edward Lansdale, former                    Saigon station chief for the CIA and an architect of the Bay                    of Pigs invasion; the mysterious Raoul, said by                    James Earl Ray to have masterminded the death of Martin Luther                    King; E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis, who have gone to court                    to successfully clear their names of this charge; and a wide                    assortment of Dallas mobsters, and French and American intelligence                    operatives. One small-time Dallas hood, Charles Harrelson,                    father of Cheers actor Woody Harrelson, has even confessed                    to the murder of JFK.
