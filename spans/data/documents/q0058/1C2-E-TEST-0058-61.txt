THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
The assassination of John F. Kennedy is one of the most controversial and debated topics in American History. November 22, 1963, the day that JFK was assassinated, is a day that will live in infamy in the mind of every American. It is not certain why Kennedy was murdered, or who actually murdered him. Speculations as to who murdered the president first lead to Lee Harvey Oswald. The Warren Commission, appointed by president Lyndon B. Johnson was established to determine who killed JFK and why. In the eyes of many Americans, the Warren Commission failed to come to an accurate conclusion. The biggest slip up that the  Commission made was disregarding key eyewitness reports that they considered to be incompatible, inconsistent and were contrary to their lone psychotic assassin theory.
There is strong evidence to support that there was more than one shooter on the day of the assassination. As President Kennedyâ€™s motorcade turned left onto Elm Street, a series of gunshots rang out. Kennedy was struck twice and Governor Connally once. But where did the gunfire come from? According to the official report from the Warren Commission, all three shots came from the sixth story of the Texas School Book Depository. Thus the Commission surmised that one person, namely Oswald, had been completely responsible. But the Commission ignored the opinions of experts as well as eyewitness accounts and the sounds coming from police radios. Data that supports the involvement of the Mafia suggests that the Mob was involved in the murder of JFK as a result of his brother, Robert Kennedyâ€™s crime busting. It is also believed that Castro, with strong motives, ordered Kennedy to be killed as a result of U.S. Cuban affairs. Strong evidence supports the idea that the CIA was behind the murder of its own president, as a result of JFKâ€™s unethical decisions (regarding what?). Thus, support (form experts in the field????) has been generated to maintain that Oswald was not the only person involved in the killing of John F. Kennedy. Contrary to popular belief that Oswald was the â€œlone gunmanâ€ and mastermind behind the JFK assassination, there is much evidence to support that the findings of the Warren Commission were indeed wrong.
Eyewittness accounts and acoustic evidence also contribute to the provability that the there was more than one shooter. Evidence that was presented by witnesses (that said what in sum?) to the commission was disregarded because it contradicted their theory of one shooter. Additionally, it was scientifically proven with more than a 95% certainty that there were four shots fired from two different locations. The proof was found in a recording captured on the radio traffic of the Dallas Police Department. These radios were in the possession of police officers who were situated close to the motorcade and adjacent to a railroad yard and a grassy knoll. The first two gunshots could be heard faintly in the distance; however, the third was noticeably louder and presumably fired closer to where the officers were stationed. Experts analyzed the recordings and came to a mutual conclusion. In December of 1963, two of the expert investigators, Mark Weiss and Ernest Aschkenasy, testified before the House Assassination Committee. In their conclusion Professor Weiss stated that â€œwith the probability of ninety-five percent or betterâ€ the third shot came from the grassy knoll (Arnold 189). Furthermore, several innocent bystanders also confirmed that gunfire came from the grassy knoll. These witnesses included six railroad workers who confirmed reports of smoke being seen in the area surrounding the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting stopped (Scheim 40). Additionally, several onlookers heard the sharp crack of a rifle report behind them as they observed the Presidentâ€™s motorcade. Perhaps the most compelling account is the description given by Senator Ralph Yarborough who rode in the motorcade a few cars behind President Kennedyâ€™s limousine. The Senator stated that after driving by the grassy knoll â€œyou could smell gun powder on our car nearly all the way to Parkland Hospitalâ€ (Scheim 40).
Along with the evidence of audio, a video captured by Abraham Zapruder documented this moment in history (did the video contribute evidence? Let us know why you are bringing this up and if it is important, this shouldnâ€™t be the first time it is introduced). Many people believe that there was no possible way that Oswald had time to fire all four shots, therefore there must have been a second shooter. The disproval of the â€œsuperbulletâ€ (was this something suggested by the Commision?) theory helps to prove that one bullet could not have killed JFK as well as hit Senator Connally. The bullet would have had to hit President Kennedy in the neck, from the front, and then hit Connally through the back, chest, wrist, and thigh. This theory is impossible according to the Zapruder film.  The film shows a definite delay between the wounding of the two men. It was physically impossible to get three well-aimed shots off in less than five seconds, because it takes 2.5 seconds for one shot (cite your source). Less than 2.5 seconds elapsed between the first and second and the second and third shots. One assassin could not shoot three shots at a man in a limousine, traveling at 11.2 mph, in under five seconds. This is evidence that there had to be a second gunman present.  This does not support the Commisionâ€™s theory of the â€œlone gunmanâ€, known as Oswald. This film also shows that there is plausible reason to believe there was a conspiracy. This film was shot with a 8mm movie camera that filmed 18.3 frames per second.  Zapruder was located on a concrete platform extending from the grassy knoll. The Zapruder film implies that the first shot was fired right before frame 204. It is known that the President was shot before frame 204 because his wife turned sharply toward him at 204.  It would not have been possible for Oswald, who was in the sixth story to have shot at the President at this time. A large oak tree blocked the assassins view between frames 166-210; therefore there must have been another shooter in another position. The Zapruder film implies that there is indeed a second gunman, according to the evidence and reaction of Jacqueline Kennedy at frame 204; therefore the Commission disregarded concrete evidence suggesting a second shooter, which implies that there may have been a conspiracy.
Now that it has been proven that there was more than one assassin, there are several theories as to who could have murdered the president that contradict the verdict of the Warren Commission. While not all of these theories could have been true simultaneously, there is strong evidence to support each one, which will be reviewed below. There is reason to believe that one of the conspiracies involved with the assassination of Kennedy is in fact true. The question though, is not which one is correct; rather the point is that more than one person was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.
The first conspiracy, that is logically plausible, shows that the Mafia had obvious reason to kill Kennedy. Strong evidence of the mafiaâ€™s motives supports that there could have undoubtedly been mob involved in the killing of the president. Robert Kennedy, the brother of John and also the attorney general at this time, dated a known mobstersâ€™ girlfriend. Robert also tried to get one of the biggest court cases in the history of the U.S. put upon the mob.  In order to get back at him, they killed his brother, JFK.  Later, they killed him when he was going to run for President.  The mobâ€™s involvement is also supported by Jack Rubyâ€™s killing of Oswald subsequent to the assassination. The common link between the assassination of President Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald was Jack Ruby, the man who killed Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police Department Headquarters. Ruby was a nightclub with strong ties to organized crime (Scheim 299). Although Ruby claimed that he killed Oswald out of anger and frustration for killing Kennedy, facts and data prove otherwise. Jack Ruby had heavy involvement in the mafia and in the first week of November, he attended meetings in New Orleans, New York, Chicago, and Miami. These locations that Ruby went to just happened to be the four key Mafia bases. As time went on, Rubyâ€™s meetings shifted to Dallas, where he knew the motorcade would be approaching. Rubyâ€™s out of state call records to specified mafia locations increased 25 times the amount of his regular calls on the morning of the assassination. To make sure Oswald was kept silent, Ruby shot him at close range with a .38 caliber pistol, a typical mafia weapon. This trail of silent clues supports the idea that the Mafia was involved with the assassination of JFK.
Another conspiracy, which is also ideal and logical, supports that the CIA was responsible for the murder of its countryâ€™s own president. It is a plausible prospect that the CIA, with the help of Cuban exiles, was involved in the assassination of Kennedy.  The CIA was mad at President Kennedy because he said, "Something very bad is going on within the CIA and I want to know what it is. I want to shred the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter them to the four winds."(Kennedy). The CIA believed that Kennedy posed a major threat to the security of the nation. Furthermore, President Kennedy was determined to remove all United States military personnel from Vietnam, effectively ending U.S. involvement in Asia. This intended move worried the CIA in addition to several large companies providing armaments for the war effort. The CIA felt that while the ending of the war may have economic implications, having no visible military presence in the Far East would leave American interests vulnerable. The CIA was resolute to reverse the Presidentâ€™s plan no matter what the cost.
Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the CIAâ€™s involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy was the quick reversal of Kennedyâ€™s policies by Lyndon B. Johnson, the man who followed John F. Kennedy in the Presidency. Whether for political reasons or for self-preservation, President Johnson both supported the Warren Commissionâ€™s findings and reversed the course of Kennedyâ€™s Vietnam policy (Newman). Perhaps Johnson feared for his life and would not oppose the still effective power of the CIA (Prouty 326).
Addionally, prior to the assassination, in August through October of 1962, the CIA met with the President and his advisors to attempt to change his intentions in Vietnam. When President Kennedy refused to negotiate with the intelligence community, the stage was set for his assassination. In outrage, it is reasonable to believe that the CIA would want the President eliminated. The CIA had another reason to kill Kennedy, it was fused as a result of the invasion of the â€œBay of Pigsâ€ on April 18, 1961. The CIA tried to overthrow Castro by themselves.  They landed on the shore and were defeated.  Kennedy had told them that the U.S. would have no part in this invasion, even though he had ships just off the shore. The CIA blamed the defeat on the President for not helping them. After the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, Kennedy changed his mind about an invasion, earning the hatred of the Cuban exile community. The House Select Committee on Assassinations believed evidence existed implicating certain violent Cuban exiles in Kennedy's murder. These exiles worked closely with CIA operatives in violent activities against Castro's Cuba. When JFK shut down the U.S. resistance to Castro, both the CIA and the Cuban exiles were angered. They were again given a motive to kill the President.
Evidence that also disputes the â€œlone-gunmanâ€ theory is that Fidel Castro had President Kennedy shot. In October 1962 Kennedy faced the most serious international crisis of his administration. Aerial photographs proved that Soviet missile bases were being built in Cuba. Declaring this buildup a threat to the nations of the Western hemisphere, Kennedy warned that any attack by Cuba would be regarded as an attack by the Soviets and the United States would retaliate against the Soviet Union.  Kennedy also imposed quarantine on ships bringing offensive weapons to Cuba in response to this. The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred soon after this, when Castro had missiles pointed at the U.S.   Kennedy did not like this, and decided to force Castro to disarm himself and Cuba. Angered by this series of events, Castro would have easily been given reason to want Kennedy to be dethroned. The anti-Castro rebellion as well as the Bay of Pigs invasion, supported by the U.S., gave Castro motive to kill Kennedy. If Castro could defeat the President of the U.S., Cuba would no longer be under such constraints.
Evidence from the autopsy performed on Kennedy directly after his murder shows evidence that the bullets that were supposedly shot from Oswaldâ€™s gun could not have been the only shots fired. There are several speculations as to how the first bullet struck Kennedy.  The medical analysis of JFK provides that the shot that hit Kennedy in the head came from the front of the motorcade, and not the back where Oswald was perched. The back of Kennedy's head was almost completely blown out, clearly implying that a shot from the back was not the only shot fired. A small wound in Kennedy's throat was diagnosed an entrance wound, proving a shot from the front, and not from the Sniper's Nest behind Kennedy.  Parkland doctors, knowing there was a conspiracy, have feared to speak out. Only one doctor has addressed the issue and confirmed that the President's body was altered between Parkland Hospital and the autopsy at Bethesda. Dr. Charles Crenshaw, who performed the autopsy at the Parkland Hospital, proves that alteration to the body was made before later autopsies. In his book, Conspiracy of Silence, Crenshaw claims
â€œFrom the damage I saw, there was no doubt in my mind that the  bullet had entered his head through the front, and as it surgically  passed through his cranium, the missile obliterated part of the  temporal and all the parietal and occipital lobes before it lacerated  the cerebellum.â€(Crenshaw, Conspiracy of Silence, 86)
If the bullet had come from behind Kennedy, how could the back of his head maintain an exit wound? Had Oswald been on the sixth floor of the Book Depository behind the Motorcade, how could his bullet hit Kennedy from the front? Clear medical evidence supports that there must have been another shooter in front of the motorcade near the location of the grassy knoll. The question at hand became: why was the Kennedyâ€™s body tampered with? The clear and obvious answer to this question was that someone needed to cover up the assassination. Lyndon Johnson called the operating room where Oswald was being treated and demanded a confession be extracted from the accused assassin. What other reason was there for Johnson to make this call if the government didnâ€™t have something to cover up?
As a result of the aforementioned evidence, there is strong confirmation to support that Lyndon B. Johnson, hungry for power and blood, ordered the killing of JFK. LBJ was involved in several scandals and was charged with several crimes. He found out that there was a possibility that he would be removed from the ballot of JFK. LBJ was given reason to fight back, and go as far as to kill the president to give himself supreme power. As soon as the assassination occurred, Johnson appointed the Warren Commission to come to a hasty conclusion on the case. Johnson was quoted as wanting the case closed as soon as possible. Johnson obviously did not want there to be any chance of thoughts of conspiracy. He was the one that appointed the committee and he needed to cover something up that was bothering him. Since he now had supreme power over the nation, Johnson had the ability to make sure that he would not be caught red handed. He also wanted to make it certain that the American people were convinced that Oswald acted alone. LBJ also tried to manipulate the positioning and people that were in each of the cars. He convinced John Connally to ride in the car with JFK instead of sitting next to the President himself; this would ensure his own safety.  LBJ also had involvement with CIA agent William Harvey, who was angered at JFK for demoting him after Harveyâ€™s attempt to poison Castro. Angered Harvey had easy access to LBJ and stated that he had dreams of becoming director of the CIA and LBJ could do that for him if he were president. It is more than plausible to think that LBJ was involved in the shooting the president.
The theory that American people read about is the theory that Lee Oswald shot Kennedy from the Texas School Book Depository.  There is valuable information suggesting that this theory is not true.  Many witnesses say that the shot sounded as if it was back behind them on the grassy knoll, and not just the Depository.  The American people are lead to believe that there were three shots fired from Oswaldâ€™s gun, which could not have been possible. All theories that support the â€œlone gunmanâ€ base their evidence on the Warren Commission, and nobody looks beyond the Warren Commissionâ€™s decision.  They think they are being told the truth, and therefore believe it. After Kennedyâ€™s assassination and despite the overwhelming evidence of multiple shooters, the news reports spoke only of Oswald as the lone assassin. This lack of information to the public was the innovation of the murderer in their attempt to cover-up the facts, This cunningly constructed plot was carefully monitored by skilled agents who controlled certain key facets of the government, the Warren Commission, and the news media. This activity caused J. Lee Rankin, the commissionâ€™s general counsel to say, â€œPart of our difficulty in regard to the assassination in that they have decided that it is Oswald who committed the assassination. They have decided that on one else was involvedâ€ (Prouty 301).
The commission stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter.  They denied ever hearing or thinking that there could have been a second gunman, even though there is evidence that there was someone on the grassy knoll behind the picket fence. With respect to the strong evidence for the aforementioned conspiracies, it is plausibly argumentative that Oswald was not the only man involved with the assassination. There is definitive support that another shooter, possibly under the influence of an organization such as the CIA or the Mafia, was involved or behind the killing of the President. They had to quiet Oswald or he was going to talk and reveal who was really involved. So who was really behind it?  This is a question that the world will never know the real answer to, but there is proof as well as eyewitness accountability to support that there was more than one shooter, and motives to establish reason for their involvement. Through acoustical, video, and medical evidence, it is beyond doubt that the Warren Commission was wrong in their findings, and that conspiracy was undeniably correct.
