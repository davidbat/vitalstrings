Grassy Knoll
Heather Carr
Many witnesses claim they heard shots coming from the grassy knoll on the north side of Elm Street.  The trees on the grassy knoll were much smaller then, so Kennedy's assassin would have had to stand in the full sunlight.  A storm drain on the other side of Elm Street had a mark on it that day that many say was created by a ricocheting bullet.  The grassy knoll is on the same side of Elm Street as the Texas School Book Depository and Elm Place, but nearer the overpass.  The grassy knoll affords a clear view of the length of Elm Street.
