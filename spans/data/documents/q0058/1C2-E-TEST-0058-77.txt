JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theories

JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theories, JFK's mistress killed by CIA, book claims--- The most recent book to come out concerning former president John F. Kennedy revolves mostly around his mistress, Mary Pinchot. The new conspiracy theory suggests that JFK and his mistress were both murdered by the CIA.
Mary Pinchot was shot and killed execution style on Oct. 12, 1964 in broad daylight. The man originally suspected of killing her was eventually released due to eyewitness testimony, and the murder has since remained unsolved.
In his new book titled “Mary’s Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision of World Peace,” author Peter Janney has suggested that both JFK and his mistress were murdered in attempt to secure foreign power.
Janney links Pinchot to the infamous Timothy Leary, who was a Harvard professor and LSD advocate. Revealing that the two were close friends, Janney then suggests that JFK was deeply in love with Pinchot and that the two were involved in doing drugs together.
According to Janney, drug usage altered the president’s perception of war, making him question America’s role in the Cold War, which intervened with other agencies’ agendas.
“Like others before him, Janney posits that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of a CIA plot to eliminate the only man in the way of the agency’s total control over U.S. foreign policy,” the Huffington Post wrote in a book review.
