JFK Deathbed Confessions To Be Shown On Conspiracy Theory
November 19, 2010, By Freddie in TV Shows
The much awaited JFK deathbed confession is scheduled to be aired on TruTV’s, Conspiracy Theory program. This is the episode that most of the viewers around the US were waiting for, because the John F. Kennedy assassination has been one of the most debated topic’s in American history.
There have been numerous conspiracy theories revolving around the country in context to the JFK assassination, but even though the government and the authorities have come to a conclusion and have provided the citizens the explanation, some people in America still tend not believe it. In the show, Gov. Jesse Ventura would be discussing about the assassination, the truth and the credibility behind it.
Before the second season of Conspiracy Theory had commenced on TV, in an interview, Ventura had stated that he would be showing the world the deathbed confession of the late John F. Kennedy. It would be really exciting to see whether the claims of Mr. Ventura do carry some thought and weight, or whether it would just be another question that will remain unanswered to the American people.
