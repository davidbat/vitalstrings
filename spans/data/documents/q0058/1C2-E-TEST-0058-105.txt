New book uses JFK assassination to explore conspiracy theories
MILWAUKEE – The assassination of President John F. Kennedy is the backdrop of a new book that explores how to approach conspiracy theories. JFK Assassination Logic: How to Think about Claims of Conspiracy, by John McAdams , associate professor of political science at Marquette University, focuses on using logic and reason to assess conspiracy theories.
JFK Assassination Logic  addresses various conspiracy theories about Kennedy’s assassination and explores the evidence, eyewitness accounts, government agencies, relationships and profiles, to deconstruct and assess the validity of the theories. “I’m not interested in telling people what happened, as most lone assassin books do, or in mobilizing evidence that contradicts the Warren Commission, as most conspiracy books do,” McAdams said. “I’m interested in giving examples of how to sort through the key issues and contradictory evidence.”
Using these examples, McAdams hopes to provide readers with a blueprint for understanding how conspiracy theories arise and how to evaluate evidence and information used in competing theories.
McAdams teaches American politics, public opinion and voter behavior in Marquette’s Department of Political Science. He previously taught at Harvard University, where he also earned his Ph.D. in 1981. McAdams has written articles for various journals, including American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, Sociological Quarterly, and Law and Contemporary Problems.
