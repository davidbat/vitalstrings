I find that after every Gym session or running session, that i could curl up in a ball and have a long deep sleep.
I go to the gym virtually every day monday to friday, and go running one day each weekend too. I do a mix of exercise over the week. Usally running, then weight, Pilates, Running and then running again. And then out door running at weekend.
I have read running magazines and everything to help me out. I eat a poached egg on muffin at breakfast, 2 hours before the gym ill have a glass of water and a tracker bar, an hour before the gym ill have a coffee with one sugar, a bannana and a glass of water, then i come out the gym having chicken noodle soup and a wholemeal bread roll.
I've checked with the doctor to see if it was anemia, and thats fine. I just want to find more energy in my body, any suggestions where im going wrong???
