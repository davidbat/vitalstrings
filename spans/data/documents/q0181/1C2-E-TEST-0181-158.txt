Tiredness and fatigue is very common in people who have diabetes because the main source of energy in the body is glucose, and in order for glucose to get into the cells, you need insulin. And people with diabetes either don't have enough insulin, or they're very resistant, their cells are resistant to the insulin. Whether you don't have enough insulin or whether your cells are resistant to insulin, the glucose, the sugar doesn't get into the cells. This leads to deprivation of energy in the cells and this leads to tiredness and fatigue.
