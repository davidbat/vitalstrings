So why exactly does Accutane make you so tire?? And why do my heals hurt? that is kind of wierd to me.   I looked all over the Internet to find out exactly why Accutane causes you to be tired and I have came up with absolutely nothing.. Im wondering if id be tired during the day as well if I wasnt taking my Adderall for ADD in the morning. I think I notice the extreme tiredness later in the day when the Addy wheres off.. Anyways does anyone know exactly why Accutane make you tired.
U sure its not the adderall making you tired.  I know I feel like shit when I come down from it.
On the otherhand I have heard a lot of complaints about tane tireding you out, maybe try taking more adderall.  jk:)
