I haven't been tired at all. I also haven't had a hard time going to sleep at night, thank goodness. I don't feel a huge burst in energy but I don't feel like I want to lay down or take a nap or anything. I was just telling my hubby how nice it has been.
I agree with Naomi, try taking a multi vitamin. Also, try Chromium Picolinate. It doesn't necessarily have an immediate effect but once it builds up it is great. It is supposed to speed up your metabolism and give you energy. I get it at Walgreens, you can probably find it at Wal-Mart or your local pharmacy. 400 mcgs is the average dose. Some say that it can do harm to your body if you take too much. There are threads you can look up about it. I would check them out. Good luck!
