Someone said: I used to get this from when i was 12 to when I was 16 it was horrible. I never found out what it was but it passed when i was older. However I did find that if I was showering and added lots of cold to the mix at the end for a couple of minutes it didnt happen when i got out. Same with baths just empty some water out and add a lot of cold and lie in it for 2 minutes before you get out. For some reason when I was about 16 it stopped happening anymore. I replied to this as I simpethise as when it happened to me i thought I had something really wrong with me. Note however that im not a doctor or anything im just speaking from experience.

Someone said: I get very faint when I take warm showers too.  I haven't had a problem since I turned the temp down.  Put  it as cool as you can stand.
