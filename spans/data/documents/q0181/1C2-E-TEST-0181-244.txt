I've been taking concerta for my adhd for over a week now, started with 18mg and am now up to 54mg. it is very important for me to take for school and it does make it a little easier to concentrate. unfortunately it makes me very nauseous, cold, gives me a long lasting headache and makes me very very sleepy (i believe because it is a methylphenidate). a lot of time i just sit there because i'm feeling too sick to do my work let alone be there for more than 6 hours straight. i've tried a friend's adderall once and it worked great. i've also researched it and feel it's a better drug for me. i heard if you ask your doctor for adderall they won't give it to you, and i don't want to tell my doctor that i've tried it before in fear that i wont get it. how can i get him to prescribe me adderall without outright asking him, or would that be the only way to do it?
"I suggest that you stress over and over how awful concerta made you feel..."
Some professsionals look at ADHD as a brain chemical imbalance, while others treat it as a "psychiatric disorder." It sounds like a tangent but I suffer from major depression and attend a weekly support group for people with depression, bipolar disorder, etc. The first thing I learned is that people can react very differently to psychiatric medications. A med that is very helpful for one person may not have the same effect on someone else.  To find the right drug for a patients is, unfortunately, a matter of trial and error. Your reactions to concerta sound dreadful. However, sometimes it takes the body a while, as much as a month, to adjust to a new medication. Then the side effects lessen or completely disappear and the positive effects of the drugs kick in. That may or may not happen with you and concerta. It could just be the wrong drug for you. Concerta contains methylphenidate, which is a stimulant, so in theory it should NOT make you drowsy. You can check out the side effects at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate The fact that adderall made you feel great once is no guarantee that it will continue to work well for you in the future. It is comprised of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, so some doctors are quite reluctant to prescribe it, especially to children or teens.   Sometimes "it pays to tell the truth." However, if you tell your doctor that you illegally tried a friend's adderall, it will probably upset your doctor quite a bit. Using someone else's medication, especially an amphetamine,  is the last thing doctors want to hear. I suggest that you stress over and over how awful concerta made you feel . You can then add that you have heard or read about the positive effects of adderall. The doc may try adderall or another med for ADHD drugs like vyvanse that may work well.   I have been in your situation with trying friends' drugs a few times. So I am not trying to preach to you. I am actually trying to tell you the best way to get a better medication, whether it is adderall, vyvanse, or whatever. I wish you the best.  By the way, here is a list of meds usually used for ADHD. http://adhd.emedtv.com/adhd/adhd-medications.html

"It worked as it was supposed to..."
Another poster reported that adderall taken first thing in the morning caused sleepiness, but when taken at midmorning snacktime, it worked as it was supposed to .   The sleepiness would be called a paradoxical reaction. You might also try Strattera, if Adderall fails to help you.
