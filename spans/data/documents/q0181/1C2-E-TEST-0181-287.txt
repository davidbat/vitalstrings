    Actually, the algae isn't tiring me. I'm tired of            the people trying to sell it to me. Most blue-green algae is sold in            a multi-level marketing scheme through Cell Tech. Sellers see me, a            physician, as a potentially lucrative franchise to sell algae for them.            So I get two or three sales calls every week (once as many as twenty).            Never mind that selling algae to make myself money is a conflict-of-interest            and an unethical ploy already encouraged by pharmaceutical companies            ("The only solution I see for your diagnosis, Mr. Smith, is blue-green            algae, which I happen to have right here..."). I've tried the algae            and it doesn't do much for me. The cost/benefit ratio is poor. Nevertheless,            in the past three years I've received over 400 phone calls, dozens of            tapes in the mail, and had people barge into my office and home, all            selling algae. One salesperson has continued to call me for almost three            years! So what is blue-green algae and why does it make people so obnoxious?
    I investigated the algae when one of my patients            came in sick after eating some. The patient had symptoms of poisoning            caused by endotoxins or enterotoxins - nausea, vomiting, fever, chills,            malaise. I called the salesman who sold my patient the algae, and he            said these symptoms proved the algae was working, that the patient's            body was ridding itself of toxins. But this patient was a vegetarian,            lived in the country, exercised regularly, and was very healthy before            she ate the algae. Based on the salesman's reasoning, my reaction to            eating algae should have been ten times more nauseating, since I eat            meat, drink city water, live in a moldy home, listen to Lou Reed records,            etc.
    The species of blue-green algae sold by Cell Tech,            scientific name Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, is one of six species of blue-green            algae known to produce toxins. 1 When I searched the scientific literature, most of the information            regarding A. flos-aquae was not about health benefits, but health hazards. 2 A. flos-aquae is the green pond scum that sewage engineers constantly            try to control. It kills fish, livestock, wild animals, and people's            pets. The reason why more people aren't poisoned, one researcher noted,            was the repelling appearance of A. flos-aquae-contaminated water. The            literature is full of ways to eradicate it with chlorine, copper sulfate,            and other compounds. A. flos-aquae proliferates in sewage and other            waters rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. Upper Klamath Lake, where Cell            Tech harvests its algae, is a shallow eutrophied lake full of nitrogen            and phosphorus from animal feces. Klamath Lake lies along a migratory            bird flyway, and large colonies of pelicans poop there year-round in            a protected sanctuary. The August 1995 issue of Vegetarian Times describes            the lake as pretty polluted. Three epidemic fish kills have occurred            there recently, due to algal blooms.
    Toxins may also come from bacterial contaminants.            Pathogenic bacteria luxuriate in water with a slightly basic pH, like            water found in Klamath Lake. 3 The mucilaginous sheath encasing A. flos-aquae and Spirulina spp.            provides a strong anchor for adhering bacteria. Most Spirulina cultivators            recognize this problem and pasteurize their product. 4   Cell Tech substitutes expensive pasteurization with a "heat-sanitize" process. 5 Toxic samples            of A. flos-aquae are frequently infested with gram-negative rod bacteria. 6a
    A. flos-aquae also produces hepatotoxins and neurotoxins.            Some of these are carcinogenic. 6b   Others are acutely lethal. The LD50 of one hepatotoxin, microcystin-LR            is a mere 50 µg/kg, compared to cyanide's LD50 of 10,000 µg/kg. 7   Neurotoxins produced by A. flos-aquae include neosaxitoxin and anatoxin. 8 Anatoxin is a chemical cousin to cocaine. Anatoxins may be the reason            why people eating blue-green algae sometimes feel energized. Some people            also describe being addicted to blue-green algae. Animals are known            to develop a fatal attraction to mats of blue-green algae washed up            on shorelines. 9 Anatoxins            are neurotoxins and eventually destroy brain cells. 10   And contrary to claims by Cell Tech, toxins have been found in            A. flos-aquae coming from Klamath Lake.6, 11 , 12   Cell Tech reportedly tests their algae for these toxins. But in 1984            batches of blue green algae distributed by Cell Tech were found to be            toxic and seized by the FDA. 13   According to a company posting, tests for toxins are run every            other day. 14 Cell            Tech uses a "bio assay" anatoxin test (which means they inject            mice and see if the mice die - PETA are you reading me?).
    Luckily, it seems these toxins rarely arise in Klamath            Lake. But why eat algae with such toxic potential? Spirulina, a blue-green            algae marketed by other companies, never produces anatoxin nor microcystin.            Dry Spirulina contains 66% protein, 15 compared to 63% in dry A. flos-aquae "Alpha Sun." 3   Spirulina contains about the same or more B vitamins than A.            flos-aquae, with the exception of B12. Spirulina also contains more            calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, and chromium            than A. flos-aquae, but less iron, iodine, fluorine, selenium and molybdenum. 16
    Despite these facts, or perhaps because of them,            Cell Tech slams Spirulina as a vastly inferior food. 3   Cell Tech's literature is full of corporate hype. The bogus health claims            made by Cell Tech distributors really make me mad. At last count, A.            flos-aquae has cured over 600 diseases, including Alzheimer's and AIDS.            These claims are creating large expectations in the public. And when            these expectations go unfulfilled, the public may turn cynical and stop            buying not only blue-green algae but all herbal remedies. The algae/herbal            market will crash. (Cell Tech itself is already diversifying its product            line, going into telecommunications.) The Cell Tech distributors will            dash back to their old jobs, and people like myself, who worked with            herbs long before Cell Tech came along, will remain behind to begin            rebuilding the public's faith in herbal medicine.
    Blue green algae is a lot like the Kombucha tea            - of dubious benefit and full of potential danger. But while most Kombucha            is distributed free as an act of caring and love, Cell Tech made $50            million off its algae last year, and 54¢ of every dollar's worth of            algae goes to sellers as a commission. 3   I realize this article may anger some people distributing blue-green            algae. I'm sorry. But I hope they'll stop asking me to buy and sell            the stuff.
Epilogue
    The above article was published in a local publication,            the Vermont Alternative Medicine Newsletter. A mere three days after            mailing the newsletter around Vermont, I received a nasty phone call            from Cell Tech in Oregon. Cell Tech makes Super Blue-Green Algaeª (SBGA),            and they didn't like my article. They rudely assumed I was "paid            off by the Spirulina people." They refused to believe that I wrote            the article on my own, for nothing. The concept of doing something for            free seemed very foreign to them (although Cell Tech does understand            tax write-offs, from which they generate hype about corporate humanitarianism).            Cell Tech has paid people to write propaganda for them, and they have            paid off critics to stop writing. Needless to say, they haven't paid            me off yet!
    Christian Drapeau, Cell Tech's Director of Research,            sent me a letter saying I "obviously lacked the scientific training            and background necessary to correctly interpret the scientific literature            that is available on blue-green algae." The arrogance! I've published            more research in the scientific literature than Drapeau has; I've probably            published more articles than Cell Tech's entire research department.            The point of my article on SBGA was not whether SBGA has scientific            nutritional value. It most certainly does (albeit at a terrible cost-to-benefit            ratio). My article took issue with the greedy misconduct of Cell Tech            distributors, spewing their half-truths and lies to generate sales commissions.
    Drapeau missed my point. Instead he vigorously denied            that Cell Tech's algae have ever produced toxins in Klamath Lake. For            every scientific publication stating the species has produced toxins,6, 11 , 12 Drapeau devised some contradictory flim-flam defense. On several occasions            he even contradicted himself. Drapeau did correct me on one point: the            FDA never seized algae produced by Cell Tech. The FDA seized algae sold            by Victor Kollman, Cell Tech's predecessor. After Kollman was busted            for fraud, his brother, Daryl, took over the algae business and Daryl            created Cell Tech and its cult of personality.
    I received several pro-algae letters from Vermonters;            100% were Cell Tech distributors. Nobody wrote a positive note who didn't            have a vested interest in Cell Tech. I heard from six people with bad "algae stories," who suffered many side effects after taking            SBGA, including nausea, vomiting, chills, fever, anxiety, psychosis,            and even hepatitis.
    Since the printing of my article I've seen other            authors issue warnings about blue green algae in Scientific American,            Vegetarian Times, Natural Health, and Prevention. Are they all just            crying sour grapes because Daryl Kollman is a millionaire? I think not.            It seems SBGA, like many species of blue green algae, is encased by            a mucilaginous sheath, which provides a strong anchor for adhering bacterial            contaminants. One such bacterium associated with blue green algae is            Legionella pneumophila, the cause of Legionnaires disease. 17 Another bad bug, Vibrio cholerae, can actually live inside blue green            algae. 18 , 19   Drinking V. cholerae-contaminated            water causes cholera, if the bacteria survives passage through the stomach.            Protection within algae may aid the bacteria's passage through the gastric acid barrier. 20 Algal            protection also allows bacteria to survive in aquatic conditions that            would normally kill them. McCarthy & Khambaty 21 suggest this is how cholera spread from Bangladesh to Latin            America - first V. cholerae attached to algae in polluted Bangladesh            water, then cargo ships took on the algae-infested water as ballast,            sailed to Peru and Mexico, discharged their ballast, the cholera reverted            to an infectious state, and started a New World epidemic. Ships are            now required to discharge their ballast on the high seas to reduce the            possibility of introducing pathogens into U.S. coastal waters.
    I'm not saying Cell Tech sells algae contaminated            by Legionella pneumophila or Vibrio cholerae. But has anyone looked            for these organisms? Both are extremely difficult to isolate in vitro. 19 According to Epstein, 22 algae-disseminated disease will increase on a global scale due to global            warming. Like Cell Tech's propaganda, Epstein sees blue-green algae            looming large over the 21st century. But Epstein is not happy about            it.
