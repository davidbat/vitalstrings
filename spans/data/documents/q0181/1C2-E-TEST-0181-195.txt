I will ask her about her diet. She told me she's eating though, cos she needs the energy to go to gym.
Should she up her dose of clen?? That sounds risky.
no, 60 mcg is plenty for a woman. The fatigue is directly related to her diet or training, it has to be. Tell her to do things like cycle her carbs, drink some coffee during the day, etc etc.
