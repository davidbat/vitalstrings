Freedom from Nicotine
A support classroom to stop smoking, quit oral tobacco and break free from NRT
Freedom is an open nicotine dependency recovery forum where 100% of the group's posts and materials are available to all, regardless of membership. A single-minded program, those applying for posting privileges must have quit all forms of nicotine delivery cold turkey within the past 30 days, without use of any products, pills, e-cigarettes or procedures, and remained 100% nicotine-free for at least 72 hours.  A nicotine-free forum, any nicotine relapse - even one puff, dip or chew - permanently revokes posting privileges.
