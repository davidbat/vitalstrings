The two most biologically "expensive" organs to run are, in order, the brain and the intestines.  When you are digesting a large meal, a lot of the body's blood supply is diverted to around the intestines, both to carry the necessary oxygen to the tissues, and to pick up nutrients passed through into the body.  This leaves your limbs feeling a bit heavy, and your brain (without as much of an oxygen supply, as it has been temporarily diverted) a bit sleepy.
EDIT: "Breathing more" does not matter, given that we have a finite number of red blood cells to carry oxygen, and the location of those red blood cells is what changes.
