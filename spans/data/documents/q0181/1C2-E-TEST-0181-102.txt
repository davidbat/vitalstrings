Why does the weather make you feel tired?
ok so it is all dull and stormy now - my mum is asleep now and before she went to bed she said she had to sleep because the weather is making her tired [this happens a lot when it is cold, grey and wet out]
but also when it is hot and sunny out it makes me feel sleepy
why can weather conditions affect you like this - especially as it is not always the same type of weather?
