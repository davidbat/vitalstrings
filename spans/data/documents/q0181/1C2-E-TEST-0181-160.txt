makes sense.. why do you think ppl suggest a cup of warm milk at bedtime to help you sleep?
and the fact that babies fall asleep after drinking a bunch of milk supports that too.. =]
what's weirder is that I find multi-vitamins make me sleepy, so i put off taking them sometimes.. EmerGen-C gives me energy, but yet when i take b-vitamins in pill form i get sleepy... really weird
personally, i'm lactose intolerant AND i'm allergic to casein protein so i can only drink milk in small portions unless i want congested sinuses.. =(
