keep up with the running- quickest way to lose weight and you see results too.
no junk or snack foods. keep it natural. plenty of water, and dont skip meals.
try an anti-stretchmark cream. after about 4 weeks stretch marks appear lighter. or bio-oil is supposed to very good. try it.

Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?
$16.23
In his most powerful book since What’s So Amazing About Grace? and The Jesus I Never Knew, Philip Yancey explores the intimate place where God and humans meet in Prayer. Polls reveal that 90 percent of people pray. Yet prayer, which should be the most nourishing and uplifting time of the believer’s day, can also be frustrating, confusing, and fraught with mystery.Writing as a fellow pilgrim, Yancey probes such questions as: *Is God listening? *Why should God care about me? *If God knows everything, what’s the point of prayer? *Why do answers to prayer seem so inconsistent? *Why does God sometimes seem close and sometimes seem far away? *How can I make prayer more satisfying?Yancey tackles the tough questions and in the process comes up with a fresh new approach to this timeless topic. ‘I have learned to pray as a privilege, not a duty, ‘ he says, and he invites you to join him on this all-important journey.

$19.99
Underactive thyroid conditions are epidemic in this country. Dr. Berglund decided to write this book after seeing countless patients come to him after another doctor&rsquo;s lab testing showed their thyroid to be fine. Yet a thorough history and examination revealed many of the symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism or low thyroid. Berglund believes we have become too dependent on lab tests alone to validate normal thyroid function. And if your thyroid is running too low, you can eat perfectly and take tons of vitamins and still feel sick. The hormones are there, but the function just isn&rsquo;t. In this book you&rsquo;ll learn the truth about thyroid problems that your doctor may not be telling you, such as:The typical treatment of low thyroid includes using a synthetic thyroid hormone replacement (T4) but does not provide for the other, more active hormone, T3.Traditional thyroid medications can actually lead to the thyroid gland becoming less productive.In some cases, low thyroid doesn&rsquo;t show up on lab tests.Are you interested in getting healthy again or in getting your energy back? If so, this book will teach you the signs and symptoms to help you discover if your thyroid might be the key to unlocking your health potential.&#160;
