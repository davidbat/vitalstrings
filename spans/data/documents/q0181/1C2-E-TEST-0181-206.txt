Why does alcohol makes me tired the next day?
I drank about 120ml of red wine last night at 2.30AM to help me get to sleep. And I woke up naturally at 8:00AM. I felt fine in the morning but I started feeling tired around lunch time so I drank some coffee to wake me up.
Normally after a cup of coffee, I feel awake and energetic but today no matter how much coffee I drank, I just felt tired as if caffeine wasn't doing anything on me. And after drinking coffee, I started feeling even worse than before. I literally felt like a zombie the whole day..
Also, this happens quite frequently as well. Coffee tends to not work the next day I drink alcohol.
Why is this? Is it because alcohol is still in my blood?
I keep hearing that red wine in moderation is good for you but is it really? I only drink once or twice a week at night and it's always red wine. I try to not go over 150ml.
What's the truth? Is red wine much more dangerous than coffee?? Is it better off to quit drinking all together? I'm always cautious when drinking because I'm scared of becoming alcoholic..
I'm 20 y/o BTW and legal age to drink is 18 in Australia.
