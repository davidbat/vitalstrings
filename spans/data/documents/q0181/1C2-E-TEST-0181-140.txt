It may not be the hydroxycut that is making you tired. It’s those children. Also did you talk to the doctor before you started taking it so soon after having a baby, I would. Are you breastfeeding, this also makes you alittle tired.Make sure that when eating right you are also thinking about the fact that your schedule probably isn’t normal. When my son was 6 weeks old, he wan’t sleeping through the night, this could have alot to do with it.Good luck ,and congrats on the new baby.
