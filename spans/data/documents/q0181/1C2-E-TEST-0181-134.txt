Since going low carb, I have seemed to become even more sensitive to carbs like bread, potatoes and other starches. They do make me doze off.
I don't count carbs but after my diabetic team showed me the amounts and sizes, etc. i generalized to say a pork chop or a fillet of fish, or 6 chunks of beef, with 1 baked potato, or 1 and 1/2 cup of rice, and salad, or vegetables, and a bread bun with maybe 1 tsp of margarine.  Basically that's my supper.
As for exercising, i hurt my heel on my gym walker and it is taking a while to recover -- better every week.  So my exercising is mild walking.  The naps are getting far and few between, and i am developing some expertise in lowering my bg's.  Last average 6.2 in 3 months.  Sometimes i do feel tired though and get an irresistable urge to nap for 30 min.
What do you eat for supper?
