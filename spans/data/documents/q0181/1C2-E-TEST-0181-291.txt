Question: Why Am I So Tired After Long Runs?
"I'm training for a marathon and after I finish my long runs on Saturdays, I'm so exhausted. I need to take a nap during the day, go to bed early, and still feel tired the next day. Is it normal to be so tired after a long run?"
Answer: Yes, it's normal to be a little tired after a long run. You've expended a lot of energy and put a lot of physical demands on your body. Sleep is part of the recovery process, so it's definitely important to rest when your body is telling you to.
However, if you feel as if you're sleeping away your entire weekend, here are a few things to keep in mind:
Make sure you're eating properly, especially after your runs. After running, especially a long run, you want to replenish energy as quickly as possible. Muscles are most receptive to rebuilding glycogen (stored glucose) stores within the first 30 minutes after exercise. If you eat soon after your workout, you can minimize muscle stiffness and soreness, and help reduce your fatigue.
After your runs, you'll want to consume primarily carbs, but don't ignore protein. A good rule of thumb for post-run food is a ratio of 1 gram of protein to 3 grams of carbs. Nutrition bars, such as Clif bars or Power bars, are healthy options. Other examples would be a bagel with peanut butter or a smoothie made with fruit and yogurt. Many runners like to drink chocolate milk after a long run, which also has the right carbs to protein ratio.
Also, keep track of what you're eating and make sure you're following a balanced diet. You may not be getting enough iron or protein .
