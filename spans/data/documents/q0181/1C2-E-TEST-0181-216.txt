Nursing sure made me tired! I used to doze off in the chair while feeding my daughter even after 7 or 8 straight hours of sleep! I think its just the release of the hormones from the milk flowing. Even pumping would make me yawn the whole time I was hooked up!

Nursing can make you very sleepy..the prolactin.  With my son I was soooooo drousy, but with #2 I haven't been as tired.  Keep up your strength with TONS of water , plenty of small protein-packed meals, and exercise ...and sleep, as much as you can with 5 kiddos!

K., I first want to congratulate you on the birth of #5 and secondly on your determination to nurse!  It's not as easy as some people make it look, and it doesn't work for everyone, so kudos to you for not giving up!  I have 4 boys and nursed all of them and can tell you that YES - nursing takes A LOT out of you.  I read that it takes 800 calories a day (from your body ) to produce all that milk.  So hang in there!  You're doing great by still taking your vitamins, just make sure you are eating plenty of protein, fruits and veggies and drink as much water as you can possibly take!  Now with all that said, might I suggest that your tiredness could possibly be compounded because this is your FIFTH child and you are not only caring for your baby's needs, but the needs of all those sisters and their daddy too??  Heaven's girl!  Anyone would be tired taking care of all that!  I just weaned my baby a few weeks ago (he just turned 13 months) and honestly - this was the most exhausting year of my life!  No matter how much sleep I was able to get, I always felt DRAINED!  Go easy on yourself and make sure you are getting enough help to cut down on your stress level - and all will be well!  As tempting as it may be, I don't recommend drinking coffee or any other beverage with caffeine while nursing (or ever for that matter!) as it is such a harmful stimulant for us as adults, and it's the last thing your little baby needs to get from your milk.  Keep up the good work!  My hats off to you for all you are doing for your family!  Good luck!

I nursed both my sons.  I am so glad I did.  The benefits are countless, for them and me.  It always relaxed me.  The reason, I figured, is that when I am nursing, I am holding baby, caressing my baby and it is such a tremendously relaxing experience.  One cannot feel stressed or uptight at all while nursing, that is for certain.  If you can, go with it, if you feel a little tired.  Maybe you could rest for about 15-20 minutes after nursing and you should wake feeling refreshed.  Otherwise, maybe get a cup of coffee and sip that in your favorite rocking chair, while nursing.
La Leche League are the greatest resource for nursing moms and they may even have meetings in your area!  You can get in touch with a rep and she may help you with a suggestion or you can meet other moms.

Yes!  It definitely took alot out of me.  I nursed both of my girls and I would say it took alot out of my body.  I even pumped at work (3 sessions) and would feel drained at the end of the day.  But good for you I hope you continue to breastfeed.  Once my second daughter got to be about 6 months old I started supplementing with formula during the day and breastfeeding during the evenings and noticed a difference in my energy levels.

Totally normal! Your body releases a chemical to relax you (and baby). Close your eyes and ride the sleepy wave while you're nursing- you might even catch a little cat nap. I call these my "nursing naps " and have found that if I can actually completely relax, when we are done nursing I am genuinely refreshed.
I've been nursing 11 months now and have found that this comes and goes. When my daughter was tiny, it seemed to happen alot, now that she's older it doesn't happen so much.

A.Q. answers from   Phoenix   on   December 03, 2009
If you think about all the calories you burn nursing, then it would make sense that it would cause some fatigue .  I want to congratulate you on going this route though.  It is definitely worth it.  When I was nursing, I would drink a glass of OJ after or eat an apple when I was tired.  It worked wonderfully.  Since I shunned Caffeine, coffee was not an option. Good luck.  And just decide to enjoy the "rest" you get every time you sit down with the baby to nurse.

yes, nursing can make you tired!  I know that I completely underestimated how much I needed to eat and drink while nursing.  Try, try and eat and drink more - trust me, you do not need to worry about weight gain at this point!  With five kids, I can only imagine how busy you are so maybe you need to try fast, liquid calories :).  Best of luck and great job for you on trying the breastfeeding!

M.C. answers from   Albuquerque   on   December 04, 2009
I nursed my daugher for 3 months until we both got thrush and kept passing from one to another and I got mastitas and stopped producing milk. However, in those first 3 months nursing did make me tired. It was hard work. Something that seems like it would be so natural is not so. I wish someone would have told me that when I was pregnant as I went into nursing thinking that it would be easy for the both of us. It drains you of energy (and your baby... the reason they usually fall asleep during or after nursing). You need to make sure that you are eating enough as nursing burns about 500 calories and keep water at your side WHILE you are nursing. Drinking the wate will keep you hydrated and you should see an improvement in your tiredness...hope this helps!

J. answers from   Santa Fe   on   December 04, 2009
I was so tired, when I was nursing. I mean it! When I weaned my first one she was 2 years old and nursing only in the morning and in the evening before sleep, and I was pregnant. But I felt a blast of energy! I could run, I could cook, I could be myself ! Nursing took a toll on me, but I am still happy I nursed my older one, and now I am nursing my second one. She is 9 month old, I cannot wait until I wean her, really. I am so tired. Well, just maybe another year...

Nursing makes me exhausted! I used to sleep about 14 hours a day but still not have the energy to cook dinner. I noticed that if I ate protein at every meal and a ton of veggies (like a cup and a half every meal) I felt better. Also drinking at least 4L of water a day helped too.
Keep it up. It is so wonderful. I love bonding with my daughter who is now 11 months. I love the benefits for her too. My husband had swine flu in September and my daughter and I are just fine - not even a cold at 11 months!
