@augustlan :
Also, fatty foods, greasy foods and such make you freaking exhausted. Another fun tip… like surgeons many performance artists do not eat before a show, only small snacks veggies or fruit. Fried chicken is the WORST thing to eat before any task. The fats and carbs both work together to make you comatose.
It’s probably the carbs. Honestly, try switching to ONLY healthy snacks for a week. Raw crunchy foods, fruits, nuts, etc. Cut out ‘white foods’ – white bread, rice, sugar… In a week you’re gonna feel like a fucking superhero.
Bonus with snacks like those, less calories, more energy and a greater physical feeling of satisfaction. If you don’t feel full on them, drink a tall glass of water and wait 20 Minutes before eating anything else. Your stomach needs time to send the ‘I’m full – stop fucking feeding me!’ signal to you brain.
Science!
