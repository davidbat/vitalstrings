It is not just ice cream. Intaking of any food that can increase your blood sugar levels can make you feel drowsy and want to sleep. It is because, when the  blood sugar levels rise after eating ice cream , the body tries to control it by letting the pancreas secrete more insulin. When this happens, the insulin drives one of the protein building blocs called tryptophan to the brain where it is converted to serotonin.
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for ensuring quality sleep. No wonder, you feel sleepy after an ice cream feast.
