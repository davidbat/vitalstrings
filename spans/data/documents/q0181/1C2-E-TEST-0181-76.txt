Why does a peanut butter sandwich and milk make me sleepy?
Q: If I eat a sandwich of peanut butter and drink a cup of cold milk before bedtime, I sleep much better. What ingredient is it that makes me rest better? I know warm milk will work, but I drink it cold.
A: Both peanuts and milk contain Tryptophan.Tryptophan is a precursor of the sleep-inducing substances serotonin and melatonin. This means tryptophan is the raw material that the brain uses to build these relaxing neurotransmitters. Making more tryptophan available, either by eating foods that contain this substance or by seeing to it that more tryptophan gets to the brain, will help to make you sleepy. On the other hand, nutrients that make tryptophan less available can disturb sleep.
