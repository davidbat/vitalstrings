Q: Why do you get sleepy when you read?
A: because you are staring at the same clors-- same text and everything for a long period of time causing your eyes to get drowsy. i am in 7th grade so i dont know if that is true but i made my best guess and is hopig that it is correct.

A: Cause Reading is boring, nahh. If a book doesn't intrest you then it will make you sleepy, or if you are already tired it will make you wanna close your eyes.
