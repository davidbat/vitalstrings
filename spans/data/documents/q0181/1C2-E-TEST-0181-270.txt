Of the three of those, black tea, peppermint tea, and rooibos, with each being from a different plant and only the first having caffeine, the main thing they have in common is that they're generally served hot. Are you drinking these in place of coffee? Could the headaches/sleepiness be a result of caffeine withdrawal, or do you experience them even when you have the same amount of coffee as usual in addition to tea? If the latter, see if there's any difference if you serve the various teas cold.
