My Mood:
Yes, and biologically it should. The hormone, Cortisol, that is released in the body when you are under stress is SUPPOSED to rev up your body in order to prepare you to have what is known as the "flight or flight" response, or any type of action. But, like anything else Cortisol should be moderated... so when you have anxiety disorders you have not had the proper return to normal, body cortisol levels and you remain in that heightened state for excessive amounts of time.
It sucks, but yes... I feel like I have no energy at all most times.
