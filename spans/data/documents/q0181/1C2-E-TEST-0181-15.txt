The main ingredient that people refer to is triptophan.  Other studies seem to conclude that it is not triptophan but the mere fact that a large meal (which we typically eat during the holidays) is what induces fatigue as our bodies want to settle in for a good digestion.
To test this, eat a little turkey (the amount you would normally eat for a non-holiday meal) and keep your daily routine.  I would guess that you will feel the same as you usually do.  Or pay attention to how your body feels after a large meal that does not involve turkey.  I would guess you would feel tired or want to nap or rest.
