tryptophan isn't a sedative in it's self, ie it doesn't make you drowsy, it is a precursur to serotonin, which in turn is neccessary for producing melatonin, which is the regulator of our sleep paterns....that's why we get sleepy after too much Xmas dinner ...

John:  Way to pay attention to the video.
More generally:  They were on the right track when they blamed carbohydrates.  Then they veered off into the Twilight Zone with the calories thing.  Not so much.  I can eat a meal much lower in calories than the typical Thanksgiving meal and if it's still mostly carbohydrate, I get drowsy afterward.  It's a blood sugar spike-and-crash that does it.  If instead you ate the same number of calories in protein and fat, well, first off I don't think you'd be *able* to eat the same number of calories all in one meal (fat triggers true biochemical satiety and protein helps too) and second, you wouldn't get that huge blood sugar spike.  Only thing I can figure is ACS wanted to blunt any "carbs are bad" message by veering back into calorie-blaming.  Yeah, because that's worked so well for preventing obesity and diabetes in the past forty years.  Yawn.
(I like ACS, don't get me wrong, but everybody's got a blind spot or three.)
