Why does eating turkey make you sleepy? Answer…
Ever wonder why you end up taking a nap on your aunt’s sofa after feasting on turkey? People often feel tired after eating Thanksgiving dinner but can we really blame it on the turkey?
According to About.com turkey contains a sleep inducing substance called ﻿L-tryptophan:
Turkey does contain L-tryptophan, an essential amino acid with a documented sleep inducing effect. L-tryptophan is used in the body to produce the B-vitamin, niacin. Tryptophan also can be metabolized into serotonin and melatonin, neurotransmitters that exert a calming effect and regulates sleep. However, L-tryptophan needs to be taken on an empty stomach and without any other amino acids or protein in order to make you drowsy. There’s lots of protein in a serving of turkey and it’s probably not the only food on the table. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
﻿﻿But before you go blaming the turkey consider the four other factors that may lead to your “after-Thanksgiving dinner coma” -  fats, alcohol, overeating and relaxation.
