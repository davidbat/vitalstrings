Why does being out in the sun make you tired?
It was our spring game yesterday, and with it comes a massive tailgate.  I was out in the sun drinking beer from 7:30am till 6pm.  I came home,sobered up and drank lots of water for an hour, and then slept from 7pm till 11am the next day.  After sleeping for 16 hours, I got up, made some food, then took a 2 hour nap.
Id say this was mostly a result of so much sun exposure, because I wasnt hung over at all, and when I went to sleep I was sober and I drank alot of water.
