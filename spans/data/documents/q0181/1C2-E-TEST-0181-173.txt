There is a real difference between making you go to sleep and sleeping well. Studies have shown that alcohol does, indeed, make you go to sleep more quickly, at least if it’s not drunk in excess — it has a natural sedative effect. However, once you are asleep it disrupts what scientists call “sleep architecture” — the pattern of sleep and brain waves that leaves you feeling refreshed in the morning. We need the right balance of REM sleep (dreaming sleep) and non-REM sleep (including deep sleep), and alcohol disturbs this.
“Alcohol can mean that sleep is no longer refreshing, because the brain can’t perform the normal restorative job it does during the night,” says Jessica Alexander, of the Sleep Council, which provides information about sleep and health.
During the first portion of sleep, alcohol drunk within an hour of bedtime increases the proportion of non-REM sleep and decreases the proportion of REM sleep, but it doesn’t greatly disrupt sleeping patterns. The problems come mainly in the second half of sleep, when REM falls off again and sleep becomes more disturbed. People taking part in sleep experiments have reported that they sleep more superficially a few hours into their sleep — and it has been observed that their limb movements increase, their temperature fluctuates, they are more dehydrated and are more likely to awaken from dreams. This may be partly because, in the second half of the night, your body is suffering alcohol-withdrawal symptoms once it has processed the alcohol you put in your bloodstream before going to sleep. It may also be a side-effect of some of the toxins produced by the breakdown of alcohol.
