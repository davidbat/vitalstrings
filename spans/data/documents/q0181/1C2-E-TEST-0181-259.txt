Do allergies make you sleepy?
Every fall this happens.  No matter what my plans, if I get near
some airborne allergic entity, I must sleep.  The keyword here is must. It is as if I have been given a very strong drug that makes me sleep.  I had something yesterday that I wanted to do, but again, I had this uncontrollable urge

to sleep, and sleep I did.  I missed doing what I wanted, and had planned to do.  1) Is this natural?  I seems that it must be, since it happens every fall, and never any other time of the year?  2) Is there anything I can do about this uncontrollable urge
