Yes, I'm taking Biaxin (Clarithromycin)500 mg for 10 days for sinusitis/otitis externa. Today I took my second tablet and got so sleepy so fast..it scared me. I went to the ER to ask if this was expected. The ER Nurse said no - they had never heard of that happening...Then the ER Doc said Biaxin may enhance the "drowsiness" effects of my other meds (Clarinex, Nasonex, Atenolol, Cardura) but he had not heard of that until me. Ok, so glad I found this site. Have not had any of the side effects--yet..I eat before taking it. Going back to sleep now. It's the best rest I've gotten in a while. Thx for sharing you guys!

Oops. just want to be clear that on my previous post, I am taking Biaxin twice a day (1000mg total/day). Started taking them June 26 and went to ER today, June 27. I feel fine but I also am not working this summer. My sleepy/drowsy effects kick in about 10 minutes after I take it. Will check back to report progress over the next 8 days if there are any physical or psychological changes.

I am taking 500 mg of clarithromycin twice a day and pantoprazole 1000mg twice a day for 14 days with panitoprazole for a bacteria infection in my stomach.  I was ok til day  5 except a metalic taste in my mouth. From that day on unbelievable drowzy.  Good thing I am retired never would be able to work.  Today day 12 took meds at 11 p.m. last night fell asleep at 1 a.m. slept til 12 noon today ate some yogart and took the next doze and woke up at 5 p.m. tonight.  It is about doing me in.  I have 4 dozes left can't wait to be finished so I can lead a normal life and sure hope it fixes my stomach ache.  I was diagnosed with H. Pylori.  Glad I found this website to know my sleeping was normal.  Hope my info helps someone else.
