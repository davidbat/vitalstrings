Hysterectomy:
Does Estradiol make you sleepy?
Is there any difference between label and generic on estridol? I'm supposed to switch to estridol, yesterday when I went to pick up my script it was generic. I told the pharmacist I wanted label and I think he thought I was nuts, but I know my Dr. and PA both have said to only use l brand name on hormones. After being on about 3 different estrogens including estratest HS I'm going to go to compounded testostorone and "some form" of estridol. Wish me luck. I really want to feel like ME again.
