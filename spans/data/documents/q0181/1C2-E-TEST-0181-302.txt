Why does Alcohol Make You Hungry?
Glad you asked...
When you've been drinking, the chemicals inside the alcohol are a depressant and tend to slow down body and brain functions and even make you tired.  To fight this feeling, your body starts to crave carbohydrates as a way to raise your blood sugar and to give you more energy.  Now the next time you're drinking and you crave chips or pizza, you'll know why.
