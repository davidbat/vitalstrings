Other herbs/plants containg tryptophan include Oenothera biennis seeds, Helianthus annuus seed, Lablab purpureus , Nasturtium officinale and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus seed and leaf. [22]
[ edit ] Use as a dietary supplement and drug
There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, [23] but for some time, tryptophan has been available in health food stores as a dietary supplement .
Clinical research has shown mixed results with respect to tryptophan's effectiveness as a sleep aid , especially in normal patients. [24] [25] [26] Tryptophan has shown some effectiveness for treatment of a variety of other conditions typically associated with low serotonin levels in the brain. [27] In particular, tryptophan has shown some promise as an antidepressant alone [28] and as an "augmenter" of antidepressant drugs. [28] [29] However, the reliability of these clinical trials has been questioned because of lack of formal controls and repeatability. [30] [31] [32] In addition, tryptophan itself may not be useful in the treatment of depression or other serotonin-dependent moods, but may be useful in understanding the chemical pathways that will give new research directions for pharmaceuticals. [33]
[ edit ] Metabolites
A metabolite of tryptophan, 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), has been suggested as a treatment for epilepsy [34] and depression , although clinical trials are regarded inconclusive and lacking. [35] Since 5-HTP readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and in addition is rapidly decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). [36] However, serotonin has a relatively short half-life since it is rapidly metabolized by monoamine oxidase .[ citation needed ]
Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, there may be a significant risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart. [37] [38]
The primary product of the liver enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase is kynurenine . [11] [39]
It is marketed in Europe for depression and other indications under the brand names Cincofarm, Tript-OH and Optimax (UK). In the United States, 5-HTP does not require a prescription, as it is covered under the Dietary Supplement Act . Since the quality of dietary supplements is now regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , manufacturers are required market products whose ingredients match the labeling, but does not establish efficacy of the product.

[ edit ] Tryptophan supplements and EMS
There was a large tryptophan-related outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome ( EMS ) in 1989, which caused 1,500 cases of permanent disability and at least thirty-seven deaths. Some epidemiological studies [41] [42] [43] traced the outbreak to L-tryptophan supplied by a Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko KK. [44] It was further hypothesized that one or more trace impurities produced during the manufacture of tryptophan may have been responsible for the EMS outbreak. [45] [46] The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce L-tryptophan gave rise to speculation that genetic engineering was responsible for such impurities. [47] [48] However, the methodology used in the initial epidemiological studies has been criticized. [49] [50] An alternative explanation for the 1989 EMS outbreak is that large doses of tryptophan produce metabolites that inhibit the normal degradation of histamine , and excess histamine in turn has been proposed to cause EMS. [51]
Most tryptophan was banned from sale in the US in 1991, and other countries followed suit. Tryptophan from one manufacturer, of six, continued to be sold for manufacture of baby formulas. At the time of the ban, the FDA did not know, or did not indicate, that EMS was caused by a contaminated batch, [52] [53] and yet, even when the contamination was discovered and the purification process fixed, the FDA maintained that L-tryptophan is unsafe. In February 2001, the FDA loosened the restrictions on marketing (though not on importation), but still expressed the following concern:
"Based on the scientific evidence that is available at the present time, we cannot determine with certainty that the occurrence of EMS in susceptible persons consuming L-tryptophan supplements derives from the content of L-tryptophan, an impurity contained in the L-tryptophan, or a combination of the two in association with other, as yet unknown, external factors." [44]
Since 2002, L-tryptophan has been sold in the U.S. in its original form. Several high-quality sources of L-tryptophan do exist, and are sold in many of the largest healthfood stores nationwide. Indeed, tryptophan has continued to be used in clinical and experimental studies employing human patients and subjects.
In recent years in the U.S., compounding pharmacies and some mail-order supplement retailers have begun selling tryptophan to the general public. Tryptophan has also remained on the market as a prescription drug (Tryptan), which some psychiatrists continue to prescribe, in particular as an augmenting agent for people unresponsive to antidepressant drugs.[ citation needed ]
[ edit ] Turkey meat and drowsiness
See also: Postprandial somnolence#Turkey and tryptophan
A common assertion is that heavy consumption of turkey meat results in drowsiness , due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. [54] [55] [56] However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable to that contained in most other meats. [17] Furthermore, post-meal drowsiness may have more to do with what else is consumed along with the turkey and, in particular, carbohydrates . [57] It has been demonstrated in both animal models [58] and humans [59] [60] [61] that ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers release of insulin . Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan (an aromatic amino acid ) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in the uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). [62] [63] Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. [58] [60] The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into melatonin by the pineal gland . [10] Hence, this data suggests that "feast-induced drowsiness"— may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which, via an indirect mechanism, increases the production of sleep-promoting melatonin in the brain. [58] [59] [60] [61]
[ edit ] Lifespan
Rats fed a low tryptophan diet showed reduced blood levels of triiodothyronine , which was suggested to retard the aging process. [64] Rats on tryptophan-reduced diets have shown increased maximum life span and improved biomarkers of aging (although the rate of initial deaths was higher than in controls ). [65] The result was attributed to harmful effects of the age-related increase in brain serotonin. Cancers upregulate the liver enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase because its primary product, kynurenine , increases tumor growth. [39] . That would be especially relevant to lifespan studies in rodents, insofar as most rodents die of cancer[ citation needed ]. Additionally, excess dietary tryptophan has been shown to induce insulin resistance in pigs, [66] a physiological condition that has a deleterious effect on many organ systems.
