I have honestly never heard anyone say that about fish before! What about it do you think makes him sleepy? I know that people often say Turkey makes them sleepy, but that's really the only food I've ever heard anyone say made them sleepy. Or I guess too if someone overeats a food they may say it made them sleepy because they ate too much!

Hi Jennlk. I think it is because we both got sleepy after eating dinner. So I thought I would see what every one else thought. I love fish it is a good food. I have heard about turkey making people sleepy but never about fish making someone sleepy. Just made me wonder if anyone else felt sleepy after eating fish. I think it was all the work we did today that made us sleepy not the fish....LOL
