Experts disagree about this. In general though, poultry and milk are said to promote sleep, and so are carbohydrates such as pasta, rice, and bread. Big meals make you sleepy, but certain foods, like coffee, tea, and chocolate, promote wakefulness. Alcohol may make you sleep at first, but it ultimately spoils sleep.
