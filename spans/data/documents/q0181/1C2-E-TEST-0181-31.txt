Doodlesmgee: Turkey makes you sleepy because you've just had a nice big warm filling meal. Some people say it's the Triptomenophene in turkey like in warm milk that makes you sleepy. Both of these are actually crap, the doses of the drug in turkey and in warm milk are so minute, you would have to eat probably five times your body weight in turkey, or in warm milk in order to have the drug actually make you feel tired.

Jtoyer: You might think it is the chemical L-tryptophan that makes you sleepy after a turkey dinner. That is part of the reason, but there is more. It is also the amount of fats, along with the larger amount of food you tend to eat at a turkey dinner.  To find more information click here: http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archive...
