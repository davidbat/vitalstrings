Inhaling smoke also delivers toxins. Two of the biggies are carbon monoxide and benzene. Although both are deadly poisons, the only noticeable effect you'll get from them is sleepiness.
Enough of either will put you to sleep permanently. The quantities you get from smoking herb are sufficient to just make you drowsy. Although they're also present when smoking cigarettes, the stimulant effect from nicotine tends to more than counteract the sleepy effect.
Well, some folks anyway. Not this 'ol sailor dog.
Smoking pot always wires me.
Hmmm, maybe it's a side effect of my last cloning...
