A:Â Azithromycin is used to treat infections caused by certain bacteria. Respiratory infections are treated well, such as bronchitis and pneumonia.    Sexually transmitted diseases respond to azithromycin. Some other uses of azithromycin include: ear and throat infections, skin infections, and lung infections. Malaria has also been treated effectively with this antibiotic. Antibiotics in general will not clear up colds, or viruses, contrary to our popular belief. I think many people anytime they start to get sick want an antibiotic to get rid of whatever is ailing them. Sometimes, however, this doesn't work.
