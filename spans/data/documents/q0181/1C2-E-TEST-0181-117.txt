Re: Does Morphine make you sleepy?:yawn:
Hello everyone, I hope everyone had a Happy Turkey Day!. Went to the in laws as we do every year. The wife has 11 siblings, so there is always quite a feast! They actually have to rent the community building to handle the entire family. Anyway, my wife told one of her sisters about my upcoming back surgery so it didn't take long before I was the subject of conversation and everyone wanted to ask me "Hows your back?", "How did you hurt it?", "When did you hurt it?"
. I am grateful that they are concerned, don't get me wrong, but does anyone else get tired telling your troubles over and over and over again? And then everyone wanted to make a big fuss about me. I really did not want that, I just wanted to have Thanksgiving dinner, watch football, and fall asleep in the recliner (which my mother in-law made an announcement that "The recliner belongs to Porter, nobody sits in it but him!"). Anyway, all in all not too terrible of day.
OK, as far as the Morphine, it really has not made me sleepy, so I took 1 10mg percocet which seemed to do the trick. In no time I was finding myself becoming sleepy and eventually drifted off. It felt good to take a nap. And although there were probably 60 people there, I managed to fall asleep watching football.
To answer the question about whether my morphine was time released, I don't know for sure, the bottle says "Morphine sulf 30 mg tab SA" so maybe one of you know?. I stayed awake till about 1:00AM last night so I took another percocet, and pretty soon I was out. I woke up about 4:00AM, but feel more rested then I have for awhile. I will continue this regimen as it seems to work fairly well.
Hope you all had a good day! Enjoy those left overs! I know I will! It seems because I have a bad back, that means I get a lot of left overs!
Take care.
