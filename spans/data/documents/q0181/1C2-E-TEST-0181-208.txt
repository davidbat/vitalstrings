hi, JC
pa alone can make you fatiqued/washed out then there's  linked comorbidiets
to be ruled in or out,   even a low start dose 2.5 knocked me for six
! best to tell  your rheumy all so checks can be carried out
in laymans terms mtx is a folate antagonist &
depletes folates /plasma homocyystienes/blood count etc etc
you and your consultants know your medical/medicine history
? are your bloods all ok
? what dose mtx,  is it tablet or injection  you are  on
if tablets you could spread the dose ask your rheumy
? what dose of folic acid if any, and  are you on any anti/nausea
hope the mtx  is helping  you
