Does Caffeine make you tired?
 
Does Caffeine make you tired?
on 5/19/2008
Okay so sitting at work for ten hours is enough to make anyone tired but it seems when I come back from lunch with a cup of coffee I tend to yawn even more than usual.  So, I looked into it to see if it was in my mind or there was some truth to caffeine actually having a reverse effect on people.  I found that caffeine is a vasoconstictor (it shrinks your blood vessels).  Meaning, it increases your heart rate and blood pressure.  (This is why caffeine is so effective for treating headaches)
Also, as most of us know, caffeine is also a diuretic.  So if you are somewhat dehydrated the caffeine will not have enough blood volume to shrink down the vessels to increase your blood pressure.  The caffeine will then increase your dehydration to in fact make you tired.
A tip I read is to drink at least 3 to 4- 8 ounce glasses of water before drinking one cup of coffee.  You will run to the bathroom in 20 minutes, but you will see that you will have more pep and energy.  Plus a bathroom break is still a break at work!
