Thisï»¿ is great (BEYOND great) ,but what are you supposed to do when your doctor doesn't DO any of this? Typically it's ME going in and asking for certain tests. A few days later, a nurse or secretary will call my voice mail and leave a message saying, "Your test are fine." and that's the end of the story. NO follow up or other options from the doctor and no way to REACH the doctor except if I make another appointment. I've started asking for copies of my tests but I'm not medically trained.
