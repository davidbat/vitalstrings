Turkey does contains tryptophan, an amino acid that can causes drowiness in high enough doses. Although this is true, in actuality, turkey contains less tryptophan than chicken! It's just a myth that turkey itself makes you sleepy. On Thanksgiving and other family holidays where people eat alot. The combination of stress, excitement, and large amounts of heavy foods is what really makes you tired. You would have to eat several turkeys by yourself to have the tryptophan make you sleepy.
