I was on Dilantin for a seizure disorder I can tell you that I had fatigue but not the kind that I think I hear you describing I took 100mg three times a day, I can tell you that it did bother my gums a lot, I think this is one of the things Dilantin is known for possible side effects drowsiness, tiredness, headache some of these tend to disappear after continuation of treatment. this may be something that needs a dose adjustment, and it may make you feel better to talk with the doctor, I do care and I do wish you only the very best I am going to friend you and if you ever need someone to talk with I am more than willing to listen, keep us posted my site name is Caringsonbj my first name is

Dilantin does make me tired. I was taking 400 mg at night a year ago, and was so tired shortly after taking it. My joke was, I never had better sleep. Any way, the tired ness dragged into the daytime. Just over the summer, My neurologist adjusted my dosage to 50 mg vimpat twice a day and 300 dilantin at night. 3 months ago, the fatique and tiredness wasn't much better, so he again changed my dosage to a split dosage. 130 in the morning and 160 at night with the vimpat. This has made a nice improvement. I still sleep well but can enjoy a night time movie a little longer now. good luck to you. You may want to consider different dosing.
