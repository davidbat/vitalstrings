What's in turkey meat that makes you sleepy?

Dear Keith:
We'd always heard that post-turkey lethargy was a result of a natural chemical found in turkey, the same one that makes a glass of warm milk such a touted sleep aid.
We were surprised when we found a page of turkey tidbits at the University of Illinois Extension site that asserted, "Eating turkey does not cause you to feel sleepy after your Thanksgiving dinner. Carbohydrates in your Thanksgiving dinner are the likely cause of your sleepiness."
Not willing to write this off as a culinary urban myth, we moved on. Dr. Weil , a popular health guru, seemed to confirm our long-held belief, at least intially. He affirmed that the amino acid L-tryptophan found in turkey skin is a natural sedative. But, the good doctor points out that this probably isn't the cause of post-turkey sleepiness:
L-tryptophan doesn't act on the brain unless you take it on an empty stomach with no protein present. So I don't think the amino acid is to blame for the sudden lethargy that hits just about when it's time to do dishes. That's more likely due to drinking alcohol and overeating...
So, this Thanksgiving, moderate your alcohol and side-dish intake rather than passing on seconds of the bird. Have a happy holiday!
