Does eating turkey make you tired? The Myth of Tryptophan at Thanksgiving
It's nearly Thanksgiving.  Which means after Thanksgiving dinner, you'll hear someone say: "Boy, I'm sleepy.  Must be all that trypophan in the turkey."  Forget the rolls, mashed potatoes, corn bread, stuffing, cranberries, alcohol, and pumpkin pie.  BLAME THE TURKEY.  Yeah, just blame the healthiest item on your plate.  
Here's the scoop from Snopes :  "Turkey does contain tryptophan, an amino acid which is a natural sedative.  But tryptophan doesn't act on the brain unless it is taken on an empty stomach with no protein present [JD: must be hard to get it from eating turkey in that case], and the amount gobbled even during a holiday feast is generally too small to have an appreciable effect."
Sweet, sweet vindication for unfairly maligned dead turkeys everywhere.  Eat what you want for Thanksgiving, but DON'T BLAME THE DAMN TURKEY.
MYTH: BUSTED.
