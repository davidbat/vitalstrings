Why does Lettuce Make Me Sick?
Glad you asked...
Anyone who has ever had an adverse reaction to lettuce, has probably wondered  why does lettuce make them sick. The truth is, there are many reasons. The most common would be because of an allergy or sensitivity to lettuce. It could also be, particularly if you've only gotten sick from lettuce once, that it had already gone bad. Lastly, if a person doesn't like lettuce, the taste or texture could easily make them sick.
