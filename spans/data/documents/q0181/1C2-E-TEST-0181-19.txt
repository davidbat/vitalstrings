While it's true that turkey does contain the sleep inducing chemical tryptophan, its effects are only felt if you eat turkey on its own. Who just eats plain turkey with nothing else?

Plus, if you eat a lot of high-carb foods like mashed potatoes, rice, corn bread, stuffing and apple pie, your body uses all its energy to digest it, which makes you feel really tired.
