Tomorrow many Americans will prepare and indulge in the annual Thanksgiving feast of turkey, gravy, stuffing and all the trimmings. Eating turkey, it has been said, can make you especially sleepy. But is this true, and does it have any basis in science?
The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is found in many of the foods we eat such as meats, poultry, dairy products, rice and peanuts. L-tryptophan is the precursor from which the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin are synthesized. Both neurotransmitters have a natural calming effect and can induce sleep. So, yes, eating turkey can lead to a sedative effect.
But is there such an unusually high amount of tryptophan in turkey that it alone would make us sleepier than any other type of food we eat it? The simple answer to that question is no.
Turkey contains no more L-tryptophan than any other poultry, meat or dairy food. In fact, according to one source, a simple egg white contains four times more tryptophan per gram than does turkey. Other sources state that one would have to consume a large amount of turkey on an empty stomach to induce a sedative effect from just the tryptophan content.
Medical professionals say that it is more likely the carbohydrates, alcohol, and amount of food we take in during a typical Thanksgiving repast that causes us to head to the couch instead of the gym after a big turkey day dinner. So enjoy your Thanksgiving with family and friends; we all deserve the break. But donâ€™t blame the turkey big sleep that ensues after dinner in front of the television; blame the cook and then yourself.
