So a turkey and lettuce sandwich for supper, washed down with a glass of warm milk would have us all sleeping like babies then!

According to popular belief, tryptophan in turkey meat causes drowsiness [4]. Turkey does contain tryptophan, which does have a documented sleep-inducing effect as it is readily converted into Serotonin by the body. However, tryptophan is effective only when taken on its own as a free amino acid. Tryptophan in turkey is found as part of a protein, and, in small enough amounts, this mechanism seems unlikely.
