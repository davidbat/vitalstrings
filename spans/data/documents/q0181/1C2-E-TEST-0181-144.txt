Hello, my advice is to take it in the morning as its going to be energizing your brain to produce more happy hormones i.e. seratonines and dopeamines and this stimulation will cause you to experience insomnia initially until you get use to it.  There is a poll on DF about do people take their AD in the morning or evening and overwhelmingly 82% or some such say they take it in the morning.  You are going to have a bit of insomnia probably when you first start taking it, but dont worry, it will fade away with time.  This extra stimulation of your brain will also probably cause you some extra anxiety, so I hope your doctor prescribed you a sleeping aide and an anti-anxiety medication as you may need both.  Dont be afraid to ask for any if you need some, you will know if you do or not.
Definately AM if you take it in PM I think you are going to discover its a big mistake because citalophram, celexa lexapro is a stimulating AD... there are a few AD's on the market which will make yoiu sleepy believe it or not, but most of them are stimulating...
Good Luck and best wishes and hope I helped a bit...
