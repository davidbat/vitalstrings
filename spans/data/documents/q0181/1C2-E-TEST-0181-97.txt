Milk contains the essential amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan is not produced by the body but obtained through certain food products. Tryptophan helps to produce increased levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is an important component in regulating sleep and producing an overall feeling of relaxation. Tryptophan supplements have been widely used as a treatment for insomnia.
