Since the beginning of the year I have been mostly free from refined sucrose. Just then I had something and it was way too sweet not to have had sugar in it, and now I feel so tired and worn out. My advice is when you get sugar cravings eat an orange and if that sounds boring then try something exotic like paw paw or lychee. Stay clear of refined sugar and other processed sugars and you’re body will thank you for it in the long term. You take care of your body and it will take care of you.
