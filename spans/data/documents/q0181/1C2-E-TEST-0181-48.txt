Does Eating Turkey Make You Sleepy?
By Kum Martin
Do you know why you feel sleepy after having a turkey dinner? Or, very often while taking dinner, you begin to yawn. Is it because you do not want to eat anymore or there is something in the food which makesyou feel sleepy.
Turkey food contains amino acids L-Tryptophan which induces sleepiness. L-Tryptophan produces Vitamin B, or niacin, in the body. Tryptophan is broken down into serotonin and melatonin. These are neurotransmitters which cause serenity and induce sleep. When L-Tryptophan is taken on empty stomach without any amino acids or proteins, it makes you feel tired and sleepy.
Turkey has 0.333 g of tryptophan in every 100 grams of edible portion. In every 100 grams of chicken there is 0.292 g of tryptophan, and also pork and cheese have tryptophan. In the other poultry and meat products, besides tryptophan other amino acids are also present and hence do not induce sleep.
L-Tryptophan is rich in carbohydrate which increases the level of amino acids in the brain and directs the synthesis of serotonin. It also stimulates the secretion of insulin in pancreas. When this happens, some tryptophan enters into the muscle cells and increases in concentration in bloodstream. The synthesis of serotonin generates the sleepy feeling.
Fats not only slow down the digestive system, but also take a lot of energy to digest. Less flow of blood makes you fell less active after taking dinner. Overeating means full stomach. When this happens, the blood flows away from the nervous system and makes you feel sleepy.
Any holiday means rich diet. And, a turkey diet, jovial mood and happy atmosphere are the best to relax and celebrate holidays.
