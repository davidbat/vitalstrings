Turkey has an amino acid called Tryptophan. It's an essential amino acid - the body can't make it itself. The body has to get tryptophan and other essential amino acids from food.
Tryptophan is like a natural sedative.
Tryptophan helps the body produce the B-vitamin niacin, which, ­in turn, helps the body produce serotonin which acts as a calming agent in the brain and plays a key role in sleep.
But nutritionists and other experts say that the tryptophan in turkey probably won't trigger the body to produce more seroton­in because tryptophan works best on an empty stomach.
t's worth noting that other foods contain as much or more tryptophan than turkey, including chicken, pork, and cheese. As with turkey, other amino acids are present in these foods besides tryptophan, so they don't make you sleepy.
The tryptophan in a Thanksgiving turkey has to vie with all the other amino acids that the body is trying to use. So only part of the tryptophan makes it to the brain to help produce serotonin.
Usually, after people eat a lot of food, they feel sleepy. I think that eating turkey and having your body digest it really takes up a lot of energy.
Fat and proteins are the hardest nutriments to digest. Eat a big fat steak (or in this case, a big fat turkey) and you'll feel like sleeping.Fats also take a lot of energy to digest, so the body will redirect blood to your digestive system to tackle the job. Since you have less bloodflow elsewhere, you will feel less energetic after eating a meal rich in fats.
