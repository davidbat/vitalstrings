With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the question
always comes up “Why does Thanksgiving turkey make me drowsy?” Turkey is high in tryptophan, an amino acid that can cause one to get sleepy. Tryptophan needs to be taken on an empty stomach and without any other amino acids or proteins to cause drowsiness. Add pumpkin pie to the mix (which also contains tryptophan) and you’re in trouble! This video explains why sometimes you get sleepy and why sometimes you don’t after eating a big Thanksgiving dinner.
