Caffeine has the reverse effect on some people, especially those who drink it alot and started at a young age. I have ADHD and Mountain Dew actually calms me down, yet Pepsi makes me REALLy wired. I've never drank coffee and I don't like chocolate, so it's possible your body has built up a tolerance to coffee and it doesn't have the effect on you it has on most people... both my parents drink coffee all day and it doesn't really do anything for them. Just something to drink, I guess.
