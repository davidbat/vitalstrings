Morpheus : The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
[Neo's eyes suddenly wander towards a woman in a red dress]
Morpheus : Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?
Neo : I was...
Morpheus : [gestures with one hand] Look again.
[the woman in the red dress is now Agent Smith, pointing a gun at Neo's head; Neo ducks]
[Everybody and everything besides Neo and Morpheus freezes in time]
Neo : This... this isn't the Matrix?
Morpheus : No. It is another training program designed to teach you one thing: if you are not one of us, you are one of them.
