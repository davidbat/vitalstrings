Does Thanksgiving Dinner make you Sleepy?

After eating the two helpings of Thanksgiving Day turkey, cranberry sauce, potatoes, vegetables, and pumpkin pie, you may want to take a long nap. Turkey, of course, contains a natural sedative called Tryptophan. And Tryptophan makes you sleepy, right?
Well…not exactly. Tryptophan doesn’t really have a significant effect because it’s just one of the many Thanksgiving Day factors that cause sleepiness. The “food coma” you experience is actually the result of your body working overtime to digest all that food!
Just consider:
The full stomach. A big, solid meal has been shown to induce sleepiness, regardless of what you’ve eaten. In response to a full stomach, your body gears up for digestion. The body increases blood flow to the stomach, which results in decreased oxygenation and decreased blood flow to the brain.
Wine, wine, wine. A glass or two of wine — especially for people who only partake on occasion — is all that’s needed to induce sleepiness.
A long day. At least for the cook it is — what with getting up early to start all the preparations. It can be exhausting.
Consequently, Tryptophan probably plays some role in the “Thanksgiving coma,” but it’s not the only cause.
Best Dinners for Sleep
