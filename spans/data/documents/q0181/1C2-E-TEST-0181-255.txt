Which doctor prescribe you the med? the primary or rheumy? I think your rheumy should know the dose by heart. Did your doctor tell you to take 2 tabs twice daily or you base on the label on your  med bottle. I think there is probably some error or misunderstanding or miscommunication going on. I don't think there is a 100 mg tab, unless it is specially compounded. You definitely need to double ck with your doctor soon!
I have been on that for many many years and don't have sudden tirenss with it. Actually it helps with fatigue. If i don't take it, I will know later on during the day since I will feel very tired.

I started taking Plaquenil in June. I take 200 mg twice per day with food (at lunch and dinner). I have noticed a BIG improvement in my fatigue and achiness, in fact I actually get a slight burst of energy just after taking it. I still have days where I feel crappy but my symptoms have improved and it's not every day. I'm grateful for any improvement. My biggest issues now are tendonitis in both ankles and unbelievable jaw pain. I'm seeing my rheum today so hopefully he'll have something that can help with that. I already take Mobic daily. Hope all of you are having a good morning!

Hi all..thanks for all your responses!!  I do take four 200mg tablets a day...when my rheumy started me on this drug, she said that she always starts her patients on the highest dose possible and then tapers them down as their symptoms improve!  She says she does this to speed up the time it would take for the drug to take effect.   I don't know....maybe i'll put a call into the office to double check with her....
