Hey Helena,
The Zoloft's initial buzzkill was horrible but only lasted about a month.  The lexapro was about two months and then the sleepiness wore off, but I was still nauseaus so we d/c that.  Actually the Zoloft was only three weeks and it got continually better through those weeks.  Its the initial smack on the ass that got me.  I believe the stimulating ADs are prozac and zoloft with lexapro and celexa coming in at the middle.  I have BP 1 so we took a chance on the zoloft because its supposed to be the worst to put a BP on.  However, I get the weird side effects so we figured I'd have adverse reactions and be ok and so far I am.
I really hated Wellbutrin, but I know so many people who love it.  I wouldn't stress too much about the unavailability since there's a bunch more to try.  And if you run out of AD's there's a whoe slew of atypical antipsychotics to try too.  Come on, don't you want to keep taking more drugs!  I'm just kidding.  I've felt like a test subject this year, wait I was one! 
Well, the thing is if you wait it out, it USUALLY goes away or you might have that body chemistry that hates ssri's.  But you can try to hang in there.  Are you starting a job where you have to be uber-energetic?
I'm the kind of girl who walks into chairs and apologizes.
I rule the land of You-Wanna-Make-Something-Of-It? where it's always that time of the month.
