Rain may make you feel tired, but it doesn't really help you get a     good night's sleep . In fact, sunny weather brings more restful nights,     according to research done at the University of Rochester Sleep     Laboratory in New York. When the clouds go away, not only do you sleep     more soundly, you are more likely to sleep longer.
In the study, 43 subjects were asked to keep sleep diaries for 105     nights. The researchers crosschecked the diaries with the National     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather database and found that     the higher the barometer—meaning the better the weather—the     more soundly people rested.
The findings explain why people don't want to get up when it's     raining. Researchers add that the sound of rain and lack of sunlight make     it even harder to get out of bed.
