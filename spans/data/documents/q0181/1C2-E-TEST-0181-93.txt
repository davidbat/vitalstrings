Have you ever wondered what's in Thanksgiving turkey that makes you want to curl up and go to sleep? I sure have.
No matter how much you try to control it, the inevitable happens. You fall right to sleep against your will when you should be visiting with relatives you usually only see once a year.
I know it's closer to Valentine's day than Thanksgiving but I promise you it's relevant just keep reading.
We all are familiar with the foods we shouldn't have before going to bed. You know like caffeine, too many liquids, spicy food and alcohol. These are obvious!  But, there are foods that are actually encouraged before going to bed. I'm sure many of you remember being offered a glass of milk before bed as a child. Do you know why? It's because milk contains tryptophan (and so does that Thanksgiving turkey).
Tryptophan is an amino acid that's needed for your body to make serotonin which promotes sleep.  However, in order for Tryptophan to be effective, it must get to the brain. Ensuring tryptophan gets to the brain requires carbohydrates to run interference. The insulin that's released when carbs are added absorbs into the muscle. Therefore, keeping tryptophan open to make its way to the brain. Once it's made it to the brain is usually when sleepiness kicks in due to the melatonin and serotonin.
Foods that have tryptophan include poultry, peanuts, oats and bananas. By eating foods containing tryptophan, you're that much closer to getting some sleep and don't forget the carbs!
I'm a supportive wife and an involved mother who has had trouble sleeping since the birth of my first child.
I've turned over many rocks trying to uncover the secret to a better night's sleep.
I would like to provide anyone with trouble sleeping the information that I have found over time. After all, sleep is a basic human need and we all deserve a "good sleep".
Here's to restful sleep!!!
