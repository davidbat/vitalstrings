In my case a full stomach makes me sleepy but there is a not very pleasant feeling for me because I feel too plenty and I can't really sleep. Most of the time I try not to eat too much but sometimes when I have delicious food in front of me and I can't control myself I prefer after to have a walk and I feel better. Does having a full stomach really make you sleepy?
