something really bad happened to me like two days ago and ever since i cant stop thinking about it i even dreamed about it last night. And every time i think about it  my heart rate increases by a lot i start feeling nervous and scared my hands start shaking, i feel like crying and so sad i dont understand what`s happening to me?
