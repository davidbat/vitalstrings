Today, I went for my blood work and had to take the pill after the draw - I took it at 9 AM and so far, no sleepiness. So, maybe the sleepiness was a result of starting treatment and now that my body has gotten used to it, maybe it is gone? This was the first time I took the pill during the day as I have been afraid I would fall asleep. Hopefully, that is gone.
I am still at 75 on the Synthroid. I see the endo in 2 weeks. I bet my dose gets upped again.
Did your doctor tell you to not take your Synthroid before the draw, I am wondering?
Consistancy is extremely important.  I take my thyroxine faithfully @ 5:20 AM every single morning and have done so for many many years.
