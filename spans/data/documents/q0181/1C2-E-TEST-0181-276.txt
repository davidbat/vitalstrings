My bp is naturally low. I've always felt like I could use more energy. I know - Who doesn't feel that way? Just curious as to whether or not the low bp and low energy go together. The rest of my family, younger siblings included, all have high bp. My siblings had to start taking bp meds in their 20's just to get their bp down to 140/something. I am grateful I don't have to deal with that... just tired.
Kaykay, I see you live in Plano. I just moved here a few weeks ago. Hi!
Thanks for the replies!
