Accutane has really worn me out too. During the first month or two of treatment, I could still do plenty of bodyweight exercises and recover from them quicker; now, I'm sleeping at least 10 hours a night, waking up still feeling exhausted, and finding it nigh-on impossible to do vigorous exercise because I literally lack the strength and energy to. I have minor back pain and muscle soreness, but they are not the reasons for my aversion of heavy exercise. I also have a bloated stomach, strangely enough; it used to be completely flat before, and I haven't changed my diet or moderate exercise habits (plenty of walking daily). I'll just wait until my course is over (just over a month left!) and give my body a chance to recalibrate itself as the drug leaves my system. As a side note, I am not suffering from any depression; this is all just a physical burden that is having some effect on my mental ability too (as in I'm so tired that I find it hard to be at my best).

Help me guys,
Next month I'll go through a physical fitness test and am thinking of stopping the accutane for a week. what do you think? I feel very tired and that can really affect my performance in this test. I have to run 2400 meters in 13 minutes.
I may be wrong, but I believe that what matters is your accumulated dosage. Taking a week off accutane won't have any undesirable effects, and you should be fine once you resume your treatment. It would still  be best for you to be as consistent as possible, though.
