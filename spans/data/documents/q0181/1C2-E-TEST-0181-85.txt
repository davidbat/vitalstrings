Sometimes just the process of eating certain foods can cause certain gut hormones which might make you sleepy. For example foods like Turkey have Trypophan ( sp) which makes you tired.
OK jwags -- it may also be the timing of taking the Metformin-- forgetting to take with meal and taking much later for example.  But to eliminate the "denial" factor i might have to watch the carbo level of the meal too.  Sometimes I do feel tired for no diabetically related reason though; it's a fluctuating blood level it seems.  Vitamins -- right!  Why have i never believed in vitamins? :-)
