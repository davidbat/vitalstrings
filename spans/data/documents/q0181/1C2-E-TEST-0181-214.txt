According to my limited understanding, the body maintains certain ratio between the various electrolytes, so if there is a surplus of one certain mineral, the body will flush it out to maintain balance.
My long term strategy is to put enough salt into my food (lot of people are not aware of the importance of this step), and then eat enough mineral-rich foods - but most of the Paleo food does have this property, so that's not such a problem. Eating enough sodium (salt) is especially important if you eat lower-carb, which many paleo-ers do.
I do not have experience with supplementation, but as I understand it, to be safe one should then supplement all of the main minerals, and not just pick up some of them selectively (unless doctor prescribes them). But that's only my opinion.
