"Told that if you take a medication long enough it gets toxic..."
I have been on hypertensive meds for  5 years now. This is my experience: My doctor put me on lopressor and enalapril. I didn`t know if I was coming or going! Then enalapril only, an ace inhibitor, was great for 3 years, not tired. Then topryl (lopressor, a beta blocker) for 2 years, very tired. I would have stayed with enalapril but after 3 yrs it "turned" on me. Another M.D. told that if you take a medication long enough it gets toxic . I experienced unexplained depression from it. I will discus with my doctor if I can be prescribed another ace inhibitor because my experience with enalapril was energizing and effective. I just could not take it at night, mornings and afternoons only, that`s how energizing it was.
