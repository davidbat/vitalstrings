Bury
I notice that too much sleep make me more tired. However, I need 11+ to feel that way.I also find that if I get the &quot;normal&quot; 8 hours of sleep that I feel groggy through out the day. I need to sleep either 5-6 hours or 9-10 hours. For some reason that 7-8 range messes me up. Anything less then 4 and I feel like I am on auto-pilot throughout the day. It is not really a tired feeling. If I get 11+ then I do feel tired the entire day and might as well stay in bed because I can't do anything. When I get 7-8 then I can function fine but have very low energy and have to make a conscience effort to concentrate.
