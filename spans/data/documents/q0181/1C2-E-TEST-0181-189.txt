Caffeine addiction. I used to have it bad - could drink half a pot of coffee and then go to bed without it even phasing me.

geeez i wonder the same thing too i mean isnt it suppose to keep you all hyper and wake and it does the complete opposite with me well milk makes me sleepy so making coffee with milk isnt going to help me either but since drinking it black isnt my thing either i just have to stay away from it for awhile

Water and some deep breathing will perk you right up.

Some people have a paradoxical reaction to drugs and medications which is why ADHD medications (stimulants) make people who are hyperactive calm.  Some medications made to make people sleepy will actually make people hyper.
