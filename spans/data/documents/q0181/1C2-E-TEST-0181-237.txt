Why does sugar make me tired?
Jamie Truong Asked: Why does sugar make me tired?
I love sweet things! Candy, ice cream, cookies, cake, you name it! But for the past few years, I've noticed that I always get tired after eating something sweet. I'm only 13, but when I was 11 I tried some of my mom's coffee that she got at a restaurant. I only took a few sips, but a couple minutes later, I fell asleep on her lap! Do you think I might have diabetes? I don't want to get tested, but are there other ways to tell if I do have it, so I can be sure? Thank you!

Its called a sugar high. After a bit it wears off and you get all tired. Its normal

Reverse effect. But hey, at least it has an effect on you. =D
People sometimes have the same experience with caffeine. They'll fall asleep instead of waking up. It's rare, but it happens. Although this is the first time I've heard about this happening with sugar.

i get tired over sugar and caffeine too. for me, im not 100% sure how,but probably because i have ADHD. or it might be the meds i take. im pretty sure you don't have diabetes.

Lol, the chances are, you don't have diabetes. At that age I'm 99% you would know weather or not you had it, it's also often genetic so don't worry unless a close family member has it. As for the tiredness, you may have hypoglycemia, or just crashing from the sugar. I suggest you ask a parent, and a doctor about this issue as it is potentially serious
