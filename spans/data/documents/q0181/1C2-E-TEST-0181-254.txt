Yes, progesterone can make you sleepy!  I have a few friends who are newly pregnant, and one of the hormones that surge in your body when you are pregnant is progesterone...the very hormone that makes your first trimester exhausting, tiring and feeling fatigued and energy-drained.
What is the dosage of your progesterone?

I am taking progesterone 400mg per day..It is totally draining me! I am So tired. I am taking it because my progesterone levels were very low when I had my initial pregnancy blood work done and 4 miscarriages..This is my 3rd week on the pills and I am drained!

I am taking progesterone cream that I purchased otc at a health store. it works very wel for me. I am sleeping through the night for the first time in ages. I don't want to discontinue, but it too makes me very tired/lethargic during the day. Is there some supplement I can take to overcome this effect. Is there an herb or vitamin I can take to combat the fatigue of the progesterone?
