mornings are more apropriate it wakes your body up for the rest of the day, at first you will be tired but once your in a good routine it makes the day much better, and by night time you just want to sleep.
if you do it in the evening it wakes your body up (same effect as running in the morning) and then you are awake in the evening your mind is over stimulate and it is harder to wind back down, you will also be burning off less fat and building less muscle tissue in evenings aswel.
best thing to do is run before breakfast this way you burn yesterdays meals off, then have your breakfast, if it is a long run or longer than usual, it is safer to have breakfat first then wait for about an hour (light breakfast) this will give you your energy to get through the whole run without "kissing gravel"
hope this has helped

I am a runner and it depends on how much I run, if I do 3-4 miles I like to do it early in the day. If I do 6 or over I do it in the afternoon so I can shower and veg out...

I like jogging at night way out in the desert along deserted stretches of highway.

A morning jog usually set up the pace for my entire day. I find myself in a more calm and cheerful mood compared to the days when I didn't do any morning workout.

IDK .. I just started swimming and found that it puts me to sleep amazingly well at night! I was an insomniac and now I'm sleeping by 11 pm every night!

Exercising at night keeps me up too late.  Get plenty of sleep and jogging, whenever you do it, will make you more alert since you'll have more efficient circulation delivering oxygen to every part of your body all day!

Only if I get out of bed first
