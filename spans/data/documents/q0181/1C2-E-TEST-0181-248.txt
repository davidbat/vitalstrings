Dull rainy weather makes me feel what the point is of getting out of bed. Unfortunately, for me, I live in Scotland where we have many dull rainy days so if I get into those lazy feelings then I'd never get out of bed!

Yes it does I've been asleep for an hour after tea, it's also very depressing
It's May for gods sake when's it going to brighten up.

Yes, rainy and stormy weather make me lazy feeling.

I actually have the opposite problem! I would rather it rain and storm all day, it makes me happier. I know weird.

there is a syndrome called SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
I get it quite a lot and so does my mum really badly that she has to have what is called a light box. It makes you feel like you have hardly any energy all the time and when you wake up you don't feel refreshed.
Not saying that you have this for sure but this shows that the weather can affect people, you notice it the most when it has been alright weather (like it was a few weeks ago), and then suddenly mixes up or goes all dark and dull like it is at the moment
