"You know phentermine is a stimulant appetite suppressant that..."
you wnat to know if your dr can perscribe phentrinemine for you? if your dr likes he will. you know Phentermine is a stimulant appetite suppressant that means that this drug will NOT cause you to LOSE weight. what it does is lowers your appetite to lower you caloric intake. If you are already not eating a lot then Phentermine is not the right choice. As with any stimulant medication Phentermine can be addicting that is why it is a Schedule 4 controlled substance and many doctors will only prescribe it for 3 months due to the fact that if you can`t lose weight within this time on this drug chances are you won`t with more time on it. I`d be very weary if any doctor leaves you on it for longer than this time.

Someone said: Balony, I've taken Phentermine for a year, I started eating healthier, lost weight, and now have energy to do the things I did 30 years ago.... This isn't snorting or shooting meth, it's taking 1 to 2 37.5 mg pills a day and feeling better than I have in forever... Weary  smeary,,, I'd rather feel good for 15 more years and be happy than crappy for 25 years and unhappy....

Unfortunately it doesn't matter what YOU think about the drug or anyone else for that matter.  Prescriptions are subject to the DEA and state and federal laws.  Depending on what schedule the drug is classified as will determine how it is treated.    Years ago tramadol was not considered dangerous or worthy of DEA surveillance, but now becuase it has become so popularly used by many, it is now a controlled substance in several states...... it almost seems that when the demand is high for a certain drug, they classify it as controlled (besides the obvious other reasons). •if you have diabetes, you may need to decrease your dose of insulin while taking phentermine.   ABSOLUTELY discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist FIRST!  also do not take it with alcohol
