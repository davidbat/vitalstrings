You've probably heard of hypothermia, where you are exposed to cold temperatures that you can't compensate for, bringing down your body temperature. There's also hyperthermia, in which your body temperature increases because heat exposure is beyond what you can compensate for. To counteract this, your body slows down, decreasing heat generated by muscle activity.  If your body still can't cool down, your blood pressure will drop, making you feel tired.
If you've also been sweating a lot, you may also be suffering from heat exhaustion.  Despite the name, this is a separate phenomenon from hyperthermia, and is caused by a lack of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This can also cause tiredness.
