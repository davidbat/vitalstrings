Description: A twisted treasure from Hollywood’s pre-Code       horror heyday, Island of Lost Souls is a cautionary tale of       science run amok, adapted from H. G. Wells’s novel The       Island of Dr. Moreau. In one of his first major movie       roles, Charles Laughton is a mad doctor conducting ghastly       genetic experiments on a remote island in the South Seas,       much to the fear and disgust of the shipwrecked sailor       (Richard Arlen) who finds himself trapped there. This       touchstone of movie terror, directed by Erle C. Kenton,       features expressionistic photography by Karl Struss,       groundbreaking makeup effects that have inspired generations       of monster-movie artists, and the legendary Bela Lugosi in       one of his most gruesome roles.
 
 
The Film:
The pre-production on Island of Lost Souls included a talent search    contest for the role of "The Panther Woman." The winner, Kathleen Burke,    also received a free five-week stay at the glamorous Ambassador Hotel in    Los Angeles. For the role of Moreau, however, no contest was needed.    Charles Laughton, the brilliant and versatile British actor, had already    made his mark in Hollywood as Nero in Cecil B. DeMille's The Sign of the    Cross (1932) and Island of Lost Souls, made the same year, was his fifth    U.S. production. As Moreau, Laughton created one of the great horror    film archetypes, which as the Herald Tribune later described it, was "an    engaging combination of child, madman and genius," but his actual    appearance was inspired by an unlikely source, according to writer    Arthur Lennig. "With his little turf of beard, thin mustache, and soft,    almost infantile face, Laughton modeled his makeup on an eye specialist    he had visited several times." (from The Count: The Life and Films of Bela Lugosi). As for Moreau's skill at handling a whip, that came from    Laughton's training with a London street performer for a previous stage    play.
Excerpt       from TCM located HERE
There's not a wasted frame in this chilling horror film that was banned    in England upon its first release. Laughton is Dr. Moreau, a smiling,    benign-seeming man who welcomes shipwrecked Edward Parker (Arlen) to his    own private island. While waiting for the next passing freighter, Parker    learns that the "natives" who serve Moreau are really animals who have    been transformed into semi-humans by the doctor's experiments in an area    known as "The House of Pain." The only woman around, Lota (Burke),    becomes involved with Parker but she too conceals a terrible secret.    When Edward's fiancee Ruth (Hyams) arrives with a search expedition, the    two women vie for his affections while Moreau makes his own attempts to    deal with the new intruders. Unfortunately for him he makes a crucial    error which goes against the lessons in "humanity" and "civility" he has    browbeaten into his creations. The famous, controversial climax is still    a shocker.

The       1932 version of Island of Lost Souls via Criterion Blu-ray looks splendid. It appears as though they have procured their exceptional digital restoration with elevated black       levels. The image quality is rich with grain - there are,       less-consequential, vertical surface scratches. This       is dual-layered and the hour-10-minute feature is supported       with a very high bitrate.       Contrast is at Criterion's usual strong levels. There is,       surprisingly, some depth but the film textures are the most       appealing factor. You really get the sense that this Blu-ray is representative of an authentic, film-like, presentation. No       doubt the best we are ever likely to get digitally. Top       marks.
I have heard that MoC was able to obtain superior source       material for their Blu-ray release of Island of Lost Souls.       But I see the same marks and scratches as on the Criterion.       It is, however, visually, slightly, different. I find the UK       1080P brighter which shows more background detail in a few       scenes - and some of the scratches can be slightly more       prominent. That is always the trade-off but it is quite       inconsequential. It is equally as competent technically with       a very high bitrate. Generally speaking, I think few would       find enough significant differences between the two HD       transfers to sway them to pick one over the other in       regards to video. To be fair - for my praise for the       Criterion - I am also extremely impressed with the Masters       of Cinema. It looks absolutely fabulous. I was, again, just       blown away by how this film looks with the wonderful       textured grain.

Audio :
Criterion    remain faithful with a linear PCM mono track at 1152 kbps. The audio is    predictably imperfect but is reasonably consistent considering the age    of the film and level of the source. In fact - it may not have sounded    much better theatrically. We can trust the lossless rendition is about    as strong as we can get and it is without major hiss, dropouts or    similar flaws. There are optional English subtitles and m
y Momitsu has identified    it as being a region 'A'-locked disc despite the film, presumably, being    in the public domain.
The Criterion may be technically more robust but my ears  couldn't distinguish much of a difference in playing the same scenes  back-to-back. MoC offer a      DTS-HD Master monoaural 2.0 channel at 656 kbps and optional HoH  English subtitles. The Masters of Cinema Blu-ray disc is region-locked to 'B'.
 
Extras :
Criterion    supply an excellent audio commentary featuring film historian Gregory    Mank, author of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff and Hollywood’s Maddest       Doctors .    It is filled with rare information about the stars and production    details. Vintage film fans will relish the professional soliloquy on Island of t Lost Souls.

There are also new interviews    with horror film historian and documentary filmmaker David J. Skal for    13-minutes; writer and filmmaker Richard Stanley the original director    of the ill-fated 1996 adaptation, The Island of Dr. Moreau, for    14-minutes plus Gerald Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh founding members of    the band Devo - who were heavily influenced by the film Island of    Lost Souls, lasting almost 20-minutes. Also included is their 1976    10-minute film In the Beginning Was the End: The Complete Truth About    De-evolution. It features the songs “Secret Agent Man” and “Jocko    Homo”.
