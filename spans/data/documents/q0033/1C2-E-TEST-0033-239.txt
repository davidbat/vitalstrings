About Ray Charles :
Ray Charles was the stage name of Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 - June 10, 2004). He was a pioneering American pianist and soul musician who shaped the sound of rhythm and blues. He brought a soulful sound to country music, pop standards, and a rendition of "America the Beautiful" that Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes called the "definitive version of the song, an American anthem - a classic, just as the man who sang it."
