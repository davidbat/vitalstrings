Charles Bronson movies on Blu
Ok, so far we have the following Bronson movies on Blu.
1. The Magnificent Seven
2. Battle of the Buldge
3. The Dirty Dozen
Where's Once Upon A Time In The West, Death Wish, Breakheart Pass, The Mechanic, The White Buffalo, Hard Times?
People seem to think Chuck Norris, Stallone, and Schwarzenegger were the ultimate heroes. Bronson was always the ultimate tough guy in my opinion. I have and always will be a great fan of Mr. Bronson's and would love to see more of his films released on Blu.
