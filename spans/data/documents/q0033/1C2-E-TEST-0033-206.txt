Ray Charles
Ray Charles started out smooth - A substandard Nat King Cole - but               after signing to Atlantic , his gospel background kicked in and he               effectively invented soul. 
As his vibrant music evolved he blended               R&B, Rock & Roll, big band jazz and country - the latter               on the groundbreaking Modern Sounds In Country & Western               Music album, which gave him a US pop Number 1 with I               Can't Stop Loving You.
Born in Albany, Georgia, into harsh poverty on 23 September               1930, Ray Charles Robinson lost his sight to glaucoma at the age               of seven. 
By his mid-teens Charles had learned to read and score               music in Braille and play the piano, clarinet, saxophone and               trumpet.
Meeting with little success in the South he moved to Seattle               where his career blossomed. 
The records Charles made from 1955 -               1965 - during which time he battled, and eventually conquered, a               severe heroin addiction - influenced, and were covered by, a whole               host of 60s British acts, from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to Van Morrison , Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart . 
He later set up his               own label, Tangerine, and became a very tough businessman.
Although future records, which relied too much on pop songs and               sugary string arrangements, rarely recaptured the glory of his               peak years, in concert his voice remained strong and wonderfully               expressive.
Ray Charles died on 10 June 2004, aged 73. "A great soul               has gone on," said close friend Aretha               Franklin , after news               of Charles' death was announced. "He was a fabulous man, full of               humour and wit. A giant of an artist. The music world will miss               his voice".
