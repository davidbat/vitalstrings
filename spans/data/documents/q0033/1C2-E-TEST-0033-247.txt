**DON'T LEAVE OUT STEVIE WONDER**
by Kevin R. Dickson on 5/10/2009 1:52am
You have to be tone deaf not to hear this sound and fall in love with it. Someone else might have wrote it, but Sir Ray Charles stamp will be forever on it.

If you haven't already heard it, check out Richard Manuel's version, either with or without The Band.  I love Ray's, but Richard's is much more soulful and from-the-heart.
by Henno-C on 6/4/2009 4:27pm
Amazing song, one of the best ever. Found it through tommy emmanuels instrumental version, and Im so glad I found it :)

Have you guys heard 'Hit the Road Jack'? It is also by Ray Charles
by SS on 7/26/2009 3:32pm
I haven't ever heard a bad version,
but my favorite is by Jerry Reed!!
His guitar work on this one is awsome!!

This is a song that never gets old
by Matt Baker on 11/16/2009 6:04am
No doubt that Ray Charles made this song famous. But yes, it is true, he is not the original composer. That honour goes to Hoagy Carmichael. Funnily enough I heard another singer (Malcolm McNeill) doing a rendition of the Hoagy Carmichael version before I ever heard Ray Charles sing it.

here is something fun to do - go to grooveshark.com or similar free music site and type in david bromberg in the search field and then select and play his instrumental of georgia - get a copy of the lyrics and you have your own karaoke!  now, advanced singers, try to sing it differently than ray!!!

this song is beautiful :) <3 x
by Lorna Anne MacCormick on 1/22/2010 10:27pm
This song truly reminds me to always believe in oneself.It reminds me of how it is to lose oneself within the noise of the world.Mr charles was mislead in a way or two for a  period in his life but more importantly he never lost that beautiful gift of himself and the most gracious gift of all, our memories and how that added to our lives.what is even cooler he is affecting a whole new generation of people I find it so very distasteful that it took till 1974 to stop banning Mr.Ray Charles music.Some one must have had a ahaaaah haaaa moment when they finally made Georgia On My Mind the state song!!!!!!!!!!!!!God Bless you I would also love to Thank Jamie Fox for doing such an excellent job in the movie! thank you for sharing your beautiful souls.May god continue to bless your families.THANKYOU

Late Mr. Ray Charles, may he rest in peace
by biggboy on 6/7/2010 6:13pm
he was the best ever I wish he was still alive
by Witherspoon on 6/11/2010 7:16am
As Seajay from Georgia posted two years ago Ray Charles didn't write the Lyrics to this tune.  Hoagy Carmichael wrote the music and Stuart Gorrell the lyrics (in 1930). You should correct your info.
by Matt on 7/25/2010 6:18pm
Someone who said that noone can ever sing that song like Ray Charles did, should, (if they haven't done so already), check out the footage, I think from a Finnish TV station in the mid 60's, of the Spencer Davis Group.
Steve Winwood modelled his vocals on Ray Charles and the R C version of Georgia On My Mind inspired him to sing in that way, to the point where a lot of people, especially in America thought Winwood was black.
If there is one prime example of matching up to Ray Charles's version, it's the Spencer Davis Group version.
Steve Winwood gave excellent tribute to a legend at the time and since then is now a legend himself.
Black Blues singers more than made a mark on musics history, right back to people like Robert Johnson and Blind Blake and as in the prime case of Ray Charles, their legacy and influence should never be forgotten.

This song was an great hit and a classic well before Ray Charles sang it... Hoagy Carmichael also wrote (the music to)'Stardust' - one of the great songs of the first half of the 20th Century.
by Tyler Gray on 10/4/2010 4:31pm
i wached the movie ray i think there should have been more music parts and less drug parts but i love gorgia and i knew that he didn''t write the song but it's a good song any way and i don't think anyone shouod care who wrote it if any body has a diffrent apinoin they can emial me at tgray@mvmsfalcons.com
by Dawbree' on 10/19/2010 8:52pm
This song is amazing!! R.I.P Ray Charles. I L O V E Y O U . !

Why are Ray Charles fans such bad spellers?
by Aaroninlatin on 11/10/2010 12:42pm
Great cover. Hoagy Carmichael wrote a great song and Ray Charles made it his.

I'm oing this on my report of state ,Georgia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
by Giland BIKOUA on 1/7/2011 1:43pm
writing a text is something, but singing a song is to give life to this text. Georgia on my mind was writen by someone else, but Ray Chales had given life to this song and it will never be forgoten in this world.
by seifu tajure on 1/11/2011 9:47am
I said Georgia
I find just an old song keeps
Georgia on my mind
Ray Charles is a legend at a time for many of us,
and no one can ever sing cool song like  him. then now i listen to his song and become legend to my self.
by mis unknown on 2/15/2011 7:43am

I really like this song its awesome
by Jazzmanmusic on 3/1/2011 10:58pm
Ray Charles performed this song well but he did not write this song. The words were written by Stuart Gorrell.
And the Music was written by Hoagy Carmichael. Hoagy has written so many beautiful music  peices like, Stardust and  the Nearness of You. Words by Ned Washington.
by korro on 3/18/2011 8:23am

One of the best songs that wee 'll can ever hear. A sad story of black people.
by CYNNOMORE on 7/22/2011 7:11am
Quoting Claudette Robinet from France:"A sad story of black people."
WHAT? HUH? This song is universal and has nothing to do with whether you're black  brown purple or green. I don't even see where one would conclude that sentiment from the lyrics. Maybe there is a language barrier as I see you are from France?
by Shane on 8/19/2011 8:28am
I heard some one singing this at Ashland Oregon park to the tune of Ray, it stayed in my head for days. I just love it!
by Soul on 8/28/2011 11:30am
Every time that I listen this song each one of my senses explodes. Thanks Ray

by Jonathan on 2/20/2012 10:13am
These are not the original lyrics from Ray Charles's Singular Genius recording sessions. They should be:
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through (the whole day through)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
I said-a Georgia, Georgia
A song of you (A song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I said Georgia, oh Georgia
No peace I find (No peace I find)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Woah Georgia, Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Get the fuck out of here with "deandre gave justice to this song"! No wanna be American Idol could come close to RC. Study up on music before you let bullshit fall out if your mouth like that.
by haley on 3/25/2012 8:04pm
I agree with Joshua, ray is a one of a kind and deandre or any other American idol ect. That thinks they can even come close to singing this song with the soul, and feeling that ray did is delusional. Ray Charles was a great man, wonderful musician, and loving father, don't butcher his songs with your unfit voice.

This song wasn't written or originaly done by Ray Charles. Hogie did it first. and the Great Sachmo coverd it way before Charles.
