Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winner for Best Actor (Jamie Foxx), "Ray," the biopic about Ray Charles, has been a hit both with critics and at the box office.  Effective February 1, 2005, this biopic about legendary musical entertainer Ray Charles is available on DVD.
On DVD, "Ray" is a two-disc set, where Disc 1 has not only the theatrical version of the movie, but also contains an extended version that is more than 25 minutes longer. There's also an audio commentary track by director Taylor Hackford.
Disc 2 contains 14 deleted scenes, as well as uncut versions of two of the film's musical performances, one of which is Ray and the Raelettes doing "Hit the Road, Jack." There's also a 10-minute featurette about Jamie Foxx getting into the role of Ray Charles that includes a little footage of the actor, who plays piano, working on his keyboard technique with the famous musician he portrays. In addition, there's a four-minute featurette where various people remember Ray Charles, who died in June of 2004. Also, there's a 3-minute-20-second featurette called "A Look Inside Ray" that's essentially a mini-making-of.
Below I've listed all the special features of the "Ray" DVD set.
