Early career
After graduation from the Saint Augustine School, Charles traveled         across Florida and performed with country and western bands. It was an         experience that helped him later, when he added western songs to his         performances. Shortly afterward he began touring with rhythm-and-blues         bands, arranging and composing music as well as playing the piano,         clarinet, and saxophone. In order to avoid being confused with boxing         champion Ray Robinson (1921–1989), he dropped his last name and         became known as Ray Charles.
Charles grew tired of Florida and decided to use his savings to go as         far away as possible.           He wound up in Seattle, Washington, where he formed a band called the         McSon Trio, which eventually had its own local television show. He also         made several records for the Swingtime record company. In 1950 he moved         to Los Angeles, California (where Swingtime was based), and continued to         record and perform.
As a singer, blues singers Guitar Slim (1926–1959) and Percy         Mayfield influenced Charles. At the piano, the jazz arrangements of         Lloyd Glenn influenced him. The influence of gospel music was always         present in his style. Charles's singing of romantic songs         continued in the smooth tradition of Nat "King" Cole         (1917–1965), but was boosted by deep-throated growls and high         notes that were often thought to be coming from a female voice. His         strong voice, his mixing of styles, and his skill as a musician gave him         international appeal, but for an English-speaking audience his         storytelling power added something extra that made Charles stand out         from other artists.
Invented soul music
In 1954 a recording session with Atlantic Records combined gospel with         rhythm-and-blues and established Charles's "sweet new         style" in American music. Charles used the forms of both gospel         music and standard blues in recording such songs as "My Jesus Is         All the World to Me," "I Got a Woman," and "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand." Charles referred to his         invention of soul music as a combination of jazz and gospel. He         continued to tour, spending most of the 1950s on the road.
In 1959, on the ABC-Paramount label, Charles recorded his famous "Georgia on My Mind," which later became the official song         of the state of Georgia. Charles won ten Grammy Awards from the National         Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. In 1976 he recorded songs from         George Gershwin's (1898–1937) Porgy and Bess with Cleo Laine. A television ad for Pepsi in the 1990s helped make         sure that Charles would be known to a new generation of music lovers. He         also kept the albums coming, including My World, The Best of Ray Charles: The Atlantic Years, and Love Affair. He also appeared in films such as Ballad in Blue, The Blues Brothers, Limit Up, and Spy Hard.
Views on Elvis
In 1994 Charles appeared on the NBC news show Now, admitting that "I'm probably going to lose at least a         third of my fans," when he told interviewer Bob Costas         (1952–) that Elvis Presley (1935–1977) had just copied         what African American artists were already doing. "To say that         Elvis was … 'the king,' I don't think of         Elvis like that because I know too many artists that were far greater         than Elvis." While this statement caused a stir, it was known         that rock music, especially in its early years, was heavily rooted in         blues. Many rock artists performed and became popular by playing music         that originally belonged to African American blues singers.
Later years
Charles is married to the former Della Altwine, herself a gospel singer,         with whom he has three children. He is also good friends with Stevie         Wonder (1950–), Quincy Jones (1933–), and other musicians.         Yet there is always a feeling of loneliness in his music that is,         perhaps, best reflected in his recordings with Betty Carter         (1930–1998) and his recordings from Porgy and Bess. Charles put it best himself in a 1989 Downbeat interview with Jeff Levinson: "Music is my breathing.         That's my           apparatus. I've been doing it for 40 years. And I'm going         to do it until God himself says, 'Brother Ray, you've been         a nice horse, but now I'm going to put you out to         pasture.'"
Ray Charles also remains in the news for his generous donations to         educational institutions. In 2000 he gave Wilberforce University in Ohio         a two-million-dollar gift to fund music scholarships, and in 2001 he         donated one million dollars to all-black Morehouse College in Atlanta,         Georgia. Both universities awarded honorary degrees (received without         having met the usual requirements) to Charles. Charles also appeared in         Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001 to promote a new line of slot machines that         the Alliance Gaming Corporation had created for the blind to use.
