 
Ray Charles Heroin Addiction
Ray Charles had many challenges to overcome in the music industry.                  He was an African American trying to break into a world dominated                  by white men. He was blind, growing up in poverty, and struggling                  to make his way in the world. There were many challenges that                  he faced growing up that few people could even fathom and yet                  he appeared to do so with style, elegance, and grace.
 
 
Yet Ray Charles also succumbed to the powerful temptations of                  drugs when he became addicted to heroin. It is commonly reported                  that he developed this powerful, and dangerous, addiction shortly                  after the death of his beloved mother in 1946.
Ray Charles's story of addiction is somewhat different than the                  average drug addict's. The reason for this is that, while he seemed                  to attempt to rehab from time to time, he didn't make any major                  concerted effort until his third drug bust for possession, which                  took place in Boston in 1964, led him to finally decide to quit.
Heroin is one of the most powerfully addictive drugs
What makes his story so much different than most others who have                  become addicted to heroin is that the drug itself alters the neural                  pathways in the brain. In other words, the drug itself causes                  a physical change in the brain, which usually means that the body                  actually needs to the drug to function. In some of today's rehab                  clinics, heroin addicts are prescribed methadone in order to stay                  away from the more devastating and dangerous drug heroin.
Ray Charles, however, entered a drug clinic in L.A. in 1964 and                  walked out clean and sober. He didn't require any follow up and                  basically quit the most dangerous and addictive drug cold turkey.                  He once stated that quitting smoking for him was much harder than                  quitting heroin.
Not without his staples
Of course, Ray Charles did have one minor addiction that remained                  with him long after his heroin using days were over and that was                  coffee with a splash of gin added, daily. Considering the life                  that Ray Charles led from early childhood, and then comparing                  that upbringing and the struggles that he endured to musicians                  and other celebrities today who live a charmed life for the most part from their childhood through adult life, it is remarkable                  that someone with so many obstacles, pain, and sacrifice laid                  out before him could quit so readily after so many years.
This leads us back to the principle that a person must want to                  quit using drugs or alcohol before any type of rehab will be effective.                  If there is no desire to improve or to better one's life, then                  there will be no chance at living that kind of dream.
Ray Charles in life stands as a testimony to the power of will                  over substance abuse. He is one of the leaders in famous                  celebrity recoveries . It is a mystery why some people can                  stop cold turkey and just walk away from drug and alcohol addiction                  the rest of their lives while others are in and out of rehab until                  the day they die.
Ray Charles, in overcoming his addiction, provides an inspiring                  story of hope to millions who suffer with similar substance abuse                  problems.
