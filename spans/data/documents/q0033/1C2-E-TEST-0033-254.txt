AS A KID IFELT THIS WAS THE GREATEST SONG EVER SUNG. AS A MARINE, RAY MAKES ME BELIEVE IN WHAT/WHO I FIGHT FOR. THERE IS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT MUSIC WHEN HEARING HIM SING THIS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH AND WILL FOREVER GO THROUGH HARDSHIPS AS A PEOPLE AGAINST OURSELVES. AS MUCH AS AN OXYMORON AS THESE WORDS SAY, AT THE LEAST, FOR 3-4 MINUTES, ONE MAN SCORNED, FORGAVE A NATION THAT HATED TO LOVE HIM. I AM PROUD TO SAY I AM A UNITED STATES MARINE. GOD BLESS ALL THAT YOU'VE TOUCHED RAY CHARLES ROBINSON
