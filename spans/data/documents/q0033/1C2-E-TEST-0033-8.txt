Blue’s Clues: Blue’s Big Musical Movie
Blue bounds into her first feature-length film ready to sing.  She gets  sidetracked along the way, of course, but that’s part of the  brilliant Blue’s Clues formula. Each half-hour TV show presents engaging, easy-to-grasp  mini-mysteries that are within toddlers’ reach. This time  Blue; her  huge-eyed, slightly loopy human companion, Steve; and their  cadre of  talking-object friends are scurrying around, preparing for a  backyard  music show that day. Everybody picks a number to perform;  Blue’s is a  duet with Tickety Tock, but the clock contracts laryngitis.  Who will be  Blue’s new partner? A game of Blue’s Clues reveals the  hardly  reluctant replacement. The standard discovery of three clues  followed  by the usual wind-down song would add up to a colossal  disappointment  in a feature film, so substantial rounding-out is  provided. Steve  stumbles onto a keyboard inhabited by a note called  G-Clef (the  unmistakable voice of Ray Charles), who gives a tour of how  to make a  song. First you pick the notes, then you work on rhythm, then  comes  tempo, and, last but not least, “you’ve got to give it soul.” This  movie’s themes include perseverance (Tickety Tock can’t sing but  finds a  way to contribute anyway) and self-empowerment. Blue’s Big  Musical Movie is a feast for little eyes and ears; the sets are so  colorful they  hurt grown-up eyes, and the songs–especially the one  that gets the  Charles treatment–are all sing-along-with-me winners. –Tammy La Gorce, Amazon.com
