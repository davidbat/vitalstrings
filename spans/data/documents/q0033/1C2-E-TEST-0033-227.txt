From 1980-1987, he had a string of Country chart hits including "Seven Spanish Angels" (1985, with Willie Nelson).  His backup musicians included the Raeletts (a.k.a. the Cookies) and the Jack Halloran Singers.  He also performed duets with jazz singer Betty Carter.  His last charted song was in 1993, "A Song For You," for which he received his 12th Grammy.
