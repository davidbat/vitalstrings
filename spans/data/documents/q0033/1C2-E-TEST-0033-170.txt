Ray Charles
The unique style of this music icon won him fans for more almost half a century, since his first charted hit, Swanee River Rock.  Two years later What'd I Say became his first top ten hit.  In October, 1960, his cover of the Hoagy Carmichael tune, Georgia on My Mind would become his first number one hit and the only state song to hit number one.  He followed this with two more records that went to number one, Hit the Road, Jack and I Can't Stop Loving You, which is today considered his signature song.  Over the years Ray became involved in other art forms, most notably acting.  His performance of Georgia on Sesame Street is considered a classic moment for this television show.
According to the hit movie Ray, Charles was banned from performing in Georgia in 1961, following his refusal to play to a white-only audience. Mr. Charles was never banned from performing in his home state of Georgia. In 1979 the General Assembly did welcome him. He sang the classic Hoagy Carmichel song "Georgia."
