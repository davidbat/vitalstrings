Fans of Ray Charles, some bringing flowers and others clutching well-worn copies of old albums, came by the thousands Thursday to file past the singer's casket and piano at a public viewing in a sunny atrium of the Los Angeles Convention Center. The 73-year-old singer will be eulogized today by his family and famous peers at a private service at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. But the eight-hour viewing on Thursday gave his fans a chance to say goodbye to the iconic performer.

Ghostwriter David Ritz works to give his writing real voices
June 10, 2012 | By Patrick Goldstein, Los Angeles Times
There are hundreds of spirited musical tales in "When I Left Home," Buddy Guy's new autobiography, which offers a colorful account of his 50-year-long tenure as perhaps the most influential guitar slinger in Chicago blues. One of the best comes when the young Guy, having recently headed north from Louisiana in the late 1950s to make his fortune, meets Muddy Waters, the reigning pasha of Chicago's blues scene, sitting in a red Chevy wagon parked behind a club, eating cold cuts.      "His dark skin had a glow," Guy recalls.

December 8, 2011 | Times staff and wire reports

Ray Charles' heavenly trio: Leroy 'Hog' Cooper, David 'Fathead' Newman and Hank Crawford
February 22, 2009 | David Ritz, Ritz has collaborated on the autobiographies of, among others, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin and B.B. King.
In summer 1957, I was a teenager who had just moved to Texas from the East Coast. One Sunday afternoon, I happened to walk into a large social hall in South Dallas where a jam session was underway. On the bandstand were three saxophonists: Leroy "Hog" Cooper on baritone, David "Fathead" Newman on tenor and Hank Crawford on alto. Their playing shook me to my very core. Through their horns, they shouted out a blues with the ferocity of a Blind Lemon Jefferson or a Bessie Smith.

Ray Charles Proud To Be A Legend
December 24, 1986 | LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Times Staff Writer
You need only hear a note or two of one of his vocals to recognize Ray Charles. Like the late Louis Armstrong, he's an artist who so dominates his form that he displaces everyone around him. He's instant public domain, which is as good a reason as any for his being honored in Friday's telecast of the Kennedy Center Awards (others on the list are Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Yehudi Menuhin, Antony Tudor and Lucille Ball). It airs at 9 p.m. Friday on CBS.

Quick Takes
September 25, 2010
'Judge Judy' tops 'Oprah'         "Judge Judy" won a ratings verdict over "Oprah" last season to rank No. 1 among daytime series.       According to Nielsen figures, Judy Sheindlin's courtroom show averaged 6.3 million daily viewers, compared with 5.7 million for Oprah Winfrey's talk show. "Judge Judy" became the first show to knock "Oprah" out of the top spot in a decade — and it was "Judge Judy" that did it the last time too.       Winfrey relied on more reruns than usual last season, which affected her ratings.
