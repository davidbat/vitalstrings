Ray Charles
Ray Charles virtually invented soul music by bringing together the fervor of gospel, the secular lyrics and narratives of blues and country, the big-band arrangements of jazz, and the rhythms and improvisational possibilities from all of them. His music was both sophisticated and spontaneous, and over the course of his 50-year career, Charles penned dozens of classic R&B and rock numbers.
