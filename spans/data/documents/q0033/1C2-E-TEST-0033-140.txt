Show synopsis In 1963, just before he turned 33 years old, Ray Charles brought his band to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for a special show which was filmed for a television special. Forty-one years later, Rhino Home Video discovered the rare footage of the Brazilian concert, which had never been shown in the United States; Ray Charles: O Genio - Live In Brazil presents the special just as originally broadcast, complete with Brazilian television commercials and a superb performance by Charles. Selections include "Hit The Road, Jack," "What'd I Say," "Hallelujah I Love Her So," "I Can't Stop Loving You," "You Don't Know Me," and many more. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi Hide synopsis
