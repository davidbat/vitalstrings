*Cosign* The Mistress did him dirty. you were stealing from the blind…woman like this make it okay for men to degrade women and think after spending a few dollars they can get the business. He was a womanizer, but you were just a side **** that caught feelings for his money. Not, the man like himself the only woman who got hurt out of the situation and rightly should be was his wife, and children. He was a talented man, and I understand he had a disability, but that doesn’t justify how he treated women.
