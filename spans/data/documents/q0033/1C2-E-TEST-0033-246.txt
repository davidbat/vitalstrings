USA 1931
My favorite Charlie Chaplin  feature (1931) -- his first sound picture, but not, properly speaking, his first  talkie--is also probably the one on which he exercised the most patience and  perfectionism, with almost two years of shooting, countless retakes, and a  recasting of the female lead (with Georgia Hale, his female lead in The  Gold Rush, eventually replaced by Virginia Cherrill, who was herself  subsequently fired and rehired, as the blind flower-selling street waif who  believes Chaplin’s Tramp is a millionaire). It’s also quite likely the Chaplin  feature that can boast the best DVD extras, including one brilliant seven-minute  gag sequence that Chaplin deleted because it interfered with the film’s overall  architecture. Interestingly enough, and significantly, the tragic final  sequence, in close-ups, rightly regarded as the most emotionally wrenching  sequence in Chaplin’s career, is edited in such a way that it has glaring  continuity errors, none of which matter in the slightest because of the power of  his performance.
