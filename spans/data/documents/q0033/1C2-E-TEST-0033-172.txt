Ray                Charles
Biography
Ray Charles                  Robinson was born Sept. 23, 1930, in Albany, Ga. Ray later quit                  using his last name because there was already a famous Ray Robinson,                  the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. Ray's father, Bailey Robinson, was                  a mechanic and a handyman, and his mother, Aretha, stacked boards                  in a sawmill. His family moved to Gainesville, Fla., when Charles                  was an infant.
Ray Charles endured                  many challenges in his youth. Like many families during the depression,                  his family struggled with poverty. His younger brother drowned                  when Charles was 5 and by age 7 little Ray Charles had lost his                  sight. It has been speculated that it was as a result of glaucoma                  but at the time there wasn't any specific diagnosis.
Ray Charles was sent                  away to the state-supported St. Augustine School for the Deaf                  and the Blind, where he learned to read and write music in Braille.                  Blind kids study by reading the music with their fingers. Charles                  would read three or four bars of music with his fingers, and then                  play it. Unlike those with sight, a blind person can't just sit                  there and play as they read the music. First they must learn the                  bars of music, practice it, and then play it and memorize it.
Charles wasn't able                  to get into piano class at first because it was full. Charles                  admired Clarinet player Artie Shaw so the first instrument he                  learned how to play was the clarinet. Later he was able to get                  into the piano class and he also learned how to play alto sax,                  trumpet and organ.
When he was 15 his                  mother died and he left St. Augustine to pursue his musical destiny.                  Charles played at black dance halls around Florida, nearly starving                  at times. In 1948 he wanted to move to a new place as far away                  from Florida as he could. Charles ended up in Seattle where he                  met a young Quincy Jones and formed a lifelong friendship. Charles                  played a major role in the Jones 1985 recording of USA for Africa's "We Are the World."
Early on Charle's style                  was influenced by Nat "King" Cole. Charles had a major                  R&B hit in 1949 with "Confession Blues" on the Downbeat                  (later Swing Time) label. During this early time he developed                  a dependency on heroin which continued until he stopped cold turkey                  in 1965. Charles has seldom talked about his heroin addiction,                  instead wanting the public to focus on his music.
Over the years Ray                  Charles developed his own unique sound, a blend of blues, R&B                  and gospel. Charle's musical genius was noticed early and he had                  several record company contracts and played at the Apollo, Carnegie                  Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival.
In the 1960's Charles                  started appearing in films and recorded soundtracks such as The                  Cincinnati Kid (1965) and In the Heat of the Night (1967). Charles                  also performed at nightclubs during this time.
In 1978 Dial Press                  published his autobiography, "Brother Ray." In his autobiography                  Ray Charles stated, "I was born with music inside me. That's                  the only explanation I know of... Music was one of my parts ...                  like my blood. It was a force already with me when I arrived on                  the scene. It was a necessity for me, like food or water."
In 1980 Charles appeared                  in The Blues Brothers movie and scored a minor country hit for                  his duet with Clint Eastwood, "Beers to You," from the                  film Any Which Way You Can. Clint Eastwood has been a long admirer                  of Ray Charles and developed a close friendship with him. It was                  Eastwood who presented Charles with his last award in 2004, when                  Charles' recording studios were designated an official city historic                  landmark.
1n 1989 Charles had                  his first major pop hit in over twenty years with with "I'll                  Be Good to You," featuring himself and Chaka Khan. In the                  '90s Charles appeared in commercials for Pepsi and was the subject                  of a PBS documentary.
Charles won nine of                  his 12 Grammy Awards, winning his last Grammy in 1993 for Best                  R&B Male Vocal Performance, "A Song For You."
Being born into the                  segregated south in 1930 Charles was aware of the evil of racial                  injustice. Ray Charles knew that since he wasn't able to know                  when to duck when bottles would be thrown at his head, that it                  was better for him to help raise money to fight racial injustice.                  Charles did this for Martin Luther King Jr. and other groups around                  the world.
Commenting on being                  black and blind Charles said, "I knew being blind was suddenly                  an aid. I never learned to stop at the skin. If I looked at a                  man or a woman, I wanted to see inside. Being distracted by shading                  or coloring is stupid. It gets in the way. It's something I just                  can't see."
One of Charles' most                  treasured awards is the 1976 "Man of the Year" Award                  from Beverly Hills Lodge of B'nai Brith. Charles said, "If                  someone besides a black ever sings the real gut bucket blues,                  it'll be a Jew. We both know what it's like to be someone else's                  footstool."
On a personal note,                  Charles was legendary ladie's man and has 12 children and 20 grandchildren.
The last public appearance                  by Ray Charles was April 39, 2004 alongside Clint Eastwood and                  Cicely Tyson at his beloved Central Los Angeles recording studios.                  The city of Los Angeles honored music legend Ray Charles, by designatng                  his Edifice Complex an official city historic landmark. The Grammy                  winner's recording studios, were built 40 years ago in Central                  Los Angeles. The building, located at 2107 W. Washington Blvd,                  has served as his office and studio since being built in 1962.
The Ray Charles Story,                  will be released in October 2004, starring Jamie Fox as the musical                  legend.
