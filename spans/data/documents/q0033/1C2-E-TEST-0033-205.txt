b.        Ray Charles Robinson, 23rd September 1930, Albany, Georgia, U.S.A.
d.10th        June 2004, Beverly Hills, California, U.S.A.
Ray        Charles has been described by many writers as 'A Genius' and the 'Father        of Soul Music'.
Ray        was born into extreme poverty.
He        was slowly blinded by glaucoma until, at the age of six, he had lost his        sight completely.
Whilst        he could still use his eyesight, he had to cope with the tragic death of        his brother, whom he had seen drown in a water tub.
Ray        studied composition and learned several instruments at the St. Augustine        School for the Deaf and the Blind.
His        mother Aretha died when Ray was 15, and he was brought up by Mary Jane (the        first wife of Ray's absent father).
Ray        worked as a musician in Florida for a while before using his savings to        move to Seattle in 1947.
Here        he continued his career, playing piano at several nightclubs.
Ray        began recording in 1949, with several of these sessions being released several        years later.
He        achieved his first Top Ten R & B hit with 'Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand'        in 1951.
In        1952, Atlantic Records recruited Ray.
'It        Should've Been Me', 'Mess Around' and 'Losing Hand' were released at this        time and Ray began working with Guitar Slim in New Orleans.
Ray        arranged Guitar Slim's million-selling single, 'Things That I Used To Do',        a song that was later to influence Ray's own personal stylings.
He, also, put together a group for the R & B singer Ruth        Brown .
It        was at Atlantic Records that Ray released 'I Got a Woman', a number two        R & B hit in 1955.
Ray        released further recordings, including 'This Little Girl Of Mine' in 1955,        'Talkin' 'Bout You' in 1957 and 'Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying' in        1959.
Later that year, Ray released the energetic, 'What'd I Say', a song that        became his first Top Ten pop hit, and one of his final Atlantic singles,        as he left the label in November 1959 for the ABC imprint.
The        ABC deal for Ray gave him a greater degree of artistic control over his        recordings.
Here        he released 'Georgia On My Mind', in 1960, and 'Hit The Road Jack' the following        year.
In 1962, Ray released a Country and Western album entitled 'Modern Sounds        In Country And Western', topping the charts with the single 'I Can't Stop        Loving You'.
Further        successful Sixties releases included the songs 'Busted', 'I Don't Need No        Doctor', 'You Are My Sunshine', 'Take These Chains From My Heart', and 'Crying        Time', however, Ray was arrested in 1965 for heroin possession.
He recorded the song 'Let's Go Get Stoned' in 1966.
Ray's        career faded at this time as much of his output became seen as MOR.
In        1967, Ray sang the title song for the Norman Jewison / Rod Steiger / Sidney        Poitier move 'In The Heat Of The Night', with Ray working alongside the        artist Quincy Jones .
He        also covered Beatles songs at this time, having substantial hits with his        own versions of 'Yesterday' and 'Eleanor Rigby'.
Ray        influenced many Rock artists including Joe Cocker, Van Morrison and Steve        Winwood in particular.
During        the 1970's, 'A Message From The People' and 'Renaissance' were released        and included versions of Stevie Wonder's 'Living In The City' and Randy Newman's 'Sail Away'.
In        the 1980's, Ray released more and more Country and Western influenced outings.
He        also made a cameo appearance in the film 'The Blues Brothers', and contributed        to the U.S.A. For Africa release, 'We Are The World' in 1985.
Ray        has been honoured with several awards during his career including the Lifetime        Achievement Award.
In        1992, 'Ray Charles, The Genius Of Soul', was broadcast by CBS television.
'My        World' was released on Warner Brothers in 1993 and included his version        of Leon Russell's 'A Song For You'.
The        album was seen to be a real return to form by the music pundits.
Ray        returned to the recording studio in 2002 with the release of 'Thanks For        Bringing Love Around Again', which included a re-working of his classic        tune 'What'd I Say'.
In        June 2004, Ray died at the age of 73 from acute liver disease. A major loss        to Soul Music.
