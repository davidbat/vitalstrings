This was written by Ray's good friend Percy Mayfield, an R&B singer who was badly disfigured in a car accident soon after he started performing. Mayfield cut back his touring and made his mark as a prolific songwriter, with many of his compositions performed by Charles.
This was the second (and shortest, at an even two minutes) of Charles' 3 #1 hits.
The solo backing vocals were by Margie Hendricks, who was one of Ray's backup singers, The Raelettes. They were lovers for a time, but the song is not about their relationship. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)
The continuing popularity of this song is evident by the many professional and semi-professional hockey teams playing the first few lines whenever a player is sent to the penalty box.
This was the winner of the 1961 Grammy for Best Male Rhythm and Blues Recording. (thanks, Brad Wind - Miami, FL, for above 2)
Canadian group The Stampeders, best known for their hit " Sweet City Woman ," released a novelty version of this song in 1976 that featured a telephone conversation with disc jockey Wolfman Jack. Their version hit #40 in the US. (thanks, Cole - Moose Jaw, Sk)
