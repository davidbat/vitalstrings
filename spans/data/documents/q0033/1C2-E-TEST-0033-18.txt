Ray (Charles): Legend's 'Genius Loves Company' Ships 3 Million Copies for Holiday Exhibit on Ray Charles at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame And Museum
Genius Loves Company, the final recording from music legend Ray Charles, is now officially multi-platinum. The CD, a permanent fixture at the top of the Billboard charts since its debut, has shipped more than two million copies in the United States and more than three million copies worldwide, in only three months since release.
To date, it has received Gold, Silver and Platinum certifications across North America, Europe and beyond and is the best selling recording of Ray Charles' six-decade career. The considerable sales of Genius Loves Company were facilitated in part by a unique distribution and marketing relationship between Concord Records and Starbucks Hear MusicÂ™ label.
Also, exclusively at Starbucks, beginning Dec. 1st an exclusive Ray Charles boxed set pairs Genius Loves Company and his greatest hits CD Visionary Soul, with a special edition Ray Charles Starbucks Card.
The landmark CD-Charles' 250th recording effort-features the multi-talented musician performing new duets with such world renowned artists as Natalie Cole, Elton John, Norah Jones, B.B. King, Gladys Knight, Diana Krall, Michael McDonald, Johnny Mathis, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt and James Taylor.
It was completed just months before Charles passed away on June 10. The Rock Hall exhibit opening today is titled "The Genius of Ray Charles" and is scheduled to remain on display into the summer of 2005. This collection of historic Charles memorabilia has never been seen by the public or left his very private Los Angeles headquarters.
Among the items that visitors will see up close are the entertainer's amazing collection of awards, from all over the world; his famed stage wardrobe, meticulously designed, catalogued and coded by Charles and his manager, Joe Adams; a sampling of his legendary music charts, including "Georgia" and "I Can't Stop Loving You"; his original chess board (Charles was a champion player); and many other items.
