Mary J. Blige wrote and recorded a brand new original song titled ‘The Living Proof’ especially for The Help after she saw a screening of the film, which takes place in 1960s-era Mississippi and chronicles the journey of three very different women who come together and embark on a secret writing project that breaks societal rules and puts them all at risk.

The Help – “The Living Proof” by Mary J. Blige
“The beautiful thing about these women is that they were very smart. They chose to walk in love and forgiveness.
[...]
To speak to so many women with this song means a lot to me. I wanted to be involved with this film, because I think we need to encourage each other more, we are here to tell a story.”
Singer Mary J. Blige
