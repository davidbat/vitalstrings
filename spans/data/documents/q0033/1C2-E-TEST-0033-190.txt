He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm and blues , gospel , and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records . He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records , most notably with his Modern Sounds albums. While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company. Frank Sinatra called Charles “the only true genius in show business.”
