What is a Good Credit Score?
There are two main credit score models used today. Here are each credit score ranges.
FICO Score Model 300-850
Vantage Score Model  501-990
Most lenders use the Fico Score Model when pulling your credit report. The banks trust this algorithm for dictating your credit risk for loans
Vantage Score is a model that was introduced by Experian, TransUnion and Equifax in 2006. This model only has about 6% of the market share.

The following credit score ranges are bracketed by credit score range. These credit score ranges are created by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which pass along fees to banks for these particular ranges. The fees ultimately get passed on to the consumer in the form of higher interest rates
740 -850 Credit Score
This credit score range is considered excellent credit. Some creditors will give better interest rates when you have a credit score that is 740 or better. Typically most consider a 720 credit score or higher low risk.
720-739 Credit Score
This credit score range is still considered excellent credit. You will get the best interests with most banks that are available as long as you qualify. Keep in mind that a credit score 740 or above usually will get a .25% better interest rate.
680-699 Credit Score
A score in this range typically means you may either have some past issues, or possible high credit card debt. With this credit score range getting a loan is typically not a problem. Your interest rate will be higher though.
660-679 Credit Score
This credit score range is still not considered bad. You may have a few old collections lingering around on your credit report. You may also have a recent late payment causing your credit score to drop 20 points or so. You will not get the best rates available with this credit score range with most banks.
640-659 Credit Score
If your credit score is in this range you are playing with fire. You are on the verge of getting denied for most types of credit. This type of credit range typically means you have collections, slow pays, and even high credit card debt that could cause a creditor to deny your loan inquiry.
620-639 Credit Score
This credit score range means your personal credit is challenged. You definitely need to start working on fixing your credit. You may consider settling with your creditors or maybe paying down debt. You more than likely have some good credit with some bad credit mixed in.
< 620 Credit Score A credit score below this range will get you denied for most types of credit. Most creditors will consider your credit ranges a high risk of default. This credit score range typically involves lots of collections, charge offs, slow pays and maybe a public record. If you find a bank willing to lend you money your interest rate will be as high as the law will allow. The bank will try to make as much money as they can incase you default due to your credit risk.
Credit Report Statistics
The 3 main credit bureaus Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion currently hold 2002 million credit files. Roughly 172 million of these files contain enough information to generate a credit score.

This survey also showed that 70% of the overall credit reports had errors or some type of mistake on them.
