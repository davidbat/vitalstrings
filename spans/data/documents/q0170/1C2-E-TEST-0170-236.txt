*Offer Details: When you order your free credit score, you must            activate a membership with            CreditReportsAndScores.com, which            includes credit monitoring by the three            national credit repositories: Experian,            TransUnion and Equifax. If you cancel            within 7 days of activating your            membership by calling 1-866-974-6188 you            will pay nothing. After the 7 day            trial period, you will automatically be            charged/debited a monthly membership fee            of $14.95, plus tax where applicable,            for each month you remain a member. The first charge will occur on the 8th            day after activating your membership and            each successive charge/debit will occur            approximately every 30 days            thereafter. After the 7 day trial            period, you may also cancel your            membership at any time and you will not            be further billed.  To cancel your            membership, visit the My Account tab on            your dashboard at the            CreditReportsAndScores.com website.            Monitoring begins the Sunday after your            activation. Therefore, in some cases,            monitoring will not be part of your free            trial.
