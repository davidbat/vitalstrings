Help if you don’t know your union
Your union membership dictates which Union Plus benefits you are eligible to use.
What your national union’s name (not just your local number)? Scroll through the list we have to see if you recognize your union.
What type of work do you do (select your occupation)?
Do you have a union member card or union publication/letter that shows the name of your union? Find something with the name of your union, not just a local number.
Is there a shop steward or work colleague you can ask what the name of your union is? You can even ask your human resources department to tell you the full name of your union?
Do you have a Union Plus Credit Card? If so, the name and logo for your international union should appear on the front of the card.

I am a Union Plus Credit Cardholder (?)
Union Plus Credit Card
Union members are automatically eligible for their union's Union Plus benefits and you do not need to be a Union Plus Credit Cardholder in order to access your union's Union Plus benefits.
But - if you are a Union Plus Credit Cardholder, you could be eligible for additional discounts.
