Get your free credit score through Alliant Online Banking
As a valuable part of membership, Alliant provides members their credit score free of charge
Your credit score is a key indicator of your creditworthiness, representing the likelihood to meet or become delinquent on a credit obligation in the future. A high credit score may save you thousands of dollars in interest and premiums if you’re in the market to open a credit card, get a loan, and obtain insurance. Use this credit score to help you monitor and improve your credit worthiness.
We will update your credit score quarterly. This is not a hard pull and will not impact your credit rating.
Keep in mind, there are many different credit scoring systems with different scales; a “good” credit score depends on the scoring system. The credit score displayed in Alliant Online Banking is VantageScore®. It was developed by the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union). Unlike other scoring models, the VantageScore uses one set of calculations for all three bureaus, resulting in a more uniform and consistent score. This model weighs your payment history, credit utilization, outstanding balances, depth of credit, recent credit, and available credit to calculate your credit score.
It is based on a traditional A, B, C, D, and F rating scale. Your score is measured in a numeric range, from 501 to 990.
