Credit scores are calculated numbers that assess an individual's credit worthiness.  They are based off a person's history of credit.  Creditors and lenders use credit scores to assess a credit applicant's credit risk and to determine the terms of financing. A high credit score often indicates good credit, which leads to favorable lending terms.  It is good practice to periodically check one's credit and credit score.  This helps ensure accurate reporting by the credit bureaus and it helps build a strong credit profile.
Credit monitoring services keep users updated on credit-related activities or transactions.  FreeCreditScore.com provides this service through its Triple Advantage service.
