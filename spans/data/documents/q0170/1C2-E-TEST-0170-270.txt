About Your Credit Report And Score
Your credit         report is a record of your past borrowing and         repaying activities, including information about         late payments and bankruptcy. The report will         usually contain your social security number, date of         birth and employment information. And Your credit         score is a three-digit number that is used to         predict how you will pay your bills. Several factors         are taken into consideration when calculating your         credit scores. And these factors include; your past         payment history, current debts, credit inquiries, length of your         credit history, the number of new credit accounts, other public records and collection Items. You can safeguard yourself and help fight identity theft by monitoring and reviewing         your credit report. It is suggested that you obtain         and review your credit report at least once a year,         but if you ever feel that your information may have         been compromised, you need to check your report as quickly as         possible.
People often         ask: will checking my credit report lower my score? The         answer to this question is absolutely not! Reviewing your         credit report for personal use will not lower your credit rating         or score.
