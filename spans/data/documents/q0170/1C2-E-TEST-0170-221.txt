Your Experian Credit Score
Your Experian credit score can help you to understand how lenders view your credit report .
Before deciding whether or not to lend money, many organisations take your          Experian credit report, plus additional information from your application          form, and generate a credit score. This score predicts the risk involved in          granting you credit.
Calculating your score
Every lender uses a slightly different credit scoring formula that represents          its own and industry experience. This may be adjusted according to the type of          credit you are applying for. So every credit application could generate a          different credit score.
Credit scoring is designed to predict how likely you are to repay a loan and to          make your repayments on time. Over the years, automated credit scoring has proved          to be more accurate and consistent than subjective human judgement.
Credit scores range from 0 to 999. A higher score suggests that you will probably          find it easier to borrow money or buy goods on credit. Knowing your existing credit          score could help you take steps to improve it.
Your credit score will also change over time as the information in your credit history and on your          credit application form changes, the credit score changes too.  You should check          your Experian Credit Score regularly, so you keep up to date with your credit rating .
