Credit scores are not part of a credit report and there isn't just one score. Because credit reports don't rate your history, lenders use many different scoring models with different scoring ranges to help guide their decision to grant you credit and how to price it. When you review a score, don't focus on the number, but where you fall in the range of risk and what factors in your history most influenced the score. Those will be consistent no matter which scoring model is used.
Closing unused accounts can hurt your credit scores. While never missing a payment is the most important factor in having good credit, having a low balance-to-limit ratio is also important. If you close unused cards, you eliminate those open credit limits from your ratio, possibly making you "charged to the max" on your remaining cards.
A short sale may get you out of your mortgage, but doesn't get you out of the loan without consequences. Selling your home for less than the loan amount is typically reported as a "settled" account, meaning that you did not pay as agreed. That can be as negative to your credit history as a foreclosure, but for many homeowners is the best way to get out of a bad situation.
