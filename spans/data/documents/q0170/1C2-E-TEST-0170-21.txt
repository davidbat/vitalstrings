How Your Credit Score Affects Your Loan Interest Rates
Your Credit. Your Responsibility.
We aren’t supposed to judge a book by its cover, but financial institutions will judge you by your credit score. If you need to borrow money for any reason, that’s what the lender will be looking at. With a sub-par credit score, you can expect to pay higher interest and therefore, higher payments, than if you would if you had a better score.
Want to Improve Your Credit Score? Here Are Some Tips!
Stay On Top of Your Credit Score: Get a copy of your credit report once a year. Make sure all of the information is valid and correct.
Stay Current On Your Bills: Late payments are a quick way to damage your credit score.
Stay Current With FICO and Credit Scoring Systems: Knowing how your score is calculated is a big step in improving it.
Check Your Credit Report: If you see your report and find errors, report and correct them as soon as possible. But look out for scams that say they can fix your credit.
Don’t Overextend Yourself: Don’t go crazy with those credit cards. Do not max them out; instead, reduce the total balance, paying it off entirely when possible and avoid opening or closing accounts.
