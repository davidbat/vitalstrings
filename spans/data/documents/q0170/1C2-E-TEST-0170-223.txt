FICO Score
FICO scores are used in everyday life to determine whether somebody should be approved or denied for a loan or line of credit. This can range from something as simple as a credit or in store card to a major life decision such as a mortgage or small business loan. 
This score is also used to determine what rate of interest will be offered to you, the higher your score the lower your interest rate. The reverse is true, meaning that the lower your score the higher your interest rate. 
Because FICO scores are so linked to loans it's easy to forget that they are also used for other things. For example, some employers use them to determine whether an applicant should get a job or not. Another common use is to use them for tenant applications - if your score is to low you might find it hard to find somewhere to live. 
Free FICO Score
Now that you know how important FICO scores are, you're probably wondering how you can get one. There are plenty of companies out there that offer them - there are only a few that offer them for free. We've taken the legwork out of it though and below are two websites that offer free scores.
Creditreport - These guys are great, you get all three of your scores for free AND all three of your credit reports. All you need to do is enter your credit card information, they then bill you $1 which is then gifted to charity on your behalf. This signs you up to their  monitoring program - which is allows you unlimited access to your credit reports and credit scores along with daily monitoring. Thankfully you get 7 days for free, so all you need to do is cancel your account before that time is up. 
Freecreditscore - This works the same way, sign up to their credit monitoring program and as long as you cancelled within the 7 days you don't need to pay anything. The only difference is that you only get your Experian credit score.
