Our credit        department is a        licensed, bonded and registered Credit Service        Organization, specializing in credit repair. We have        over 16 years of experience in the credit repair        industry and are experts with extensive knowledge of the        methods used by credit bureaus and creditors allowing us        to maximize the results our clients receive. Credit        repair is much more than simply disputing a negative        item on your credit report and then hoping that the        creditor doesn't turn the response to the credit bureaus        with in 30 days. When this happens, it is simply a band        aid that more than likely will not last. If this was all        there was to credit repair, anyone could do it. To do it        properly with permanent results, it must be done        properly.
What is        Credit Repair?
It is        estimated that 90% of Americans have negative items        and/or mistakes on their credit reports such as,        collections, judgments, late payments, lie
ns,        inquiries and even duplicate items. All of these        negative items lower a persons credit score. It is legal        and it is every persons legal right to seek to have        mistakes, unverifiable items, inaccurate items and        incomplete items removed and deleted from their credit        reports.
How it        works?
We dispute        specific key details of our client's negative items with        the creditors and all of the credit bureaus as well as        all of the public record as it pertains to the nature        and origin of the trade line. The credit bureaus have        tight federal guidelines that requires strict        compliance.
Credit scores come from three different bureaus, which lenders use to view your credit history:Each credit bureau utilizes their own credit  software. Furthermore, your score  may vary depending on the reason you are checking your credit at that  time. If you are buying a car, your credit score may be different than when you  are seeking a mortgage, applying for a credit card, or getting your "free credit  report," and so on. When it comes  to credit, your history is vital to your future. Each and every decision you  have made and will make will have a noticeable and definite effect on your  ability to acquire financing and borrow money in the future.

And ultimately, that's what  lenders are all about: minimizing risk. Thus, if you want to improve your  chances of being seen as a "safe bet" to a lender and convince them that you  will repay your borrowed funds in a timely manner, you must maintain a solid  FICO® score. This score will determine what your interest rate will be, and if  you get a loan in the first place.
