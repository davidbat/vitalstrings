About Your Credit Score
Your credit score is calculated based on the information in your credit report. Credit scores allow lenders to quickly make on-the-spot credit decisions based  on a 3-digit number that sums up your credit worthiness. There are many credit scoring models in use today; all are designed to rate your  likelihood to repay your debts. When you order your credit score , you will also receive an analysis of the factors affecting your score.
Your credit report is a snapshot of your credit at a particular moment in time. However, in reality that information is  flowing in and out of your credit report all the time. Credit applications, home and auto loans, payments, an address change or even  an inquiry from a prospective creditor all show up on your credit report - and affect your credit score.
Credit history is the main determining factor of credit nowadays, but there are potential problems that can work against  consumers. Since some credit reports can contain inaccuracies serious enough to cause consumers to be denied credit, a loan or even a job,  keeping abreast of changes to your credit file is vitally important.
Monitoring your credit is one of the easiest and most effective ways of protecting your credit against errors and fraud.    CreditScore.com is a leader in providing free credit scores in a secure online environment.
