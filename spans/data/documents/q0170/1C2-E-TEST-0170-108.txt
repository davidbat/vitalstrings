A credit report unlike any other
We have changed the credit report forever.  We made it horizontal and easy to read.  Search or find anything quickly.
We added tabs to view more or less detail.  It’s even linked to your transactions from your online accounts.
Plus, use the Action buttons to ask your creditors anything without the need for phone calls or letters.
It also includes your credit score, auto score, insurance score and even a hiring risk index for job seekers.

The best Identity Theft Protection
Stop identity theft before it happens!  Get instant alerts to your phone or email that someone is applying for credit in your name.
Then use the Action button to stop the thieves.  You don't have to login, talk to anyone or fill out forms.  Just push the button.
If you see identity theft on your credit report, use the same Action button to tell your creditor to stop the account and remove any reporting of it.
