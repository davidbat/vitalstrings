There's NO SUCH THING as a credit blacklist!
Every lender has a 'perfect customer' wishlist, so if you are rejected by one, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll be rejected by another. To add to the confusion, scoring systems are never published and differ lender-to-lender, and product-to-product.
Plus the tools they use to decide aren't universal either; it's a mix of your past dealings with the company, the application form, and official 'credit files' from three credit agencies.
It's all about PROFIT not RISK
Lenders aren't obliged to dole out credit. Instead  decisions  revolve around how much money you're likely to make them. This means savvy  customers who always repay  in full, or shift debt to 0% cards to avoid interest may get rejected as the bank'll make no money!
Risk plays a part, as those unlikely to repay are a threat to profits. But banks exist to make money; grasp that and you can play the system.
Not checking your files can lead to major rejection!
You've a right to see your credit files for Â£2, plus you can do it for free (see full details ), and you should do it regularly. Check EVERY detail; people have been rejected because unused (but not cancelled) mobile contracts address hadn't been updated after a house move, so be vigilant. Plus check for products that aren't yours in case of ID fraud.
Always check before  making any big applications (eg, mortgage) to minimise your risk of rejection. Otherwise, yearly checks will let you keep a handle on your rating's health.
