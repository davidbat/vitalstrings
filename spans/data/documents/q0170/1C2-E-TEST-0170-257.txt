Credit Reports and Scores
Consumer credit reports are documents containing factual records of an individual's credit history.  Credit grantors are permitted by law to review all 3 credit reports to objectively determine  whether to grant a consumer credit. Lenders usually report consumer credit payment information to the credit bureaus. Most of the information in a consumer credit report comes directly from the companies consumers do business with.
Triple Credit Report and Score
A triple credit report contains credit report information from all 3 major credit bureaus  (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) combined into one easy-to-read report.
