How FICO Scores Work
When     you apply for credit - whether for a credit card, a car loan, or a     mortgage - lenders want to know what risk theyâ€™d take by loaning money     to you.
FICO scores are the credit scores most     lenders use to determine your credit risk. You have three FICO scores,     one for each of the three credit bureaus - Experian, TransUnion, and     Equifax. Each score is based on information the credit bureau keeps on     file about you. As this information changes, your credit scores tend to     change as well.
Your 3 FICO scores affect both how much and what loan terms (interest rate, etc.) lenders will offer you at any given time.
Taking steps to get your FICO scores in the higher ranges can help you qualify for better rates from lenders.
