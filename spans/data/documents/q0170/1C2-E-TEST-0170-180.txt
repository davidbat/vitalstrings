Protecting Yourself From Identity Theft
Identity theft is becoming extremely important, as my parents in their 50’s recently found out.  After looking at credit card statements, they realized their identities has been compromised when a lot of adult website charges were showing up on their bill.  Some how the carder (someone who uses stolen credit card numbers) got a hold of their number, tested the card to see if it worked (he did this by making a donation in a small amount to the Red Cross), then used it to buy adult memberships.  After this happened my parents asked me what they could do to prevent it.  I told them to change all of their online passwords for financial institutions, encrypt their wireless internet at home, opt out of pre-approved credit applications , and check their credit report regularly (which apparently they had never done).
One thing I suggested to them was to check out an identity theft protection service like Life Lock .  You might have seen their commercials which advertise their CEO’s social security number.  They do this to show you how much they stand by their product.  Life lock will take you off the pre-approved credit card list, which cuts down on unwanted mail and the likelihood of identity theft, free credit reports once a year, cover child’s identity theft too, offer a $1 million guarantee if your identity is ever stolen while you’re with Life Lock, and finally, they place monitors on your credit reports.  These alerts ensure that if anyone tries to do anything with your credit report, get new credit, change your address, expand credit lines, open a checking account, get insurance or utilities, you will be called directly for approval before anything happens.  You can really beat this offer, especially considering it is just $10/month.  That is cheap for guaranteed peace of mind.
Any readers used this service?  If so, what do you think?
