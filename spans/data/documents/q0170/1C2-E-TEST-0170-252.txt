636 Credit Score
It is very important to know your credit score if you intend to get a loan for a car or a mortgage for a house. Depending on your credit score bank will decide what kind of rate they will give on your loans and how easy would it be for you to get a loan.
Make sure that you know your score and have your credit report on hands before going to a bank to get a loan. It is possible to get one free credit report from the governmnt each year now. So use this chance to get it.
Learn how you can improve your credit score and lower your payments.
There are multiple ways of improving your 636 credit score. The simplest one is to wait for some time without taking new loans and paying old ones on time. It also makes sense to pay out credit cards every month and don't max out them. Make sure that you don't get any issues with collections and try to prevent your bills from going to collection by all means.
If based on your 636 credit score bank gives you a rate which is way to high try to save more cash for downpayment to avoid getting loan which isn't affordable.
