Credit Scores
 
Credit Scores are employed by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of an individual. The stronger the credit score the greater the opportunity to negotiate more favorable terms and interest rates. Weaker credit scores deter banks from lending, and encourage more stringent terms and interest rates, to protect their own position.
 
High Credit Scores
 
A high credit score based on favorable credit information indicates you are in a strong position to payoff debt, which assists  you in negotiating better lending terms with banks and institutions.
 
Low Credit Scores
 
A low credit score based on unfavorable credit information can make negotiation with lenders more difficult, but does provide a gauge of your status, and insight into how much you need to improve your score to get better terms.
 
Credit Score Bands
 
Credit Scores range from 300-850. Scores below 600 are typically regarded as high risk borrowers, 620 indicates away from high risk,  640 is approaching average, and 650 is about average. Scores near to 700 and beyond are generally considered excellent. Scores fluctuate depending on payment history, the amount owed and available credit, length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit in use.
