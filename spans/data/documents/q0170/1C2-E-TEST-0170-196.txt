Is a Credit score of 600 Bad?
Well, look at the chart above.  It’s right on the line between “Bad” and “Below Average”.  Most banks will be very cautious, especially in this day and age, lending you money.  You will be able to get a mortgage if you can find a bank willing to take a risk, and if you have good income as well as a nice sum of money to place as a down payment on the mortgage.  You can expect to pay a few percentage points higher then the prime rate if accepted for a mortgage, and may find it difficult to get an auto loan.

How Hard is it to Improve Your Score?
It would not be that difficult to increase your credit score from 600 all the way up to 700 within 18-24 months or so if you can acquire two lines of credit and not miss payment in that time span.  One mistake many individuals make is that once their credit rating is damaged they often give up, and not even try for additional liens of credit.  This is in fact the worse thing you can do, as in order to increase your score you must establish new debts and make your payments on time every time.  With a bit of patience, as well as financial discipline anyone can can reestablish their rating and get their lives and credit back on track where it should be.
