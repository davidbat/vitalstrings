When it comes to getting your annual credit report, many people think it’s a difficult process that costs a lot of money. In the 21st century, this is just not the case. In fact, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) actually makes it easy to get a free credit score report online. The federal government runs AnnualCreditReport.com, but there are other places to get your credit report online – some of which can help you with other financial aspects as well.
Here’s a look at the three main places to get your annual credit score report online:
Experian Credit Score
Equifax Credit Score
TransUnion Credit Score
Each of these companies have a long history of providing accurate credit rating reports for people around the country, but they are known to make mistakes sometimes. This is why it is vital for everyone to get their credit report score at least once per year.
For those that want more peace of mind, checking the credit rating at Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion more than once a year makes a lot of sense. For example, if you check your scores and a mistake happens a few weeks later, should you really wait a whole year to find and fix the mistake?
While errors may be uncommon, they do happen and they can add up to lots of money lost to higher interest fees because of the misinformation on the credit report. While you can get a free annual credit report from the federal website, there are also other options to make sure you get a more timely look at your credit report every month.
When you take the time to know your credit score, it’s possible to more easily improve it. And for those who have a perfect credit score, it makes sense to check up on it at least once a quarter to make sure it stays that way.
