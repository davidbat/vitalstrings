Lots of Credit Scores
The programs that generate your credit score are complex, and their designs are closely guarded secrets. However, we know that they generally look for proof that you're a seasoned, responsible borrower.
The most popular credit score is the FICO credit score, from the Fair Isaac Corporation. They share some general information on what the score looks at and how it is calculated.

Other credit scores exist; which might extend the FICO credit score, or they might be custom built for a lender's particular needs. For example, a lender may want to include your income in a credit scoring model. Likewise, some peer to peer lending sites create "credit grades" that are easier for lenders to understand.
Just be aware that there are many different credit scoring models out there. Even your FICO score will differ among the credit reporting companies because they all have different information on you.

Approving Loans
Credit scores do not determine whether or not your loan is approved. They are simply numbers generated from your credit report. Your lender sets standards on which credit scores are acceptable and makes the final decision.
To improve your credit scores, you have to show that you're a seasoned, responsible borrower. If you build your credit files with positive information, your credit scores will follow.
