In addition, if you have not made a purchase or had other account activity for 12 months you will not be able                         to access the Sears Credit Score website until after you have made a transaction on your account, and reenrollment in the Sears Credit Score website will be required. If you have not accessed                         the Sears Credit Score website for 6 months, you will have to reenroll in the Sears Credit Score website. Sears Credit Score Access is subject to change, including termination, without notice.                         See the Terms and Conditions for additional information.
