IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
When you order your Credit Report for $1 here, you will begin your trial membership                     in Experian Credit Manager. If you don't cancel your membership within the 30-day                     trial period, you will be billed $19.95 for each month that you continue                     your membership.
Checking your own credit won't lower your Credit Score!

Look for potential inaccuracies and unauthorized activity, including new accounts,                             credit inquiries and bankruptcies.
Guard Your Identity
We closely monitor your Credit Report everyday. Be alerted to key changes and possible fraudulent                             activity.
* Calculated on the PLUS Score model, your Experian Credit Score indicates your relative credit risk level for educational purposes and is not the score used by lenders. Learn More .
** Monitoring with Experian begins within 48 hours of enrollment in your free trial.             Monitoring with Equifax and TransUnion takes approximately 4 days to begin, though             in some cases cannot be initiated during your trial period. You may cancel your             trial membership any time within 30 days of enrollment without charge.
