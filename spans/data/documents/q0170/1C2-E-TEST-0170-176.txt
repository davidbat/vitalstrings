Earlier, we compared FreeCreditReport.com to AnnualCreditReport.com. While the names can be deceiving, the place you want to go for a free credit report is AnnualCreditReport.com. But the one very important piece of information you won’t get there is your FICO credit score. And it’s a question heard a lot: “How do I get my free credit score?” Fortunately, you can get your credit score instantly online for free.
How to Get Your Free Credit Score
You have several options when it comes to getting your credit score for free. With all of these options, your free score is available online instantly once you sign up for a free trial of credit monitoring service. The best options give you your credit score from all three major credit bureaus and offer the free trial for at least 7 days.
Our TOP PICK to get your Free Credit Score is GoFreeCredit.com. It only takes a few minutes to get your Free Credit Score from Equifax and your 30-day Free Trial of Credit Monitoring from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you continue with the credit monitoring service, the cost will be $16.95 per month. But, it’s a good idea to have the credit monitoring service, because you will receive instant Fraud ID Alerts should anything change on your Credit.

Owned and operated by TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus, TrueCredit offers consumers a look at all three of their credit scores (not just TransUnion) as well as all three credit reports, during the 7 day free trial.  Once the free trial period has expired, the cost to maintain the TrueCredit is $14.95.  That amount is in line with the other free credit score providers we’re showing in this post and the TrueCredit.com interface is a cinch to use.
