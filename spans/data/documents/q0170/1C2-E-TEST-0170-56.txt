500 - 559
Anything below 500 will usually be declined credit, or be forced to pay extremely high interest rates. These six point groups are used by all the major credit card issuers, auto finance companies, and mortgage companies.
Naturally, the very best interest rates and prime lending goes to those in the top category. Although most consumers fall into the middle ranges, there is a lot of competition among credit card issuers, which means you can still get some very good deals.
So, how do you improve your credit score? First, let me be clear in saying that there is no overnight magic solution to adding 100 points to your credit score. It will take a little time, but you can make some dramatic short term improvements.
1. Open up a savings account if you don't already have one. Even if you can only begin with $100, it can add 30-40 points onto your credit score.
2. Pay your bills on time. Did you know that 35% of your FICO score is base on payment history? The more frequent you pay your bills on time, the more your score will rise.
3. Don't max out your credit cards. Having a 50% balance is optimum. It shows you're responsible and able to handle credit cards.
4. Don't open a lot of new credit card accounts. This may seem like a good idea, but financial institutions look at it differently. It sets off all sorts of red flags.
5. Check your credit report frequently and correct any errors. Many times people will have an error on their credit report that is adversely affecting their credit score.
Now, the next time you hear someone say their credit score is 605, you'll better understand what they are talking about, and perhaps offer them some suggestions in being able to raise it.
