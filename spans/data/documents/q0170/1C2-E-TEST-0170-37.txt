Charles A. Capone, Jr., Ph.D Senior Analyst, Microeconomic and Financial Studies Division U.S. Congressional Budget Office Washington, DC, writing in "Research Into Mortgage Default and Affordable Housing: A Primer":  For most of the 1990s, the mortgage market viewed a FICO score of 620 as the bottom cut off for prime loans , meaning loans that could be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Scores in the 580-620 range were considered 'near' prime, with labels such as A-minus, and those above 720 were considered low risk borrowers." (2001)( alt )
Associated Press: "For consumers with scores near 620, considered the dividing line between good and bad credit , discrepancies and omissions can affect whether a person gets approved for a mortgage at the best interest rate, the study said." (2002)( alt )
CNN/Money Magazine: "Scores range from 350 to 800 points; scores of 620 and above are considered good ."  ("Money Magazine Editor-at-Large Jean Chatzky appears regularly on NBC's Today.")(2003)
CNN/Money: "According to a recent survey conducted by GMAC Mortgage, 62 percent of consumers do not realize that a score of 620 or better means you can become eligible for getting the best possible mortgage rate ."

CNNfn, CNN/Money:  "Credit scores in the range of 620-650 indicate basically good credit . A score above 680 will most likely qualify you for the best rate your lender has to offer." (2004)
BusinessWeek: "FICO scores generally fall between 550 and 800, but nearly 20% of the U.S. population has a credit score under 620, generally the cutoff for a prime-rate loan ." (2002)
Fair Isaac: "Those agencies [Fannie mae and Freddie Mac], which buy mortgages from banks and resell them to investors, have indicated to lenders that any consumer with a FICO score above 620 is good while consumers below 620 should result in further inquiry from the lender, Watts said... Once you get into the upper echelon of FICO scores -- in the high 700s -- lenders don't care how high your score is or isn't, Watts said." (dead link)
Fair Isaac: "But a 620 score doesn't mean you're going to qualify for the best rate, he says. 'It means you're going to qualify for a standardized rate, or a prime rate . `Prime' is a broad category, so lenders will have different loan products that classify as `prime' rates.'"
St. Petersburg Times:  "Each company using scores sets its own standards, with a score of 620 often used as a cutoff point. Fall below that and you are likely to be labeled a high risk." (2003)

Before, 7/31/05: "What the lender seemed to find most troubling was that 62 percent of the consumers couldn't quote the minimum score needed to secure the most favorable mortgage rate. (It's 620 out of 850.) Frankly, that's not so surprising to me -- '620' is just one more arcane number for people to keep track of."
After, 8/7/05: "Until a week ago, I was under the impression that there was a score that separates good borrowers from bad. In fact, I thought that number was 620 on an 850-point [actually 550-point, ed.] scale, because a major mortgage lender had told me so."
U.S. Department of Agriculture: "FICO Scores Below 620. The risk of default is statistically very high for applicants who have credit scores in this range."
