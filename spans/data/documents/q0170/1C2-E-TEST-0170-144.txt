Credit Score Myths and Facts:
 
There are many        misconceptions about your credit score, which is one of        the most misunderstood parts of consumer credit. Here        are some myths and the facts behind them so that you can        better understand your credit score.
Myth: Credit scores only range from 250-850.
Fact: Credit scores are always scored in this range, but        if your credit is bad enough, it can bottom out below        the 250 mark. Also, if your credit is beyond excellent,        it may occasionally exceed 850, just to let lenders know        how creditworthy you really are.
Myth: Inquiries don’t affect a credit score.
Fact: Every time someone does a credit check on you, it        affects your score. There are 3 instances where an        inquiry won’t affect your credit, though. When you check        your own credit, it doesn’t matter. Also, if an        insurance company inquires, or a credit card company        sends you a pre-approval letter, those inquires don’t        affect your credit score. However, the fewer inquiries        you have, the better. That way you won’t appear        desperate for credit.
Myth: My credit score is bad, so it’s going to take a        while to get it back up.
Fact: This one is partly true. If you have a low score        and large debts to pay off, you might spend years trying        to right the wrong. However, if you can pay off all of        your debts that are outstanding in less than 3 months,        your credit score can improve drastically within 6        months or less. If you have good credit, it is far        easier to make it bad than it is to make bad credit        good.
It’s important to be informed about credit scores and        credit checks because you need to be an informed        consumer. You’ll be better able to use your credit and        make it work for you when you know what you’re dealing        with. You’ll also be better able to fix your credit, if        necessary, by being informed and prepared.
