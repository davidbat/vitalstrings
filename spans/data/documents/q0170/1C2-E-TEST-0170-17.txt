Why Your Free Credit Score Matters
You have three credit scores, one from each credit bureau. Each one is slightly                 different, but all three play a very important role in your financial life. Your                 credit scores determine the amount credit lenders will make available to you and                 the interest rates and payments on mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, insurance                 policies, and more.
The Difference Between a Credit Report and a Credit Score
A credit report is a detailed history of the loans                 you´ve received and credit cards you´ve used that is offered by the                 three bureaus once a year. If you´ve had collections, they may also appear                 on any of the credit reports. For each account, the credit report shows your payment                 history, current balance, credit limit, the date the account was opened, and whether                 the account is open or closed.
A credit score is a three digit number based on the                 information in your credit report. The bureaus factor in the number of years you´ve                 had credit, how much of your available credit you´re currently using, whether                 you´ve recently made any late payments, and how recently you´ve had                 any negative actions or credit applications.
Why Your Credit Report Matters
First, your credit score is based on your credit report. Any incorrect information                 could reduce your credit score. A lower credit score can cause your interest rates                 to rise or you could be denied credit. Your credit report also lists past addresses                 and employers. Credit report inaccuracies could slow loan processing.
A credit report is often the first place people detect identity                     theft . By regularly monitoring your credit ,                 you can reduce the damage from credit fraud.
