So it looks like much less of a total risk for the lender,                            right? Not when you consider that 87% of people in this category                            will have late payments—do the math and it makes 870                            people. If you were a lender, you would want to steer clear                            of poor credit scores. If you had to make loans or extend                            credit into this category, you would probably try to make                            up for your losses by charging high interest rates—which                            is exactly what happens in the real world.
 
Different Credit Score Ranges
Each credit bureau has a slightly different scoring model.  Although the current FICO credit score is considered 300 to 850, each credit reporting                            agency uses a slightly different scale. All are based on the FICO credit score system,                            which was developed by Fair Isaac & Company., Inc. TransUnion                            calls its score Empirica, Equifax used the name Beacon (now                          NextGen), and Experian calls its system Experian/FICO.
 
Recently, a new credit scoring system, called VantageScore , has been developed   jointly by Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.   However, it remains to be seen just exactly how many lenders actually use the   new score.
