1. About        credit scores
Credit bureau scores are often called "FICO          scores" because most credit bureau scores used in the United States are          produced from software developed by Fair, Isaac and Company (FICO). FICO          scores are provided to lenders by the three major credit bureaus: Equifax,          Experian and TransUnion. Credit scores give prospective credit grantors          the best guide regarding the risk of poor payment performance or non-payment          based solely on credit report data. The higher the score, the lower the          indicated risk. But no score says whether a specific individual will be          a "good" or "bad" customer.
While many lenders use credit scores to help them          make lending decisions, each lender has its own strategy, including the          level of risk it finds acceptable for a given credit product. No single          "cutoff score" determines a borrower's ability to secure credit, and there          are additional factors that lenders use to determine your actual interest          rates. Lenders can charge higher interest rates for lower credit score          candidates, for example, to cover their costs of default from that category          of individuals.
2. How credit scoring        works
Credit scores are determined by a mathematical model that evaluates many          types of information in a consumer's credit file. By comparing this information          to the patterns in hundreds of thousands of past credit reports, the score          identifies the lender's level of future credit risk. In order for a credit          score to be calculated on a consumer's credit file, the file must contain          at least one account, which has been open for six months or longer. In          addition, the file must contain at least one account that has been updated          in the past six months. This ensures that there is enough information          -- and enough recent information -- in the credit file on which to base          a score.
3. What a credit        score uses
The following are the five main categories which credit scores evaluate          and the weight attached to each:
Payment history: 35% of the score's weight
Amounts owed on accounts: 30% of the score's weight
Length of credit history: 15% of the score's weight
New credit inquiries: 10% of the score's weight
Types of credit used:10% of the score's weight
More about each of these categories and the measurements that they include          are contained further in this section.
4. What a credit        score ignores
Credit scores consider a wide range of information          on the consumer's credit report. However, they do not consider:
A consumer's race, color, religion, national origin, sex and marital            status. US law prohibits credit scoring from considering these facts,            as well as any receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any            consumer right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
A consumer's age. Other types of scores may consider age, but FICO            scores don't.
A consumer's salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed or            employment history. Lenders may consider this information, however,            as may other types of scores.
Where a consumer lives.
Any interest rate being charged on a particular credit card or other            account.
Any items reported as child/family support obligations or rental agreements.
Certain types of inquiries* (requests for a consumer's credit report).
Any information not found in the consumer's credit report.
Any information that is not proven to be predictive of future credit            performance.
*The score does not count "consumer-initiated"          inquiries—requests the consumer has made for his/her credit report.          It also does not count "promotional inquiries"—requests made by          lenders in order to make a consumer a "pre-approved" credit offer (for          example, credit card offers by mail), or "administrative inquiries"—requests          made by lenders to review a consumer's account with them. Requests that          are marked as coming from employers are not counted either.
5. Things to remember        when examining credit scores
A score uses all five categories of information, not just one or two.
No one piece of information or factor alone will determine the score.
The relative weight of any factor in a scoring category depends on            the overall information in the credit report.
A consumer's credit score only looks at information in his/her credit            report.
The consumer's score considers both positive and negative information            in his/her credit report. Late payments will lower the score, but establishing            or re-establishing a good track record of making payments on time will            raise the score.
For some people, a given factor          may be more important than for someone else with a different credit history.          For example, late payments by a consumer with a bankruptcy in their recent          credit history may lower a score more points than for a consumer with          an otherwise positive repayment history. In addition, as the information          in the credit report changes, so does the importance of any factor in          determining the score. Thus, it's impossible to say exactly how important          any single factor is in determining the score; even the levels of importance          shown here are for the general population, and will be different for different          credit profiles. What's important is the mix of information, which varies          from person to person, and for any one person over time.
Note that lenders also look at many things when          making a credit decision: the consumer's income, how long he/she has worked          at his/her present job, and the kind of credit the consumer is requesting.
6. Payment history
Payment history accounts for approximately 35%          of the weight of the score.
This is one of the most important          factors in a credit score. However, late payments are not an automatic          "score-killer." An overall good credit picture can outweigh one or two          instances of late credit card payments, for example. By the same token,          having no late payments in the credit report doesn't mean the consumer          will get a "perfect score." Some 60%-65% of credit reports show no late          payments at all. The payment history is just one piece of information          used in calculating the score.
This category takes into account:
Payment information on many types of accounts.
These will include credit cards (such as Visa, MasterCard, American            Express and Discover), retail accounts (credit from stores where the            consumer does business, such as department store credit cards), installment            loans (loans where the consumer makes regular payments, such as car            loans, recreational vehicles, and signature loans), finance company            accounts and mortgage loans.
Public record and collection items: bankruptcy, foreclosures, suits,            wage attachments, liens and judgments.
These are considered quite serious, although older items and items with            small amounts will count less than more recent items or those with larger            amounts. It is also important to note that even though a collection,            judgment or tax lien is reported as paid that the account is still considered            seriously delinquent because of the fact that it went to a collection            status. Never pay off an old collection, judgment, tax lien, etc. until            the close of escrow, as doing so turns the delinquency into a current            event (according to the "date of last activity")            and the consumer's score will go down.
Details on late or missed payments ("delinquencies"), public record            and collection items.
Specifically, how late they were, how much was owed, how recently they            occurred and how many there are. A 60-day late payment is not as risky            as a 90-day late payment, in and of itself. But recency and frequency            count too. A 60-day late payment made just a month ago will count more            than a 90-day late payment from five years ago. Note that closing an            account on which the consumer had previously missed a payment or satisfying            a judgment or collection item does not make the late payment or item            disappear from the credit report. An important qualification considering            late payments is that a 30-day late payment is not considered a serious            delinquency. 60-day or more late payments are considered serious delinquencies.            A 30-day late payment will effect the credit score but not nearly as            much as a 60-day or greater late payment.
How many accounts show no late payments?
A good track record on most of the consumer's credit accounts will increase            the credit score.
Payment history tips
The best advice is to manage credit responsibly over time.
Pay bills on time.
Delinquent payments and collections can have a major negative impact            on the score. Late payments reported recently are more detrimental to            the score than are late payments that were reported in the past.
If the consumer has missed payments, he/she must get current and            stay current.
The longer the consumer pays his/her bills on time, the better their            score.
Be aware that paying off a collection account will not remove it            from the credit report.
It will stay on the report for seven years.
If a consumer is having trouble making ends meet, he/she should            contact creditors or see a legitimate credit counselor.
This won't improve the score immediately, but if he/she can begin to            manage their credit and pay on time, their score will get better over            time. A recent change at Fair Isaac no longer penalizes a score for            the consumer entering Consumer Credit Counseling.
Check your credit report regularly for errors. At least            annually is recommended.
Check for erroneous late payments and have them corrected with the reporting            bureau. Check for old, especially derogatory, information that is old            enough to be purged from the report. Ensure that accounts, again especially            derogatory accounts, are reported with the actual true date of last            activity. This would include accounts that were discharged through a            bankruptcy. The date of last activity of bankruptcy accounts should            match the date that the bankruptcy was discharged.
Here is a list of all past payment          history factors:
Account payment information on specific types of accounts (credit            cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company accounts,            mortgage, etc.)
Presence of adverse public records (bankruptcy, judgments, suits,            liens, wage attachments, etc.), collection items, and/or delinquency            (past due items)
Severity of delinquency (how long past due)
Amount past due on delinquent accounts or collection items
Time since (recency of) past due items (delinquency), adverse public            records (if any), or collection items (if any)
Number of past due items on file
Number of accounts paid as agreed
7. Amounts owed
The amount owed on accounts makes up approximately          30% of the weight of the score.
Having credit accounts and owing money on them          does not mean the consumer is a high-risk borrower and gets a low score.          However, owing a great deal of money on many accounts can indicate that          a person is overextended, and is more likely to make some payments late          or not at all. Part of the science of scoring is determining how much          is too much for a given credit profile.
This category takes into account:
The amount owed on all accounts.
Even if the consumer pays off his/her credit cards in full every month,            their credit report may show a balance on those cards. That's because            creditors report a month in arrears.
The amount owed on different types of accounts.
In addition to the overall amount the consumer owes, the score considers            the amount he/she may owe on specific types of accounts, such as credit            cards and installment loans.
Whether the consumer is showing a balance on certain types of accounts.
In some cases, having a very small balance without missing a payment            shows that the consumer has managed credit responsibly, and may be slightly            better than no balance at all. On the other hand, closing unused credit            accounts that show zero balances and that are in good standing will            not generally raise your score. In fact it could lower the score.
How many accounts have balances.
A large number can indicate higher risk of over-extension.
How much of the total credit line is being used on credit cards            and other "revolving credit" accounts.
Based on the evaluation of thousands of credit files, a consumer close            to being "maxed out" on many credit cards statistically has a higher            chance of having trouble making payments in the future. This is a factor            seen very frequently at Advantage Credit. A consumer may wonder why            the credit score seems low when minimum payments have been made on time            month after month. It's likely that the balance owing on the account            is over 50% and triggers the "high proportion of balances to credit            limits" scoring factor.
Amounts owed tips
Keep balances low on credit cards and other "revolving credit."
High outstanding debt can negatively affect a score. Maintain balances            at or below 50% of the available credit limit.
Pay off debt rather than moving it around.
The most effective way to improve the score in this area is by paying            down the revolving credit. In fact, owing the same amount but consolidating            the amount onto fewer open accounts may lower the score.
Sometimes financial planners recommend consolidating higher interest            debt into a new lower interest account.
While sensible in lowering interest rates, the strategy can backfire            in credit scores. Opening a new account with a high balance and closing            pre-existing accounts all typically lower scores for many months until            the balance comes below 50% and the new account has been open for longer            than a year. If you are in the market for a home now or in the next            12 months, avoid this mistake.
Don't close unused credit cards as a short-term strategy to raise            the consumer's score.
Don't open a number of new credit cards that the consumer doesn't            need, just to increase his/her available credit.
This approach could backfire and actually lower the score, depending            on the length of time the consumer has had established credit.
Here is a list of all "amount of credit owning"        category factors:
Amount owing on accounts
Amount owing on specific types of accounts
Lack of a specific type of balance, in some cases
Number of accounts with balances
Proportion of credit lines used (proportion of balances to total credit            limits on certain types of revolving accounts)
Proportion of installment loan amounts still owing (proportion of            balance to original loan amount on certain types of installment loans)
8. Length of credit        history
Length of credit history accounts for approximately          15% of the weight of the score.
In general, a longer credit history will increase          the score. However, even people who have not been using credit long may          get high scores, depending on how the rest of their credit report looks.
This score takes into account:
How long the credit accounts have been established, in general.
The score considers both the age of the oldest account and an average            age of all the accounts.
How long specific credit accounts have been established.
How long it has been since the consumer used certain accounts.
Length of credit history tip
If the consumer has been managing credit for a short time, he/she            shouldn't open a lot of new accounts too rapidly.
New accounts will lower the average account age, which will have a larger            effect on the score if the consumer doesn't have a lot of other credit            information. Also, rapid account buildup can look risky if the consumer            is a new credit user.
Remember that most new accounts don't begin to positively add to            the credit history for 12-13 months.
Here's a list of all "length of time credit        established" category factors:
Time since accounts opened
Time since accounts opened, by specific type of account
Time since account activity
9. New credit inquiries
New credit inquiries account for approximately          10% of the weight of the score.
People tend to have more credit today and credit          scores reflect this fact. However, research shows that opening several          credit accounts in a short period of time does represent greater risk—especially          for people who do not have a long-established credit history. This also          extends to requests for credit, as indicated by certain "inquiries" to          the credit reporting agencies, resulting from requests by the consumer          for new credit. An inquiry is a request by a lender to get a copy of an          applicant's credit report. Credit scores do a good job of distinguishing          between a search for many new credit accounts and rate shopping, which          is generally not associated with higher risk.
This category takes into account:
How many new accounts a consumer has.
The score looks at how many new accounts there are by type of account            (for example, how many newly opened credit cards the consumer has).            It also may look at how many of the accounts are new accounts.
How long it has been since the consumer opened a new account.
Again, the score looks at this by type of account.
How many recent requests for credit has the consumer made, as indicated            by inquiries to the credit reporting agencies.
Inquiries remain on the credit report for two years, although credit            scores only consider inquiries from the last 12 months. Consumers' own            requests for credit reports are not counted in the score. Also, the            score does not count requests a lender has made for a consumer's credit            report or score in order to make the consumer a "pre-approved" credit            offer, or to review the consumer's account with them, even though he/she            may see these inquiries on the credit report. There have been recent            changes in the way the FICO models count inquiries for scoring purposes.            It is fairly complex and hard to understand but the basic premise is            that all auto and mortgage inquiries made within a 14 day period are counted as one inquiry for scoring purposes. The scoring models also            ignore all inquiries within 30 days of scoring. Therefore, when rate            shopping, try to make your inquiries within a 2 week period.
How long since credit report inquiries were made by lenders.
Whether the consumer has a good recent credit history, following            past payment problems.
Re-establishing credit and making payments on time after a period of            late payment behavior will help to raise a score over time.
New credit inquiries tips
Keep rate shopping within a two week period.
Re-establish credit history if there have been problems.
Opening new accounts responsibly and paying them off on time will raise            the score in the long term.
Remember that there is no score "cost" to request your own credit            report.
This won't affect the score, as long as the consumer orders his/her            credit report directly from the credit report agency or through an organization            authorized to provide credit reports to consumers.
Here's a list of all "new credit inquiries"        category factors:
Number of recently opened accounts, and proportion of accounts that            are recently opened, by type of account
Number of recent credit inquiries
Time since recent account opening(s), by type of account
Time since credit inquiry(s)
Re-establishment of positive credit history following past payment            problems
10. Types of credit        used
The types of credit used accounts for another          10% of score's result.
The score will consider the mix of credit cards,          retail accounts, installment loans, and finance company accounts and mortgage          loans. It is not necessary to have one of each, though Advantage Credit          has found that a credit card account, a store or other revolving account          and an installment loan (i.e. home or auto loan) provide good results          over time. The credit mix usually won't be a key factor in determining          the score, but it can be more important if there isn't a lot of other          information on which to base a score.
This score takes into account:
What kinds of credit accounts the consumer has, and how many of            each.
The score also looks at the total number of accounts the consumer has.            For different credit profiles, how many is too many will vary.
Types of credit used tips
Apply new credit accounts only as needed.
Don't open accounts just to have a better credit mix; it probably won't            raise the score.
Have credit cards, but manage them responsibly.
In general, having credit cards and installment loans (and paying timely            payments) will raise the score. Someone with no credit cards, for example,            tends to be a higher risk than someone who has managed credit cards            responsibly.
Recognize that closing an account doesn't make it go away.
A closed account will still show up on the credit report, and may be            considered by the score. And if you close an account that has negative            payment information from the past, it will be bumped up in it's recency            value because you will have changed the "date of last activity" to the            present.
11. Interpreting        the credit score
On a mortgage credit report, along with a credit          score, up to four "score reason codes" are also delivered. These explain          the top reasons why the score was not higher. If a request for credit          is declined and the credit score is part of the reason, these score reason          codes can help explain why the score wasn't higher. If the reason for          a low score is not obvious, the reason codes are the first place to look.
In fact, the score reasons are more useful than          the score itself in helping the broker and the consumer determine whether          the credit report might contain errors, and how the consumer might improve          his/her score over time. However, if the report indicates a high score          (for example, in the mid-700s or higher) some of the reasons codes may          not be very helpful. They may be marginal factors related to the last          three categories described previously (length of credit history, new credit          and types of credit in use).
12. Common score        reasons codes
Here are the top ten most frequently given        scoring reasons.
Serious delinquency.
Serious delinquency and public record or collection filed.
Derogatory public record or collection filed.
Time since delinquency is too recent or unknown.
Level of delinquency on accounts.
Number of accounts with delinquency.
Amount owed on accounts.
Proportion of balances to credit limits on revolving accounts is too            high.
Length of time accounts have been established.
Too many accounts with balances.
13. How        CreditXpert can help you improve your credit score
CreditXpert is a score improvement report that          is prepared using your particular credit file. It is available through          an Advantage Credit mortgage broker, realtor or other approved customer.          It examines the specific tradelines in your credit file, analyzes them          for opportunities for improvements, recommends specific actions and estimates          what score boost the recommended actions will have. It can tell you, for          example, that by moving a certain portion of balance from one account          to another may raise the score an estimated 10 points. Some actions may          have immediate effects; others will demonstrate gains over time.

14. How to correct        errors in your credit file
Corrections must be made at the bureau level          in order for the information to affect the score. Remember that the score          is based on the information in the consumer's file at the bureau level.          Advantage Credit is a credit report reseller and does not own nor maintain          the information contained in the credit reports.
First, the consumer must write          a letter of dispute regarding the erroneous information reported by the          reporting bureau referencing the tradeline, account numbers, what is incorrect.          Send the letter overnight mail, with a return receipt requested.
Under the federal Fair Credit          Reporting Act effective October 1, 1997, a credit repository has 5 days          from the receipt of a written investigation request to contact the appropriate          credit grantor about investigating the complaint(s). The consumer should          receive a reply back within 30 days of the original repository notification.
Within 5 business days after          the completion of the investigation, the repository must send a written          report to the borrower with its findings (and a copy of the revised report          if there was any change). The findings will state one of the following:
there is an error and the credit report is corrected.
there is no error, so the report stands.
the credit grantor(s) did not respond in the allotted time, so the            disputed item(s) is dropped from the report.
If credit errors are detected, below is the contact          information for the three repositories:
Equifax Information Service
