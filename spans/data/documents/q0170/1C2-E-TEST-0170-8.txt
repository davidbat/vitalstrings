The Automatic Fraud Alerts 2 feature is an easy way to help prevent identity theft!
If you have been or may be a victim of identity theft, you can place a fraud alert on your credit file, which notifies lenders that they should take steps to verify your identity, such as by contacting you, before authorizing new or additional credit.
When you enroll in the Automatic Fraud Alerts 2 feature, we'll place your free initial 90 day fraud alert on your Equifax credit file and, once successfully placed, we'll refer your fraud alert request to Experian and TransUnion. Then, every 90 days, we'll automatically renew your fraud alert request for you.

The Equifax Credit Score is a proprietary credit model designed by Equifax. It may be calculated using the information contained in your Equifax, Experian and Transunion Credit Files. The score is intended solely for your educational use. There are numerous credit scores and models available in the marketplace and lenders are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness.
