  Question? What is the phone number, fax number or                   address for Trans Union? Answer: Use the mail because calling a                       bureaus’ computerized phone system is more frustrating and less                       secure than certified priority mail as recommended by the                       FTC. Fax number for Transunion. There is not one.                           This would be like faxing something to Microsoft or Congress. Use                           certified mail.
   There are 3 credit reporting bureau’s (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) that have your credit history, personal data and credit                   scores. All three bureaus are likely to have different data so I                   make sure I have all 3 of my credit reports and credit scores                   online. 
   If I have a dispute or I do not have an                   address or phone number for a creditor that reported on my bureau                   then, I print the official and legal dispute form free.                   Instructions are on form
