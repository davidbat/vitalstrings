The FICO score it a number that rates your credit worthiness. It can be a very low number where anyone for anything will turn you away fast or around mid 5 hundreds may get you something but at a high interest rate. 7 -800 is the best credit history. Everything on your credit report boils down to what matters to who your trying to buy or rent from, the FICO score. There’s been enough on tv about it, You’d think everyone would know unless they had their head in a hole for years. If you have are in the highest range you can often buy a car without paying interest. In my dreams, life doesn’t always turn out like you’d hoped. And you don’t see into the future while making hundreds of mistakes along the way. The market may not be out there anymore but your FICO score follows you for life!

@dani – My suggestion is to look at Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. The TransUnion and Experian scores should be a good predictor of your FICO score. However, if you really want your FICO score and worry about paying a subscription fee, then try MyFICO. It only charges you a one-time fee.

Unfortunately your FICO score is more and more important. Even insurance companies use your personal credit to determine how much money they’re going to charge you. If you have a low FICO score you could pay as much as three times more than someone with a superior FICO credit score!!

I don’t understand. Can’t you just use annualcreditreport.com which is the only legit site to provide free annual credit reports anyway?

annualcreditreport.com is a great site for just your credit report once a year. But you dont get a consumer credit score there for free. You must pay for it. You can sign up for some of these services and get monitoring and identity theft protection. You may shop around and compare.

Quizzle.com (for Experian), CreditKarma.com (for TransUnion) and MyFICO.com (for FICO) are the ones I use. All other sites which provide reports or scores will try to sell you a subscription which you need to cancel. The problem is that some of them will put you in more than one subscription from more than one company. Naturally many people will cancel the obvious subscription from the same site they got the service from, but they won’t notice the additional subscriptions and ultimately get charged until they notice the extra transactions on their statement. That’s how the Scam usually works in it’s most innocent form. If you’re wondering what other forms there are, I remember a friend of mine who got his information stolen by a similar theme website and a fake loan was opened with his name and SSN. He paid a lawyer about 5K to fight the fraudulent loan which was about a half of the actual loan amount.

In actuality, all these sites are BS, because they want to sell you a service that you can do on your own, that being to monitor your own credit. I have no problem paying to see my three scores if it was a one time and done payment, but that’s not the way it is. There’s a catch with their monthly billing subscription.
The average person doesn’t have time to call or might forget to cancel their subscriptions and that is exactly what these companies are banking on. On top of that, when you try to cancel, you have a telemarketer on the other end of the line that tries to convince you to stay with their service. They’ll even offer you a deal where the monthly payment will be cut in half for the next three months. They will always say to just call them before the three months is over to cancel, otherwise the rate goes back to normal. Again, they are banking on the fact that you will forget.
Screw all of them. Just give me my credit score. That’s all I want.

@TD – Quizzle, Credit Sesame, and Credit Karma are all free. You can also opt to use one time payment with MyFICO and Equifax.

With the FICO scores, how many time within a year do I need to keep my eyes on?

I have learned the hard way not too give my credit card # for a trial offer. Seems like every time I do it I get ripped off. One time I had to close my bank account because I couldnt get them to stop billing me the bank couldnt even stop it. 6 (bills)months later and a new accound it stopped.

@kong — I only look at it about once every 3 months. The scores aren’t that important until you’re getting close to making major financial moves, e.g., taking out a mortgage.
@mark000 and louiszinsky — You may want to give Quizzle and Credit Karma a try. No cost and no credit card needed (as far as I can recall).

I read that the scores that experian gives are not the scores lenders see and make decisions off of. I’m afraid Quizzle and Credit Karma is providing the “experian plus” score which is only an estimate of what your actual score may be. Is this true?

@lele – Quizzle provides Experian consumer score and Credit Karma provides TransUnion consumer score (plus their the new VantageScore). You are correct that these are not the exact numbers that your lenders see; however, these score should give you a good approximation of how good your score is. I compared my consumer scores against the one my mortgage lender used and they were within 50 points of each other.

Derrick, AnnualCreditReport.com is great for getting free credit report from each of the three credit agencies, but you cannot get free credit score from them.

I remember a conversation from a senior retiree about 69 years old friend of our family. With the recent housing mess, his mortgage is more than what his home is worth. I asked him what’s his plan. His reply: “to heck with my credit score. I’m walking away, the last thing I would worry about is my credit scores at my age.”

This is a great comprehensive overview, Pinyo. Thanks for including Credit Karma and clearing up any misunderstandings. Credit Karma will never ask for your credit card information; our services will always be free.

Nice tips… I guess I will apply for a car loan even if I don’t have any intention of getting one. I just want to see my credit score. LOL.

@Cherleen – Why don’t you try Credit Sesame? I wouldn’t get a loan or apply for one just to get my credit scores.

@Mauricio – No. These are soft pulls and they do not show up on your credit reports or affect your scores.
