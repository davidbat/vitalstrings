Credit report
Free Annual Credit Score
A credit report is a record of your credit activities. It lists any credit-card accounts or loans you may have, the balances, and how regularly you make your payments. Your credit report score also shows if any action has been taken against you because of unpaid bills.
A credit report is simply a record of your credit habits - it shows every time you apply for credit, every time someone makes an inquiry about your credit record, and how you manage your credit.
Your credit report contains a variety of information that lenders use to evaluate you as a credit risk. It includes personal information, such as your name,  address, date of birth, and Social Security Number. It also includes previous addresses, current and previous employers, and public records like bankruptcies,  liens, or judgments. Most important, your credit report contains your credit card, mortgage and loan payment history.
So, if you have been denied a loan, are getting ready to make a major purchase, or just want to make sure everything is accurate, checking your  credit report is a great way to ensure you get the credit and services you deserve.
