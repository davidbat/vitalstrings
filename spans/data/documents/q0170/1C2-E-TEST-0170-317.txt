It's your right to know what your credit score says about you. Finding out this                          information is doesn't cost a lot and takes only minutes to do - which may be                          time very well spent.
So what is credit scoring?
Simply put, credit scoring is a method of assessing the credit risk of a loan                          applicant. It uses mathematical models to evaluate a person's credit worthiness                          based on their credit history and current credit accounts. The system was first                          developed in the 1950s, but has come into widespread use in just the last                          couple of decades.
In the early 1980s, the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and                          TransUnion) each developed scoring models that allowed them to offer a score                          based solely on the data of one individual. Creditors, especially those in the                          home mortgage industry, frequently use these scores when deciding who gets a                          loan and at what rate. However, it's worth remembering that creditors also                          consider other information, such as your salary or employment history, when                          making loan decisions.
What's in a score?
Credit scores are reported as a number, usually in the 330 to 830 range. The                          higher the number, the better the score. Creditors see the number as an                          indicator that an individual will repay a loan. Typically, scores are                          determined by reviewing the following data:
Your history of late payments
Non-payments
