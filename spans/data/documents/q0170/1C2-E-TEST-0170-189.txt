3-in-1 credit monitoring is provided by the 3 main credit bureaus. Your credit history information is used to monitor your credit.
Credit Scores
Credit scores are an assessment of the financial position of an individual.
Scores are based on the financial information (credit files, bank histories, etc) of each individual.
Lending institutions and corporations use the score to calculate a person's ability to pay debts.
The credit score measure is based on an analysis of a person’s  credit files, and is used to estimate the creditworthiness of that person.
Scores help to determine those who  qualify for a loan, what interest rate is to be paid, and credit limits. More favorable terms are applied to the best scores.
Credit Monitoring
Credit monitoring is offered by credit  bureaus to detect any suspicious activity regarding your  credit history.
Alerts inform you of any critical changes to your credit  history, and counter potential fraud or identity theft. Activity tracked includes credit inquiries, public records, delinquencies,  negative information, and other changes.
