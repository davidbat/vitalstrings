Monitor and Manage your Credit Health on Credit Karma
The standard Credit Score on CreditKarma is the TransRisk New Account Score provided by TransUnion.  This risk score represents your likelihood of deliquency or non-payment of credit obligations.  This score is based on information in your TransUnion credit report and ranges from 300 (minimum) to 850 (maximum).  The score is calculated using TransUnion's proprietary model for assessing the credit risk of existing accounts and was constructed using a selected group of factors drawn from your credit records at TransUnion.
