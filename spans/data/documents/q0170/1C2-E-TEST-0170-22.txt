Credit score
A credit score is a three digit number that summarizes how well a person or business has handled debt. The higher the number, the better. Those with high scores can qualify for larger loans at better rates. Those with low scores will get poor terms, or be turned down. There are a variety of credit scores using different formulas;  what they have in common is that they judge risk and try to predict future behavior. Factors such as employment, income, credit lines outstanding, debt to income ratio, past payment behavior factor in to a person's credit score. The firm FICO pioneered the use of credit scores, and its product, the FICO score, remains the best known.
