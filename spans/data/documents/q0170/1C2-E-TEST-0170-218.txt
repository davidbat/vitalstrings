Three Major Credit Bureaus
One Time Credit Score
There are a lot of companies on the internet that advertise your free  credit report. Some of these companies are better than others. The most  important things to look at when sorting through all of the different  companies is whether or not they offer a good service, have good  security and offer you a one time credit score along with your report.  Getting a free credit score is not quite as doable as getting your free  credit report. Often it takes a bit of creativity and homework. However,  there are a handful of companies that offer your one time credit score  as long as you sign up to become a member of their site. After you have  figured out a way to get your one time credit score and you have it in  hand then you can sit down with a friend, family member or even a  professional credit counselor to see what can be done to fix your score.
If you have bad credit then there is no reason to sit on it any  longer without taking some sort of action. Bad credit can literally ruin  you if you are not careful. In addition, having bill collectors calling  you night and day is never very fun. If you are able to get on the  right road to repairing your credit then soon you will begin to see  results. We did not kill our credit in one day in most situations so it  is not going to come back up to perfect in one day either. We have to  work hard on paying off things that we owe, making deals with collectors  to remove things from our report and a number of other things that are  involved in repairing credit. The only way to do it is to pout one foot  in front of the other and take baby steps.
