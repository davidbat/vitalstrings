Insurance and credit score
If you're shopping for a new homeowners or  auto policy, it helps to know how you look to the insurers. A majority of insurance  companies use credit scores to determine both eligibility and rating  classification.

Some insurance companies, for example,  use credit scores as part of a rating basis for homeowner's and auto insurance  premiums. Some insurers only consider the credit score on the initial  application for a policy; others pull your score every three years and  re-evaluate the risk. . It is estimated that a low credit score could cost you  between 10 and 50 percent more in auto and homeowner's insurance premiums.

VantageScore:                            A New Alternative to the FICO Score
In recent times, an alternative system of                          rating a person‘s credit history has been in development                          and is now in somewhat limited use. This new system is called                          VantageScore. The three major credit bureaus have been involved                          in the development of this new system -- and are likely to                          make significant use of the news system into the future.
 
The new system does rely on numerical data                          to develop a credit rating for a consumer. The scores go from                          501 to 990. However, under this new system, the raw numerical                          is transformed into a letter grade -- precisely like the letter                          grades used in an academic setting. Consumers, under the VantageScore                          protocol, will be given a letter grade in regard to their                          credit histories of A, B, C, D, or F. Read more .

Yet only around                      30% of Americans know their scores, and 78% of our credit                      scores are said to contain errors. So very few likely even                      know what a good score is so they can clean up their reports                      and raise their number. Read more .
