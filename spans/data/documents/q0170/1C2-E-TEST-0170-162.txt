Credit Score Rating Scale Chart
Posted May 14th, 2009 by Carrie Davis
There are many opinions out there about what your credit score means and how a lender is going to classify you based on your score. The truth is, you don't have just one score . You have many. The credit bureaus and lenders each have different credit scoring formulas they use, and these scoring formulas may or may not be based on one of the many FICO scoring model variations.
Many of the credit scores out there fall on a rangte of 300-850, but sometimes the range is more like 350-900. So even the credit score range can vary depending on which lending or credit institution formulated it. ThisMatter.com has a neat little rating scale chart to summarize some of the various credit score ranges:
