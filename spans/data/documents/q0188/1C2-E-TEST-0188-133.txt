Hasn't Earth been cooling since 1998?
 
We've zoomed in for               a closeup of  temperatures  over the last three decades, taken               from a longer timeline discussed here . This closeup shows the annual trend in average global air temperature,               in degrees Celsius, from 1975 to 2008.  For each year, the range               of uncertainty is indicated by the vertical bars. The blue line               tracks the changes in the trend over time.

Thanks in large part to the record-setting El Niño of 1997–98,           the year 1998 was the warmest year globally in the 20th century. Since           2001 the global trend has been relatively flat, and 2008           was the coolest year so far this decade (see graph at left). However, a simple calculation           shows that global temperatures continue to run much           warmer now than in the past: the average from 1999–2008 exceeds the average from           1989–1998,           even though the latter period includes the record-warm 1998.
Although scientists are confident that global temperatures will rise           further in the coming decades, there could still be occasional "pauses" in           warming that last a few years, like the one we're seeing now.
Some           of the contributing factors to these breaks in warming could include           erupting volcanoes that spew sunlight-blocking ash skyward, a lack           of El Niño events, and/or the natural minimum in the 11-year           solar cycle. Since we are now emerging from the most recent solar minimum,           and an El Niño is developing in 2009, there's good reason to           believe global temperatures will climb significantly as the 2010s approach.
 
It's been really cold, with lots of snow. So what happened to global warming?
Temperature anomalies (variations above                 and below average, in degrees Celsius) for Wednesday,                 January 17, 2007. Despite the cold across Texas                 and New England, most of the Northern Hemisphere was running                 well above average that day.

There are always cold spells and warm spells going on in         one place or another. But even where weather is cold, what's considered "typical" is         changing. For example, the heavy snow that struck Colorado and         Kansas at the end of 2006 was actually more characteristic of that         area's autumn or spring weather than a typical December.
Globally, Earth's natural processes don't follow a linear pattern, so the     global average temperature may be slightly cooler or warmer from one     year to the next. Different parts of Earth's     ecosystem also  respond to the greenhouse effect in different ways.     The oceans, for example, hold more heat and respond to atmospheric     chnages more slowly than land masses do. Average temperatures of     the land, oceans, and atmosphere also vary from year to year as well     as from each other.
To examine long-term warming, climate scientists     look at large       areas and longer time periods. The maps on this page help illustrate the global nature of climate change.

The picture becomes even more striking when                 looking at the period from mid-December to mid-January and December as a whole.
The warming is especially strong in the high-latitude                 countries of Canada and Russia, which is consistent with the                 long-term trends predicted by computer models that take increased                 greenhouse gases into account.

Aren’t the computer models used to predict climate really simplistic?
The                 amount of detail in  climate models has continued to increase in recent years,                 largely  because of the calculation power provided by newer supercomputers.                  In the 1990s, high-resolution global climate                 models operated                 on the T42 resolution scheme (upper left). At  this resolution,                 temperature, moisture, and other  features were tracked in grid                 boxes that each spanned  about 200 by 300 kilometers at midlatitudes                 (120 x 180  miles), an area roughly as large as West Virginia.
In more recent  modeling that led up to                   the 2007 IPCC Working Group I  report, the NCAR-based Community                   Climate System Model  (CCSM) routinely operated at T85 resolution                   (upper  right), with midlatitude grid points of about 100 by                    150 km (60 x 90 miles)—the                 size of Connecticut.
Better  resolution not only provides a more true-to-life depiction                  of atmospheric processes, but also allows for more realistic                  topography, which makes regional climate                 projections more accurate.                 For example, the highest Rocky Mountains  appear as two coarse                 grid points at T42 but as a more  diverse assortment of high peaks                 at T170 (lower left).  Enhancements in computing power will help                 scientists  explore the use of higher resolutions, such as T170                 and  T340 (lower right).

Global climate models—the software packages that simulate the           past, present, and future of our atmosphere—have grown in complexity           and quality over the last 10 to 20 years, and the most sophisticated           models agree on the big picture of climate           change. This includes the rough amount of warming expected and           the idea that poles will warm faster than lower latitudes. As           models have continued to improve, increasing agreement on regional           details has emerged, such as the likelihood of more precipitation in           the northern subpolar latitudes and a northward expansion of the hot,           dry subtropics around 30°N. Climate models are not perfect,           but the main ingredients are well understood and tested, and scientists           are making progress in areas that remain a challenge, such as the behavior           of tropical oceans and the evolution of cloud patterns.
It’s important to note that models are not the only reason why           scientists are concerned about climate change.  For more than           a century—long before many recent advances in science, and long           before computer models—we’ve known that increased greenhouse           gases could produce a global temperature increase.  Observations           of the last century of climate, including those from instruments and           from the behavior of ice and plants, concur that the planet is warming.  As           greenhouse gases continue to increase, it stands to reason that more         warming can be expected.
Even the earliest models           of the 1960s, which were quite crude by today’s standards, showed           that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase           global temperature by around 5°F (3°C). That projection remains           close to the modern consensus, and temperatures over the last 30 years           have risen at a rate consistent with this early estimate.
Far more information is available from today’s models, such           as the NCAR-based Community           Climate System Model , because they           now include many more aspects of the Earth system, including ice sheets,           vegetation, cloud areas, and soil moisture.
Research conducted for the 2007 IPCC Working Group 1 assessment compared           the output from major models at research centers around the world.           While these models are far from perfect, scientists are confident that           they capture the key processes that drive climate. For example, models           now replicate the ups and downs of 20th-century global temperature           quite accurately.
As in other areas of science, rigorous testing and continual improvement           are part and parcel of climate modeling. Researchers can test models           against reality, identify and correct flaws, and compare their models         with others. 
 
The complexity of global climate models has increased     enormously over the last four decades, as shown in this graphic. The     most powerful models, such as the Community Earth System Model     (developed by scientists at the Department of Energy and NCAR with     colleagues at other organizations), now have the capability of     simulating a broad range of atmospheric processes, such as the impact of     marine ecosystems on the atmosphere.

Computer models reach high into a  virtual atmosphere and deep into the ocean. They simulate climate by  dividing the world into into 3-dimensional grid boxes, measuring  physical processes such as temperature at each grid point. Such models can be  used to simulate changes in climate over years, decades, or even  centuries. Click here or on the image to enlarge. (©UCAR.

The NCAR-based Community  Earth System                 Model ( CESM ) is one of the world’s most  sophisticated                 models of   global climate. Created by scientists at NCAR, the Department of Energy,   and collaborators, this powerful model simulates the many processes in   our climate system, ranging from clouds and atmospheric chemicals to  ice  to marine ecosystems.

We're going into an ice age, aren't we?
Glacial periods have occurred about every 100,000 years, in sync with           well-understood cycles of change in the           way Earth orbits the Sun . These           "Milankovitch cycles" affect where sunlight hits the planet,           which can speed up or slow down the accumulation of ice across high           latitudes. 
It has been about 10,000 years since the last glacial period ended.           All else being equal, another glacial period would be expected to arrive           in the next several tens of thousands of years. However, the exact           process is not fully understood, so we don’t know exactly when           this will occur.
In contrast, the increase in human-produced greenhouse gases is proceeding           rapidly, and it is already having effects that could intensify significantly           in the next few decades. We cannot count on the arrival of the next           ice age to offset the potentially catastrophic effects of human-triggered           climate change over the next several centuries.
 
 
When it comes to glaciers, aren't there other factors besides temperature determining whether they're growing or shrinking?
Glaciers started melting long before human industrial activity. Glacier dynamics are indeed complex, and melt rates           can be influenced strongly by many factors. For example, dark           particles of pollution that fall on ice and snow fields can increase           melting because they absorb           more sunlight than the lighter           colored surface. But the vast majority of glaciers           across the planet are melting, with the melt rate accelerating in many           areas. This global phenomenon can be best explained by research that           includes the rise in global  temperatures as a main driver.           The involvement of other factors does not negate the role of warming           temperatures in ice and snow melt.
The National Snow and Ice Data Center tracks changes in glaciers,           including where they end (terminus) and how large they are           (mass balance) on its State           of the Cryosphere site. Their Glacier           Photograph Collection provides           stark evidence of how rapid the decline is for many glaciers around           the world.
 
 
Isn't ice building up in some places, like Antarctica (and doesn't that offset losses in the Arctic)?
As the amount of summertime ice has declined in the Arctic Ocean,           it has increased in the Southern Ocean adjoining Antarctica.  The           processes controlling ice in these two areas are not the same, though,           and the implications for global climate are very different.
Southern sea ice forms and decays each year around the edge of Antarctica.  However,         the continent itself remains virtually covered with ice year round. In         the Arctic Ocean, there is about twice as much summer ice as there is         around Antarctica. The loss of summer ice in the Arctic threatens         to expose much of the ocean to the midsummer sun. Since dark ocean absorbs           far more sunlight than does the brighter sea ice, this leads         to a warmer ocean and, thus, further melting, in a warming feedback loop.           The total loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic would also have profound           implications for the people and wildlife of this region.
What is the IPCC?
Highlights from the IPCC Working Group II, Summary for Policymakers, Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
“Some adaptation is occurring now, to observed and projected future      climate change, but on a limited basis.”
“Adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the     warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions.”
“However, adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected     effects of climate change, and especially not over the long run as most impacts     increase in magnitude.”
“A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more extensive adaptation     than is currently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to future     climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs, but these are not fully      understood.”
“Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by the presence     of other stresses.”
“. . .[T]he projected impacts of climate change can vary greatly due     to the development pathway assumed. For example, there may be large     differences in regional population, income and technological development     under alternative scenarios, which are often a strong determinant of     the level of vulnerability to climate change.”
“Sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate change     by enhancing adaptive capacity and increasing resilience. At present,     however, few plans for promoting sustainability have explicitly included     either adapting to climate change impacts, or promoting adaptive capacity.”
“A portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can further diminish     the risks associated with climate change.”
“This Assessment makes it clear that the impacts of future climate     change will be mixed across regions. For increases in global mean temperature     of less than 1 to 3°C [1.8 to 5.4°F] above 1990 levels, some impacts     are projected to produce benefits in some places and some sectors,     and produce costs in other places and other sectors. It is, however,     projected that some low latitude and polar regions will experience     net costs even for small increases in temperature. It is very likely     that all regions will experience either declines in net benefits or     increases in net costs for increases in temperature greater than about     2 to 3°C     [3.6 to 5.4°F].”
 
What is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological          Organization, to assess the state of scientific knowledge about the human role in climate change.
To accomplish its mission, the IPCC coordinates the efforts of         more than 2,000 scientists from 154 countries. Together, they represent         a vast array of climate specialties, from physics, to chemistry, to interactions         with Earth's surface, to the role of human behavior. Their reports take         years of critical assessment and review before they are         issued to the public. The scientists who participate volunteer their time to IPCC activities, assisted by a small number of paid staff.
Because each chapter is subjected to more extensive review than         perhaps any other scientific report, and because the authors are assessing         multiple studies, many of the findings reported by the IPCC are considered more         cautious or conservative than the outlooks provided by any single experiment         or analysis.
Because different types of expertise are required to assess different aspects of climate change, the IPCC is divided into three working groups.
Working Group I reviews the physical science, including           observations and computer modeling of the past, present, and future
Working Group II examines the likely impacts on           people and the environment.
Working Group III explores policy options for lessening           the likelihood of climate change.
Each working group prepares a lengthy report and a much briefer "Summary         for Policymakers." In addition to the three working groups, the IPCC Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories was created in 1991 to help participating countries calculate and report their production and elimination of greenhouse gases.
In addition to reviews by individual scientists and scientist panels,           each chapter within an assessment is also scrutinized by  representatives of the  governments         participating in the IPCC  process. While governments  negotiate on how         the findings are  worded, the final product is  based on a         scientific, not a political, consensus .
After years of planning, collecting, writing, and responding to           multiple reviews, each assessment report reflects the  scientific          consensus on what is known and what is still  uncertain about the environmental         and societal consequences of  continuing to add greenhouse gases to Earth's         atmosphere.
In late 2007, participants in all of the IPCC assessments since         1990 shared         in the Nobel Peace Prize .
The IPCC has published major assessments in 1990, 1996,  2001,          and 2007, as well as special interim reports on topics such as aviation, land use, assessment methods, or emissions scenarios. All of the major and interim reports are available in the six official languages of the United Nations and may be downloaded from the IPCC Publications and Data page.
The next major assessment report is  scheduled for release in 2013–2014.

Politics and opinion
Don't all the government reviewers and negotiations over wording make the IPCC report political, not scientific?
The unique structure of the IPCC includes both scientific and governmental           review, but the input of diplomats to the final report           is designed to be distinct and different from that of scientists.
Scientists who are experts in their subject matter prepare the chapters           that go into the full assessment reports. Those chapters are scrutinized            by individual scientists and scientist panels, whose questions must           be addressed before a chapter can be approved for inclusion.  The           chapters making up the 2007 draft report from IPCC Working Group 1           report run to over 1,600 pages.
It           is only the Summary             for Policymakers, typically around 30 pages,   that receives             a word-by-word review, during the final plenary session, by diplomats             from almost every nation in the world. The lead authors of the report             are on hand at the plenary to make sure that any  changes are             scientifically valid. The diplomats have a say in how the Summary             for Policymakers is           worded, but the scientists have the last word on what is said.
The result of the IPCC process is a report that carries the weight of         formal approval by the world's governments as well as the authority of         hundreds of participating scientists.         For more about the process, see the IPCC Fact Sheet on How         the Summary for Policymakers of an IPCC Working Group report is approved         during the Plenary .
Isn't there still a lot of debate among scientists?
The scientific             method is built on debate among scientists, who test           a question, or hypothesis, and then submit their results to  the             scrutiny of other experts in their field. That scrutiny, known as             "peer review," includes examining the scientists' data, experiment             and/or analysis methods, and findings.
The spirited debate around remaining           uncertainties in climate science is a healthy indicator           that the scientific method is alive and well. But the fundamental elements           of climate change are not in dispute. To take just a few examples,           we understand
how greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide             trap heat (see FAQ: What               is the Greenhouse Effect? )
how much carbon dioxide we have added to the atmosphere since the             Industrial Revolution (see FAQ: How much carbon dioxide is already in the atmosphere? )
how observed warming has been affecting plants, animals, the ecosystems             they live in, and us, the people who depend on them (see article: Impacts               on Natural Systems )
The questions            on this page represent many of those raised by debaters           who are not actively engaged in           climate research. These            questions have been answered here and elsewhere with evidence           from research that has been tested by the scientific method.
Science           is a human activity, and no human is infallible. Science is also a community activity, and scientists rely on each other to question, challenge, and improve one another's work. When corrections are made, this is not a sign that the system is broken but rather that it's working as designed.
The science reported           by researchers at NCAR and our collaborating institutions around the           world is built on decades           of investigation and represents the           current state of our knowledge on climate change.
Our understanding of the particulars of climate change continues to evolve, and predictions of specific impacts may be revised upward or downward. However, the majority           of climate scientists who specialize in understanding the complex interactions           of our atmosphere, Earth, and Sun have concluded           that:
Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced ( U.S.               Global Change Research Program , citing its 2009 report on Global           Climate Change Impacts in the United States).
Changes in the atmosphere, the oceans, and glaciers and ice caps           now show unequivocally that the world is warming due to human activities             ( United             Nations , citing the IPCC 2007 report)
Here's what several major scientific organizations say about global warming           and climate change, including the uncertainties climate scientists           continue to examine (each link opens a new window):
