High Tech Weather Forecasting
What is Meteorology?
Meteorology is the study of the current weather conditions. A meteorologist, known to most as the “weatherman”, also formulates short-term weather forecasting. Meteorologists use Doppler Radar to predict precipitation, wind direction or when storm tracking. They record daily weather data and records. Meteorologists make use of weather data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , more specifically the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service alerts and warnings help meteorologists determine the extent and impact of storms, flooding, fire threats, tsunamis and other weather situations.
Using Weather and Climate Collectively
Climate and weather use the same terms for measurements:
temperature
wind
solar radiation.
Together, climate and weather can be used in forecasting models, for both long and short-term weather predictions. Weather and climate are interrelated, as changes in one affect the other. Accurate weather measurements and data collection is important to climate predictions and analysis. Climate prediction can be extremely complex because of uncertainties. Monitoring of the climate is dependent on complete and precise weather measurements.
