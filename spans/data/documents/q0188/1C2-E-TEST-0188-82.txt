Global warming is a more precise description of what is blamed on humans.  Climate change encompasses everything that might happen to make sure that humans can be blamed for something.  The climate always changes and there hasn't been significant warming.  There certainly hasn't been warming beyond what would be considered perfectly natural warming by rational people.
