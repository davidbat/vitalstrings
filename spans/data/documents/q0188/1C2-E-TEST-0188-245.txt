The fall cool-down is notably more rapid than the spring warm-up, but otherwise the two are very similar. Actually even summer and winter are only marginally different in terms of appearances.
The seasons here are best marked by fruit. Winter is strawberry season, spring stone fruits like peaches and cherries, summer is watermelon and mango, fall is dates and pomegranetes.
Back in Victoria BC, springs and falls were rather distinct. Spring was cooler, cloudier, and drier, but greener than the fall. Victoria can be quite dry in summer, so often things weren't green again until the leaves were off the oaks. Fall was sunnier, warmer, but also wetter than spring.
Though I appreciated the early blossoms of Victoria, spring's cool often outstayed its welcome. On the other hand, pleasantly warm days happened as late as early November. There was a big lag.
