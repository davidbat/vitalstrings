General                  Characteristics
Due to the extension of the country,                  its geographical location, and different latitudes and altitudes,                  Argentina presents climatic characteristics that greatly differ                  from one region to the other.
Like other South American countries                  below the equator, Argentina's winter lasts from July to October,                  while the summer goes from December to March. The winter is cold                  and rainy and the days grow shorter, therefore, we recommend visiting                  the north and northwest regions during this time, since there                  is less rainfall and heat there during this season. The summers                  are hot and humid and the days are longer, making the Patagonia                  and southern Andes ideal vacation spots.
The sea regulates the temperature                  in the majority of the country's costal cities so there is not                  much difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures.                  This is the case in Buenos Aires.
For many people the ideal months                  to visit Argentina are in the spring and fall since the climate                  at this time remains relatively warm.
