The northern border with     the
US
is 1,947 mi long (3,141 km), the border in the south and east with
Guatemala
is 596 mi (962 km) and the border to the east with
Belize
is 155 mi (250 km).  The coastline totals 5,785 mi (9330 km).
The northernmost portion     of
Mexico
is covered by two different deserts.  The largest is the Chihuahuan     desert which covers approximately 176,700 sq mi (453,000 sq km) and is     centered between the
Sierra Madre Occidental
and
Sierra Madre Oriental
mountain ranges.  The Sonoran desert covers about 86,000 sq mi (221,000     sq km) and ranges from the majority of the Baja peninsula and the     northwestern portion of the mainland.
Northern and central     Mexico have also have coastal plains on the east and west and two     north/south mountain ranges framing a group of broad central plateaus known     as the Altiplano Central.  The Altiplano Central is divided into     northern and central parts, themselves split by minor ranges and varies in     altitude from about 3,300 ft (1,000 mt) in the north to more than 6,500 ft     (2,000 mt) in the center of the country.  The central plateau is mostly     rolling hills and broad valleys and includes some of the best farm and ranch     land in the country.  The altiplano is bound on the east by the
Sierra Madre Oriental
and includes peaks as high as 12, 000 ft (3,700 mt).  The
Gulf
plain is an extension of a plain in the
US
and is wide in the north but narrows as it nears the
port
Veracruz
.
South of the Altiplano     Central and the two Sierra Madres, the Cordillera (mountain range)     Neovolcanica runs east-west acress the country.  This range includes     the active volcanoes Popocatepetl (17, 800 ft; 5,452 mt) and Volcan de Fuego     de Colima (13,000 ft; 3,960 mt), as well as Mexico’s other highest peaks,     Pico de Orizaba (18,000 ft; 5,611 mt), Iztaccihuatl (17,300 ft; 5,286 mt)     and Paricutin (9,200 ft; 2,800 mt).
The Pacific lowlands     cover a narrow strip west of
