Paraguay is entirely landlocked and is situated between          18° and 28°S. It is as large as the state of California. It is          bordered on the north by Bolivia and Brazil and on the south by Argentina.
Most          of the country lies below 450 m/1,500 ft. The northwestern part of the          country lies entirely within the tropics and has a typical tropical climate          with hot summers, warm winters, and most of its rainfall in the hottest          months between October and March.
The          southeastern half of the country has temperatures a little lower in all          months, but the summers are sufficiently hot and wet to be typically tropical.
The          northwest of Paraguay is part of the Chaco region, which extends into          the adjoining regions of Bolivia and Argentina. Here annual rainfall ranges          between 750 mm/30 in and 1,250 mm/50 in, increasing northwards. Occasionally          in winter the region is affected by outbreaks of colder polar air from          Antarctica; this cold air lowers the temperature for a day or so but frost          is very rare.
This          is a rather desolate and sparsely populated region. It is very flat and          level; the elevation of the land rises very gradually towards the Bolivian          border. Differences of climate and weather are small within the Chaco.
The          southeastern half of the country contains some land that is a little higher,          and the more southerly latitude means that the winter here is somewhat          cooler; however, cold days with frost are very rare.
Summer          temperatures are hot to warm so that conditions are then quite tropical.          Rainfall is between 1,250 mm/50 in and 1,750 mm/70 in a year and it increases          eastwards. Rain can be expected on about one day in five in winter and          on about one day in three in summer.
The          table for Asunción illustrates conditions in the centre of the          country. To the northwest, in the Chaco, conditions are a little hotter          in all months and there is less rainfall. In the southeast of the country          it is rather wetter with slightly lower temperatures in all months. The          southeast is the most developed and densely populated part of Paraguay.
The          weather can often be distinctly sultry and oppressive during the wet summer          months and this is particularly the case in the Chaco region.
