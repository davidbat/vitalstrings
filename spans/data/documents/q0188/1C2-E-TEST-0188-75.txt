I understand organisational culture to describe all the unwritten rules, practices, attitudes and beliefs that affect the way in which business is done and underpins the interactions of staff and customers.
Organisational climate describes the morale and perceptions of the organisation and is quite subjective.  A major education department in South Australia has just undertaken an organisational climate survey in which staff have been asked to rate their work environment and teams against 16 criteria, incuding team functioning, leadership, clarity of purpose and roles etc.  With a large number of responses, a very clear picture of the organisational climate is emerging. The process also highlights a high level of variability across different sections of the department.
I've attached a powerpoint file that outlines the major features of the organisational climate survey.

ORGANIZATION  CLIMATE AND CULTURE
The Climate of your Organization is the State of its Health
How your employees feel about their jobs, their supervisors, their peers, top management, and many other factors affects their individual productivity, and collectively the ability of the organization to achieve its objectives.
Without a formal process, finding out about employee attitudes usually relies on the manager's instincts or the employee's own willingness to communicate upward. But managerial instinct rarely provides the kind of hard data needed for decision ‑ making. And most employees are hesitant to communicate anything but positive information to their supervisors.
The formal process generally involves using a climate survey or questionnaire, and you have probably learned that there are lots of them out there.
Organizational climate measures attempts to assess organizations in terms of dimensions that are thought to capture or describe perceptions about the climate.
1.Structure ‑ feelings about constraints and freedom to act and the degree of formality or informality in the working atmosphere.
2.Responsibility ‑ the feeling of being trusted to carry out important work.
3.Risk ‑ the sense of riskiness and challenge in the job and in the organization; the relative emphasis on taking calculated risks or playing it safe.
4.Warmth ‑ the existence of friendly and informal social groups.
5.Support ‑ the perceived helpfulness of managers and co‑workers; the emphasis (or lack of emphasis) on mutual support.
6.Standards ‑ the perceived importance of implicit and explicit goals and performance standards; the emphasis on doing a good job; the challenge represented in personal and team goals.
7.Conflict ‑ the feeling that managers and other workers want to hear different opinions; the emphasis on getting problems out into the open rather than smoothing them over or ignoring them.
8.Identity ‑ the feeling that you belong to a company; that you are a valuable member of a working team.
9.autonomy ‑ the perception of self‑determination with respect to work procedures, goals and priorities;
10.cohesion ‑ the perception of togetherness or sharing within the organization setting, including the willingness of members to provide material risk;
11.trust ‑ the perception of freedom to communicate openly with members at higher organizational levels about sensitive or personal issues, with the expectation that the integrity of such communications will not be violated;
12.resource ‑ the perception of time demands with respect to task competition and performance standards;
13.support ‑ the perception of the degree to which superiors tolerate members' behaviour, including willingness to let members learn from their mistakes without fear of reprisal;
14.recognition ‑ the perception that members' contributions to the organization are acknowledged;
15.fairness ‑ the perception that organizational policies are non‑arbitrary or capri­cious;
16.innovation ‑ the perception that change and creativity are encouraged, including
risk‑taking into new areas where the member has little or no  prior experience.

HOW  AN ORGANIZATION's  CULTURE CAN BE KNOWN ?
Organization culture  can  be  a  set  of  key values , assumptions,
understandings  and  norms that  is  shared  by  members of an
organization.
Organization  values  are fundamental beliefs that  an organization
considers  to  be  important , that are  relatively stable over time,
and  they have an  impact on  employees behaviors and  attitudes.
Organization  Norms  are  shared  standards that define what
behaviors are  acceptable  and  desirable within organization.
Shared  assumptions  are  about  how  things  are  done
in  an  organization.
Understandings  are  coping  with internal /  external  problems
uniformly.
