Heat storage refers                to the heat which is stored in the lower atmosphere and in the material                immediately below the surface. This can be in the form of latent                heat, in which case temperature is not affected unless water                phase changes occur. Materials such as light snow or dry soil                have low heat capacities, which means that changes in surface temperature                due to the heat transport mechanisms listed above will be greater                than for surfaces with a high heat capacity, such as the ocean.
Water Phase Changes refer to the processes of evaporation, condensation,                sublimation, freezing and melting. These affect the surface temperature                by changing the form of heat from latent to sensible forms or vice-versa.                Latent heat represents a form of heat storage that is not "realized"                until there is water phase change.
The processes described                above are called the "direct" controls on surface temperature                because they are the processes that are directly responsible for                controlling the surface temperature for any given time and location.                Any numerical model attempting to simulate or predict surface temperature                would need some type of mathematical representation of the above                processes to provide a quantitative measure of their effects on                surface temperature.
Notes:
The temperature                  of a ground, water or ice surface (surface temperature)                  and the temperature of the air just above the surface (near-surface                  air temperature) are not always the same, although they are                  usually closely related. In this section the term                  "surface temperature" will refer to either parameter, they                  will be distinguished when needed.
 
For simplicity,                  we use the term 'ocean' for all liquid water masses. This                  includes lakes, rivers and all other surface liquid water masses.
 
Indirect                Factors
The focus of this module                will be on a qualitative understanding of the factors controlling                the annual cycle of surface temperature for a given location. For                this purpose, it is more useful and practical to examine indirect factors controlling surface temperature, indicated below in green. They are called 'indirect'                because, in themselves, they do not control the temperature. They                do, however, control the direct factors (red) which, in turn, control                surface temperature. Here is a list of the most important indirect                factors which control surface temperature, along with an explanation                of how each one affects the direct factors and the annual cycle                of surface temperature.
Time of Day
Solar radiation is a function of time of day.
The surface is always                  emitting longwave                  radiation, usually at a rate greater than it is absorbing longwave                  radiation from above. Therefore, this tends to cool the surface.                  During midday hours, the net short wave radiation is typically                  greater than the net longwave radiation, the result is surface                  warming. At night, the short wave radiation is zero, therefore                  the net surface radiation cools the surface. These processes create                  the temperature cycle we call the diurnal temperature cycle.
Time of Year (season)
Solar radiation is also a function                    of time of year, therefore the surface temperature typically                    follows a yearly cycle.
Latitude
Solar                    radiation is also                   a function of latitude. On the average, the                    poles receive much less than the tropics, but not during                    all months of the year. Examine Figure 1 to see                   how downwelling solar (shortwave) radiation varies with latitude and                    time of year. Note that on their respective summer solstices,                    the North and South Poles actually receive more solar radiation                    than anywhere else in the world, although in today's climate most                   of the solar radiation reaching the surface in polar regions                   is reflected back due to the high albedos of snow and ice.
Surface Type
Four                  important aspects of the surface are albedo,                  heat storage, moisture content, and vegetation type:
Albedo
"Albedo" is the reflected solar radiation divided by the incoming solar radiation.                 Snow and ice have relatively high albedos.                  Therefore they tend to remain cooler than other surfaces exposed                  to short wave radiation.
Heat storage
Dry snow and dry soil have low heat storage,                  causing larger diurnal and yearly temperature variations. The                  ocean has very large heat storage, due to both the the high specific                  heat capacity of water and the ability of turbulent mixing to                  transfer heat energy much deeper than solid surface types.
Moisture content
Moisture at the surface will often decrease the albedo, but usually                  a more important effect is to convert sensible heat to latent                  heat by evaporation when warmed by short wave radiation. Moisture                  also tends to increase the surface heat storage. The net result                  of these effects usually causes moist surfaces to have smaller                  diurnal and yearly temperature variations than dry surfaces.
Vegetation type
Higher and thicker vegetation lessens short wave radiation, while                  at the same time increasing downward longwave radiation at the                  surface. Transpiration of plants cool the surrounding air in the                  daytime. The net effect is that thicker and higher vegetation                  decreases the magnitude of both the diurnal and the yearly temperature                  cycles.
Elevation
In general, higher                  elevations surfaces will be colder due to adiabatic cooling of                  air parcels and decreased downward longwave radiation.                  Small scale elevation changes may have different effects and are                  discussed below in the local topography category.
Continentality
The ocean moderates                  surface temperature swings for reasons discussed above. Horizontal                  advection causes these effects to extend over adjacent land                  regions as well. Regions over the oceans and adjacent land areas                  are said to have a marine climate that is characterized                  by a relatively small magnitude yearly temperature cycle. Land                  regions far away from marine influences, particularly areas isolated                  by mountains, have very large differences in temperature between                  summer and winter. These areas experience a continental climate.                  Therefore, continentality is a measure of the marine influence                  (actually the lack of) and is quantified by the magnitude of the                  yearly temperature cycle. Synoptic activity and clouds (described below) are also related to                 marine influence and are therefore closely related to continentality.
Synoptic Activity
Cyclones                    are efficient at horizontally advecting heat between                    latitudes and between land and ocean areas. Therefore, polar regions                    that experience frequent cyclones are usually warmer than other                    polar regions. Storms are associated with high winds and cloudy                    conditions. The high winds tend to disrupt nocturnal surface                    inversions and cause vertical                    advection (mixing) of                    warmer air from above. The effects of the clouds, vertical and                    horizontal advection from strong synoptic activity causes areas                    in storm tracks generally to have more moderate diffferences in average temperature                    between winter and summer. (There will be larger 1-10 day temperature                    swings.)
Clouds
Clouds decrease downward                  short wave radiation and increase downward longwave radiation.  The                  result is cooler days and summers, and warmer nights and winters.
Local Topography
In the absence of                  strong mixing winds, shallow valleys will collect cold air that                  has flowed downhill from surrounding surfaces that are cooled                  by longwave                  radiation at night. Therefore, these areas will have colder                  nighttime temperatures. Conversely, the surrounding slopes will                  be warmer than would otherwise occur without the cold air drainage.                  This may seem to contradict the elevation effects described above.                  But the topographic effects described here result from a location's                  immediate surroundings, while the elevation effect described above                  is more general. These "cold drainage" valleys and adjacent warm                  slopes are not so different in elevation from each other that adiabatic heating of the downward flowing air parcels is                  able to counteract the longwave radiational cooling.  Therefore,                  due to the combination of elevation and local topographic effects,                  high valleys tend to have the coldest temperatures in a region,                  with the possible exception of mountain peaks, where elevation                  effects (cold) may dominate local topographic effects. Deep valleys                  and areas in the lee of mountains may be warmer than nearby areas                  (at the same elevation) if air parcels are forced to move downhill                  before reaching the valley bottoms.
Ocean Currents and Convection
Horizontal temperature advection by ocean currents and turbulent vertical heat flux during ocean convection can transport large amounts of heat energy               and strongly affect surface temperature.
