When planning travel to Mexico you need to consider the weather and seasons so you can make informed decisions about where to go and what to pack. Many people automatically assume that the weather throughout Mexico is always hot - not true! Mexico is a large country and its weather can vary greatly from one destination to another.
The weather in Mexico is determined not only by latitude but also by altitude. Mexico has tropical forests, dry deserts, fertile valleys and snow-capped mountains. Since Mexico's terrain is extremely varied, so is the weather. On the coast the climate is generally balmy year-round, but some months are rainy and others dry, and Mexico City can have days - and nights - that are quite chilly.
Seasons in Mexico
In Mexico there are two main seasons. Although there is some variation in temperature over the year, the most obvious difference is between rainy and dry seasons. The rainy season through most of Mexico falls roughly from May through September or October. During the rest of the year there is little or no rain. Don't be discouraged from visiting during rainy season, when you'll see lush, green landscape, as opposed to the dry season's parched, brown landscape - and it often only rains in the late afternoons and evenings.
Hurricane Season
Hurricanes and other natural disasters can ruin your vacation. Before heading to Mexico during hurricane season (June to November), check the weather forecasts and read up about precautions you can take in our article: Hurricane Season Travel in Mexico
