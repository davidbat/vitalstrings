Keith Randa   Apple Valley High School   Apple Valley, Minnesota     BACKGROUND INFORMATION  Antarctica is the southern-most continent on Earth.  The South Pole is located on the continent of Antarctica.  This pole represents the axis about which the Earth is rotating.  Antarctica's location presents a unique situation in terms of weather and climate.  We will begin the study of Antarctica's weather with a look at the causes of weather, climate, and seasonal change.     CAUSES OF THE SEASONS ON EARTH:  1-The tilt of the Earth's Axis is 23 1/2 degrees from vertical.  The North Pole is always pointed toward the star Polaris.  The sun's rays that strike the Earth are parallel.  2-Rays from the sun range from direct to indirect.  A-Direct rays strike the surface of the Earth at close to a 90 degree angle. Direct rays are more concentrated.  This concentrated energy provides more heat.  B-Indirect rays strike the surface at angles less than degrees.  Indirect rays are more spread out.  The spread out rays provide less heat.  The sun's rays are parallel when they reach the Earth and the curvature of the Earth is what causes the rays to be direct or indirect.  The parts of the Earth that receives direct rays are hotter those receiving indirect rays are cooler.  Summer in the Northern Hemisphere is caused by the North Pole's tilt toward the sun.  The tilt causes the Northern Hemisphere to receive the most direct rays and have longer days.  These two factors cause the temperatures to be warmer.  Due to the tilt, the North Pole and Arctic Circle receive 24 hours of daylight.  Even when the North Pole has continual daylight, the sun's rays are very indirect due to the Earth's curvature, and allows very little heating.  At the same time the Southern Hemisphere has continual darkness, which means that it also receives indirect rays but has short days.  These factors cause the cooler conditions of the winter.  During this time, the South Pole has 24 hours of darkness lasting about six months.  During the winter, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun and receives 24 hours of darkness.  The tilt has effects on both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.  The tilt causes the Northern Hemisphere to receive less direct rays, and experience more hours of darkness.  The Southern Hemisphere receives more direct rays and more hours of light, so they are experiencing summer.  Although the South Pole experiences 24 hours of daylight, it stays cool because the sun's rays are so indirect.  During the spring and fall, the axis of the Earth is not tilted relative to the sun but is perpendicular to the sun's rays.  This means that the equator is receiving the most direct rays from the sun and is experiencing the warmest temperatures.  This results in equal hours of daylight and darkness over the entire planet and occurs on the spring and fall equinoxes in March and September.  Different temperatures on the Earth's surface are responsible for causing the weather.  The unequal heating of the Earth's surface causes air pressure differences which in turn causes the winds, which move the weather systems that form around the Earth.  Weather includes temperature changes, air movements, evaporation, formation of clouds, and precipitation.  The energy to make all of these things happen comes from the sun.  The weather in Antarctica is characterized by high winds, blowing snow, and extremely cold, dry air.  The following is a summary of the weather conditions typically found in Antarctica.     TEMPERATURE  The average temperature at the South Pole is -57 degrees F., while the average temperature on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula is 24 degrees F.  In the Antarctic summer the temperatures range from 32 degrees F.  to 59 degrees F.  on the coast, and 5 degrees F.  to -41 degrees F. inland.  Warmer temperatures are due to the longer days that occur during the summer months.  The mid-winter temperatures range from -40 degrees F. to 31 degrees F.  on the coast and -126 degrees F.  to -21 degrees F. inland.  Winter temperatures are influenced by the shortage of sunlight during the Antarctic winter.  In fact, the coldest temperatures are usually during late August before the return of the sun.  Other factors besides the indirectness of rays from the sun and differences in length of daylight cause Antarctica to be so cold.  These include:  -The snow cover reflects the sun's light instead of absorbing it.  In snow free areas land surfaces heated by the sun radiate heat back to the lower atmosphere causing warmer conditions.  -The extreme dryness of the air, due to the cold temperatures, causes any heat that is radiated back into the atmosphere to be lost instead of being absorbed by the water vapor in the atmosphere.  -Antarctica has a higher elevation which causes cooler temperatures.  -During the winter, the size of Antarctica doubles as the surrounding sea water freezes blocking heat from the warmer surrounding ocean water.  The oceans typically act as a heat source because water takes a much longer time to change temperatures as compared to the land.  All of these factors combine to making Antarctica one of the coldest places on the Earth.     WIND  Wind is the movement of air from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure.  These pressure differences are caused by differences in temperatures.  Generally, colder temperatures develop higher pressure due to the cool air sinking towards the Earth's surface.  Lower pressure is due to warm air rising from the surface of the Earth.  The rotation of the Earth causes these winds to curve as they move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.  Over the South Pole cold dense air sinks towards the surface.  This sinking air flows outward from the pole towards the coast causing nearly constant wind and average about 11 miles per hour about 64% of the time. Occasionally the cold, dry air moving away from the interior highlands is accelerated by gravity to speeds up to 150 mph.  These winds are called "katabatic winds."  Wind causes two special problems in Antarctica:  wind chill factor and localized blizzards.  Wind chill is the cooling factor caused by the combination of wind and temperature to produce conditions that would be much colder than the temperature alone and is the most debilitating factor of Antarctic expeditions.  Localized blizzards are caused when the surface wind sweeps up any loose snow, even if the skies above are clear and no snow is falling.  These conditions make travel and outdoor activities virtually impossible.     PRECIPITATION  The low temperatures in Antarctica allow the atmosphere to hold very little water.  The atmosphere above Antarctica has about 1/10th of the water vapor concentration found in temperate latitudes.  The water vapor present largely comes from the ice free regions of the southern oceans.  The water vapor falls as precipitation mostly in the form of snow.  Rainfall is almost unknown.  Antarctica is known as the world's largest desert because it receives an average of 2" of snow per year in the interior.  The coasts receive an average of 1-2 feet of snow caused by frequent storms during the winter season.     CLIMATE OF ANTARCTICA  Climate is defined as the average weather for a region over a period of time with the two main features being temperature and precipitation.  The main factors influencing climate are latitude, altitude, prevailing winds, topography, distance from large bodies of water, and nearby ocean currents.  There are two main climatic regions in Antarctica: the coastal regions and the interior.  The coastal regions of Antarctica are milder for the following reasons:  -The lower latitude provides more direct rays from the sun in the summer and also shorter periods of darkness in the winter.  -The closeness to the ocean means that in the summer coasts receive more moisture in the form of precipitation, and also have warmer temperatures due to the water's heat storing capability.  The interior of Antarctica has the harshest climate in the world,  even harsher than the North Pole.  This is due to the following conditions:  -The interior receives the most indirect rays from the sun which makes it cooler.  -For long periods in the winter it receives no sunlight at all â€¢ The interior has a very high altitude which adds to the very cold temperatures.  -Because the interior of Antarctica is a land mass and far away from the ocean, it gets no warming effect from the water.  Overall, the coast is relatively warm and moist compared to the dry and cold interior.  However, in comparison to other climates around the world, Antarctica is a very harsh place.

APPLICATION ACTIVITIES  Select one or more of the following activities to provide students with practice applying their new knowledge.  1-Weather of the Expedition  In this activity, students will look at the weather that the expedition will encounter as they travel across Antarctica.  They will also evaluate what types of weather might interfere with the activities of the expedition.  2-Climate comparison activity  In this activity, students will plot temperature and precipitation graphs for three different locations.  They will then determine the factors which are responsible for these climates.  They can then pick the perfect climate and what they would do for employment and recreation in that environment. They will then compare their perfect climate with Antarctica's climate.  3-Antarctica Travel Brochure  Working in groups of two, students will design a travel brochure that could be given to travelers to Antarctica.  Included in the brochure would be information about the seasonal weather along with suggested attire and a list of possible activities designed to entice a traveler to make a trip to Antarctica.     APPLICATION ACTIVITY #1:    WEATHER OF THE EXPEDITION     PURPOSE:  To have students see what type of weather the Expedition is encountering and to see what affects the weather has on the activities and progress of the Expedition.     BACKGROUND:  The team members of the Trans-Antarctica Expedition are encountering some of the harshest weather known on the Earth.  The very cold temperatures, strong winds, and blowing snow make outdoor activities very difficult.  The weather is a major factor determining whether or not the trek can be finished.     PROCEDURE:  1-Each team (2 people) should select one week of the Expedition to work with.  2-Using the team bulletins from LEARNING LINK, each team should fill out the data table for their week of the Expedition.  3-After the table is finished, the team should write a summary of the week.  The Summary should include the following:  -Temperature range for the week  -Average temperature of the week.  -Range of wind speed for the week.  -Average wind speed of the week.  -Other weather conditions encountered during the week.  -Distance covered during the week.  -Any other difficulties caused by weather during the week.  -Overall statement explaining how the weather affected the team's progress or activities.  4-Team members should share their summary with others in one of the following ways.  -Meet in small groups of 8-10 to share summaries.  -Share the summaries orally in front of the whole class.  5-The class may get together to discuss the following:  -What are the general weather conditions encountered by the team traveling across Antarctica?  -Did the weather improve as they got further along in their trip?  -How does the weather that they are encountering compare with the weather that we are encountering during the same time?  -How do you think you could manage to survive in the weather of Antarctica?

To make some lifestyle decisions about each climate.     BACKGROUND:  Climate is the average weather over a region for a period of time.  The two main features of climate are temperature and precipitation.  There are several factors which work together to influence the climate.  These factors are latitude, altitude, prevailing winds, topography, proximity to oceans, and ocean currents.  The climate of Antarctica is vastly different from the climate of the rest of the Earth. It is influenced strongly by its location on the Earth, it's altitude and the fact that the Earth is tilted in its orbit around the sun. In this activity, we will look at the climates of five locations and determine what factors influence each climate.     PROCEDURE:  1-Set up a graph like the one shown below for each of the five  locations given in the climate data table.                  |                     |                |                     |                |                     |   Temperature  |                     |  Precipitation                |                     |                |                     |                |                     |                |_____________________|                J F M A M J J A S O N D   2-Plot the climate data for the five locations on each of the five graphs.
