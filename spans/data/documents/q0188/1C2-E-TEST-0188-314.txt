Weather and Climate in Germany
Germany's climate is almost as varied as its country but                      it is mostly temperate. Extreme temperature lows and highs                      are rare. Winter temperatures vary from west to east, with                      around freezing temperatures in the west and well below freezing                      in the east of Germany. Summer temperatures are typically                      between 20°C and 30°C, with more rainfall during the                      summer months.
Frequent changes of weather make forecasting difficult. To                      be on the safe side, be sure to bring a sweater and wet weather                      clothing with you.
Central and Southern Hills
Apart from the coastal regions, the Northern regions and                      Southern Bavaria, Germany's climate is relatively constant.                      From Leipzig and Dresden to Stuttgart the summers are warm                      with frequent rainshowers. Winters are generally cold. The                      amount of snowfall and average temperatures are generally                      influenced by altitude rather than by various climatic regions.
The weather is continental in the sense that it varies from                      year to year, meaning a chilly spring and rainy summers one                      year can be followed by spectaculary warm and sunny the next                      year.
The areas around the Rhine are blessed with a particularly                      pleasant climate which allows for the successful cultivation                      of grapevines. Close to the German border with Switzerland,                      in the region of Freiburg im Breisgau, temperatures are generally                      warm enough for tobacco to grow successfully.

Baltic Coast and North German Plain
Due to the influenceof the sea, the climate around the Baltic                      and the North Coast is fairly reliable and with little variation.                      In contrast to inner Germany, the difference between seasons                      is less distinct. However, winters can be severe with cutting                      winds and freezing temperatures.
Summers are warm and pleasant. Rainshowers are frequent but                      do not last too long: the sunshine index is high, whilst the                      amount of rainfall guarantees a green and fertile landscape.

Bavarian Alps
The climate of Bavaria is similar to the climate of the Austrian Alps, esp. of neighbouring Tyrol. Winters can be cold and                      with frequent snowfalls. Germany's highest peaks and deepest                      valleys offer excellent wintersport opportunities.
The south is particularly famous for its warm foehn winds,                      which are notoriously blamed for everything from headaches                      to uncalled-for political changes. These warmblowing winds                      mostly occur in autumn and spring and often account for dramatic                      temperature fluctuations.
