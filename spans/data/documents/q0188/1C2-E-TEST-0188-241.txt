Cooking differences: Northern regions have "discovered" olive oil quite recently (probably in the 60s of last century), before that there was massive use of butter in the North and olive oil in the South. The same goes for other food differences that are now less evident than in the past. Hot pepper and oregano are typical of the South, like spicy sausages and salame.

The major regional division in Italy is between the prosperous, industrialized North Italy and the poor, rural South Italy and the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. The origins of the problem of these regional differences goes back centuries but the differences were increased as a result of policy choices made at the time of the unification of Italy in the 1860's.
In the north of Italy the climate is cooler than the south of Italy which has a lot more flat land.
The north, with cities like Milan, has a lot more money than the south.
Apart from standard Italian, regional variations and "dialects", a number of truly separate languages do exist. In the north, the province of South Tyrol (SÃ¼dtirol in German, Alto Adige in Italian) is almost entirely German-speaking; the area was awarded to Italy following the First World War and her defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
