LIMITED ACCESS: If technology resources                            are limited, you can access the weather web site                            previously and print the weather data or display the                            weather web site using a projector or television                            screen.
GRAPHING: Students will be creating comparison                            chart for this lesson. If you are new or not familiar with                            graphing, please review the Graphing Tips .

Procedure
Part 1: Weather and Climate
Begin the activity by having a brief class              discussion to review the weather variables that the students have              been studying. Tell the students that, for the purpose of this              lesson, they will be using precipitation and temperature data              only.
Ask the students to take our their Weather Learning Logs and have them answer the questions.
Review the  climate report sites previous to the                  class. If your country is not listed below, conduct an online                  search using the key words "YourCountry Climate Report". For class use, you can either print out sufficient copies                  per individual students or groups of students, send data                  collector students to print the pages and bring a copy back to                  their groups, etc.
The information will vary depending on the report although                students will notice that information about the climate region as                well other information unique for their region is provided in the                climate reports.
Students should identify the climate region for their city.
Answers will vary. Some answers might include that the weather                report describes the weather for one day / hour while the climate                report describes the trends in weather over a year. The climate                reports also include detailed information about the geographic                location about the region.
Students should determine that they are looking at weather                when they look out the window because it changes from day to day                and hour to hour while the climate is the average weather in a                location over a long period of time.
After studying the data, students should be able to construct                the concept that weather changes every day and that climate is the                average weather in a location over a long period of time. One                might say that climate is what weather is "normally" like in a                place. The daily recording and averaging of weather information                helps to describe the climate of an area.
Part 2: Climate in your Region
Graph the Climate Data: Students will draw a comparison                chart that displays both the average monthly temperature over one                year in the form of a Line graph and average monthly precipitation                over one year in the form of a Bar graph. You should remind the                students that they will ONLY use the average temperature and                precipitation listed. An example of the types of                comparison chart produced in this        activity has been constructed and is available below, however this is NOT the same data that students will        use in their activity so their graph will be        different from the example.

NOTE:  You can copy and paste the data directly into the document          if you have access to a spreadsheet program like Excel however you will          need to remove the text descriptors (i.e. ºC and mm).
Temperature: Answers will vary. Ask the students to                answer the questions using their Student Worksheet or their                Weather Learning Logs.
Precipitation: Answers will vary. Ask the students                    to answer the questions using their Student Worksheet or their                    Weather Learning Logs.
Part 3: Final Conclusions
Depending on time, you can use this last section to assign                      students to write either a brief report or create a tourism                      brochure, pamphlet, etc. describing the climate for their                      region. Be sure to mention that students should address all                      of the points
Assessment Suggestions
Make each student or cooperative group responsible                      for their answers.

NOTE: The following instructions                      also appear in the Student                      Activities section of this web site.
 Activity C5:                          Weather and Climate
 
Part 1: Weather and Climate
Answer the following questions using the weather data that you                recorded in your Weather Learning Logs from Activity 3: Track                Weather like a Meteorologist.

Which day had the most precipitation? The least?
Which day had the highest temperature? The lowest?
Select one of the climate reports below for the country in                  which your city is located and read the information.
NOAA US Climate Site   (Statistics for all states. Access monthly averages for                    temperature and  precipitation by clicking on "Basic                    Climatology").
World Climate  (Average                    temperature for selected US and foreign cities).
Regional Climates (US                    climate data by section of the country)

Locate and read about the climate region for your city                    using                    the following world climate map and climate descriptions
Name at least three ways how climate reports are different from a weather report.
When we look out the classroom                      window, are we looking at climate or weather? Why?
What is the difference between weather and climate?
Part 2: Climate in your Region
Graph the Climate Data: In your Weather Learning Log,              you are going to create a comparison chart that displays both the average              monthly temperature over one year in the form of a Line graph and              average monthly precipitation over one year in the form of a Bar              graph. Label the              axis as shown in this example .              When you graph the data, use the monthly averages of the temperature and precipitation  from the  links                below:
(NOTE: If you have access to a spreadsheet                program like Excel, you can copy and paste the data directly into the                document)
www.weather.com --> Enter your city --> Select "Averages                  and Records"

Temperature
Did the average temperature you recorded in Activity 3 fall within the range of                      averages for the month?
Which month had the highest temperature? The lowest?
What was the average temperature for the year?
How does the line graph for the annual temperature                      compare with the temperature line graph you made in Activity                      4? Be specific.
Precipitation
Was the total amount of precipitation you recorded during Activity 3 representative of the average for that month?
Which month had the most precipitation? The least?
What                      was the total precipitation for the year?
How does the bar graph for the annual precipitation compare                with the precipitation bar graph you made in Activity 4? Be                specific.
Part 3: Final Conclusions
Write a brief report or create a tourism brochure,  pamphlet, etc. describing the climate for your country / region. Be sure to  include the following:
the difference between climate and weather;
the common characteristics of the climate region where your                city is located;
the average precipitation and temperatures for each                month/season (you can include the graphs if you wish);
how each of the three factors (latitude, elevation, and local                geography) influence the temperature of your country / region;
the "best" time of the year to visit your country and why; & and
the "worst" time of the year to visit your country and why.
EXTENSION
Compare your climate to that of another region listed above.
Select another city and compare and contrast the climate      for your region with that of another region / city
Use the weather web site --> "Averages      and Records" to locate a region for each of the below:
A city that has over 800 mm of precipitation a year.
A city that has less than 20 mm of precipitation a year.
A city that averages a temperature of below zero (-0 ºC)      for the year.
