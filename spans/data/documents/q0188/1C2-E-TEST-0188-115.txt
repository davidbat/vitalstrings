Weather    vs. Climate
What's    the difference?
Our weather changes    from day to day. Some days it may be rainy, the next day might be sunny. Sometimes    we have a few days that are cold, then the temperature might warm up for a while.    Weather is the daily or weekly changes in wind, moisture and temperature of    an area. All three of these changes take place in the air around us. We call    the air around the earth the atmosphere.
Weather    in an area over a period of years is called climate. In some climates the winters    are long and cold. In other climates the winters are short and mild.
It    is important to understand climate. Climate affects the clothes we wear, how    we heat our houses and the plants we grow. Water vapor is part of climate because    it is the moisture in the air. Have you wondered where water goes when it dries    from the sidewalk after a rain? It evaporates or changes into a gas. It goes    into the air and stays invisible until it condenses, or changes from gas to    liquid. It usually condenses to form a cloud.
