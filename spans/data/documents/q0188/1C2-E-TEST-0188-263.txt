Simply unite Science        (Occam's Razor / Simplicity) with Metaphysics        (Dynamic Unity of Reality) and describe reality from only one substance        existing, as Leibniz wrote;
'Reality cannot be found except in One single source, because of the        interconnection of all things with one another'.
Given we all experience many minds and many material things, but always in one common Space, we are thus required        to describe physical reality in terms of Space . We then find there is        only one solution, a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) where the electron is        a spherical standing wave. See Wave        Diagrams .
In hindsight the error was obvious, to try and describe an interconnected        reality with discrete 'particles', which then required forces / fields        to connect them in space and time. This was always just a mathematical solution which never explained how matter was connected across the universe .
I realise that there are a lot of 'crackpot' theories about truth and reality        on the internet, but it is easy to show that the Wave Structure of Matter        is the correct solution as it deduces the laws        of Nature (the fundamentals of Physics & Philosophy )        perfectly (there are no opinions). While the Wave Structure of Matter is obvious        once known , to begin it will seem strange simply because it takes time        for our minds to adjust to new knowledge.
For those who are religious        / spiritual , I think Albert        Einstein expresses the enlightened view of God . He writes 'I believe        in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists,        not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.' This harmony arises from a Wave Structure of Matter in Space (we are all        interconnected in this space that we all commonly experience). This unity        of reality (God, Brahman, Tao, Spirit, Energy, Light, Vibration) is central        to all major world religions, thus their common moral        foundation of 'Do unto others as to thyself' as the other is part of        the self.
Please        help our world (human society / life on earth) by sharing this knowledge.
Clearly our world is in great trouble due to human overpopulation and the        resultant destruction of Nature , climate        change and the pollution of air, land and water. The best solution to        these problems is to found        our societies on truth and reality rather than past myths        and customs (which invariably cause harm).
We are listed as one of the Top        Philosophy Websites on the Internet with around 600,000 page views each        week, and rank in the top 20 in Google for many academic search terms -        so we just need a bit of help to get in the top five. Given the Censorship in Physics / Philosophy of Science Journals (founded on the        standard model / particle physics) the internet is clearly the best way        to get new knowledge visible to the world.
A world now in great need of wisdom from truth and reality.

Human Survival & the Destruction of Nature
Climate Change and Global Warming
"We are experiencing the greatest wave of extinctions        since the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Extinction rates are rising by        a factor of up to 1,000 above natural rates. Every hour, three species disappear.        Every day, up to 150 species are lost. Every year, between 18,000 and 55,000        species become extinct. The cause: human activities." (Ahmed Djoghlaf,        head of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity)
Introduction
Most people are aware that human behavior is damaging the environment.        The purpose of this page is to show that this damage has now become dangerous        - that in many areas we are approaching the tipping point that will lead        to collapse of ecosystems. Most importantly, since humans evolved from Nature,        we thus depend upon Nature for survival, as it is the source of all our        food, air and water. If the natural systems that support life on earth collapse        then humanity is going to collapse (James Lovelock, who proposed the gaia        hypothesis , forecasts that billions of people will die).
So why is this happening? There are two obvious reasons;
i) The world is overpopulated.
ii) Our political / market economic system selects for short term profit        and over consumption.
How do we solve these problems?
Well the solution is obvious to any thoughtful mind. We must control human        population (Malthus wrote on this 200 years ago) and we must regulate corporations        to ensure they do what is good for humanity / life on earth.
Climategate: Global Warming Vs. Climate Change
I think a lot of people confuse Climate Change with Global Warming. Humans        are obviously changing the climate due to changing life on earth and adding        80,000 synthetic chemicals to the global system. Because of the complexity        of the system it is impossible to predict the changes.
However, to say that increasing CO2 by x amount will increase        global temperatures by y amount is naive and simplistic. This is why the        data was deliberately changed that has led to the 'climategate' controversy        - because the science behind it is flawed - so it does not work.
That this is the foundation for global energy policies is thus very foolish.
See: http://www.assassinationscience.com/climategate/
CO2 is trivial given the massive human overpopulation, the destruction        of nature, the pollution of environment that supports life on earth. While        global warming may be true, it may also not be true - certainly most of        the effect will be due to the sun, it is hard to say what the human contribution        is.
But climate change is true - and possibly catastrophic for humanity. I        suspect we will get greater variability in climate, that nature acts as        a moderator of changes due to its complex feedback cycles.
The irony is that though the science is bad, the move to green energy is        obviously good (the carbon tax is probably not the best way to go though).
Below you will find a number of articles on the problems our environment        faces - and this is just a small sample - the tip of the iceberg. To any        reasonably minded person the reports and statistics are frightening. The        further problem is that humans are notoriously blind        to the obvious .

Rapid Worldwide Depletion (90%) of Predatory Fish Communities
Ransom A. Myers and Boris Worm - Pub. in Nature Journal,        March 2003
Serious concerns have been raised about the ecological effects of industrialized        fishing, spurring a United Nations resolution on restoring fisheries and        marine ecosystems to healthy levels. However, a prerequisite for restoration        is a general understanding of the composition and abundance of unexploited        fish communities, relative to contemporary ones. We constructed trajectories        of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental        shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning        of exploitation.
Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within        15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species        were observed, but often reversed within a decade. We estimate that large        predatory fish biomass today is only about 10% of pre industrial levels.        We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions have extended        throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems.
'The impact we have had on ocean ecosystems has been vastly underestimated.        These are the megafauna, the big predators of the sea, and the species we        most value. Their depletion not only threatens the future of these fish        and the fishers that depend on them, it could also bring about a complete        re-organization of ocean ecosystems, with unknown global consequences.'        (Boris Worm)

Collapsing Fish Stocks - Summary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation        of the UN (FAO) Report
A major international scientific study released in November 2006 in the        journal Science found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide        have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than        10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue        all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years.
After increasing from around 79 million tonnes in 1998 to 87 million tonnes        in 2000, world marine capture fisheries production decreased to around 84        million tonnes in 2001 and remained at that level in 2002. This decrease        mostly took place in the Southeast Pacific and the Northwest Pacific.
The general trends in the levels of exploitation of world marine stocks        observed in previous years are continuing. In 2003,
* about one-quarter of the stocks monitored were underexploited or moderately        exploited,
* about half of the stocks were fully exploited and close to their maximum        sustainable limits of exploitation, and
* about one-quarter of stocks were overexploited, depleted, or recovering        from depletion, and needed rebuilding.

Importance of Krill - Transporting Carbon to the Ocean Floor
'Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling' - By Geraint        A. Tarling and Magnus L. Johnson - Article published in the journal Current        Biology on 7 February 2006
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are shrimp-like crustaceans that are        one of the most important animals in the Southern Ocean. They feed on phytoplankton        and are in turn eaten by a wide range of animals including fish, penguins,        seals and whales. Phytoplankon are the starting point for the marine food        chain and use photosynthesis to extract carbon from carbon dioxide.
Krill live in the open ocean, mainly in large swarms and reach particularly        high numbers in Antarctica. The migrations that they perform (called Diel        Vertical Migrations, DVM) are a way of transporting carbon to the ocean's        interior because they eat phytoplankton at the surface and excrete their        waste at depth.
The krill migrate from the ocean surface by fanning out their swimming        legs and enter a controlled descent, akin to parachuting. The behaviour        is most apparent when their stomachs are full and may be an effective means        of getting out of harms way when they can eat no more.
Dr Geraint Tarling from BAS says, 'We had no idea that krill's tactics        to avoid being eaten could have such added benefits to the environment.        By parachuting down they transport carbon which sinks ultimately to the        ocean floor - an amount equivalent to the annual emissions of 35 million        cars - and this makes these tiny animals much more important than we thought.'
Numbers of Antarctic krill have dropped by about 80% since the        1970's. The most likely explanation is a dramatic decline in winter        sea-ice. Krill feed on the algae found under the surface of the sea-ice,        which acts as a kind of 'nursery'. The Antarctic Peninsula, a key breeding        ground for the krill, has warmed by 2.5°C in the last 50 years, with        a striking decrease in sea-ice. It is not fully understood how the loss        of sea-ice there is connected to the warming, but could be behind the decline        in krill.
Canadian Atlantic Cod Fishery Collapse
In 1992, the devastating collapse of the cod stocks off the east coast        of Newfoundland forced the Canadian government to take drastic measures        and close the fishery. Over 40,000 people lost there jobs.
For the first time in 400 years the fishing of northern cod ceased in Newfoundland.        The fisheries department issued a warning in 1995 that the entire northern        cod population had declined to just 1,700 tonnes by the end of 1994 and        showed no sign of recovery - just 1,700 tonnes remained in a fishery that        had for over a century yielded a 250,000 ton catches, year after year.
