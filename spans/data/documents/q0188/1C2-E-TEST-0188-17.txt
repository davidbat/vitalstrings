Weather is the state of the atmosphere at the present time.  Climate is atmospheric conditions averaged over a long period of time (officially 30 years in the US, with averages updated every 10 years).  Meteorologists study weather over periods of minutes to weeks or even months, while climatologists study climate over periods of months to centuries and beyond, and there is very little overlap between the two.
