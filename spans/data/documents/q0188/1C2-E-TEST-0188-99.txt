The climate in the Amazonian rainforest is warm and humid and the average temperature in the area is about 79 degree Fahrenheit. One of the prominent features of this area is the difference between the temperature during the day and during the night is greater than that of the difference between the seasons.
The Amazon rainforest consists four layers and each layer has its unique ecosystem and plants and animals are adapted to that. The tallest layer is called the emergent layer, which has trees of approximately 200 feet in height. The other layer is canopy which has smooth oval leaves and have pointed drip tip. This makes the flow of water easy and preventing the growth of mosses and fungi. The layer below the canopy layer is able to get only 5 per cent of sunlight and plants of this layer are uniquely adapted to survive in the shadowy layer. The lowest layer is the forest floor and is almost without any plant. Only 2 per cent of sunlight reaches here.

The rain forest climate is hot, wet, sticky and humid. It rains heavily each day. The rain comes down suddenly and stops just as fast, this is called convectional rain.
