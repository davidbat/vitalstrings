The Ozone Layer
Ozone is a gas that occurs naturally in our atmosphere. Most of it is         concentrated in the ozone         layer ,  a         region located in the stratosphere several miles above the surface of         the Earth. Although ozone represents only a small fraction of the gas         present in the atmosphere, it plays a vital role by shielding humans         and other life from harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun. Human activities         in the last several decades have produced chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons         (CFCs), which have been released into the atmosphere and have contributed         to the depletion of         this important protective layer. When scientists realized the destructive         effect these chemicals could have on the ozone layer, international       agreements were put in place to limit such emissions. As a result, it is expected       that the ozone layer will recover in the coming decades.
Ozone is also a greenhouse           gas in         the upper atmosphere and, therefore, plays a role in Earth's climate.         The increases in primary greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide ,         may affect how the ozone layer recovers in coming years. Understanding         precisely how ozone abundances will change in a future with diminished         chlorofluorocarbon emissions and increased emissions of greenhouse gases         remains an important challenge for atmospheric scientists in NOAA and         other research centers.
Ozone Research
NOAA Research has, for many years, played a vital           role in studying the ozone           layer . For           instance, at the Chemical Sciences           Division of  ESRL ,           researchers are conducting laboratory and field experiments and designing         computer models to study this issue. One of the primary missions of ESRL's Global Monitoring Division is           to observe and understand the ozone layer through accurate, long-term           measurements of ozone, chlorofluorocarbons, greenhouse gases, and solar           radiation.
Taking Observations
NOAA researchers build and deploy instruments all           over the world to measure ozone, as well as the trace gases and aerosol           particles that affect its abundance. They also participate in many           field experiments to study and document the processes that control           atmospheric ozone. Research scientists take ozone           measurements using         instruments located on the ground and onboard aircraft, balloons, and         satellites. The data         from these instruments provide         precise measurements that can be used to detect small regional ozone         changes over long periods of time, provide global maps of ozone amounts         and examine local ozone distributions.
Ozone Depletion
Antarctica
Ozone depletion occurs in many places in the Earth's ozone         layer, most severely in the polar regions. NOAA scientists have traveled         to Antarctica to study the ozone         hole that         has been occurring there since the late 1970s. In 1986, soon after the         reported discovery of the ozone hole, Aeronomy Lab (now ESRL) scientist         Dr. Susan Solomon led a team of 16 scientists, the National         Ozone Expedition (NOZE I), to         Antarctica. The scientists took measurements of various trace gases and         physical properties of the atmosphere. The data, along with additional         findings from the NOZE II mission the following year, showed conclusively         that human-produced trace gases that contain chlorine and bromine were         causing the ozone hole. The Global Monitoring Division of ESRL has monitored         the yearly Antarctic ozone hole since 1986 by launching balloon-borne ozonesondes ,         from the South Pole station and measuring total column ozone from a ground         based Dobson spectrophotometer since         1963.
This unique record from the South Pole station clearly         shows the annual development of the springtime Antarctic ozone hole over         the past two decades. Ozone depletion at the South Pole can also be viewed         from another perspective through the images created from data collected         by the NASA TOMS satellite ,         and the NOAA         SBUV-2 instruments         aboard NOAA satellites. These various ozone measurements provide an important         record of the status of the ozone hole. Continued surveillance is necessary         in order to verify the expected recovery of the ozone layer.
Arctic Ozone
Significant depletion also occurs in the Arctic           ozone layer during         the late winter and spring period (January - April). However, the maximum         depletion is generally less severe than that observed in the Antarctic,         with no large and recurrent ozone hole taking place in the Arctic.
Since the 1980's, scientists at ESRL           have been participants in field, theoretical, and laboratory research           to demonstrate some of the key processes that contribute to the observed           difference between the depletion of ozone in the Arctic and Antarctic.           For example, the POLARIS           mission in         1997, was designed to study ozone photochemistry in the Arctic during         the summertime at middle and high latitudes. And later, the SAGE         III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) campaign         was designed to examine the processes controlling ozone levels at mid-         to high latitudes in the Arctic during the winter. The mission also acquired         correlative data needed to validate the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas         Experiment (SAGE) III satellite measurements that are used to quantify         high-latitude ozone loss. Both these experiments took measurements using         the NASA DC-8 and ER-2 aircraft, as well as balloon platforms and ground-based         instruments
Atmospheric Models
Another NOAA lab involved in studying stratospheric ozone         depletion is the Geophysical Fluid         Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in         Princeton, N.J. GFDL seeks to understand and predict the Earth's climate         and weather, including the impact of human activities. Specifically,         GFDL conducts leading-edge research (i.e., atmospheric chemistry modeling)         on many topics of great practical value, including stratospheric         ozone depletion. For         example, the GFDL group developed a 3-D atmospheric model tailored to         study the interaction of chemistry, dynamics, and radiation in the stratosphere.         Their extensive calculations were necessary for evaluating the simpler         models used in the policy assessment studies, as well as for understanding         the climatic impact of the Antarctic ozone hole.
Ozone-Depleting Substances
Certain industrial processes and consumer products           result in the atmospheric emission of ozone-depleting gases. These           gases contain chlorine and bromine atoms, which are known to be harmful           to the ozone layer. Important examples are the CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons           (HCFCs) ,         human-produced gases once used in almost all refrigeration and air conditioning         systems. These gases eventually reach the stratosphere, where they are         broken apart to release ozone-depleting chlorine atoms. Other examples         are the halons,which are used in fire         extinguishers and which contain ozone-depleting bromine atoms.
Methyl           bromide, is         another important area of research for NOAA scientists. Primarily used         as an agricultural fumigant, it is also a significant source of bromine         to the atmosphere. Although some ozone-depleting gases also are emitted         from natural sources, emissions from human activities exceed those from         natural sources.
NOAA researchers regularly measure           ozone depleting gases in the lower and upper atmosphere and attempt to account for observed         changes. As a result of international regulations, ozone-depleting gases         are being replaced in human activities with "ozone-friendly" gases         that have much reduced potential to deplete ozone. NOAA researchers are         also measuring         these "substitute" gases as         they accumulate in the atmosphere. Observing changes in both old and         new gases emitted into the atmosphere allows researchers to improve our         understanding of the fate of these gases after release and thereby improve         our ability to predict future ozone changes.
Winter Ozone Summaries
The full range of ground-based and satellite-based           observations from several NOAA offices are collected together and used           to describe the past Arctic or Antarctic winter in the Climate Prediction         Center's Winter Ozone Summaries. The contributors include the National           Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) , NOAA         Research and         the National Environmental Satellite,         Data, Information Services (NESDIS). By monitoring and researching stratospheric ozone, as well as the chemical   compounds and atmospheric conditions that affect its concentration, NOAA has   contributed vital information toward protecting the Earth's stratospheric ozone   layer. Perhaps most notable is NOAA's instrumental role in providing ozone   data and analysis for the United   Nations Environmental Programme and World   Meteorological Organization .
Communicating Information on Ozone depletion
The world's population is a stakeholder in decisions that         limit the emissions of ozone-depleting gases. In 1987, the international         community put in place a treaty known as the Montreal         Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
.         Since that initial treaty was ratified, periodic assessments and updates         have been conducted. The Protocol success has derived in part from these         scientific updates on the science and observation of ozone depletion         made over the past 15+ years. NOAA researchers from several laboratories         have participated in all of these scientific updates and have also been         active in preparing outreach documents to communicate the science         of ozone depletion to the public.

Figure 2: Altitude distribution             of ozone in the atmosphere. The blue curve indicates a typical             altitude profile of ozone showing no depletion. The high abundance             of ozone near 15 km marks the center of the normal ozone layer.             The red curve was obtained over South Pole, Antarctica, in winter.             The ozone layer has been severely depleted at this location as             indicated by the near zero values between 14 and 20 km. Similar             depletion occurs over the entire Antarctic region in late winter/early             spring, causing the Antarctic ";ozone hole" in satellite             observations of Antarctic ozone.
