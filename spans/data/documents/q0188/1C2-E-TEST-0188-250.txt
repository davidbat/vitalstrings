January:          Cold, rainy and windy. There is a one-week period during January when          the weather is generally good and the winds cease. This period is called          the Halcyon Days.
February: Slightly warmer and sunnier than January. The almond          trees bloom in February, the first trees to bloom. The weather is unpredictable and cold days alternate with warm ones.
March: Usually cold and windy but there are many sunny days too.          In March 2001 there was a heat wave with temperatures as high as 30 °C          but that was an exception. The first daring swimmers appear.
April: Spring time in Crete with medium temperatures and low rainfall.          Crete is full of wildflowers and it is magnificent.
May: The weather in Crete becomes warm and sunny. Rain is unlikely         to occur past May 10. The "meltemi" seasonal North winds have not yet started to blow,         the sea is  calm and nature is at its best. May is considered the best         month for outdoors  activities. A jacket will prove useful for the night.
June: Sunny and hot. Time for the beach!
July and August: Windy and very hot. July and August are          the months that the seasonal North winds blow. It is hard to do anything          else during these months, than spend the entire day at the beach. Look          for a shady place and drink plenty of water. Do not forget your hat         and  sunscreen. Not the best weather for people who cannot stand high         temperatures (30-35 C).
September: Sunny, less windy and slightly cooler. Good for outdoors          activities. Get a light jacket for the night, especially if you plan to          visit any mountainous areas.
October: Sunny, very few windy days but some rain will fall,         especially  in the west part of Crete. The weather is very good for         outdoor activities. October is the month that the traditional drink         of Crete, raki,         is distilled from  grape skins. Warm clothes are rarely necessary.
November: The weather becomes unpredictable. It may be sunny         but  there are plenty of rainy and windy days too. Pack a sweater and         don't  forget your umbrella. The south winds start and sometimes they         carry sand from the Sahara desert. This sand covers the sky of         Crete and it creates very unusual weather         conditions .
December: The weather conditions vary from year         to year with a mixture of windy, calm, rainy, sunny, cold and warm days.         Pack warm clothes together with your swimming suit. There are days when         the temperature along the south coast makes swimming possible and pleasurable.
