The most familiar climate mechanism or oscillation is the changing                seasons, which vary more or less regularly every year from warm                summer to cool winter. The next most familiar climate oscillation                is probably El Niño, whose intensity is indexed by the Southern                Oscillation Index (SOI), which is the difference in air pressure                between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. This index is easy to measure                accurately, we have historical records of it, and it is an indicator                of the starting time and strength of an El Niño, which occurs                irregularly every two to seven years.
Several important climate mechanisms contribute to events occurring                at high latitudes and have impacts throughout the globe. These mechanisms                have longer time scales than the seasons or the El Niño-Southern                Oscillation, which means that they do not occur as frequently (every                ten to thirty years). Examples are the Pacific Decadal Oscillation                and the Arctic Oscillation, whose consequences include phenomena                such as increases or decreases in the severity of winter weather,                frequency or severity of winter storms, volume of river runoff,                and stocks of various important fishes.
What are the time scales associated with climate mechanisms                and modes?
The different modes or mechanisms of the climate system act on                different time scales. Some of these mechanisms occur on short time                scales, such as the changing of the seasons, which occurs regularly                every year, or the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which occurs                irregularly every two to seven years. Others, such as the Arctic                Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, are important on                time scales of ten to forty years. Variations of thousands of years                are associated with orbital cycles of the planet, which appear to                be related to past ice ages. The different frequencies of these                variations harmonize, in a manner of speaking, to bring about the                symphony that is our climate.
It can be difficult to determine exactly when a climate cycle is                changing. For example, although everyone is familiar with seasonal                variations (spring warming, the hot days of summer, the cooling                in autumn and the colder weather in winter), it is difficult to                say exactly which day a season begins. Although we have designated                June 21, the solstice, as the first day of summer, the warming typical                of summer occurs slowly, over some period of time, and warm summer-like                days may occur as early as April, or as late as July. It is not                so easy to say that summer weather has started on any specific day,                or exactly how many days any given summer lasted. This holds true                for other climate cycles as well.
Many factors affect the conditions we experience every day. As                we have seen, these include the familiar day-to-day weather and                the changing seasons, but they also include mechanisms with longer                time scales, such as El Niño, and the longer time-scale climate                mechanisms have been identified as indices and associated with Arctic                climate change.
What are climate indices?
Scientists use climate indices in their attempt to characterize                and understand the various climate mechanisms that culminate in                our daily weather. Much in the way the Dow Jones Industrial Average,                which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies, is used to represent                the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole, climate indices                are used to represent the essential elements of climate. Climate                indices are generally identified or devised with the twin objectives                of simplicity and completeness, and each typically represents the                status and timing of the climate factor they represent. By their                very nature, indices are simple, and combine many details into an                generalized, overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which                can be used to characterize the factors which impact the global                climate system. Because the climate indices are generally determined                from measurements made in a localized area, they can have impacts                in other areas around the globe, through processes sometimes called                teleconnections.
What are some Arctic Climate Indices?
A variety of separate modes seem to be responsible for fluctuations                in the Arctic climate. These modes, as summarized through their                individual indices, generally vary on decadal time scales. This                presents a problem, because it means that we have not experienced                enough cycles during the period of reliable observations, which                goes back roughly 50 to 100 years, to fully understand their causes                and effects. Nevertheless, we have accumulated enough evidence to                indicate that variations in these modes are accompanied by systematic                changes in the weather, with wide-ranging ramifications. The most                important of the Arctic modes, at least as identified to date, are                summarized below.
The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North                Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)

The Arctic Oscillation (AO) appears to be the cause for much of                the recent changes that have occurred in the Arctic. Its effects                are not restricted just to the Arctic; it also represents an important                source of variability for the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. The                AO has been described as "a                seesaw pattern in which atmospheric pressure at polar and middle                latitudes fluctuates between positive and negative phases. The negative                phase brings higher-than-normal pressure over the polar region and                lower-than-normal pressure at about 45 degrees north latitude. The                positive phase brings the opposite conditions, steering ocean storms                farther north and bringing wetter weather to Alaska, Scotland and                Scandinavia and drier conditions to areas such as California, Spain                and the Middle East."(University of Washington)
The AO appears related to a well-known mode of variability for                the North Atlantic called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).                The NAO has been recognized for decades and has been considered                " the dominant mode of                winter climate variability in the North Atlantic region ranging                from central North America to Europe and much into Northern Asia.                The NAO is a large scale see-saw in atmospheric mass between the                subtropical high and the polar low. The corresponding index varies                from year to year, but also exhibits a tendency to remain in one                phase for intervals lasting several years. " The positive phase                of the NAO is associated with more frequent and intense storms in                the North Atlantic Ocean, warmer and wetter winters in Europe, and                cooler, drier winters in Greenland and northern Canada.
Some controversy exists concerning the relationship between                the AO and the NAO , namely whether they represent fundamentally                the same mode, or whether the distinctions between them are meaningful.                At any rate, a systematically positive sense to both indices since                the end of the 1980s has coincided with relatively warm conditions                in the Arctic and net melting of the Arctic ice pack.
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and                the North Pacific Index (NPI)

The Pacific side of the Arctic is also significantly influenced                by an inter-related pair of modes, the Pacific                Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North                Pacific Index (NPI) . The PDO is based on the pattern of SST in the North Pacific while the NPI is based on sea level pressure. The positive phase of the PDO is                associated with warm ocean temperature along western North America                and with generally prosperous fisheries in Alaska and poor fisheries                along the west coast of the continental US, especially with regards                to salmon. The North Pacific Index provides a measure of the intensity                of the mean wintertime Aleutian Low pressure cell. An alternative                measure of the latter is provided by the Aleutian                Low Pressure Index (ALPI) .
The PDO is strongly correlated to the NPI/ALPI through air-sea                interactions in the North Pacific. The effects of abnormal atmospheric                conditions over the North Pacific affect both the currents and temperature                of the ocean, which in turn, may feedback on the atmosphere. The                ultimate result of variations in these modes is tangible effects                on wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea, Alaska and western Canada.                A notable shift in these modes occurred in the late 1970s, bringing                about a rapid change from relatively cold winters in western North                America in the early 1970s to relatively warm, benign winters in                the late 1970s and 1980s. There is evidence, based on sea surface                temperature, that the PDO changed to a negative or neutral phase                in the late 1990s, bringing colder coastal waters once again to                the U.S. North Pacific coast.
Summary
Climate mechanisms in the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic are                very active research topics, and our understanding of their causes                and effects is far from complete. The importance of this wide-ranging                research activity is very well stated by Dr. Nate Mantua, a researcher                at the University of Washington, as he speaks about the PDO: " Even                in the absence of a theoretical understanding, PDO climate information                improves season-to-season and year-to-year climate forecasts for                North America because of its strong tendency for multi-season and                multi-year persistence. From a societal impacts perspective, recognition                of PDO is important because it shows that 'normal' climate conditions                can vary over time periods comparable to the length of a human's                lifetime.
