DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEATHER AND CLIMATE
METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY
Weather is the conditions that occurred very recently or are currently happening. The current  temperature, dewpoint, relative humidity , cloud cover and precipitation are examples of weather.
Climate describes the typical weather a location will have. For a good climate data set, at least  30 years of data for a location is needed. Climate also includes what type of  weather extremes that can be expected for a location. Normal high and low temperature, typical  monthly rainfall, most accumulation of snow in a year and record lowest temperature recorded for each  month are examples of climate.
