Arrhenius , Svante
Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming . He proposed a relation between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature. He found that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15oC because of the infrared absorption capacity of water vapor and carbon dioxide . This is called the natural greenhouse effect . Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the CO2 concentration would lead to a 5oC temperature rise.
Atmosphere
A blanket of 560 m of air surrounding the earth that supports life. The atmosphere absorbs energy from the sun, recycles water and other chemicals and works with electrical and magnetic forces to provide a moderate climate . It also protects us from high-energy radiation and the frigid vacuum of space.
The atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and argon (1%). Other components include water (0-7%), ozone (0-0,01%) and carbon dioxide (0,01-0,1%).
The atmosphere changes from the ground up and consists of four distinct layers: troposphere (8-14,5 km), stratosphere (14,5-50 km), mesosphere (50-85 km) and thermosphere (85-600 km). Temperatures are different for each layer. In the troposphere temperatures drop from about 17 to -52 degrees Celcius, in the stratosphere temperatures increase gradually to -3 degrees Celcius, in the mesosphere temperatures fall to -93 degrees Celcius as altitude increases, and in the thermosphere temperatures can be as high as 1727 degrees Celsius (figure 1).
Above the thermosphere, the exosphere starts and continues until it mixes with interplanetary gases or space. This layer primarily consists of low-density particles such as hydrogen and helium .
