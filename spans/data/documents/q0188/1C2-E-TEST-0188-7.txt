Weather reflects short-term conditions of the atmosphere while climate is the average daily weather for an extended period of time at a certain location
We hear about weather and climate all of the time. Most of  us check the local weather forecast to plan our days. And climate change is  certainly a “hot” topic in the news. There is, however, still a lot of  confusion over the difference between the two.
Think about it this way: Climate is what you expect, weather  is what you get.
Weather is what you see outside on any particular day. So,  for example, it may be 75 degrees and sunny or it could be 20 degrees with  heavy snow. That’s the weather.
Climate is the average of that weather. For example, you can  expect snow in the Northeast in January or for it to be hot and humid in the  Southeast in July. This is climate. The climate record also includes extreme  values such as record high temperatures or record amounts of rainfall. If  you’ve ever heard your local weather person say “today we hit a record high for  this day,” she is talking about climate records.
So when we are talking about climate change, we are talking  about changes in long-term averages  of daily weather. In most places, weather can change from minute-to-minute,  hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate, however, is the  average of weather over time and space.
