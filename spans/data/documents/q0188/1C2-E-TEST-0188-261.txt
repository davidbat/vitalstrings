They               could not decide on a cause for the shorter-term irregularities. Solar               fluctuations were only one of half a dozen plausible possibilities. (30) The early 1970s also brought claims               that far slower variations in the Earth's magnetic field correlated               with climate. In cores of clay drawn from the seabed reaching back               a million years, colder temperatures had prevailed during eras of               high magnetism. The magnetic variations were presumably caused by               processes in the Earth's interior rather than on the Sun, but the               correlation suggested that cosmic rays really did influence climate.               As usual the evidence was sketchy, however, and it failed to convince               most scientists. (31)
 
In 1975 the respected meteorologist Robert Dickinson, of the National               Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, took               on the task of reviewing the American Meteorological Society's official               statement about solar influences on weather. He concluded that such               influences were unlikely, for there was no reasonable mechanism in sight  except, maybe, one. Perhaps the electric charges that               cosmic rays generated in the atmosphere somehow affected how dust and other aerosol               particles coalesced. Perhaps that somehow affected cloudiness, since               cloud droplets condensed on the nuclei formed by aerosol particles.               This was just piling speculation on speculation, Dickinson hastened               to point out. Scientists knew little about such processes, and would               need to do much more research "to be able to verify or (as seems more               likely) to disprove these ideas." For all his frank skepticism, Dickinson               had left the door open a crack. One way or another, it was now at               least physically conceivable that changes in sunspots could have               something to do with changes in climate. Most experts, however, continued               to believe the idea was not only unproven but preposterous. Interest might be piqued when someone reported a new correlation between solar changes and weather, but nobody was surprised when further data and analysis knocked it down. (32*)
 
In 1976, Eddy tied all                 the threads together in a paper that soon became famous. He was                 one of several solar experts in Boulder, where a vigorous community                 of astrophysicists, meteorologists, and other Earth scientists had                 grown up around the University of Colorado and NCAR. Yet Eddy was                 ignorant of the carbon-14 research  an example of the poor                 communication between fields that always impeded climate studies.                 He had won scant success in the usual sort of solar physics research,                 and in 1973 he lost his job as a researcher, finding only temporary                 work writing a history of NASA's Skylab. In his spare time he pored                 over old books. Eddy had decided to review historical naked-eye                 sunspot records, with the aim of definitively confirming the long-standing                 belief that the sunspot cycle was stable over the centuries.

Instead, Eddy found evidence that the Sun was by no means as constant               as astrophysicists supposed. Especially intriguing was evidence suggesting               that during the "Little Ice Age" of the 16th-17th centuries, sky-watchers               had observed almost no sunspot activity. People clear back to Herschel               had noticed this prolonged dearth of sunspots. A 19th-century German               astronomer, G.W. Spörer, had been the first to  document               it, and a little later, in 1890, the British astronomer E. Walter               Maunder drew attention to the discovery and its significance for climate.               Other scientists, however, thought this was just another case of dubious               numbers at the edge of detectability. Maunder's publications sank               into obscurity. It was only by chance that while Eddy was working               to prove the Sun was entirely stable, another solar specialist told               him about Maunder's work. (33*)
 
"As a solar astronomer I felt certain that it could never have happened,"               Eddy later recalled. But hard historical work gradually persuaded               him that the early modern solar observers were reliable  the               absence of sunspot evidence really was evidence of an absence. Digging               deeper, he found the inconstancy confirmed by historical sightings               of auroras and of the solar corona at eclipses (both of which reflected                activity on the Sun's surface). Once his attention was               drawn to the carbon-14 record, he saw that it too matched the pattern.               All the evidence pointed to long-sustained minimums and at least one               maximum of solar activity in the past two thousand years. It was "one               more defeat in our long and losing battle to keep the Sun perfect,               or, if not perfect, constant, and if inconstant, regular. Why we think               the Sun should be any of these when other stars are not," he continued,               "is more a question for social than for physical science." (34)
 
As it happened, the ground had already been               prepared by developments in astrophysics in the early 1970s. Physicists               had built a colossal particle detector expressly to observe the elusive               neutrinos emitted by the nuclear reactions that fueled the Sun. The               experiment failed to find anywhere near the flux of neutrinos that               theorists insisted should be reaching the Earth. Was it possible that               deep within the Sun, production of energy was going through a lull? Perhaps the output of stars like the Sun really could wander up and               down, maybe even enough to cause ice ages? The anomaly was eventually               traced to neutrino physics, not solar physics. Meanwhile, however,               it called into doubt the theoretical reasoning that said the Sun could               not be a variable star. (35)

Eddy's announcement of a solar-climate connection nevertheless               met the customary skepticism. He pushed his arguments vigorously,               stressing especially the Little Ice Age, which he memorably dubbed               the "Maunder Minimum" of sunspots. The name he chose emphasized that               he was not alone with his evidence. It is not unusual for a scientist               to make a "discovery" that others had already announced fruitlessly.               A scientific result cannot flourish in isolation, but needs support               from other evidence and ideas. Eddy had gone some distance beyond               his predecessors in historical investigation. More important, he could               connect the sunspot observations with the carbon-14 record and the               new doubts about solar stability. It also mattered that he worked               steadily and persuasively to convince other scientists that the thing               was true.
 
Pushing farther, Eddy drew attention to a spell of high carbon-14, and thus low solar               activity, during the 11th-12th centuries. Remarks in medieval manuscripts               showed that these centuries had been unusually warm in Europe. It               was far from proven that those were times of higher temperatures all               around the globe. However, scientists were (as usual) particularly               impressed by evidence from the North Atlantic region where most of               them lived and where the historical record was best known. Especially               notable was the mild weather that had encouraged medieval Vikings               to establish colonies in Greenland — colonies that endured for               centuries, only to perish from starvation in the Little Ice Age. Eddy               warned that in our own times, "when we have observed the Sun most               intensively, its behavior may have been unusually regular and benign." (36)
 
 
 
(Decades later, after painstaking studies developed much fuller series of data covering                the entire globe, these data showed a complex variety of periods                of warmth and periods of cold. The so-called "Medieval Warm                Period" when Iceland and Greenland were settled was a group                of regional variations, significant but not as universal and extreme                as the steep temperature rise felt around the world since the 1980s.                The "Little Ice Age" was much more definite, but it too had                many local variations, not everywhere as obvious as around the North Atlantic. As one pair of experts remarked in 2004, "If                the development of paleoclimatology had taken place in the tropical Pacific, Africa,... or Latin America, the paleoclimatic community                would almost certainly have adopted other terminology." Instead                of a Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period, scientists of the                1970s might have talked, for example, about great periods of drought.                Still, Eddy's central point would stand: regional climates were                more susceptible to perturbing influences, including small changes                on the Sun, than most scientists                had imagined.)
