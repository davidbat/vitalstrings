Global Warming is rather simplistic.  The IPCC uses Climate Change and notes changes other than temperature.  Some of the Anthropogenic forcings work to cool global temperatures, such as aerosols, but don’t have as much affect as the warming agents.  Climate Change is what is studied and measured, Global Warming is the net identified result.  I think for a Grad School paper, GW is far too limiting of a term.
I am shocked in fact that you would be taking this subject at the grad school level having not read any of the IPCC reports.

There are some differences between the two terms, but I see no reason why they shouldn’t be used interchangeably. Climate change refers to any change in the conditions that fall under the definition of climate, such as average temperature, wind, and humidity. While global warming specifically refers to an increase in the Earth’s mean temperature resulting from a shift in the planet’s energy budget.

When it stopped warming ten years ago they needed to maintain their pretext for new taxes and limits on production and consumption so they changed it to "climate change," pretending there is more variability in the weather than there used to be, and blaming that on us.  Now, they don’t have to predict anything correctly (good for them because they never could) – whatever happens they have a theory by which it’s both bad and our fault.
It took a while for them to learn this lesson, to understand that they couldn’t predict anything.   They should perhaps have gone right to climate change from global cooling.
