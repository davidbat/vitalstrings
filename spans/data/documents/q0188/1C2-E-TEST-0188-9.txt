It’s a sweltering midsummer day. “It must be global warming,” mutters         someone. But is it the Earth’s changing climate that has made the       day so warm? Or, is it just the weather that is so unbearable?
Weather is the mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere including         temperature, rainfall and humidity. Weather is not the same everywhere.         Perhaps it is hot, dry and sunny today where you live, but in other parts         of the world it is cloudy, raining or even snowing. Everyday, weather events         are recorded and predicted by meteorologists worldwide.
Climate in your place on the globe controls the weather where you live.         Climate is the average weather pattern in a place over many years. So,         the climate of Antarctica is quite different than the climate of a tropical         island. Hot summer days are quite typical of climates in many regions of         the world, even without the affects of global warming.
Climates are changing because our Earth is warming, according to the research         of scientists. Does this contribute to a warm summer day? It may, however         global climate change is actually much more complicated than that because         a change in the temperature can cause changes in other weather elements         such as clouds or precipitation.
