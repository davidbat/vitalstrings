2010 equals record for world’s warmest year
Geneva, 20 January 2011 (WMO) – The year 2010 ranked as the warmest year on record, together with 2005  and 1998, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Data  received by the WMO show no statistically significant difference between  global temperatures in 2010, 2005 and 1998.
In 2010, global average  temperature was 0.53°C (0.95°F) above the 1961-90 mean. This value is  0.01°C (0.02°F) above the nominal temperature in 2005, and 0.02°C  (0.05°F) above 1998. The difference between the three years is less than  the margin of uncertainty (± 0.09°C or ± 0.16°F) in comparing the data.
These statistics are based on data  sets maintained by the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Centre/Climatic  Research Unit (HadCRU), the U.S. National Climatic Data Center (NCDC),  and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Arctic sea-ice cover in December  2010 was the lowest on record, with an average monthly extent of 12  million square kilometres, 1.35 million square kilometres below the  1979-2000 average for December. This follows the third-lowest minimum  ice extent recorded in September.
“The 2010 data confirm the Earth’s  significant long-term warming trend,” said WMO Secretary-General Michel  Jarraud. “The ten warmest years on record have all occurred since  1998.”
Over the ten years from 2001 to  2010, global temperatures have averaged 0.46°C (0.83°F)   above the  1961-1990 average, and are the highest ever recorded for a 10-year  period since the beginning of instrumental climate records. Recent  warming has been especially strong in Africa, parts of Asia, and parts  of the Arctic, with many subregions registering temperatures 1.2 to  1.4°C (2.2 to 2.5°F) above the long-term average.
2010 was an exceptionally warm  year over much of Africa and southern and western Asia, and in Greenland  and Arctic Canada, with many parts of these regions having their  hottest years on record.
Over land few parts of the world  were significantly cooler than average in 2010, the most notable being  parts of northern Europe and central and eastern Australia.
December 2010 was exceptionally  warm in eastern Canada and Greenland. It was abnormally cold through  large parts of northern and western Europe, with monthly mean  temperatures as much as 10°C below normal at some locations in Norway  and Sweden. Many places in Scandinavia had their coldest December on  record.  December in Central England was the coldest since 1890. Heavy  snowfalls severely disrupted transport in many parts of Europe. It was  also colder than average in large parts of the Russian Federation and in  the eastern United States, where snow also severely disrupted  transport.
Recent significant weather and climate events
The year 2010 was characterized by  a high number of extreme weather events, including the heatwave in  Russia and the devastating monsoonal floods in Pakistan. These were  described in WMO’s provisional statement on the status of the global  climate issued December 2010 (http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/press_releases/pr_904_en.html)
There have been many major weather and climate events in late 2010 and early 2011. These include:
In early January floods affected more than 800 000 people in  Sri Lanka according to the UN Office for the Coordination of  Humanitarian Affairs. The Philippines were also severely affected by  floods and mudslides during January.
Flash floods in the mountain areas near the city of Rio de  Janeiro in Brazil in the second week of January resulted in more than  700 deaths, many of them in mudslides. This is one of the highest death  tolls due to a single natural disaster in Brazilian history.
Severe flooding occurred in eastern Australia in December and  the first half of January, associated with the continuing strong La Niña  event.  The most extensive damage was in the city of Brisbane, which  had its second-highest flood of the last 100 years after that of January  1974. In financial terms it is expected to be the most costly natural  disaster in Australia’s history. Previous strong La Niña events have  also been associated with severe and widespread flooding in eastern  Australia, notably in 1974 and 1955.
Notes to Editors:
Background to data used in this statement
The information for 2010 is based  on climate data from networks of land-based weather and climate  stations, ships and buoys, as well as satellites. The data are  continuously collected and disseminated by the National Meteorological  and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of the 189 Members of WMO and several  collaborating research institutions. The data continuously feed three  main depository global climate data and analysis centres, which develop  and maintain homogeneous global climate datasets based on peer-reviewed  methodologies. The WMO global temperature analysis is thus principally  based on three complementary datasets. One is the combined dataset  maintained by both the Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office and the  Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom.  Another dataset is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce,  and the third one is from the Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS)  operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The updated data complements the Provisional Statement on the  Status of the Global Climate 2010 published by WMO on 3 Dec. 2010 ( http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/press_releases/pr_904_en.html ).
The final Statement will be published in March 2011.
