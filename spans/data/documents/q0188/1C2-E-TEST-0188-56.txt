The world is unquestionably warming - the more difficult question to answer is whether human activity (chiefly the     burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas) is responsible.  Dozens of scientific studies have demonstrated     that the increase in globally averaged temperature since about 1950 cannot be explained as a natural cycle or the     result of changes in solar output or cosmic rays or volcanoes, but can be explained as a result of rising greenhouse     gases.  For detailed answers see
