Knowing about the climate can            help us in many ways, such as helping us plant crops at the right time,            designing comfortable houses to live in or planning for possible climate            change.
Climate & Weather: what's the difference?
There          is a variety of ways to explain the difference. Here are a few that may          shed some light:
Climate is what you expect; Weather is what you get.
Climate is about long-term records, trends and averages;
Weather is the day to day experience.
Climate is the sum or synthesis of all the weather recorded over            a long period of time. It tells us the average or most common conditions,            or extremes, or counts of events, or frequencies. Weather is            a description of conditions over a short period of time - a "snap            shot" of the atmosphere at a particular time.
If weather is the watch then climate is the calendar.
