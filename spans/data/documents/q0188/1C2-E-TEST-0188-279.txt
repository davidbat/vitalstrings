=> Climate cycles
Many meteorologists repudiated the whole enterprise, seeing nothing               but random fluctuations from the norm. There remained a good number               who believed that cycles were probably there, just at the edge of               what the data could prove. An indicator of middle-of-the-road opinion               was Helmut Landsberg's authoritative climatology textbook of 1941.               Among other cases, Landsberg described how "widespread attention"               had focused upon a cycle of around 33 years in the level of lakes               (which gave a good measure of average precipitation). Detected in               the 1890s, the cycle had been used to predict how much rain would               fall in the late 1920s  but the prediction had failed ignominiously.               Nevertheless, Landsberg thought there was a real effect at work, perhaps               an irregular rhythm that varied between 30 and 40 years long. "Scientific               skepticism is well warranted in the research on climate cycles," he               admitted. "Nevertheless some of them seem to have much more than chance               characteristics..." (3) Meanwhile the stock of weather observations increased rapidly               and calculation techniques improved, so that it became increasingly               possible to offer solid proof of whether or not a given cycle was               valid. The answers were usually negative.
 
By the middle of the 20th century, opinion               among meteorologists was divided about the same way as at the start               of the century. Some expected that a few cycles would eventually be               pinned down, while others believed that no cycles existed  the               variations of climate were purely random. Progress was stymied unless clues could be found in some new approach.
 
<=> Solar  variation
A big clue came in the 1950s, when a few scientists decided to  build actual physical models of climate. Perhaps if they studied how a fluid behaved in a rotating  pan, they would learn something general about the behavior of fluid systems like the rotating  planet's atmosphere. These "dishpan" studies turned out to be surprisingly effective in modeling  features of the atmosphere like weather fronts. What was most thought-provoking was the way  the circulation of a fluid in the laboratory could show different patterns even when the external  conditions remained the same. Stir the fluid in the rotating dishpan with a pencil, and you  couldn't predict which of two or three possible states the circulation would settle into. The choice  of pattern depended in some arbitrary, unpredictable way on the system's past history. (4)
 
<= Simple  models
Of course, random behavior could be no surprise to anyone who watched               the tumbling of fluids. When water flows through a channel, if the               speed gradually increases, at some point the smooth, steady flow gives               way to a turbulent flow with vortexes swirling unpredictably. In 1921,               Vilhelm Bjerknes had suggested that a similar instability might be               at the root of major daily disturbances of the atmosphere. Beyond               some critical point, the symmetric flow of wind would become unstable               and spin off storms. (5) In               1956, Edward Lorenz proposed an explanation along those lines for               the dishpan experiments. As the dishpan experiments were refined,               however, they seemed to point to something much more unfamiliar. (6)
 
A second essential clue came from another new field, digital computation.               As scientists applied computers to a variety of tasks, oddities kept               popping up. An important example came in 1953 when a group at Los               Alamos, led by the great physicist Enrico Fermi, used the pioneer               computer MANIAC to study how a complex mechanical system behaved.               They wrote equations that described a large number of "nonlinear"               oscillators (the mathematical equivalent of springs with flaws that               kept them from stretching smoothly), all coupled to one another. Physical               intuition insisted that the distribution of energy among the oscillators               in such a system should eventually settle down into a steady state,               as a shaken glass of water will gradually come to rest. That was indeed               what Fermi's group saw, after the computer had ground away at the               numbers for a while. Then one day, by accident, they left the computer               running long after the steady state had been reached. Fermi's group               was amazed to find that the system had only lingered for a while in               its steady state. Then it reassembled itself back into something resembling               the initial distribution of energy. Like the flow in the rotating               dishpan, the system had at least two states that it could flip between               for no obvious reason. Further computer experiments showed that the               system shifted unpredictably among several "quasi-states." (7) In retrospect, this was the first true computer experiment,               with an outcome that foreshadowed much that came later. The lesson,               scarcely recognized at the time, was that complex systems did not               necessarily settle down into a calm stable state, but could organize               themselves in surprising large-scale ways.
 
Fermi's group described these wholly unexpected results at a few meetings during the 1950s,  stirring curiosity among physicists and mathematicians. Meanwhile there were hints that such  behavior was not confined to abstract mathematical systems. For example, a pair of scientists  wrote a simple system of equations for the exchanges of carbon dioxide gas among the Earth's  atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere, and ran the equations through a computer. The computations  tended to run away into self-sustaining oscillations. In the real world that would mean climate  instability  or even fluctuations with no regularities at all. (8) Nothing specific came of these and other peculiar results. It is not  uncommon for scientists to turn up mildly anomalous calculations. They stick them away in the  back of their minds until someone can explain what, if anything, it all has to do with the real  world.
 
The more people worked with computers, the               more examples they found of oddly unstable results. Start two computations               with exactly the same initial conditions, and they must always come               to precisely the same conclusion. But make the slightest change in               the fifth decimal place of some initial number, and as the machine               cycled through thousands of arithmetic operations the difference might               grow and grow, in the end giving a seriously different result. Of               course people had long understood that a pencil balanced on its point               could fall left or right depending on the tiniest difference in initial               conditions, to say nothing of the quantum uncertainties. Scientists               had always supposed that this kind of situation only arose under radically               simplified circumstances, far from the stable balance of real-world               systems like global climate. It was not until the 1950s, when people               got digital machines that could do many series of huge computations,               that a few began to wonder whether their surprising sensitivity pointed               to some fundamental difficulty.
