(the reverse is true in the northern hemisphere)
Wind, generally speaking, moves across the isobars
How do you read wind direction without windsticks?  The  black arrows  show the wind direction. High and low pressure regions do not stay  in the same place. They move over the Earth's surface.
FRONTS
A front is the  leading edge of change . They are the  border zone between warm and cold air . There are two types of fronts:
Warm fronts  occur when warm air is pushed into a cold air mass. These are very rare in Australia. They result in drizzle and light rain over a few days.

A warm front
Cold fronts  are far more common in Australia and occur when  cold air is pushed into a warm air mass . This forces the warm air to rise causing a number of changes: (a)  Decrease in temperature : cold air replaces warm air. (b)  Change in wind direction  and sometimes speed. (c)  Build up of cumulonimbus or rain bearing clouds . (d)  Increase in humidity : corresponding to a build up of clouds. (e)  Probability of rain . Make up an acronym to remember these changes.
A cold front
 
Temperature and humidity:
are  related to  the  wind . Winds  pick up  the  characteristics  of  where they form  – sea or land – these are called source regions
Remember:
Winds off the land  are generally  hotter and drier .
Winds off the sea  tend to be  cooler and wetter  (greater moisture = greater humidity).
Humidity
Humidity  is the amount of  water vapour  in the  atmosphere
A high humidity means there is a lot of water vapour, and a low humidity means a little.
The humidity level varies with  temperature . The warmer air is, the more moisture the air can hold as vapour. The colder the air is, the less moisture the air can hold.
Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (i.e. 100 percent humidity).
Types of rainfall: Convection http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkgThul2El8
Types of rainfall: Orographic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVykQfRC_aI http://www.radioblogclub.com/open/51998/elevation_u2/U2_-_Elevation
Orographic Rainfall The dry air mass becomes warmer, with little chance of rain. Deserts are often found on the leeward side of large mountain ranges Warm moist air approaches a mountain barrier The air mass is forced to rise as it hits the mountain and  condenses  into clouds Orographic rainfall occurs on the  windward   side of the mountains The air mass, now drier, flows down the  leeward  side of the mountains

Seasons
are determined by the location of various pressure systems.
Remember: 
Summer  = Lows over Northern Australia and Highs over Southern Australia.
Winter  = Highs over Northern Australia and Lows over Southern Australia.

Clear skies allow the sun’s rays to have maximum effect. Daytime temperatures are usually high.   At night, clear skies allow heat to be lost causing temperatures to fall. In winter frosts are likely.
Why Do Climates Vary?
Factors Affecting The Climate What makes a certain place hot, cold, wet, dry, windy…?
Your Ideas
On the A4 paper provided  and working in pairs:
Quickly sketch as many ideas as you can as what might cause  temperature  and  rainfall  to be different at various places.
You have 3 minutes
World Pattern of Climate The climate of a particular place on the earth’s surface depends on 5 main factors.  Latitude: Affects temperature radiation from the sun is stronger and more direct at the equator. Places at the equator are therefore generally hotter than the places near the poles. Also seasonal differences are more obvious away from the equator. Now copy fig 5.3e from p109 in your text
Latitude http://people.cas.sc.edu/carbone/modules/mods4car/ccontrol/controls/latitude.html
The sun’s rays are concentrated at the equator but spread out at the poles.
Differential Heating. At the Poles the sun’s rays covered a larger surface area, therefore heating is less efficient. At the Equator, the sun’s rays covered a smaller surface area, therefore heating is more efficient. At the Equator the sun’s rays also have to travel through less of the Earth’s atmosphere, therefore more heat energy reaches earth.
 
Altitude (elevation):
The air is generally thinner and therefore colder higher up in the mountains than it is at sea level. Also precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) is generally affected by mountain ranges as moist air will be forced to rise over the mountains (orographic rainfall). This will cause the air to cool and then condense into cloud.

Why are the temperatures different? Relief Everest. The higher the relief (elevation), the lower the temperature, about 6degrees C for each 1000 metres.
Distance from the sea:
The ocean acts as a stabilising influence on temperatures as the sea heats and cools more slowly than the land. Thus diurnal (daily) and annual (yearly) ranges of temperature are smaller near the coast and greater in inland areas. This means that inland areas generally have hotter summers and colder winters than coastal areas. Also moist air near the coast may result in more rainfall in coastal areas than places inland.
Distance from the Sea
In the summer, the sun heats the land quickly but it takes longer to heat up the water which is large and deep.
http://people.cas.sc.edu/carbone/modules/mods4car/ccontrol/controls/landwater1.html
However, the water stores heat for longer and so in winter, the temperature of the sea is warmer relative to the land and so keeps coastal places warmer.
Ocean Currents:
Cold ocean currents cool the air and generally cause dry conditions along the coastline. Warm ocean currents will warm the air and cause warmer, wetter conditions.
http://people.cas.sc.edu/carbone/modules/mods4car/ccontrol/controls/ocean.html
 
Gulf Stream Then there are air masses... Also known as the  North Atlantic Drift . A current of  warm water  that travels from the  Gulf of Mexico . This, along with the prevailing  South-Westerly wind , enables a relatively  warmer climate  compared to areas on the  same latitude .
Prevailing Winds
These are the winds that blow most often.
Winds can affect temperature and precipitation.
Winds blowing over tropical oceans bring warm and wet weather.
Winds blowing from the poles and over land bring cold and dry weather.
Length of day & Night
Because the earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, there are seasonal differences in the number of daylight hours. The shorter the day the less opportunity there is for the earth to absorb heat.
 
Continentality Sea heats up slowly and cools slowly. Land heats up quickly and cools quickly.
The Seasons
Seasons are created by the combination of the earths tilt and its orbit around the sun.
The distance between the earth and sun is about 149 million kms. The earth rotates around the sun in an elliptical, or oval shaped path and takes about 365 days or 1 year to complete an orbit.
The earth also rotates in an anti-clockwise direction about its north-south axis, an imaginary line that runs between the poles. It takes 24 hours for the earth to spin around once, and this rotation creates day and night. When one half of the world is in darkness, the other is in daylight.
The earth is also tilted about 23.5 degrees on its axis. So, depending on the time of year, certain latitudes of the earth incline toward the sun more than others. Throughout the year different areas, particularly those that are far from the equator, receive more or less solar radiation. If the earth did not tilt, we would not have seasons.
During summer in the Northern Hemisphere the longest day (the summer solstice) occurs when the sun is directly over the tropic of Cancer. As the earth continues its year long orbit the North Pole tilts away from the sun, and the South Pole tilts towards the sun.
The equinox is when the sun is directly over the equator. The Northern Hemisphere winter solstice (the shortest day) occurs when the sun is over the Tropic of Capricorn.
