Subject - What is The Difference between organizational Culture and climate ?
My perception in brief is culture is a process and climate is a outcome of culture, and climate is a feel such as friendly environment or stress environment. Even After a tough discussion between with my faculties and friends i am not clear with it, every one give new points which is not even similar with one another !.. I am highly confused and few books says that both culture and climate are same, can any one help me out of this..?

Dear Meyappan
If you had only searched CiteHr before discussing with your faculty and friends you would have been much wiser. Even now I suggest that you do, by using the "Search Forum"facility when you are on "Today's Posts" page. Leolingham2000 had given a detailed reply as long ago as 2005.
Have a nice day.

I could have given a link to the website; however, some would consider that as spoon-feeding.

ORGANIZATION CLIMATE AND CULTURE
The Climate of your Organization is the State of its Health
How your employees feel about their jobs, their supervisors, their peers, top management, and many other factors affects their individual productivity, and collectively the ability of the organization to achieve its objectives.
Without a formal process, finding out about employee attitudes usually relies on the manager's instincts or the employee's own willingness to communicate upward. But managerial instinct rarely provides the kind of hard data needed for decision - making. And most employees are hesitant to communicate anything but positive information to their supervisors.
The formal process generally involves using a climate survey or questionnaire.
Organizational climate measures attempts to assess organizations in terms of dimensions that are thought to capture or describe perceptions about the climate.
1. Structure - feelings about constraints and freedom to act and the degree of formality or informality in the working atmosphere.
2. Responsibility - the feeling of being trusted to carry out important work.
3. Risk - the sense of riskiness and challenge in the job and in the organization; the relative emphasis on taking calculated risks or playing it safe.
4. Warmth - the existence of friendly and informal social groups.
5. Support - the perceived helpfulness of managers and co-workers; the emphasis (or lack of emphasis) on mutual support.
6. Standards - the perceived importance of implicit and explicit goals and performance standards; the emphasis on doing a good job; the challenge represented in personal and team goals.
7. Conflict - the feeling that managers and other workers want to hear different opinions; the emphasis on getting problems out into the open rather than smoothing them over or ignoring them.
8. Identity - the feeling that you belong to a company; that you are a valuable member of a working team.
9.autonomy - the perception of self-determination with respect to work procedures, goals and priorities;
10.cohesion - the perception of togetherness or sharing within the organization setting, including the willingness of members to provide material risk;
11.trust - the perception of freedom to communicate openly with members at higher organizational levels about sensitive or personal issues, with the expectation that the integrity of such communications will not be violated;
12.resource - the perception of time demands with respect to task competition and performance standards;
13.support - the perception of the degree to which superiors tolerate members' behaviour, including willingness to let members learn from their mistakes without fear of reprisal;
14. recognition - the perception that members' contributions to the organization are acknowledged;
15.fairness - the perception that organizational policies are non-arbitrary or capricious;
16.innovation - the perception that change and creativity are encouraged, including
risk-taking into new areas where the member has little or no prior experience.
==================================================  =====================
The organizational climate consists of:-
 Organisational Structure-
An organization’s structure is actually a ‘snapshot’ of a work process, frozen in time so that it can be viewed. The structure enables the people’s energy to be focused towards process achievement and goal achievement. Employee must have a clear definition of not only the work structure but also the role used to organize the work. If the structure and the role is not clear, people will not know what the work process is, who is responsible for what, whom to go for help and decision, and who can Assist in solving problems that may arise.
 Organisational Culture-
Organisational culture is the pattern of beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and customs that exists within an organisation. Organizational culture may result in part from senior management beliefs or from the beliefs of employees.
Organizational culture can be supportive or unsupportive, positive or negative. It can affect the ability or willingness of employees to adapt or perform well within the organisation.
The most effective work culture is one that supports the organizations HR strategies by aligning behaviors, processes and methods with the desired results. It is not just achieving results but the methods through which they are achieved that are critical to long-term success.
Before any HR strategy is designed there must be a clear understanding of the organisation, its current values, its structure, its people as well as its goals and vision for the future.
==================================================  =========
Organization culture can be a set of key values , assumptions,
understandings and norms that is shared by members of an
organization.
Organization values are fundamental beliefs that an organization
considers to be important , that are relatively stable over time,
and they have an impact on employees behaviors and attitudes.
Organization Norms are shared standards that define what
behaviors are acceptable and desirable within organization.
Shared assumptions are about how things are done
in an organization.
Understandings are coping with internal / external problems
uniformly.
