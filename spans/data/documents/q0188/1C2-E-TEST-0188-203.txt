"Even  with all the technology used by the National Weather Service to  prepare severe weather warnings, storm spotters still give us the  most complete picture of what's really happening in and around  severe storms. Radar simply cannot tell us everything we need to  know. Storm spotters are the eyes and ears in the field.
For more than 60 years, storm  spotters have been the Nation’s first line of defense against  deadly storms. Working with their local communities and with the  local National Weather Service office, spotters provide  invaluable assistance and critical information to decision makers  when hazardous weather threatens. Countless lives have been saved  because of this unique partnership between volunteer storm  spotters, emergency management and the National Weather Service." "This guide is intended to introduce you to the world of storm  spotting. It is NOT intended to replace the official training  that is offered by National Weather Service meteorologists each  year. Viewing a website cannot substitute for attendance and  participation in a 2-3 hour training session, so if you are  interested in learning more and becoming a storm spotter, you  should contact your local emergency management agency or the  National Weather Service."

CREATIVE CLIMATES – CLASSROOM  ACTIVITY             NEW!
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/activities/08/climates.html
A classroom activity for  multiple grades on climate. "Snow in the  Sahara? Heat at the Poles? Cold tropics? Talk about disaster  areas! Until now, you may have thought that the biggest climatic  disaster was global warming. It's true, that's pretty hot stuff,  but things could get a whole lot worse if really wacky weather  began to occur. As the head of the Climate Observation Post,  you'll want to make sure you know all about the world's weather,  climate, and climate controls.
There are six climate zones in  the world: tropical, dry, mild, continental, polar, and high  elevation. Within each zone are further distinctions that  indicate a more specific type of climate.
Now that you're ready, create  your own illustrated climate map and match wits with the weather!  Using the climate map as a guide, print out a world map and  photographs of four of the world's climate zones. Use the  photographs to illustrate your climate map, and color in the  climate zones with shades that seem right to you. You might want  to use blue for polar regions, for instance, or red for desert  regions." Excellent

Fido jumps up from the hardwood floor and  races to the door in a panic. However, you are more interested in  watching the rest of the movie and finishing your snack without  burning the roof of your mouth.  You tell Fido, "stop  barking and lay back down!" Fido reluctantly obeys your command,  plops down on the floor, and slowly drifts to sleep. In the  movie, a storm is brewing. You put down your half eaten Hot  Pocket as you inch toward the edge of the couch watching more  intensely. The main characters grab their video cameras out of  their old pick up truck and race toward the center of the storm.  A crash of thunder booms outside your window. Fido awakens and  urgently runs to the door. Getting more annoyed, you scold Fido  again, but this time he disobeys your commands. He remains glued  to the door and barks without ceasing. You turn back to the movie  to see the characters retreat back to their car as the storm  creeps closer and closer. Suddenly, there is another boom near  your house and a streak of lightning illuminates the evening sky.  Fido relentlessly yelps in fear. The lights flicker on and off  around you. The TV suddenly goes out along with the rest of your  household power. You are left alone, in the dark, in a pure  sweat, with the remains of your Hot Pocket smeared across your  face. You can not call your parents because the phone lines are  down. The streets are beginning to flood due to the heavy rains.  This is the first time you have been home alone during a  thunderstorm. Fido will not stop barking. You can not see  anything and feel completely helpless. What should you do in this  situation?" Excellent
