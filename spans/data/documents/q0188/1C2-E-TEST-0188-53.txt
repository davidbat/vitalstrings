Interesting. I read climate research all day. I'm not familiar with those "facts." I am familiar with the memes spreading those sentences as scientific facts, however. I can show you satellite data of ice caps melting more and more every year. This year has been a catastrophe in arctic ice recession. Every scientist on the planet is completely blown away by it. "Deal with it" is notï»¿ science. You obviously believe in something that has blinded you to being open to the literature.
