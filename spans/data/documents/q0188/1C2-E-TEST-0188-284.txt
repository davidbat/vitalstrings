The current scientific consensus is that "most                of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have                been attributable to human activities".The main cause of the                human-induced component of warming is the increase in atmospheric                greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2), due to                activities such as burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and agriculture.                Greenhouse gases are gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect.                This effect was first described by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and was                first investigated quantitatively in 1896 by the Swedish chemist                Svante Arrhenius.
 
Climate sensitivity is a measure of the equilibrium                response to increased GHGs, and other anthropogenic and natural                climate forcings. It is found by observational and model studies.                This sensitivity is usually expressed in terms of the temperature                response expected from a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, which,                according to the 2001 IPCC report, is estimated to be between 1.5                and 4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) (with a statistical likelihood of 66-90%).                This should not be confused with the expected temperature change                by a given date, which also includes a dependence on the future                GHG emissions and a delayed response due to thermal lag, principally                from the oceans. Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel                on Climate Change (IPCC), using a range of SRES scenarios, project                that global temperatures will increase between 1.4 and 5.8 °C (2.5                to 10.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100.
 
An increase in global temperatures can in turn                cause other changes, including a rising sea level and changes in                the amount and pattern of precipitation. These changes may increase                the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods,                droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and tornados. Other consequences                include higher or lower agricultural yields, glacial retreat, reduced                summer stream flows, species extinctions and increases in the ranges                of disease vectors. Warming is expected to affect the number and                magnitude of these events; however, it is difficult to connect particular                events to global warming. Although most studies focus on the period                up to 2100, warming (and sea level rise due to thermal expansion)                is expected to continue past then, since CO2 has an estimated atmospheric                lifetime of 50 to 200 years. Only a small minority of climate scientists                disagree that humanity's actions have played a major role in recent                warming. However, the uncertainty is more significant regarding                how much climate change should be expected in the future, and there                is a hotly contested political and public debate over implementation                of policies that deal with predicted consequences, what, if anything,                should be done to reduce or reverse future warming, and how to deal                with the predicted consequences.
The term "global warming" is a specific case of the more                general term "climate change" (which can also refer to "global cooling," such as occurs during ice ages). In                principle, "global warming" is neutral as to the causes,                but in common usage, "global warming" generally implies                a human influence. However, the UNFCCC uses "climate change" for human-caused change, and "climate variability" for                other changes. Some organizations use the term "anthropogenic                climate change" for human-induced changes. Also, "global                warming" may refer to both the observed and the predicted warming.
Two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different                reconstructions, each smoothed on a decadal scale. The unsmoothed,                annual value for 2004 is also plotted for reference.Relative to                the period 1860–1900, global temperatures on both land and sea have                increased by 0.75 °C (1.4 °F), according to the instrumental temperature                record. Since 1979, land temperatures have increased about twice                as fast as ocean temperatures (0.25 °C/decade against 0.13 °C/decade                (Smith, 2005). Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased                between 0.12 and 0.22 °C per decade since 1979, according to satellite                temperature measurements. Over the one or two thousand years before                1850, world temperature is believed to have been relatively stable,                with possibly regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period                or the Little Ice Age.
 
Based on estimates by NASA's Goddard Institute                for Space Studies, 2005 was the warmest year since reliable, widespread                instrumental measurements became available in the late 1800s, exceeding                the previous record set in 1998 by a few hundredths of a degree                Celsius. Similar estimates prepared by the World Meteorological                Organization and the UK Climatic Research Unit concluded that 2005                was still only the second warmest year, behind 1998.
 
Depending on the time frame, a number of temperature                records are available. These are based on different data sets, with                different degrees of precision and reliability. An approximately                global instrumental temperature record begins in about 1860; contamination                from the urban heat island effect is believed to be small and well                controlled for. A longer-term perspective is available from various                proxy records for recent millennia; see temperature record of the                past 1000 years for a discussion of these records and their differences.                The attribution of recent climate change is clearest for the most                recent period of the last 50 years, for which the most detailed                data are available. Satellite temperature measurements of the tropospheric                temperature date from 1979.
 
Carbon dioxide during the last 400,000 years and                the rapid rise since the Industrial Revolution; changes in the Earth's                orbit around the Sun, known as Milankovitch cycles, are believed                to be the pacemaker of the 100,000 year ice age cycle.The climate                system varies both through natural, "internal" processes                as well as in response to variations in external "forcing" from both human and non-human causes, including solar activity,                volcanic emissions, and greenhouse gases. Climatologists agree that                the earth has warmed recently. The detailed causes of this change                remain an active field of research, but the scientific consensus                identifies greenhouse gases as the primary cause of the recent warming.                Outside of the scientific community, however, this conclusion can                be controversial.
 
Adding carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) to                Earth's atmosphere, with no other changes, will make the planet's                surface warmer; greenhouse gases create a natural greenhouse effect                without which temperatures on Earth would be an estimated 30 °C                (54 °F) lower, and the Earth uninhabitable. It is therefore not                correct to say that there is a debate between those who "believe                in" and "oppose" the theory that adding carbon dioxide                or methane to the Earth's atmosphere will, absent any mitigating                actions or effects, result in warmer surface temperatures on Earth.                Rather, the debate is about what the net effect of the addition                of carbon dioxide and methane will be, when allowing for compounding                or mitigating factors.
 
One example of an important feedback process is                ice-albedo feedback. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere warms the                Earth's surface and leads to melting of ice near the poles. As the                ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open                water are less reflective than ice, and so absorb more solar radiation.                This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and                the cycle continues.Due to the thermal inertia of the earth's oceans                and slow responses of other indirect effects, the Earth's current                climate is not in equilibrium with the forcing imposed by increased                greenhouse gases. Climate commitment studies indicate that, even                if greenhouse gases were stabilized at present day levels, a further                warming of perhaps 0.5 °C to 1.0 °C (0.9–1.8 °F) would still occur.
 
Greenhouse gases are transparent to shortwave                radiation from the sun, the main source of heat on the Earth. However,                they absorb some of the longer infrared radiation emitted by the                Earth, thereby reducing radiational cooling and hence raising the                temperature of the Earth. How much they warm the world by is shown                in their global warming potential.
 
The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide                and methane have increased by 31% and 149% respectively above pre-industrial                levels since 1750. This is considerably higher than at any time                during the last 650,000 years, the period for which reliable data                has been extracted from ice cores. From less direct geological evidence                it is believed that carbon dioxide values this high were last attained                40 million years ago. About three-quarters of the anthropogenic                (man-made) emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere during                the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning. The rest of the                anthropogenic emissions are predominantly due to land-use change,                especially deforestation.
 
The longest continuous instrumental measurement                of carbon dioxide mixing ratios began in 1958 at Mauna Loa. Since                then, the annually averaged value has increased monotonically by                approximately 21% from the initial reading of 315 ppmv, as shown                by the Keeling curve, to over 380 ppmv in 2006. The monthly CO2                measurements display small seasonal oscillations in an overall yearly                uptrend; each year's maximum is reached during the northern hemisphere's                late spring and declines during the northern hemisphere growing                season as plants remove some CO2 from the atmosphere.
 
Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas,                enters the atmosphere both from biological production and leaks                from natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure. Some biological                sources are natural, such as termites or forests, but others have                been increased or created by agricultural activities such as the                cultivation of rice paddies. Recent evidence indicates that methane                concentrations have begun to stabilize, perhaps due to reductions                in leakage from fuel transmission and storage facilities.
 
Future carbon dioxide levels are expected to continue                rising due to ongoing fossil fuel usage, though the actual trajectory                will depend on uncertain economic, sociological, technological,                and natural developments. The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios                gives a wide range of future carbon dioxide scenarios [19], ranging                from 541 to 970 parts per million by the year 2100. Fossil fuel                reserves are sufficient to reach this level and continue emissions                past 2100, if coal and tar sands are extensively used.
 
Anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases broken                down by sector for the year 2000.Globally, the majority of anthropogenic                greenhouse gas emissions arise from fuel combustion. The remainder                is accounted for largely by "fugitive fuel" (fuel consumed                in the production and transport of fuel), emissions from industrial                processes (excluding fuel combustion), and agriculture: these contributed                5.8%, 5.2% and 3.3% respectively in 1990. Current figures are broadly                comparable. Around 17% of emissions are accounted for by the combustion                of fuel for the generation of electricity. A small percentage of                emissions come from natural and anthropogenic biological sources,                with approximately 6.3% derived from agriculturally produced methane                and nitrous oxide.
 
Positive feedback effects, such as the expected                release of methane from the melting of permafrost peat bogs in Siberia                (possibly up to 70,000 million tonnes), may lead to significant                additional sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Note that the anthropogenic                emissions of other pollutants—notably sulfate aerosols—exert a cooling                effect; this partially accounts for the plateau/cooling seen in                the temperature record in the middle of the twentieth century, though                this may also be due to intervening natural cycles.
 
The extent of the scientific consensus on global                warming—that "most of the observed warming over the last 50                years is likely to have been attributable to human activities"—has                been investigated: In the journal Science in December 2004, Dr Naomi                Oreskes published a study of the abstracts of 928 refereed scientific                articles in the ISI citation database identified with the keywords "global climate change". This study concluded that 75%                of the 928 articles either explicitly or implicitly accepted the                consensus view — the remainder of the articles covered methods or                paleoclimate and did not take any stance on recent climate change.                The study did not report how many of the 928 abstracts explicitly                endorsed the hypothesis of human-induced warming, but none of the                928 articles surveyed explicitly endorsed an alternative hypothesis.
 
Contrasting with the consensus view, alternative                hypotheses have been proposed to explain all or part of the observed                increase in global temperatures. Some of these hypotheses (listed                here without comment on their validity or lack thereof) include:
 
The warming is within the range of natural variation.
The warming is a consequence of coming out of a prior cool period,                namely the Little Ice Age.
The warming is primarily a result of variances in solar irradiance,                possibly via modulation of cloud cover . It is similar in concept                to the operating principles of the Wilson cloud chamber, but on a global scale where earth's atmosphere acts as the cloud chamber                and the cosmic rays catalyze the production of cloud condensation                nuclei.
The observed warming actually reflects the Urban Heat Island, as                most readings are done in heavily populated areas which are expanding                with growing population.
 
The solar variation theory
Modeling studies reported in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR)                did not find that changes in solar forcing were needed in order                to explain the climate record for the last four or five decades].                These studies found that volcanic and solar forcings may account                for half of the temperature variations prior to 1950, but the net                effect of such natural forcings has been roughly neutral since then.                In particular, the change in climate forcing from greenhouse gases                since 1750 was estimated to be eight times larger than the change                in forcing due to increasing solar activity over the same period].
 
Since the TAR, some studies (Lean et al., 2002,                Wang et al., 2005) have suggested that changes in irradiance since                pre-industrial times are less by a factor of 3 to 4 than in the                reconstructions used in the TAR (e.g. Hoyt and Schatten, 1993, Lean,                2000.). Other researchers (e.g. Stott et al. 2003) believe that                the effect of solar forcing is being underestimated and propose                that solar forcing accounts for 16% or 36% of recent greenhouse                warming. Others (e.g. Marsh and Svensmark 2000) have proposed that                feedback from clouds or other processes enhance the direct effect                of solar variation, which if true would also suggest that the effect                of solar variability was being underestimated. In general the level                of scientific understanding of the contribution of variations in                solar irradiance to historical climate changes is "very low".
 
The present level of solar activity is historically                high. Solanki et al. (2004) suggest that solar activity for the                last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years;                Muscheler et al. disagree, suggesting that other comparably high                levels of activity have occurred several times in the last few thousand                years. Solanki concluded based on their analysis that there is a                92% probability that solar activity will decrease over the next                50 years. In addition, researchers at Duke University (2005) have                found that 10–30% of the warming over the last two decades may be                due to increased solar output. In a review of existing literature,                Foukal et al. (2006) determined both that the variations in solar                output were too small to have contributed appreciably to global                warming since the mid-1970s and that there was no evidence of a                net increase in brightness during this period.
 
Expected effects
The expected effects of global warming are many and various, both                for the environment and for human life. These effects include sea                level rise, repercussions to agriculture, reductions in the ozone                layer, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, and the spread of disease. In some cases, the effects may already                be manifest, although it is difficult to attribute specific incidents                of natural phenomena to long-term global warming. Since the mid-1970s,                the total annual power of hurricanes has increased markedly because                their average intensity and duration have increased; in addition,                there has been a high correlation of hurricane power with tropical                sea-surface temperature. In spite of such strong evidence, the relationship                between global warming and hurricanes is still being debated.] A                draft statement by the World Meteorological Organization acknowledges                the differing viewpoints on this issue.
 
The extent and probability of these consequences                is a matter of considerable uncertainty. A summary of probable effects                and recent understanding can be found in the report of the IPCC                Working Group II. Some scientists have concluded global warming                is already causing death and disease across the world through flooding,                environmental destruction, heat waves and other extreme weather                events.

Effects on ecosystems
Both primary and secondary effects of global warming — such as higher                temperatures, lessened snow cover, rising sea levels and weather                changes — may influence not only human activities, but also ecosystems.                Some species may be forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction)                because of changing conditions, while others may flourish. Similarly,                changes in timing of life patterns, such as annual migration dates,                may alter regional predator-prey balance. The effect of advanced                spring arrival dates in Scandinavia on birds that over winter in                sub-Saharan Africa has been ascribed to evolutionary adaptation                of the species to climatic warming.
 
Ocean pH is lowering as a result of increased                carbon dioxide levels. Lowering of ocean pH, along with changing                water temperature and ocean depth will have a damaging effect on                coral reefs.
 
Another suggested mechanism whereby a warming                trend may be amplified involves the thawing of tundra, which can                release significant amounts of the potent greenhouse gas, methane,                which is trapped in permafrost and ice clathrate compounds.
 
There are also ecological effects of melting polar                ice: for example, polar bears use sea ice to reach their prey and                they must swim to another ice floe when one breaks up. Ice is now                becoming further separated and dead polar bears have been found                in the water, believed to have drowned. More recently, some scientists                have suggested that the observed cannibalistic behavior in polar                bears may be the result of food shortages brought on by global warming                (Amstrup et al. 2006).

The increased downward                trend in the late 1980s is symptomatic of the increased rate and                number of retreating glaciers.Global warming has led to negative                glacier mass balance, causing glacier retreat around the world.                Oerlemans (2005) showed a net decline in 142 of the 144 mountain                glaciers with records from 1900 to 1980. Since 1980 global glacier                retreat has increased significantly. Similarly, Dyurgerov and Meier                (2005) averaged glacier data across large-scale regions (e.g. Europe)                and found that every region had a net decline from 1960 to 2002,                though a few local regions (e.g. Scandinavia) have shown increases.                Some glaciers that are in disequilibrium with present climate have                already disappeared and increasing temperatures are expected to                cause continued retreat in the majority of alpine glaciers around                the world. Upwards of 90% of glaciers reported to the World Glacier                Monitoring Service have retreated since 1995.
 
Of particular concern is the potential for failure                of the Hindu Kush and Himalayan glacial melts. The melt of these                glaciers is a large and reliable source of water for China, India,                and much of Asia, and these waters form a principal dry-season water                source. Increased melting would cause greater flow for several decades,                after which "some areas of the most populated region on Earth                are likely to 'run out of water'" (T. P. Barnett, J. C. Adam                and D. P. Lettenmaier 2005)
 
Miniature rock glaciers
Rock glaciers — caches of ice under boulders — are among other water                signs such as drying meadows and warming lakes that scientists are                studying in the Sierras in the western United States. Connie Millar                searches for the rock glaciers in the Yosemite area of the Sierra                crest. She hypothesizes that rock glaciers will be predictors of                how ecosystems change with rising temperatures. Millar is leading                an effort (the Consortium for Integrated Climate Research in Western                Mountains) to co-ordinate the work of many scientists to see how                the pieces of the Global Warming puzzle may fit.
 
Destabilization of ocean currents
There is also some speculation that global warming could, via a                shutdown or slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, trigger localized                cooling in the North Atlantic and lead to cooling, or lesser warming,                in that region. This would affect in particular areas like Scandinavia                and Britain that are warmed by the North Atlantic drift.
 
Sea level rise and environmental refugees
The termini of the glaciers in the Bhutan-Himalaya. Glacial lakes                have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers                in this region during the last few decades. According to USGS researchers,                glaciers in the Himalaya are wasting at alarming and accelerating                rates, as indicated by comparisons of satellite and historic data,                and as shown by the widespread, rapid growth of lakes on the glacier                surfaces. The researchers have found a strong correlation between                increasing temperatures and glacier retreat.Rising global temperatures                will melt glaciers and expand the water of the seas through the                mechanism of thermal expansion, leading to sea level rise. Even                a relatively small rise in sea level would make some densely settled                coastal plains uninhabitable and create a significant refugee problem.                If the sea level were to rise in excess of 4 meters (13 ft) almost                every coastal city in the world would be severely affected, with                the potential for major damage to world-wide trade and economy.                Presently, the IPCC predicts sea level rise is most probable to                be just short of half a metre, and at least between 9 and 88 cm                through 2100 - but they also warn that global warming during that                time may lead to irreversible changes in the Earth's glacial system                and ultimately melt enough ice to raise sea level many meters over                the next millennia. It is estimated that around 200 million people                could be affected by sea level rise, especially in Vietnam, Bangladesh,                China, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria and Egypt.
 
An example of the ambiguity of the concept of                environmental refugees is the emigration from the island nation                of Tuvalu, which has an average elevation of approximately one meter                above sea level. Tuvalu already has an ad hoc agreement with New                Zealand to allow phased relocation and many residents have been                leaving the islands. However, it is far from clear that rising sea                levels from global warming are a substantial factor - best estimates                are that sea level has been rising there at approximately 1–2 millimeters                per year (~1/16th in/yr), but that shorter timescale factors—ENSO,                or tides—have far larger temporary effects.
 
Spread of disease
One of the largest known outbreaks of Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis                has been attributed to generally rising ocean temperature where                infected oysters were harvested in Prince William Sound, Alaska                in 2005. Before this, the northernmost reported risk of such infection                was in British Columbia, 1000 km to the south (McLaughlin JB, et                al.).
 
Global warming may extend the range of vectors                conveying infectious diseases such as malaria. A warmer environment                boosts the reproduction rate of mosquitoes and the number of blood                meals they take, prolongs their breeding season, and shortens the                maturation period for the microbes they disperse]. Global warming                has been implicated in the recent spread to the north Mediterranean                region of bluetongue disease in domesticated ruminants associated                with mite bites (Purse, 2005). Hantavirus infection, Crimean-Congo                hemorrhagic fever, tularemia and rabies increased in wide areas                of Russia during 2004–2005. This was associated with a population                explosion of rodents and their predators but may be partially blamed                on breakdowns in governmental vaccination and rodent control programs.                Similarly, despite the disappearance of malaria in most temperate                regions, the indigenous mosquitoes that transmitted it were never                eliminated and remain common in some areas. Thus, although temperature                is important in the transmission dynamics of malaria, many other                factors are influential.
 
Financial effects
Financial institutions, including the world's two largest insurance                companies, Munich Re and Swiss Re, warned in a 2002 study (UNEP                summary) that "the increasing frequency of severe climatic                events, coupled with social trends" could cost almost US$150                billion each year in the next decade. These costs would, through                increased costs related to insurance and disaster relief, burden                customers, taxpayers, and industry alike.
 
According to the Association of British Insurers,                limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional                annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s. According to Choi                and Fisher (2003) each 1% increase in annual precipitation could                enlarge catastrophe loss by as much as 2.8%.
 
The United Nations' Environmental Program recently                announced that severe weather around the world has made 2005 the                most costly year on record. Although there is "no way to prove                that [a given hurricane] either was, or was not, affected by global                warming", global warming is thought to increase the probability                of hurricanes emerging. Preliminary estimates presented by the German                insurance foundation Munich Re put the economic losses at more than                US$200 billion, with insured losses running at more than US$70 billion.
 
Nicholas Stern in the Stern Review has warned                that one percent of global GDP is required to be invested in order                to mitigate the effects of climate change, and that failure to do                so could risk a recession worth up to twenty percent of global GDP.                Stern’s report suggests that climate change threatens to be the                greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen. The report                has had significant political effects: Australia reported two days                after the report was released that they would allott AU$60 million                to projects to help cut greenhouse gas emissions. Tony Blair said                the Stern Review showed that scientific evidence of global warming                was "overwhelming" and its consequences "disastrous".
 
Biomass production
The creation of biomass by plants is influenced by the availability                of water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide. Part of this biomass is                used (directly or indirectly) as the energy source for nearly all                other life forms, including feed-stock for domestic animals, and                fruits and grains for human consumption. It also includes timber                for construction purposes.
 
While it's thought that an increase in carbon                dioxide levels should speed up plant growth, which would slow down                the effects of global warming, a new study has found the opposite                to be true. Scientists at Stanford have found that "elevated                atmospheric carbon dioxide actually reduces plant growth when combined                with other likely consequences of climate change -- namely, higher                temperatures, increased precipitation or increased nitrogen deposits                in the soil." A rising temperature can also increase the growing                season in colder regions. It is sometimes argued that these effects                can create a greener, richer planet, with more available biomass.                However, there are many other factors involved, and it is currently                unclear if plants really benefit from global warming. Plant growth                can be limited by a number of factors, including soil fertility,                water, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. Ocean plants                (phytoplankton) are actually harmed by global warming, presumably                with negative impact on ocean ecosystems.
 
IPCC models currently predict a possible modest                increase in plant productivity. However, there are several negative                ramifications: decreases in productivity may occur at above-optimal                temperatures; greater variation in temperature is likely to decrease                wheat yields; in experiments, grain and forage quality declines                if CO2 and temperature are increased; and the reductions in soil                moisture in summer, which are likely to occur, would have a negative                effect on productivity.
 
Satellite data show that the productivity of the                northern hemisphere did indeed increase from 1982 to 1991. However,                more recent studies found that from 1991 to 2002, widespread droughts                had actually caused a decrease in summer photosynthesis in the mid                and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
NOAA projects that by the 2050s, there will only                be 54% of the volume of sea ice there was in the 1950s.
Opening up of the Northwest Passage in summer
Melting Arctic ice may open the Northwest Passage in summer in approximately                ten years, which would cut 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km) from                shipping routes between Europe and Asia. This would be of particular                relevance for supertankers that are too big to fit through the Suez                Canal and currently have to go around the southern tip of Africa.                According to the Canadian Ice Service, the amount of ice in Canada's                eastern Arctic Archipelago decreased by 15% between 1969 and 2004.                A similar opening is possible in the Arctic north of Siberia, allowing                much faster East Asian to Europe transport.
 
Further global warming (positive feedback)
Some effects of global warming themselves contribute directly to                further global warming, in a vicious circle, the nature of which                may be difficult to predict in advance. Melting could also lead                to increased heat absorption because ice reflects more solar radiation                (i.e., it has higher albedo) than land or water. Because sea ice                and seasonal snow cover are more reflective than the underlying                sea, any meltback may lead to further warming. Warmer temperatures                in the oceans reduce the productivity (growth) of ocean phytoplankton                (algae). This is expected to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide                taken up by photosynthesis in the ocean, which would again increase                the effects of anthropogenic CO2 releases on the overall amount                of CO2 in the atmosphere, and hence increase the greenhouse effect.                This is a concern because ocean photosynthesis is as large a part                of the planet's overall carbon balance as land photosynthesis.
 
Mitigation
The Energy Information Administration predicts                world energy and fossil fuel usage will rise in the next decades.The                likelihood that global temperatures will continue to significantly                increase has led to proposals to mitigate global warming. Mitigation                covers all actions aimed at reducing the negative effects or the                likelihood of global warming.There are five categories of actions                that can be taken to mitigate global warming:
Reduction of energy use (conservation)
Shifting from carbon-based fossil fuels to alternative energy sources
Carbon capture and storage
Carbon sequestration
Planetary engineering to cool the earth, including screening out                sunlight or increasing albedo.
Strategies for mitigation of global warming include development                of new technologies; carbon offsets; renewable energy such as biodiesel,                wind power, and solar power; nuclear power; electric or hybrid automobiles;                fuel cells; energy conservation; carbon taxes; enhancing natural                carbon dioxide sinks; population control; and carbon capture and                storage. Many environmental groups encourage individual action against                global warming, often aimed at the consumer, and there has been                business action on climate change.
 
The world's primary international agreement on                combating climate change is the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol                is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate                Change (UNFCCC). Countries that ratify this protocol commit to reduce                their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases,                or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions                of these gases.
 
Although the governments of 163 countries ratified                the Kyoto Protocol, (notably excluding the United States and Australia),                there is a growing debate about how effective the Kyoto protocol                has been. Some politicians, including President of the United States                George W. Bush, Prime Minister of Australia John Howard had argued                that the cost of mitigating global warming via the Kyoto protocol                is too large to be practical. This view may be proving correct,                as the signatories of the Kyoto protocol are currently struggling                to meet their targets, including Europe and Japan. After only five                years, Canada has given up entirely. Also, of the 163 countries                that have signed and ratified Kyoto, only 31 are actually required                to lower greenhouse emissions.
 
Some segments of the business community have accepted                global warming and its attribution to anthropogenic causes as valid,                as well as a need for actions such as carbon emissions trading and                carbon taxes.Adaptation strategies accept some warming as a foregone                conclusion and focus on preventing or reducing undesirable consequences. Examples of such strategies include defense against rising sea levels                or ensuring food security.
 
Climate models
Calculations of global warming from a range of climate models under                the SRES A2 emissions scenario, which assumes no action is taken                to reduce emissions.
The geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century                calculated by the HadCM3 climate model if a business as usual scenario                is assumed for economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. In                this figure, the globally averaged warming corresponds to 3.0 °C                (5.4 °F)
 
Scientists have studied global warming with computer models of the                climate (see below). Before the scientific community accepts a climate                model, it has to be validated against observed climate variations.                As of 2006, sufficiently high-resolution models successfully simulate                summer/winter differences, the North Atlantic Oscillation[citation                needed], and El Niño. All validated current models predict that                the net effect of adding greenhouse gases will be a warmer climate                in the future. However, the amount of predicted warming varies by                model, and there still remains a considerable range of climate sensitivity                predicted by the models which survive these tests; one of the most                important sources of this uncertainty is believed to be different                ways of handling clouds. Part of the technical summary of the IPCC                TAR includes a recognition of the need to quantify this uncertainty: "In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that                we are dealing with a coupled non-linear system, and therefore that                the prediction of a specific future climate is not possible. Rather                the focus must be on the probability distribution of the system's                possible future states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions."An                example of a study which aims to do this is the Climateprediction.net                project; their methodology is to investigate the range of climate                sensitivities predicted for the 21st century by those models which                are first shown to give a reasonable simulation of late 20th century                climate change.
 
As noted above, climate models have been used                by the IPCC to anticipate a warming of 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C (2.5 °F–10.4                °F) between 1990 and 2100 [85]. They have also been used to help                investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the                observed changes to those that the models predict from various natural                and human derived forcing factors. In addition to having their own                characteristic climate sensitivity, models have also been used to                derive independent assessments of climate sensitivity.
 
Climate models can produce a good match to observations                of global temperature changes over the last century [86]. These                models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred                from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human                effects; however, they suggest that the warming since 1975 is dominated                by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Adding simulation of the carbon cycle to the models generally shows a positive feedback, though                this response is uncertain (under the A2 SRES scenario, responses                vary between an extra 20 and 200 ppm of CO2). Some observational                studies also show a positive feedback [87].
 
Uncertainties in the representation of clouds                are a dominant source of uncertainty in existing models, despite                clear progress in modeling of clouds [88]. There is also an ongoing                discussion as to whether climate models are neglecting important                indirect and feedback effects of solar variability. Further, all                such models are limited by available computational power, so that                they may overlook changes related to small-scale processes and weather                (e.g. storm systems, hurricanes). However, despite these and other                limitations, the IPCC considered climate models "to be suitable                tools to provide useful projections of future climates" [89].
 
In December, 2005 Bellouin et al. suggested in                Nature that the reflectivity effect of airborne pollutants was about                double that previously expected, and that therefore some global                warming was being masked. If supported by further studies, this                would imply that existing models under-predict future global warming.                [90]
 
Defining dangerous global warming
Although global warming has been seen as potentially dangerous for                some time, the first international attempt to define what constitutes                a 'dangerous' level occurred at the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change                scientific conference in February 2005. This took place in Exeter,                United Kingdom under the UK presidency of the G8 [91].
 
At the conference it was said that increasing                damage was forecast if the globe warms to about 1 to 3 °Celsius                (1.8 to 5.4 °Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. It was concluded                that the stabilization of greenhouse gases at the equivalent of                450 ppmv CO2 would provide a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming                to the average figure of 2 °C (3.6 °F). Stabilization below 400                ppm would give a relatively high certainty of not exceeding 2 °C,                while stabilization at 550 ppm would mean it was likely that 2 °C                would be exceeded.
 
It was stated that unless 'urgent and strenuous                mitigation actions' were taken in the next 20 years, it was almost                certain that by 2050 global temperatures will have risen to between                0.5 and 2 °C (0.9 and 3.6°F) above current levels. With carbon dioxide                levels currently around 381 ppm and rising by 2ppm per year, without                such action greenhouse gasses are likely to reach 400ppm by 2016,                450ppm by 2041, and 550ppm by around 2091.
 
Other related issues
Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide increases                the amount of CO2 dissolved in the oceans. This ameliorates the                greenhouse effect by removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.                Unfortunately, carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the ocean reacts                with water to form carbonic acid. The net effect, even accounting                for warming of the oceans, is an observed and accelerating ocean                acidification. Since biosystems are adapted to a narrow range of                pH this is a very serious concern directly driven by increased atmospheric                CO2 and not global warming. Ocean acidification would not be created                by any other postulated climate change mechanisms. In fact, the                result of these other forcings would be to decrease the acidity                of the oceans as the sea temperature warmed. This is exactly contrary                to what has been observed. Roger Revelle and Hans Suess first described                the chemistry of the process.
 
Ozone depletion
Although they are often interlinked in the mass media, the connection                between global warming and ozone depletion is not strong. There                are five areas of linkage:
 
The same carbon dioxide radiative forcing that                produces near-surface global warming is expected (perhaps somewhat                surprisingly) to cool the stratosphere. This, in turn, would lead                to a relative increase in ozone depletion and the frequency of ozone                holes.
Radiative forcing from various greenhouse gases and other sourcesConversely,                ozone depletion represents a radiative forcing of the climate system.                There are two opposed effects: 1) reduced ozone allows more solar                radiation to penetrate, thus warming the troposphere instead of                the stratosphere. 2) The resulting colder stratosphere emits less                long-wave radiation down to the troposphere, thus having a cooling                effect. Overall, the cooling dominates: the IPCC concludes that                observed stratospheric O3 losses over the past two decades have                caused a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere system [92]                of about -0.15 ± 0.10 W/m² [93].
One of the strongest predictions of the greenhouse effect theory                is that the stratosphere will cool. Although this cooling has been                observed, it is not trivial to separate the effects of changes in                the concentration of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion since                both will lead to cooling. However, this can be done by numerical                stratospheric modeling. Results from the NOAA Geophysical Fluid                Dynamics Laboratory show that above 20 km, the greenhouse gases                dominate the cooling. [94]
Ozone depleting chemicals are also greenhouse gases, representing                0.34 ±0.03 W/m², or about 14% of the total radiative forcing from                well-mixed greenhouse gases [95].
Decreased ozone leads to an increase in ultraviolet levels. Ultraviolet                radiation may be responsible for the death of ocean algae, which                operate as a carbon dioxide sink in the ocean. Increased UV, therefore,                may lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide uptake, thereby raising                global carbon dioxide levels. [96]
 
Global dimming
Some scientists now consider that the effects of global dimming                (the reduction in sunlight reaching the surface of the planet, possibly                due to aerosols) may have masked some of the effect of global warming.                If this is so, the indirect aerosol effect is stronger than previously                believed, which would imply that the climate sensitivity to greenhouse                gases is also stronger. Concerns about the effect of aerosol on                the global climate were first researched as part of concerns over                global cooling in the 1970s.
 
Pre-human global warming
The Earth has experienced natural global warming and cooling many                times in the past, and can offer useful insights into present processes.                It is thought by some geologists that a rapid buildup of greenhouse                gases caused the Earth to experience global warming in the early                Jurassic period, with average temperatures rising by 5 °C (9.0 °F).                Research by the Open University published in Geology (32: 157–160,                2004 [97]) indicates that this caused the rate of rock weathering                to increase by 400%. As such weathering locks away carbon in calcite                and dolomite, carbon dioxide levels dropped back to normal over                roughly the next 150,000 years.
 
Sudden releases of methane from clathrate compounds                (the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis) have been hypothesized as a cause                for other past global warming events, including the Permian-Triassic                extinction event and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. However,                warming at the end of the last glacial period is thought not to                be due to methane release [98]. Instead, natural variations in the                Earth's orbit (Milankovitch cycles) are believed to have triggered                the retreat of ice sheets by changing the amount of solar radiation                received at high latitude and led to deglaciation.
 
The greenhouse effect is also invoked to explain                how the Earth made it out of the Snowball Earth period 600 million                years ago. During this period all silicate rocks were covered by                ice, thereby preventing them from combining with atmospheric carbon                dioxide. The atmospheric carbon dioxide level gradually increased                until it reached a level that could have been as much as 350 times                the current level. At this point temperatures were raised enough                to melt the ice, even though the reflective ice surfaces had been                reflecting most sunlight back into space. Increased amounts of rainfall                would quickly wash the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and                thick layers of abiotic carbonate sediment have been found on top                of the glacial rocks from this period.
 
Using paleoclimate data for the last 500 million                years Veizer et al. (2000, Nature 408, pp. 698–701) concluded that                long-term temperature variations are only weakly related to carbon                dioxide variations. Most paleoclimatologists believe this is because                other factors, such as continental drift and mountain building have                larger effects in determining very long term climate. However, Shaviv                and Veizer (2003, [99]) proposed that the biggest long-term influence                on temperature is actually the solar system's motion around the                galaxy, and the ways in which this influences the atmosphere by                altering the flux of cosmic rays received by the Earth. Afterwards,                they argued that over geologic times a change in carbon dioxide                concentrations comparable to doubling pre-industrial levels, only                results in about 0.75 °C (1.3 °F) warming rather than the usual                1.5–4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) reported by climate models [100]. They acknowledge                (Shaviv and Veizer 2004) however that this conclusion may only be                valid on multi-million year time scales when glacial and geological                feedback have had a chance to establish themselves. Rahmstorf et                al. 2004 [101] argue that S+V have highly and arbitrarily tuned                their data, and that their conclusions are unreliable.
 
Pre-industrial global warming
Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman has argued (e.g., Scientific                American, March 2005) that human influence on the global climate                began around 8,000 years ago with the start of forest clearing to                provide land for agriculture and 5,000 years ago with the start                of Asian rice irrigation. He contends that forest clearing explains                the rise in carbon dioxide levels in the current interglacial that                started 8,000 years ago, contrasting with the decline in carbon                dioxide levels seen in the previous three interglacials. He further                contends that the spread of rice irrigation explains the breakdown                in the last 5,000 years of the correlation between the Northern                Hemisphere solar radiation and global methane levels, which had                been maintained over at least the last 11 22,000-year cycles. Ruddiman                argues that without these effects, the Earth would be nearly 2 °C                cooler and "well on the way" to a new ice age. Ruddimann's                interpretation of the historical record, with respect to the methane                data, has been disputed.
 
Climate changes reflect variations within the                Earth's environment, natural processes going on around it, and the                impact of human activity. The external factors which can shape climate                are often called climate forcings and include such processes as                variations in solar radiation, the Earth's orbit, and greenhouse                gas concentrations.
 
Variations within the Earth's climate
Weather, in and of itself, is a chaotic non-linear dynamical system,                but in many cases, it is observed that the climate (i.e., the average                state of weather) is fairly stable and predictable. This includes                the average temperature, amount of precipitation, days of sunlight,                and many other variables that might be measured at any given site.                However, there are also changes within the Earth's environment that                can affect the climate.
 
Glaciation
Glaciers are recognized as one of the most sensitive indicators                of climate change, advancing substantially during climate cooling                (e.g., the Little Ice Age) and retreating during climate warming                on moderate time scales. Glaciers grow and collapse, both contributing                to natural variability and greatly amplifying external forces. For                the last century, however, glaciers have been unable to regenerate                enough ice during the winters to make up for the ice lost during                the summer months (see glacier retreat).
 
The most important climate processes of the last                several million years are the glacial and interglacial cycles of                the present ice age. Though shaped by orbital variations, the internal                responses involving continental ice sheets and 130 m sea-level change                certainly played a key role in deciding what climate response would                be observed in most regions. Other changes, including Heinrich events,                Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas show the potential                for glacial variations to influence climate even in the absence                of specific orbital changes.
 
Ocean variability
A schematic of modern thermohaline circulationOn the scale of mere                decades, climate changes can also result from changes within the                ocean/atmosphere systems. Many climate states, most obviously El                Niño Southern oscillation, but also including the Pacific decadal                oscillation, the North Atlantic oscillation, and the Arctic oscillation,                have been recognized as modes within the climate system, owing their                existence at least in part to different ways that heat can be stored                in the oceans and move between different reservoirs. On longer time                scales, ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a                key role in redistributing heat, and could, if changed, dramatically                impact climate.
 
The memory of climate
More generally, most forms of internal variability in the climate                system can be recognized as a form of hysteresis, meaning that the current state of climate reflects not only the inputs, but also                the history of how it got there. For example, a decade of dry conditions                may cause lakes to shrink, plains to dry up and deserts to expand.                In turn, these conditions may lead to less rainfall in the following                years. In short, climate change can be a self-perpetuating process                because different aspects of the environment respond at different                rates and in different ways to the fluctuations that inevitably                occur.
 
Non-climate factors driving climate change
Greenhouse gases
Carbon dioxide variations during the last 500 million yearsCurrent                studies indicate that radiative forcing by greenhouse gases is the                primary cause of global warming. Greenhouse gases are also important                in understanding Earth's climate history. According to these studies,                the greenhouse effect, which is the warming produced as greenhouse                gases trap heat, plays a key role in regulating Earth's temperature.
 
Over the last 600 million years, carbon dioxide                concentrations have varied from perhaps >5000 ppm to less than                200 ppm, due primarily to the impact of geological processes and                biological innovations. Curiously, it has been argued (Veizer et                al. 1999) that variations in greenhouse gas concentrations over                tens of millions of years have not been well correlated to climate                change, with plate tectonics perhaps playing a more dominant role.                However, there are several examples of rapid changes in the concentrations                of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere that do appear to                correlate to strong warming, including the Paleocene–Eocene thermal                maximum, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and the end of the                Varangian snowball earth event.During the modern era, rising carbon                dioxide levels are implicated as the primary cause to global warming                since 1950.
 
Plate tectonics
On the longest time scales, plate tectonics will reposition continents,                shape oceans, build and tear down mountains and generally serve                to define the stage upon which climate exists. More recently, plate                motions have been implicated in the intensification of the present                ice age when, approximately 3 million years ago, the North and South                American plates collided to form the Isthmus of Panama and shut                off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
 
Solar variation
Variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based                on observations of sunspots and beryllium isotopes.The sun is the                ultimate source of essentially all heat in the climate system. The                energy output of the sun, which is converted to heat at the earth's                surface, is an integral part of shaping the Earth's climate. On                the longest time scales, the sun itself is getting brighter with                higher energy output; as it continues its main sequence, this slow                change or evolution effects the earths atmosphere. Early in Earth's                history, it is thought to have been too cold to support liquid water at the Earth's surface, leading to what is known as the Faint young                sun paradox.
 
On more modern time scales, there are also a variety                of forms of solar variation, including the 11–year solar cycle and                longer-term modulations. However, the 11–year sunspot cycle does                not manifest itself clearly in the climatological data. Solar intensity                variations are considered to have been influential in triggering                the Little Ice Age, and for some of the warming observed from 1900                to 1950. The cyclical nature of the sun's energy output is not yet                fully understood; it differs from the very slow change that is occurring                to the sun as it ages and evolves.
 
Orbital variations
In their impact on climate, orbital variations are in some sense                an extension of solar variability, because slight variations in                the Earth's orbit lead to changes in the distribution and abundance                of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Such orbital variations,                known as Milankovitch cycles, are a highly predictable consequence                of basic physics due to the mutual interactions of the Earth, its                moon, and the other planets. These variations are considered the                driving factors underlying the glacial and interglacial cycles of                the present ice age. Subtler variations are also present, such as                the repeated advance and retreat of the Sahara desert in response                to orbital precession.
 
Volcanism
A single eruption of the kind that occurs several times per century                can impact climate, causing cooling for a period of a few years.                For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is barely visible                on the global temperature profile. Huge eruptions, known as large                igneous provinces, occur only a few times every hundred million                years, but can reshape climate for millions of years and cause mass                extinctions. Initially, scientists thought that the dust emitted                into the atmosphere from large volcanic eruptions was responsible                for the cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar                radiation to the Earth's surface. However, measurements indicate                that most of the dust thrown in the atmosphere returns to the Earth's                surface within six months.
 
Attribution of recent climate change
Human influences on climate
Anthropogenic factors are acts by humans that change the environment                and influence climate. The biggest factor of present concern is                the increase in CO2 levels due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion,                followed by aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere) which                exerts a cooling effect. Other factors, including land use, ozone                depletion, and deforestation also impact climate.
 
Fossil fuels
Carbon dioxide variations over the last 400,000 years, showing a                rise since the industrial revolution.Beginning with the industrial                revolution in the 1850s and accelerating ever since, the human consumption                of fossil fuels has elevated CO2 levels from a concentration of                ~280 ppm to more than 370 ppm today. These increases are projected                to reach more than 560 ppm before the end of the 21st century. Along                with rising methane levels, these changes are anticipated to cause                an increase of 1.4–5.6 °C between 1990 and 2100 (see global warming).
 
Aerosols
Anthropogenic aerosols, particularly sulphate aerosols from fossil                fuel combustion, are believed to exert a cooling influence; see                graph.[2] This, together with natural variability, is believed to                account for the relative "plateau" in the graph of 20th                century temperatures in the middle of the century.
 
Land use
Prior to widespread fossil fuel use, humanity's largest impact on                local climate is likely to have resulted from land use. Irrigation,                deforestation, and agriculture fundamentally change the environment.                For example, they change the amount of water going into and out                of a given locale. They also may change the local albedo by influencing                the ground cover and altering the amount of sunlight which is absorbed.                For example, there is evidence to suggest that the climate of Greece                and other Mediterranean countries was permanently changed by widespread                deforestation between 700 BC and 0 BC (the wood being used for ship-building,                construction and fuel purposes), with the result that the modern                climate in the region is significantly hotter and drier and the                species of trees which were used for ship-building in the ancient                world can no longer be found in the area.
 
A controversial hypothesis by William Ruddiman                [1] suggests that the rise of agriculture and the accompanying deforestation                led to the increases in carbon dioxide and methane during the period                5000–8000 years ago. These increases, which reversed previous declines,                may have been responsible for delaying the onset of the next glacial                period, according to Ruddimann's hypothesis.
 
Interplay of factors
If a certain forcing (for example, solar variation) acts to change                the climate, then there may be mechanisms which act to amplify or                reduce the effects. These are called positive and negative feedbacks.                As far as is known, the climate system is generally stable with                respect to these feedbacks: positive feedbacks do not "run                away". Part of the reason for this is the existence of a powerful                negative feedback between temperature and emitted radiation: radiation                increases as the fourth power of absolute temperature.
 
However, a number of important positive feedbacks                do exist. The glacial and interglacial cycles of the present ice                age provide an important example. It is believed that orbital variations                provide the timing for the growth and retreat of ice sheets. However,                the ice sheets themselves reflect sunlight back into space and hence                promote cooling and their own growth, known as the ice–albedo feedback.                Further, falling sea levels and expanding ice decrease plant growth                and indirectly lead to declines in carbon dioxide and methane. This                leads to further cooling.
 
Similarly, rising temperatures caused, for example,                by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases could lead to retreating                snow lines, revealing darker ground underneath, and consequently                result in more absorption of sunlight.
 
Water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide can also                act as significant positive feedbacks, their levels rising in response                to a warming trend, thereby accelerating that trend. Water vapor                acts strictly as a feedback (excepting small amounts in the stratosphere),                unlike the other major greenhouse gases, which can also act as forcings.
 
More complex feedbacks involve the possibility                of changing circulation patterns in the ocean or atmosphere. For                example, a significant concern in the modern case is that melting                glacial ice from Greenland will interfere with sinking waters in                the North Atlantic and inhibit thermohaline circulation. This could                affect the Gulf Stream and the distribution of heat to Europe and                the east coast of the United States.
 
Other potential feedbacks are not well understood                and may either inhibit or promote warming. For example, it is unclear                whether rising temperatures promote or inhibit vegetative growth,                which could in turn draw down either more or less carbon dioxide.                Similarly, increasing temperatures may lead to either more or less                cloud cover.[3] Since on balance cloud cover has a strong cooling                effect, any change to the abundance of clouds also impacts climate.
 
In all, it seems likely that overall climate feedbacks                are negative, as systems with overall positive feedback are highly                unstable.
 
Monitoring the current status of climate
Scientists use "Indicator time series" that represent                the many aspects of climate and ecosystem status. The time history                provides an historical context. Current status of the climate is                also monitored with climate indices.
 
Evidence for Climatic Change
Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources                which can be used to reconstruct past climates. Most of the evidence                is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in indicators                that reflect climate, such as vegetation, dendrochronology, ice                cores, sea level change, glacial retreat.
 
Pollen Analysis
Species have particular climatic requirements which influence their                geographical distributions. Each plant species has a distinctively                shaped pollen grain and if these fall into oxygen-free environments,                such as peat bogs, they resist decay. Changes in the pollen found                in different levels of the bog indicate, by implication, changes                in climate.One limitation of this method is the fact that pollen                can be transported considerable distances by wind or sometimes by                wildlife.
 
Coleoptera
Remains of Coleoptera beetles are common in freshwater and land                sediments. Different species of this beetle tend to be found under                different climatic conditions. Knowledge of the present climatic                range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in                which remains are found, allows past climatic conditions to be worked                out.
 
Glacial Geology
Advancing glaciers leave behind moraines and other features which                often have datable material in them, recording the time when a glacier                advance and deposited a feature. Similarly the lack of glacier cover                can be identified by the presence of datable soil or volcanic tephra                horizons. Glaciers are considered one of the most sensitive climate                indicators by the IPCC, and their recent observed variations provide                a global signal of climate change, see Retreat of glaciers since                1850.
 
Historical Records
Historical records include cave paintings, depth of grave digging                in Greenland, diaries, documentary evidence of events (such as 'frost                fairs' on the Thames) and evidence of areas of vine cultivation.                Since 1873 daily weather reports have been documented, and the Royal                Society has encouraged the collection of data since the seventeenth century. Parish records are often a good source of climate data.
 
Examples of climate change
Climate change has continued throughout the entire history of Earth.                The field of paleoclimatology has provided information of climate                change in the ancient past, supplementing modern observations of                climate. Obviously, these prehistoric changes are solely the result                of natural factors.
