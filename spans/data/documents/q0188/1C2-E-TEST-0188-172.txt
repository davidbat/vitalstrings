The arithmetic average of a meteorological element over 30 years is defined          as the climatological normal. So, the key difference between the two is          that a normal is strictly for 30 years, whereas an average can be computed          over any time span. Official normals are calculated by the National Climatic          Data Center for temperature and precipitation elements and are updated          through the end of each decade ending in zero (for example, 1971-2000).          These official normals can be slightly different from a strict average          because they also take into account changes in the station over the thirty-year          period. These changes can include changes in the instrumentation, the          location, the observing practices, the observation time, or in the surrounding          environment.
How about between an          average temperature and a mean temperature?
Typically when climatologists talk about the mean temperature, they are          referring to the average of the maximum and minimum temperatures. Referring          to just to an "average" temperature can be a bit to vague -          it isn't necessarily clear whether you are referring to the average high,          the average low or the average mean for a specific time period.
Do you keep records          of the Heat Index? If not, how do I calculate it?
Because the Heat Index is a calculated value based off of air temperature            and humidity, it is not archived with historic weather data. To calculate            a specific value for a previous date, you will need to know the air            temperature and humidity. This data is not typically available for cooperative            observing stations, but is generally available for airports. The equation            to calculate the Heat Index is as follows:
What is the Wind Chill?
To find the Wind Chill Temperature Index from the table below, find the          air temperature along the top of the table and the wind speed along the          left side. Where the two intersect is the Wind Chill Temperature.

Lastly, while exposure to low wind chills can be life threatening to            humans and animals, the only effect that wind chill has on an inanimate            objects, such as vehicles, is that it shortens the time it takes the            object to cool to the actual air temperature. The object cannot be cooled            below the actual temperature.

What are Degree Days          (Heating, Cooling, & Growing)?
Heating Degree Days
Heating Degree Days (HDD) are used as an index to estimate the amount          of energy required for heating during the cool season. When the daily          mean temperature falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, most buildings require          heat to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. By monitoring heating          fuel usage and heating degree day accumulation over a period of time,          a building's energy consumption per HDD can be calculated and this value          used, for example, in fuel consumption monitoring, energy efficiency evaluation          or future fuel supply estimates. The daily mean temperature is found by          adding together the high and low temperature for the day and dividing          by two. When the mean temperature is above 65 F, the HDD total is zero.          If the mean temperature is below 65 F, the HDD amount is the difference          between 65 F and the mean temperature. For example, if the high temperature          for the day was 68 F and the low 52 F, the mean temperature for the day          would be 68 + 52 = 120 / 2 = 60 F. The Heating Degree Day total would          then be 65 - 60 = 5 HDD.
In equation form:
TBASE = Heating Degree Day base temperature, usually 65
TMEAN = mean temperature,
What is the Heat Index?
The Heat Index, also known as the apparent temperature, is an accurate          measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity (RH) is added          to the actual air temperature. The National Weather Service derived the          Heat Index in an effort to alert the public to the dangers of exposure          to extended periods of heat, especially when high humidity acts along          with the high temperatures to reduce the body's ability to cool itself.
One important fact to realize about the Heat Index is that it is computed            for temperature readings taken in the shade and for a wind speed of            approximately 6 miles per hour. Exposure to full sun can add up to 15            F to the Heat Index value!
To find the Heat Index from the table, find the air temperature along the left side of the table and the relative humidity along the top.            Where the two intersect is the Heat Index.

What is the Wind Chill?
The Wind Chill Temperature Index, sometimes also known as the equivalent          temperature, is used to describe how cold people and animals feel when          they experience heat loss caused by the combined effects of low temperature          and wind.
When the wind blows across exposed skin, it removes the insulating layer          of warm air that lies adjacent to the skin. This in turn drives down the          skin temperature and eventually the internal body temperature. The faster          the wind blows, the faster the heat is carried away, the greater the heat          loss and the colder it feels.
A new Wind Chill Temperature Index took effect on November 1, 2001,            replacing the original wind chill index that was derived in 1945. The            original Wind Chill Index was developed by two Antarctic explorers and            was based on research involving the time it took water in a plastic            container to freeze. The new Wind Chill Temperature Index includes the            latest advances in science, technology and computer modeling. It takes            into account a calculated wind speed at average face height based on            readings from winds measured at the national standard height of 33 feet.            It is based on the exposure of a human face to cold versus a plastic            container, incorporates modern heat transfer theory, lowers the calm            wind threshold from 4 miles per hour to 3 miles per hour, and has a            consistent standard for skin tissue resistance. The new Wind Chill Temperature            Index currently assumes no impact from the sun, but it may yet be revised            again for solar radiation impacts under various sky conditions (clear,            partly sunny, cloudy).

What are Degree Days          (Heating, Cooling, & Growing)?
Growing Degree Days
To calculate GDDs, you must first find the mean temperature for the day.          The mean temperature is found by adding together the high and low temperature          for the day and dividing by two. If the mean temperature is at or below          TBASE, then the Growing Degree Day value is zero. If the mean temperature          is above TBASE, then the Growing Degree Day amount equals the mean temperature          minus TBASE. For example, if the mean temperature was 75°F, then the          GDD amount equals 10 for a TBASE of 65°F. You can think of Growing          Degree Days as similar to Cooling Degree Days, only the base temperature          can be something besides 65°F.
In equation form:
TBASE = Heating Degree Day base temperature, usually 65
TMEAN = mean temperature,

Cooling Degree Days
Cooling Degree Days (CDD) are used as an index to estimate the amount          of energy required for cooling during the warm season. When the temperature          rises above 65°F, many buildings use air conditioning to maintain         a comfortable indoor temperature. By monitoring air conditioner energy         usage and cooling degree day accumulation over a period of time, a building's         energy consumption per CDD can be calculated and this value used, for         example, in energy use monitoring, energy efficiency evaluation or future         energy usage estimates. The daily mean temperature is found by adding         together the high and low temperature for the day and dividing by two.         When the mean temperature is below 65°F, the CDD total is zero. If          the mean temperature is above 65°F, the CDD amount is the difference           between the mean temperature and 65. For example, if the high temperature           for the day was 92°F and the low was 68°F, the mean temperature            for the day would be 92 + 68 = 160 / 2 = 80°F. The Cooling Degree             Days would then be 80 - 65 = 15 CDD.

TBASE = Heating Degree Day base temperature, usually 65

Growing Degree Days
Growing Degree Days (GDD) are used to estimate the growth and development          of plants and insects during the growing season. The basic concept is          that development will only occur if the temperature exceeds some minimum          development threshold, or base temperature (TBASE). The base temperatures          are determined experimentally and are different for each organism.
