India Climate and Weather
It is hard to generalise in a country that runs from the Himalayas to the beaches of the Indian Ocean, but broadly speaking, October to March tend to be the most pleasant months in India, when it relatively dry and cool. In the far south the best months to visit are between January and September, while north-eastern areas of India tend to be more comfortable between March and August. The deserts of Rajasthan (west of Jodhpur) and the north-western Indian Himalayan region are at their best during the monsoon season (July to September). The mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir should be visited over the summer months (May to September).
