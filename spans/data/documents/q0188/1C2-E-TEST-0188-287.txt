(v). Climate Classification and Climatic Regions of the World
Climate Classification
The Köppen                                 Climate Classification System is the                                 most widely used system for classifying the world's                                 climates. Its categories are based on the annual                                 and monthly averages of temperature and precipitation.                                 The Köppen system recognizes five major                                 climatic types; each type is designated by a capital letter.
 
A - Tropical Moist Climates:                               all months have average temperatures above 18° Celsius.
B - Dry Climates: with deficient                               precipitation during most of the year.
C - Moist Mid-latitude Climates                               with Mild Winters.
D - Moist Mid-Latitude Climates                               with Cold Winters.
E - Polar Climates: with extremely                               cold winters and summers.
 
Tropical Moist Climates (A)
Tropical moist                                 climates extend northward and southward                                 from the equator to about 15 to 25° of latitude.                                 In these climates all months have average temperatures                                 greater than 18° Celsius. Annual precipitation is                                 greater than 1500 mm. Three minor Köppen                                 climate types exist in the A group, and their                                 designation is based on seasonal distribution                                 of rainfall. Af or tropical                                 wet is a tropical climate where precipitation occurs all year long. Monthly temperature variations                                 in this climate are less than 3° Celsius.                                 Because of intense surface heating and high humidity, cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds                                 form early in the afternoons almost every day.                                 Daily highs are about 32° Celsius, while                                 night time temperatures average 22° Celsius. Am is                                 a tropical monsoon climate.                                 Annual rainfall is equal to or greater than Af,                                 but most of the precipitation falls in the 7                                 to 9 hottest months. During the dry season very                                 little rainfall occurs. The tropical                                 wet and dry or savanna (Aw)                                 has an extended dry season during winter. Precipitation                                 during the wet season is usually less than 1000                                 millimeters, and only during the summer season.
 
Dry Climates (B)
The most obvious climatic feature of                             this climate is that potential                             evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation .                             These climates extend from 20 - 35° North and                             South of the equator and in large continental regions                             of the mid-latitudes often surrounded by mountains.                             Minor types of this climate include:
BW - dry                                     arid (desert) is a true desert                                     climate. It covers 12% of the Earth's land                                     surface and is dominated by xerophytic vegetation.                                     The additional letters h and k are                                     used generally to distinguish whether the                                     dry arid climate is found in the subtropics                                     or in the mid-latitudes, respectively.
BS - dry                                     semiarid (steppe). Is a grassland                                     climate that covers 14% of the Earth's land                                     surface. It receives more precipitation than                                     the BW either                                     from the intertropical                                     convergence zone or from mid-latitude                                     cyclones . Once again, the additional                                     letters h and k are                                     used generally to distinguish whether the                                     dry semiarid climate is found in the subtropics or in the mid-latitudes, respectively.
 
Moist Subtropical Mid-Latitude                                 Climates (C)
This climate generally has warm and                             humid summers with mild winters. Its extent is from                             30 to 50° of latitude mainly on the eastern and                             western borders of most continents. During the winter,                             the main weather feature is the mid-latitude                             cyclone . Convective thunderstorms dominate                             summer months. Three minor types exist: Cfa - humid                             subtropical; Cs - Mediterranean;                             and Cfb - marine.                             The humid subtropical climate (Cfa)                             has hot muggy summers and frequent thunderstorms.                             Winters are mild and precipitation during this season                             comes from mid-latitude cyclones. A good example                             of a Cfa climate                             is the southeastern USA. Cfb marine                             climates are found on the western coasts of continents.                             They have a humid climate with short dry summer.                             Heavy precipitation occurs during the mild winters                             because of the continuous presence of mid-latitude                             cyclones. Mediterranean climates (Cs)                             receive rain primarily during winter season from                             the mid-latitude cyclone. Extreme summer aridity                             is caused by the sinking air of the subtropical                             highs and may exist for up to 5 months. Locations                             in North America are from Portland, Oregon to all                             of California.
 
Moist Continental Mid-latitude                                 Climates (D)
Moist continental mid-latitude climates have                             warm to cool summers and cold winters. The location                             of these climates is pole ward of the C climates.                             The average temperature of the warmest month is greater                             than 10° Celsius, while the coldest month is                             less than -3° Celsius. Winters are severe with                             snowstorms, strong winds, and bitter cold from Continental                             Polar or Arctic air                             masses . Like the C climates there are three                             minor types: Dw - dry                             winters; Ds - dry                             summers; and Df - wet                             all seasons.
 
Polar Climates (E)
Polar climates have year-round cold                             temperatures with the warmest month less than 10° Celsius.                             Polar climates are found on the northern coastal                             areas of North America, Europe, Asia, and on the                             landmasses of Greenland and Antarctica. Two minor                             climate types exist. ET or polar                             tundra is a climate where the soil is                             permanently frozen to depths of hundreds of meters,                             a condition known as permafrost. Vegetation is dominated                             by mosses, lichens, dwarf trees and scattered woody                             shrubs. EF or polar                             ice caps has a surface that is permanently                             covered with snow and ice.
 
Factors Influencing the World Climatic                               Regions
So far in this online textbook we have discovered                             that the climate of a particular place is the function                             of a number of factors. These factors include:
1) Latitude and its influence on solar                                   radiation received.
3) Location of global high and low         pressure zones.
4) Heat exchange from ocean currents.
5) Distribution of mountain barriers.
6) Pattern of prevailing winds.
7) Distribution of land and sea.
8) Altitude.
At a macro-level, the first three factors                             are most important in influencing a region's climate.                             The animated graphic below provides us with                             a generalized model of the Earth's annual climatic                             variations. It also describes the latitudinal effects                             of these top three factors through the following                             climatic features:
Relative annual latitudinal location of the                                 overhead Sun at solar noon.
Intertropical                                     convergence zone and its area of                                     uplift, cloud development and precipitation.
Subtropical                                     high pressure zone and its associated                                     descending air currents and clear skies.
Polar                                     front and its area of uplift, cloud                                     development and precipitation.
Polar                                     vortex and its associated descending                                     air currents and clear skies.
Relative location of tropical/subtropical (red)                                 and polar (light blue)                                 air masses.
In the animation we can see that the                             intertropical convergence zone, the subtropical high                             pressure zone, polar front and the position of tropical/subtropical                             and polar air masses all move in response to the                             seasonal movements of the Sun. It is important to                             understand this concept because of its climatic ramifications                             for locations on the globe. The type of climate that                             a location experiences is to a large extent a function                             of seasonal migration of these weather features.                             For example, a location at 15° North latitude                             is influenced by the subtropical high pressure zone                             during winter solstice and by the intertropical convergence                             zone during the summer solstice. Another location,                             at 60° North latitude, would be influenced by                             polar air masses during the winter solstice, the                             polar front during the equinoxes, and by subtropical                             air masses and the subtropical high pressure zone                             during the summer solstice.
When studying about the Earth's                                 Climatic Regions as described below, use this animation (Figure 7v-1)                                 as a guide to understanding the large scale climatic                                 processes that produce each location's particular                                 climate.
Figure 7v-1: Solar                             influence on the movement of the Earth's global circulation                             patterns.
 
Climatic Region Descriptions
The following discussion organizes                             the climatic regions of the world into eight different                             groups. Categorization of these climates is based                             on their Köppen classification and                             seasonal dominance of air                             masses .
 
Köppen Classification - Af.
Dominated by Maritime Tropical air masses                                   all year long.
The tropical wet climate is characterized                             by somewhat consistent daily high temperatures ranging                             between 20 to 30° Celsius. The monthly temperature                             averages vary from 24 to 30° Celsius. Annual                             range of monthly temperatures is about 3° Celsius.                             It has reasonably uniform precipitation all year                             round, and total rainfall over 2000 millimeters or                             greater.
The region experiencing this climate                             lies within the effects of the intertropical convergence zone all                             year long. Convergence and                             high maritime humidity creates cumulus                             clouds and thunderstorms almost                             daily.
