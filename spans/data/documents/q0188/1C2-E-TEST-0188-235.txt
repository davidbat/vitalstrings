The North Pole is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic                Ocean is surrounded by Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia. The                ocean is 4000 meters deep. Although it is an ocean, it is water                you can walk on. There are 2-3 meter thick ice floes floating on                the water at the North Pole. In summer the temperatures are near                0 centigrade and there is light .                In winter the temperature is about -30 centigrade and it is dark .                With the Interactive                Arctic Climate Map , you can see mean monthly temperatures for                many locations in the Arctic (including the North Pole). You can view the North Pole scenery in summer daylight as images and animations with the North Pole Web Cam , and compare changes in conditions in different years .
4. Why should we study                the Arctic?
The Arctic environment is unique in many ways and offers the opportunity                for a great many discoveries about how the physical and biologic                environments function under the "extreme" conditions found in the                Arctic. Several species of animals are unique to the Arctic (e.g.,                polar bear, walrus, musk ox) and many species of birds have their                summer home there.
The Arctic, unlike the Antarctic is inhabited by humans, including                diverse Native communities with a longer history than many of the                southerly societies. Although European-derived culture is now dominant                in the Arctic, study of the Native culture is important for its                preservation, and for what it can teach others about long-term human                survival in the Arctic. The Arctic has many natural resources that                could be exploited for economic benefit. Crude oil, gold and industrial                metals, and diamonds are presently being extracted now, yet much                of the Arctic's potential for natural resources is unknown.
More recently, we have learned that the Arctic is not as isolated                from more heavily populated areas as was once thought and our modern                civilization is having an impact on the Arctic. For example, industrial                activities are responsible for the presence in the Arctic of many                persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals that are neither                produced nor used there, but rather are transported there through                the atmosphere and deposited to land and water surfaces. This is                of great concern to the Native and other residents of the Arctic,                many of whom survive on wild plants and animals that may be contaminated                with these materials. Over the past two decades, a series of unusual                changes have occurred in the Arctic that may be related to release                of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by industrialized nations.                Sea ice and permafrost are decreasing, precipitation patterns are                changing, the air is warmer, and the intensity of harmful UVB radiation                is increasing. In addition to posing difficult challenges, and perhaps                new opportunities, to people living in the Arctic, these changes                may ultimately influence other parts of the Earth. Melting of Arctic                sea ice and the Greenland Ice Sheet could increase sea level and                change the strength of the global ocean circulation. Other changes                in the Arctic, could alter the relative amount of the Sun's energy                that is absorbed, reflected, or radiated in the Arctic. Thus, the                Arctic has the potential of providing unexpected deviations in the                rate of "global warming".

How                        and why do scientists study climate change in the Arctic
Scientific study of the Arctic historically has been conducted                by "expeditions". The earliest expeditions had as their goal reaching                the North Pole, finding a "northwest passage" for shipping, or searching                for whales or other species that could be harvested. Recently, expeditions                have been replaced by cruises on scientific research vessels, temporary                manned camps on the ice or on land, or permanent manned research                facilities. Most recently, capabilities for unmanned observation                of the Arctic have been developed. These include satellites and                automated instruments or sensors that can be left on the ice, in                the water, or on land for weeks and months at a time. Automated                instruments can either record data for later retrieval, or even                send data directly to a laboratory via a satellite link. Another                modern method for studying the Arctic relies on creation of computer-based                models of the Arctic atmosphere or ocean for example, and then perturbing                these models to see how the natural system might respond.

For humans that live in the Arctic, conditions there dictate lifestyle                to a very great extent. Residents must cope with very low temperatures                and constant darkness in the winter, and temperatures above freezing                and constant daylight in the summer. While temperatures are below                freezing, the frozen, snow covered ground, ice covered rivers, and                shore-fast ice are utilized for transportation using dog sleds (traditionally)                or snowmobiles (recently). In warmer weather, transportation is                based on small boats on ice-free coastal waters and flowing rivers.                Most indigenous people live along the coast or on river banks. Diet                is based on foods that can be taken from the natural environment                (fish, seals, whales, caribou, berries, plants), since agriculture                is impossible. Until recently, indigenous people often migrated                seasonally, or established "camps" to be near food sources. The                harsh climate limited European immigration in many Arctic areas,                and the indigenous people have continued a non-market, subsistence                economy even today. However, conditions are changing. Recent discoveries                of oil, minerals, and diamonds in Arctic areas, and a growing interest                in Arctic tourism are bringing many non-indigenous people to the                Arctic to live or visit. Simultaneously, the indigenous people are                blending many parts of western civilization into their lifestyle                (e.g., city water and sewerage, food markets, the internet).
For humans that live in the mid-latitudes, impacts from the Arctic                come mainly in the form of weather and climate. Wintertime outbreaks                of cold Arctic air are responsible for unusually cold or persistent                low temperatures, high winds, and blowing snow that are frequent                characteristics of mid-latitude winters. We are still at the early                stages of discovery in learning how the Arctic Oscillation (see                link) impacts temperatures and precipitation in the mid-latitude                belt below the Arctic, but it seems clear that the AO is a dominant                feature in controlling our weather and climate on annual to decadal                scales. The Arctic is an area with a net loss of heat to outer space                due to the long periods of little or no sunlight and the high reflectivity                of the snow and ice even when the sun is present in the Arctic.                The circulation of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans moves heat                from the tropics to the poles, making the Earth overall a much more                habitable place. Over longer time scales, changes in the reflectivity                of the land and ocean surfaces in the Arctic, or changes in ocean                currents, such as the Gulf Stream, that could result from different                sea ice conditions in the Arctic, can alter the extent to which                heat is redistributed from the tropics. Thus the climate in the                mid-latitude belt depends significantly on natural processes in                the Arctic.
7. How will studies of                the Arctic affect my life?
Studies now underway in the Arctic should lead to more reliable                forecasts of weather over the Arctic and in heavily populated mid-latitude                areas. We will learn more about how the Arctic influences the global                climate and achieve greater insight about the climate our children                will experience. We will be better able to quantify, manage and                use the natural resources of the Arctic.
8. Who lives in the Arctic?
The Arctic is inhabited by several different groups of indigenous                people, and also by relatively recent immigrants of mostly European                background. In Alaska, for example, indigenous people account for                about 70% or more of the total population in mainland areas bordering                the Bering , Chukchi,                or Beaufort Seas. In Russia, only 15% or fewer of the inhabitants                along the north coast are indigenous people. There are three main                groups of Alaska Natives, the Inuit, Aleut, and Indian, while in                Russia, there are 16 recognized minority indigenous peoples. The                total populations of indigenous people in the Alaskan and Russian                Arctic are about 50,000 and 70,000 respectively. The Canadian Arctic                has about 50,000 indigenous people, representing 50% of the total                population of the area, from three recognized groups: Indian, Inuit,                and Métis. Inuit people are also found in Greenland.
