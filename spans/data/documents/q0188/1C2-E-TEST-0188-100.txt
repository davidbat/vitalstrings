Odd how pretty much nobody in the Dearly Beloved Media seems to care about the false accusations of intent-to-murder… OF ALL SKEPTICS.
And isn’t it pathetic the way all the good little skeptics are ‘shocked’ and ‘offended’ by the HI billboard?
What is does is cut to the heart of the matter: the alarmists (read ENVIRONMENTALISTS) ARE aligned with the ideologies of Stalin, Mao, assorted insane people, etc.
Like this fool: “You cannot simultaneously say that you want to promote a debate while equating the other side to terrorists and mass murderers.”
Or this absolute douche: “It reminds me, unpleasantly, of when I used to write about messy divorces. The systemic problems were real, but far too often both sides were their own worst enemy.”
Aww, does the liddle widdle kiddie have a boo-boo?
God, but these people are tards: the other “side” IS causing human suffering and death (apart from being a group of corrupt LIARS and FRAUDSTERS) – how many killed by the DDT fiasco alone? 50 million? More? Sure, they were ONLY mostly children, and ONLY mostly black, so I guess they do not matter. DEBATE?! Who the f-ck wants to DEBATE with such people?!?! Oh, yeah, sorry, they have like books to sell, and have, like ‘reputations’, and similar – can’t afford not to be politically correct… why Hannity, and certainly an a-hole like O’Reilly, might not invite them back – the HORROR!
Who is more guilty of a great crime: the one who plays WITH the murderers, or the one who loudly and somewhat un-politely denounces them? Maybe there really ARE two groups of skeptics – those who are like hippies with zero sense of justice and truth, and those who are not.
