Basics
What is the Difference Between Weather and Climate?
Weather is the day-to-day state of the atmosphere, and its short-term (minutes to weeks) variation.  Popularly, weather is thought of as the combination of temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind. We talk about the weather in terms of "What will it be like today?", "How hot is it right now?", and "When will that storm hit our section of the country?"
Climate is defined as statistical weather information that describes the variation of weather at a given place for a specified interval.  In popular usage, it represents the synthesis of weather; more formally it is the weather of a locality averaged over some period (usually 30 years) plus statistics of weather extremes.
We talk about climate change in terms of years, decades or even centuries.  Scientists study climate to look for trends or cycles of variability (such as the changes in wind patterns, ocean surface temperatures and precipitation over the equatorial Pacific that result in El Niño and La Niña), and also to place cycles or other phenomena into the bigger picture of possible longer term or more permanent climate changes.
