 
A Mild Climate
Although its latitude (48°52'0"N) is roughly the same as Vancouver or the Island of Newfoundland in Canada, the City of Paris benefits from a temperate climate as a result of its location in Western Europe and the warming effects of the Gulf Stream .
Nestled in the Paris Basin, situated midway between an oceanic climate to the west and a semi-continental climate to the east, Paris enjoys mild winters and relatively clement summers.
Temperatures
The average temperatures in Paris generally range between 5°C (41°F) during winter and 20°C (68°F) in summer. July is the hottest month of the year, and January is the coldest.
As a rule, it is slightly warmer in Paris than in the suburbs. The effects of urbanisation result in significant differences of temperature between the city's center and the outskirts, regularly recording one or two degrees higher at Paris Montsouris 1 or at the Tour Saint-Jacques , as compared to Paris Le Bourget Airport which is 9 km outside the city.
During the past century, the coldest winter was in 1953-1954, when the thermometer dropped to -15°C (5°F). The coldest day ever recorded was on 10 December 1879: -23.9°C (-11°F).
While the hottest recorded temperature reached 40.4°C (104.7°F) on 28 July 1948, the deadly heatwave of August 2003 produced nine (9) consecutive days of temperatures exceeding 35°C (95°F). These temperatures are quite exceptional, however.
Precipitation
Spring, from March to May, is the driest season. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the other seasons. Average annual precipitation is 607-641 mm (24-25 inches). The most rainfall recorded in a single day was on 24 August 1987: 95.7 mm (3.77 in).
Paris is known for its frequent showers, which tend to pass just as quickly as they arrive. It is not unusual to witness bright sunshine one moment, then a quick shower followed by a return to sunshine — all within the course of a few minutes' time.

For instance, there are about 171 days a year with precipitation of over 0.1 mm (0.004 in.), yet only 16 days with more than 10 mm (0.4 in.). Thus, it is practical to carry a small umbrella with you in all seasons.
Thanks to its temperate climate, however, snowfall is somewhat of a rarity in Paris. Although there is at least a dusting of snow about 15 days a year, most accumulation generally disappears within 24 hours. The highest snowfall ever recorded in one day was 40 cm (15.75 in) on 2 March 1946.
Winds
The windiest months in Paris are generally from November through January, averaging 21-23 km/hr. (13-14 mph). During the rest of the year, the city enjoys pleasant breezes of 15-18 km/h (9-11 mph).
When extreme storms battered much of western Europe on 27 December 1999, the Paris region suffered a loss of tens of thousands of trees and extensive property damage, with wind gusts reaching 169 km/h (105 mph).
