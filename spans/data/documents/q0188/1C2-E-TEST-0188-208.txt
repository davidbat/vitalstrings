What Are Greenhouse Gases?
Many chemical compounds found in the Earths atmosphere act as greenhouse gases. These gases allow sunlight to enter the            atmosphere freely. When sunlight strikes the Earths surface, some            of it is reflected back towards space as infrared radiation (heat).            Greenhouse gases absorb this infrared radiation and trap the heat in            the atmosphere. Over time, the amount of energy sent from the sun to            the Earths surface should be about the same as the amount of energy            radiated back into space, leaving the temperature of the Earths            surface roughly constant.
Many gases exhibit these greenhouse properties.          Some of them occur in nature (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and          nitrous oxide), while others are exclusively human-made (like gases used          for aerosols).
 
Why Are Atmospheric          Levels Increasing?
Levels of several important greenhouse gases have increased          by about 25 percent since large-scale industrialization began around 150          years ago (Figure 1). During the past 20 years, about three-quarters of          human-made carbon dioxide emissions were from burning fossil fuels.
Figure          1. Trends in Atmospheric Concentrations and Anthropogenic Emissions of          Carbon Dioxide
Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are          naturally regulated by numerous processes collectively known as the carbon          cycle (Figure 2). The movement (flux) of carbon between          the atmosphere and the land and oceans is dominated by natural processes,          such as plant photosynthesis. While these natural processes can absorb          some of the net 6.1 billion metric tons of anthropogenic carbon dioxide          emissions produced each year (measured in carbon equivalent terms), an          estimated 3.2 billion metric tons is added to the atmosphere annually.          The Earths positive imbalance between emissions and absorption results          in the continuing growth in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

What Effect Do Greenhouse          Gases Have on Climate Change?
Given the natural variability of the Earths climate,          it is difficult to determine the extent of change that humans cause. In          computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases generally          produce an increase in the average temperature of the Earth. Rising temperatures          may, in turn, produce changes in weather, sea levels, and land use patterns,          commonly referred to as climate change.
Assessments generally suggest that the Earths climate          has warmed over the past century and that human activity affecting the          atmosphere is likely an important driving factor. A National Research          Council study dated May 2001 stated, Greenhouse gases are accumulating          in Earths atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface          air temperatures and sub-surface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures          are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades          are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that          some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural          variability.
However, there is uncertainty in how the climate system          varies naturally and reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases. Making progress          in reducing uncertainties in projections of future climate will require          better awareness and understanding of the buildup of greenhouse gases          in the atmosphere and the behavior of the climate system.
What Are the Sources of Greenhouse Gases?
In the U.S., our greenhouse gas emissions come mostly from          energy use. These are driven largely by economic growth, fuel used for          electricity generation, and weather patterns affecting heating and cooling          needs. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, resulting from petroleum          and natural gas, represent 82 percent of total U.S. human-made greenhouse          gas emissions (Figure 3). The connection between energy use and carbon          dioxide emissions is explored in the box on the reverse side (Figure 4).

Another greenhouse gas, methane, comes from landfills,          coal mines, oil and gas operations, and agriculture; it represents 9 percent          of total emissions. Nitrous oxide (5 percent of total emissions), meanwhile,          is emitted from burning fossil fuels and through the use of certain fertilizers          and industrial processes. Human-made gases (2 percent of total emissions)          are released as byproducts of industrial processes and through leakage.
What Is the Prospect          for Future Emissions?
World carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase          by 1.9 percent annually between 2001 and 2025 (Figure 5). Much of the          increase in these emissions is expected to occur in the developing world          where emerging economies, such as China and India, fuel economic development          with fossil energy. Developing countries emissions are expected          to grow above the world average at 2.7 percent annually between 2001 and          2025; and surpass emissions of industrialized countries near 2018.

The U.S. produces about 25 percent of global carbon dioxide          emissions from burning fossil fuels; primarily because our economy is          the largest in the world and we meet 85 percent of our energy needs through          burning fossil fuels. The U.S. is projected to lower its carbon intensity          by 25 percent from 2001 to 2025, and remain below the world average (Figure          6).
