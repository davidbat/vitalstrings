What Is the Difference Between Weather and Climate?
We all know what weather is. It’s what we look out the window to check before going outside every day.
Do I need an umbrella? Where are my boots? I need sun-block. I’d better wear a hat. Translated into weather terms, you are checking on rain, snow, sunshine, and wind, just some of the manifestations, or types, of weather.
Climate averages and generalizes the day-to-day weather of a specific area over a long period of time to broadly describe its weather patterns. Climate is the big picture, concerned with generalities.
Arid, polar, temperate, subtropical—these are some of the adjectives used to describe climate.
Climatology, the study of climate, helps us understand the different environments on Earth: what happens to water; how do winds blow; are the polar ice caps likely to melt?
Studying weather can help you predict what’s happening in your environment: is that hurricane off the coast likely to hit our town; will this drought last another week; can our city afford to pay for plowing this snow?
