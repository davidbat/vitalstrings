Introduction
 
While                 the scope of this discussion is limited to the major factors                 that effect the weather and climate of Boquete               (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, Thunderstorms and Orographic               Lifting) it should be remembered that        weather (the day-by-day realities of our atmosphere), the seasons and climate       (the overall trends and patterns of weather over the course of the years)       are always the result of a complex dynamic interaction of factors that       include: the relative position of the sun, air temperature, air humidity,       clouds, precipitation, air pressure, and winds. These are the basic elements       of weather and climate. The weather of Boquete is no exception.
 
Panama                       and Boquete [ top ]
 
Panama                   is a relatively small strip of land in the shape of an “S” lying                   on its back 1100 miles south of Miami, Florida. It is sandwiched                   in between two large bodies of water, the Caribbean Sea to                   the north, the Pacific Ocean                 to the south. It is also bordered by two countries with Costa                   Rica to the west and Columbia to the east (see Figure 1). To                   get some perspective of its relative size, it is a total of                   29,157 square miles which                   is a bit                 smaller than the state of South Carolina with 30,109 square                   miles (See Figure 2). It is about 400                   miles long running west to east and generally 50-70 miles wide                   from north to south. (See Figure 3). It                   has several                   mountain ranges dissecting it in various                 places. The western most mountain range continuing from Costa                   Rica is the Talamanca Range in the State of Chiriqui. This                   range includes                   the countries tallest mountain, Volcan                   Baru which is 11400 feet high (3475 meters) and home to tropical                   rainforests. Panama is located               between 7 to 9 degrees                   north latitude

from                   the equator and between 77 to 83 degrees west                   longitude placing it solidly in the tropics.                   Panama is very                   small in comparison to the large land masses of continental                   North America and Europe. Its weather is more affected by the large water masses around                   it rather than by large land masses. In short, Panama is                   a little piece of land with                    highly varying terrain bathing in a large tub of water and             basking in a whole lot of sun!
Boquete             is not just a city although the town of Bajo Boquete is often called "Boquete." It                 is  a District with 6 Subdistricts (Corregimientos)                 located in Chiriqui, the western most State (Province) of Panama                 bordering Costa Rica (See Figure 3). It covers an area of 189                 square miles (484 square kilometers) and has                  a lot of topographical variation in terrain and elevation. The             altitudes range from 1200 feet in the lowland areas             to 11400 feet (Volcan Baru the

highest                 point in Panama) in the highlands. Its southern boundary is the                 lowest                 part of the district which gradually slopes upward and northward                 to                 the Talamanca Mountain Range that runs east to west coming out                 of                 Costa Rica.                 The city of Bajo Boquete (Lower Boquete) in the Subdistrict of                 Bajo Boquete sits in a bowl like valley surrounded by Volcan                 Baru to the west, the Talamanca Range to the north, the Jaramillo             Mountains to the east and an opening to the south after a slight                 climb out of the valley to the                 more open area of Alto Boquete which then slopes downward through                 a barren savanna to the southern boundary of the District of                 Boquete. The word Boquete in Spanish means a "hole" or                 an "opening." Originally this area was called "El             Boquete" meaning the hole or opening to the valley.

About 12                   miles south of the Boquete District boundary (in the Subdistrict of Alto                         Boquete)                         and                         25 miles                         south of                         the town of Boquete Bajo is the city of David (population                         2005 138,241)  the                         capital                         of                         the State                         of Chiriqui. The elevation of David is about 200 feet.                   Driving                         from David to Bajo Boquete is a gradual climb from 200                   feet to 3500 feet. There is often a 20° F decrease in outside                         temperature from  David to Bajo Boquete. The                         District of Boquete has a lot of varying terrain with                   valleys, plateaus,                         hills,                         mountains,                         ravines,                         canyons and rivers. All of this variation provides conditions                 for differing weather and many microclimates.

The                     Tropics [ top ]
 
The Tropics is                 a designated area around the earth between 23.5° north latitude                 (Tropic of Cancer) and 23.5 south latitude (Tropic of Capricorn).                 This is the area of the earth that gets the most direct sunlight                 during the earths yearly revolution around the sun (See Figure                 4). Anyone living in this area receives more direct sun rays                 and the sun passes more directly overhead during the yearly cycle.                 In the Boquete area, the sun is most directly overhead in early             April and mid August of each year.
Figure             4. Tropics more direct Solar Radiation
During                 the day, the sun heats the earth most                 where the suns                 rays strike the earth most directly.  If the earth                 had no tilt, there would be a band around the center of the earth                 (between               10° N and 10° S latitudes) that would get the most direct               sun and consistently be the warmest part of the earth. However,               because the earth is tilted about 23.5° on its axis, as the               earth revolves around the sun each year, the part of the earth               that gets the most direct sunlight varies. This in large part is               what causes the seasons in the northern latitudes.
 For                   example, in the northern winter months, the tilt causes the                   suns rays to hit the earth less directly and at more of an                   angle resulting                   in less heating of the earth and cooler overall temperatures.                   In the northern summer, the sun casts its light more directly             in the north and makes for warmer temperatures.
In relationship                 to the earth, the path of the suns most direct radiation varies                 from about 23 degrees north (Tropic of Cancer) to about 23 degrees                 south (Tropic of Capricorn). If you live at latitudes greater                 than 23 degrees north or 23 degrees south, the sun is never as                   directly over your head. Yes, even in Florida or California,                   the sun is                 never directly overhead! However, if you live between 23 degrees                 north or south latitudes, the sun will be more directly over                   your head once or twice a year on the same dates depending                   on your             latitude.
Figure             5. Tilt of Earth and Seasons
 
At                 8° north latitude, Panama is close to the equator. It is                 between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn and                 gets a lot                 of sun. In April, the sun passes over Panama as               it moves on farther  north and then passes Panama overhead               again in August on its apparent journey  south.               This more direct solar radiation is the main reason that Panama's               temperatures and the tropics in general are warm with less temperature                 variation than the far northern countries.
 
The                 tilt of the earth also affects the length of the day. If the                 earth had no tilt, everyone on earth would have               12 hour days and 12 hour nights. Because of the tilt, days and               nights vary depending on your latitude. Near the equator the days               and nights are less variable in length (about 12 hours). In the               northern and southern latitudes, the length of days and nights               depend on the particular latitude where you are located and the                 particular season. You probably remember those                 long summer days                 and those                 short                 winter               days while living up north? Panama’s length of days and               nights vary slightly over the course of the year but only by a               few minutes.               Boquete  basically has about 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours               of darkness throughout the year.
 
World                 climate patterns are typically classified with the Köppen                 Climate Classification Scheme using average annual                 temperature and precipitation data. According to this system                 of               classification, Panama is a mix of “Short Dry Season” (Am)               and “Topical Wet and Dry” (AW) climates. "Am" climates               have a short dry season but sufficient moisture to keep the ground               wet throughout the year. "AW" climates have a distinct               dry season and at least one month with precipitation < 60 mm.               Here is a link to a good quality high resolution Köppen climate               map (1.9MB) with enough detail to show  that               Panama is a mix of "Am" and "AW" climates.               Figure 6 is a clip of this map. Note that the northern               most               part               of the Boquete District and the Province of Bocas del Toro   are               in the "Am" classification. The remainder of               the Boquete District is in the "AW" classification.

In                 short, when you live in Panama, you are living on a little                 piece of land with  a lot of ups and downs bathing in a large                 tub of water and basking in a whole lot of sun in                 the                 middle                 of                 the tropics! This helps to explain                 why we have much warmer               temperatures than northern countries, but it doesn't completely                 explain why we have a dry and a wet season? This comes next.

Before                 diving into the main cause of our dry and wet seasons we need                 to review a bit of basic meteorology. I will try and make this                 as painless as possible. Perhaps you should go and get another               cup of that wonderful Boquete coffee before taking the plunge                 into this section. Caffeine helps!
 
Because                 of the direct solar radiation on the earth, the land or water                 beneath it is heated and this causes the air over it to be                 heated and to rise. If the air is over large bodies of water                 like oceans               or lakes, the water evaporates                 into the air and the air becomes laden with moisture. Warm air                 holds a                 lot                 of moisture.                 The heated               air rises. As this heated moist air rises, it  eventually                 cools, the water condenses around particles and clouds are formed.                 If the clouds have a lot of moisture and and plenty of heat they                 rise higher and higher until the water condenses                 even further and it rains. The rising               of the heated air also causes  upward air movement and a lowered               air pressure closer to the earth. Where there is a lower pressure               in the atmosphere, replacement air  moves into the lower pressure                 area to try and equalize the pressure. This causes air to flow                 into                 the                 low pressure area which will  then rise upward again with moist                 air making a continuing circulating mass of air.
 
Due                 to the heat from the direct solar radiation that circles the                 equatorial zone of the earth, a lot of warm moist air rises                 in this area creating a low pressure at the surface. Air                  flows                 into                 this                 low                 pressure                 area from the                 northern hemisphere (northeasterly winds) and from the southern                  hemisphere (southeasterly winds). Where the winds come together                 (converge) the warm air rises                 upward  very high  ( troposphere )                 where it then bends and flows northward and southward                 toward the respective                 poles (see Figure 7). At about 30° north and south latitudes                 the flow of air bends downward toward the surface to lower pressure                 areas                 below and then flows back toward the equator to once again converge                 and rise. This flow of circulation  forms air cells called Hadley               Cells which generate the earth’s major air               circulation masses and related wind systems (See Figure 8 from               Lutgens and Tarbuck, 2007). These air movement systems are also               affected by the rotation of               the earth               which bends and changes               their direction ( coriolis               force ). The               circulation cells that most affect this part of the world form               the Trade Winds. In               the northern hemisphere               the               Trade               Winds begin about 30° north               latitude and blow in a northeasterly direction toward the lower               equatorial pressure.               In the southern hemisphere the Trade Winds begin about 30° south               latitude and blow in a southeasterly direction toward the lower               equatorial                pressure. Where the winds meet near the equator,               the               air               is of course heated,               the pressure lowered, and if it is over water gets filled               with moisture to rise again and continue the ongoing cell dynamics.

The                 low pressure equatorial area were the flow of northeasterly and                 southeasterly winds converge and the sun heats the land or water                 causing  moisture filled air to rise into towering cumulous clouds                 (cumulonimbus) is one of nature’s most                 powerful energy systems that fuels tropical weather. This                 system encircling the earth is called he                 Inter-Tropical                 Convergence                 Zone               (ITCZ). It is where the Trade Winds converge, pressure remains                 low, and lots of towering clouds with thunderstorms develop.                 It is an area of relative calm horizontal surface winds                 known as the “Doldrums” named               by sailors of the past because of the hot humid nonmoving air that               could stall sailing vessels for long periods. The ITCZ is an area               where there are many clouds, thunderstorms, lightning and                  heavy downpours of rain. Consequently, the ITCZ is               also               the water               system for the lush verdant belt of vegetation know as rainforests.                 The ITCZ nurses the Earth’s               Tropical Rainforests . The ITCZ  is not  a continuous band               around               the earth               but rather               a discontinuous band due to a number of factors that include the                 differing temperatures of land masses and ocean areas                  (See Figure 9 from Lutgens and Tarbuck, 2007 and figure 10).
Figure               9. ITCZ and Hadley Cells
 
Figure             10. ITCZ, Hadley Cells and Wind Systems
 
If                 the ITCZ continuously encircled the  earth                 and did not move north or south, there would be a band of                 clouds and thunderstorms stationed around the center of the earth                 in the same area                 that would generate a constant band of warmth and precipitation.                 You can think of it this way, if you were standing somewhere                 under                 such                 an ITCZ, you would be warm and get very wet! It would be hot                 and humid all the time. If you were not standing under it, but                 standing either to the north or south of this ITCZ you would                 be warm but dry.
 
Due                   to the tilt of the earth, the ITCZ is not static but migrates                   north                     and south                   over the course of the year. During the months of January and                   February, the ITCZ is in a southern most position while during                   the months                   of July and August, it is in a northernmost position (See Figure                   10). In                   Panama, the ITCZ moves south of us from December to April and                   moves upon                   us from May to November. As it leaves and moves more south                   of us, we have little or no rain – the Dry Season.                 When it moves more northerly and is closer to us or over               us, we have rain, usually in the form of thunderstorms – the               Wet Season. The                 months of April and November
Figure             10. ITCZ shift from January to July
are                 usually transition months gradually               working us into or out of the Wet Season or Dry Season respectively.
 
Here                 are a couple of useful links to  better understand the                  ITCZ ( Wikipedia , MSN                 Encarta ). The article by Dr. Brian Giles at the MSN Encarta                 Link is the best succinct description of the ITCZ that I have                 found. Below is a beautiful NASA satellite image of the ITCZ                 with                  Panama down there somewhere.  You can click on the image to download                 a higher resolution file of the image.
 
 
So                 there you have it. The ITCZ is the culprit. It is the main large                 atmospheric system that drives our wet and dry seasons. It               creates most of our tropical weather and               climate. So when it is either too dry or too wet in Boquete, you               can utter the four word curse “Inter-Tropical Convergence               Zone” or               use a four letter word "ITCZ" if you can pronounce it (It-see?).
 
Winds [ top ]
 
Another                 significant factor affecting Boquete District weather is the                 wind. At times there are winds from the north. At other                 times there are  winds from the south. While at other times,                 there are no winds. Typically, strong northerly winds occur                 during             the dry season.
 
The                 northern hemisphere Trade Winds come from the northeast as a                 result of the Hadley Cell dynamics mentioned previously. This                 is the fuel that propelled early explorers on their trade journeys                 from Europe to the Caribbean from which the name trade wind was                 derived. When they got closer to the equator in the ITCZ, they                 ran the risk                 of no                 winds                 or                 the                 so-called "Doldrums."
 
During                 the wet season, while Boquete is under the strong influence                 of the ITCZ, we are essentially in the “Doldrums” and                 generally have little to no northern wind. When the ITCZ moves                 south, we are no longer as directly under the influence of the                 ITCZ                 and become more directly bombarded by the northeast                 trade winds that are rushing toward the lower pressure of the                 ITCZ. When the ITCZ is in the most southerly position during                 the months                 of January, February and March, we experience the strongest northeastern                 winds. Boquete can be a very windy place during these months.                 This is nothing new. In 1911, the naturalist Henry Pittier                 explored Chiriqui as well as other parts of Panama and wrote                 about the adventure in a 1912 National Geographic article.                 He rode horseback from David to Boquete. His description of the                 3 day 25 mile journey is very interesting.                 He commented:
 
"Going                       north in the direction of the Chriqui Peak, one is soon                   struck by the peculiar range of low hills running, as it seems                   between                       the plains and the mountains and parallel to the sea-coast.                       The road winds between these and , mostly following the                   Dolega River, ascends gradually toward El Boquete. The general                   incline                       is so insensible that one travels nearly 25 miles before                   reaching the foot of the volcano, at an altitude of about 3000                   feet.                       The ride is mainly across savannas or through what ecologists                       call a parklike landscape.
During                   the dry season the long stretches, bare of arboreous vegetation,                       are constantly swept by the north trade wind, which attains                       its major intensity between 9 o'clock a. m. and 3 o'clock                   p.                       m., and is often of such violence that even the horses                   find it difficult to stand and to proceed on their way. Every                   detail                       of the surrounding landscape bears the impress of the wind.                       In the most exposed places the surface of the soil is submitted                       to an active aerial erosion, the minute particles of the                   ground being whisked away the moment they become loose." page                 631
 
At                   times there are breezes from the south, but they are typically                   milder than the northern trade winds. The southern breezes                   are related to sea breezes as well as southeast trade winds. Sea                   breezes are the result of the land heating                   more rapidly                   than the ocean. During the day, this causes                   the cooler air off the water to blow inland. This tends to                   push clouds inland that have formed over the water and the                   shoreline.                     Southeastern winds and sea breezes off the Pacific Ocean                   often move the towering cumulonimbus clouds from the coast                   and lowlands                   northward. Which of course, delivers the thunderstorms in the                   afternoons.
 
Yes                 folks, the bad news is that there are winds in Paradise                 as well as                 thunderstorms and             earthquakes! But the good news is that there are few to no hurricanes                 that directly hit Panama because of the routes                 that hurricanes usually take in the hurricane rich Atlantic-Caribbean                 area.  Although the paths of hurricanes north of Panama can come close and have an impact on our weather, only one, Hurricane Martha in 1969, has struck Panama during recorded weather history.
 
Orographic                     Lifting [ top ]
 
Another                 consideration in understanding Boquete weather is the effect                 that the rising terrain from David to Boquete has upon clouds.                 As air rises, it cools. The cool air cannot hold as much moisture                 and                 as the                 clouds                 laden                 with                 moisture continue to rise, the moisture condenses, thunderstorms                 develop and at a certain point buckets of rain pour forth. As                 clouds                 are                 pushed by the winds from lower to higher terrain, the clouds                 are lifted, cool and tend to drop their rain. This lifting of                 clouds over mountains is called in meteorology orographic                 lifting .                 What typically happens                 is that clouds rising over mountains drop their rain as they                 rise and then on the other side have no rain left to donate on                 the other side and there is drought on the other side (called             the "leeward side").
 
Thunderstorms [ top ]
 
Thunderstorms are the main vehicle delivering the rains to the Boquete District.                   As the earth is heated during the day, air over heated water                   gathers large amounts of moisture. As the air                   rises,                 clouds form and often evolve into the towering giant clouds called                 cumulonimbus. These clouds develop rapidly and complete their 3                   phase cycle within several hours or less (See Figure 11 below)                   Note                   that these                   clouds                   often                   reach                   to heights of over                 40,000 feet. Lightning and                 thunder are the awesome associates of these storms and harbingers                 of quick heavy rains. Typically areas                   of the world that are closest to the ITCZ have lots of thunderstorms                   and lightning                   strikes .
According                   to Lutgens and Tarbuck (2007) over 2000                   thunderstorms are in process at any given moment They                   go on to say: "...As we would expect, the greatest proportion                   occurs in the tropics, where warmth, plentiful moisture, and                   instability are always present. About 45,000 thunderstorms                   take place each day, and more than 16                   million occur annually around the world.                   The lightning from these storms strikes Earth 100 times each                   second." Panama is an area                   of the world that has numerous annual                   thunderstorms                     and                     lightning                     strikes.                     These                     are                     awesome forces                   of nature to be understood and respected. Living in Boquete,                   it is worthwhile to become educated about thunderstorms and                   be aware                     of lightning                     safety .                 Develop a healthy respect for thunderstorms.

Now                 that you know the basic facts that Panama is a small piece of                 land, surrounded by water, in a warm place called the tropics,                 with a               lurking culprit called the ITCZ (with associated thunderstorms,                 a dry season, a wet season), times of strong northerly wind,                 sea breezes, no wind, and that clouds pushed                 inland over rising terrain                 often dump rain, we can start talking more specifically about                 the Boquete area and it’s               weather! This may be a time for some more of that Boquete coffee….
 
The                     Terrain of Boquete [ top ]
 
During                 the Dry Season, the northeast trade winds come over the Caribbean                 from the northeast but their exact entry into the Boquete District                 is affected by the variations of mountain terrain elevation,                 ridges,                 and                 ravines.                 The friction from all of this variation alters                 the course of                 the winds. The surface winds from the Caribbean have to push                 upward over, around and through                 the                 saddles                 and ravines                 of the               Talamanca Range and then drop down into the bowl or "the hole" of               Bajo Boquete and on down the slope to the lowlands of David to               the south.               Their course at the surface encounters many frictions. The                 north                 winds                 vary               considerably in their strength and direction due to this geographical                 adventure. Some places in the District are very windy while                 others are not.               During               the dry season, especially the months of February and March, persistent                 northern winds bombard the Boquete District with the variations               depending upon your particular location, niche or perch. Follow                 this link for an illustration of the potential                 effects of the terrain upon the               flow               of the                 northeast trade winds through               the District of Boquete.
 
During                 the dry season, the northern winds can carry some moisture                 over the mountain range from the Caribbean Sea into the northern                 part                 of the Boquete District. This is especially the case at the higher                 elevations and into the Subdistricts of Los Naranjos,               Jaramillo and Bajo Boquete. Since the Boquete District                 is on the leeward side of the mountains relative to the Caribbean                 cloud                 systems, the moisture that gets pushed over from the Caribbean                 side usually comes in the form of a mist or light rain that is                 locally called the “bajareque.” It                 is a fine but very wet mist. Because of this dry season moisture,                 the northern part               of the Boquete District               and the Province of Bocas del Toro get more constant rains and                 are classified as Am tropical climates (short dry) rather than                 Aw                 (with wet                 and                 dry seasons) climates.
 
During                 the wet season, mornings are often clear with notable cumulonimbus                 cloud systems forming in the south over the Pacific coast-line.                  By afternoon                 these clouds become                 fully developed thunderstorm systems that often move inland (northward)                 from David pushed by southerly                 winds and sea breezes.  These                  towering systems make their climb                (orographic lifting) into the Boquete District.  They dump                 their heavy rains along the way from David and upward                 toward the Talamanca Range. A more typical day during the                 wet season in the Boquete District                 is                 to wake up               to generally clear skies and sunshine. As the day progresses, you                 see cumulous clouds developing in the south and then growing                 into towering cumulonimbus               systems. By mid afternoon, the cloud systems move into the area               and rain falls. The thunderstorm rains last for varying amounts                 of time, but usually not more than a couple of hours. Slow steady                 stratus cloud rains from from the Caribbean are                 unusual but occasionally occur during the wet season.
 
Because                 the Boquete District is a large area with a lot of variation                 in elevation and terrain, there seem to be many microclimates.                 While this makes sense and there is a lot of folklore discussion                 about these microclimates, there is not a lot of available data                 from which to                 draw solid conclusions. In                 general, public climate data (temperature and precipitation)                 for the Boquete District                 is not readily available. It is not clear if and when there were                 ever formal weather stations in the District. At present there                 are no government weather stations in this area. In preparing                 this                 paper,                 I was                 only able to find limited data from the World Climate web site                 indicating that some data was apparently collected in the past                 in the Los Naranjos Subdistrict. Data for several Panama                 cities is also available at the World Meteorological Organization                 Web Site,                 but none is specifically listed for                 the Boquete District. What                 I did find for                 David, Bocas del Toro and Los Naranjos indicates that Bocas del                 Toro                 receives                 the most                 annual                 rainfall with an average of 136 inches a year. The Caribbean                 side tends to get more warm wet air and precipitation each year.                 This is probably due to the northeast trade winds blowing over                 the Caribbean and the air masses being lifted over the north                 side                 of the Talamanca Range. Boquete is on the leeward side of this                 orographic lifting. David receives an annual average of 103                 inches. Los Naranjos receives                 98 inches             a year. To better understand the matter of microclimates in the District                 of Boquete a more formal investigation is needed. Weather stations                 need to be strategically placed in each of the 6 Subdistricts                 and data collected over an extended period of several years to                 determine the realities of microclimates. Until that is done,                 whatever information there is about microclimates is unreliable                 hearsay.
 
Monitoring                       Boquete Weather [ top ]
 
Currently,                 there is no official government weather station in the Boquete                 area that reports weather conditions.               The closest published weather station is in David at the                 airport. Interestingly, the David station does not report                 precipitation. There is no doppler radar. While David weather                 is of interest in                 understanding what is going on in the Chiriqui area and may give                 some indication of what may be moving north, it                 doesn't                 deliver any specific useful information for the geologically                 highly varied Boquete District.
 
Panama                 appears to have a very limited system of weather stations                 and reporting. There is basically no government weather agency.                 Weather stations in Panama are managed by the electrical company ETESA                  (Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica,                 S.A.,                  Gerencia de Hidrometeorología). At their website they have information about Panama climate and daily forecasts. It is not clear what methods they are using to make thier predictions. They have recently greatly improved their website so that is functional and provides more information. You can read               their statement of activities and functions at this link .                 It is not clear
 
To                 monitor weather in this area, we have to rely heavily upon the                 highly developed weather services out of North American and Europe.                 The United States has the most highly developed weather monitoring                 and forecasting system ( NWS )                 in the world. The reasons for this are many but include the safety                 of aviation and marine operations                 and the prevention of storm hazards.  Because the continental                 U.S. is large and has a number of potential types of storm hazards                 (e.g. floods,                 blizzards, tornados, thunderstorms, hurricanes) it needs a good                 weather agency that can collect data and develop reliable prediction                 models. Because of all of this they are heavily invested in monitoring             and forecasting weather. They have over 850 Automated Weather Observation                 Systems ( AWOS ),  155 WSR-88D                 Doppler Radar Sites , and a host                 of weather satellites with various remote sensors. The annual                 budget of NOAA and the NWS is                 more than the total annual budget of Panama!
 
Because                   the U.S. is particularly vulnerable to the devastating effect                   of natures biggest and most powerful storms, hurricanes, especially                   in                   the                     North Atlantic-Caribbean area and the Eastern Pacific Ocean,                   a very elaborate technical system is in place to monitor and                   forecast                     tropical storms. If this were not                   the case, we would                     have                     very                     little                     weather information available                     to                     us in Panama                     to monitor                     the weather. You will quickly note that most of                   the links                     to weather information for this web site link to U.S. weather                 resources especially those related to remote satellite imaging                   and sensing.
 
There                 are several private weather stations in the District of Boquete.                 Two are online (Palmira & Santuario) and links are                 provided at this web site. I know of other stations                  but I don't think they are online. If you know of others, let                 me know and I will add                 the links.
 
A                   note of caution is in order regarding private weather stations.                   Private weather stations vary considerably in placement, price                   and quality. Calibration of the sensors may or may not occur.                   Consequently, the reliability of information from private stations                   can vary not only due to station location and microclimates,                   but also due to the quality of equipment, its calibration and                   maintenance. When checking the readings of private stations                   consider all of this and use the data with caution. Check and                   note when the data was last updated. If the station doesn't                   indicate when the information was last updated don't trust                   it. Also, if the data doesn't make sense don't trust it. When                   you note problems, be sure to contact the station operator             for clarification and rectification.
 
Forecasting [ top ]
 
The                   first step in forecasting weather requires the collection of                   accurate data with good weather stations. Without good sensors                   and reliable data, it is not possible to develop forecasting                   models.                   In other                   words,                   no                   good data -- no good forecasting! Consequently, it is currently                   very difficult to accurately forecast weather here in Panama.                   There are too few and inadequate stations sensing data to develop                   reliable forecasts. Another challenge is that tropical forecasting                   is inherently difficult.                   Added to this is the fact that thunderstorms are rapidly developing                   and moving focal systems that can only be studied and tracked                   with doppler radar sites. In addition to  several                   quality weather stations, 1 or 2 doppler radar sites are needed                   in Chiriqui to monitor                     and forecast the weather associated with the many thunderstorms.                     In the guide section of this web                     site, I discuss how I monitor and forecast the weather using                     the weather                     products that are available                 locally and in the U.S. via the internet. I am gradually learning                     more about the daily ebb and flow of weather here and how                     to forecast the happenings. I will post climate data as it                     accrues.
 
Summary [ top ]
 
There                   you have it. The cat is out of the bag! The major                         factors causing the  weather and climate                         of the District of Boquete are the location of Panama                       in the Tropics, a small package of land surrounded by a                       lot of water, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, thunderstorms                       and the lifting of air over terrain (orographic lifting).                       The dry and wet seasons are a direct result of the shifting               of the ITCZ north and south over the course of the year.
