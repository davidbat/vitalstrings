 
Extreme Weather and Climate Change
With recent extreme weather events, many people are asking about the connection between single events and climate change. However, that is not the question we should be asking. When we ask if climate change “caused” a particular event, we pose a fundamentally unanswerable question. This assures that we will often fail to draw connections between individual weather events and climate change, leading us to disregard the real risks of more extreme weather due to global warming. Given the uncertainties and risks, it does not make sense to focus on whether individual events are supercharged by climate change. Instead we should take lessons from actual events about our current vulnerabilities and the risks to society caused by unabated greenhouse gas emissions that drive extreme weather risks ever higher over time.
Scientific American Series on Extreme Weather, Climate Change, and the Risks We Face
Published in three parts in June 2011, these articles by science journalist John Carey provide insights and eye-witness accounts of recent record-breaking weather events and the link to climate change, the science behind it all, and what can be done to manage the growing risks.
