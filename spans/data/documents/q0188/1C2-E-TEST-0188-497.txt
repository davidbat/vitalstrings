Runoff from                     the rains in the jungle and hills can turn the seawater  brown in some areas, mainly around rivers and streams, detracting                     somewhat from the beauty of  the beaches and the bay. Temperatures                     reach 90ºF (32ºC) during  the summer, and the humidity                     can add to the perception of  heat.
During the winter,                     the local weather changes significantly and temperatures are in the                     low to mid 80's ºF (28 - 30ºC), quite comfortable for a stroll                     on the beach and around town.

What's the Puerto Vallarta weather like in January, May, or December?
December, January and February: During the day  weather is  temperate and                      you can easily wear light clothes. Warmer clothes at night during                      this, the local winter, this could be a light sweater, a cotton jacket or a long-sleeve shirt, but if you are from a cold climate, you'll be fine with short sleeves. Temperatures  start to diminish before sundown, around                      6PM or 7PM until 8AM aprox., when the sun comes  up again.
March, April, May and June: Use very light clothes, this period is hotter than the previous period, there's normally some  wind, specially in March so skirts                      can be unconfortable, specially short and light skirts.
July, August, September to Mid-October: Vallarta's rainy season begins, bring rain clothes along, maybe better to consider                       umbrellas, because the heat can be quite uncomfortable for those not accoustomed to humid heat. You can buy a cheap chinese umbrella on the street if needed. The weather, as mentioned is quite hot and humid during these months.
Temperatures go up to around                      32 - 34 ºC (90 - 93ºF) on some days, specially                      during August and September and it is very humid, expect to sweat quite a bit, so bring extra shirts or blouses, cold showers will be a regular treat during the day. Avoid silky fabrics as they will get humid and stick to your body, this is quite disagreable (you can see it has happened to me :-)). A good tip is to bring a water spray along to cool down.
Mid-October, November till the beginning                      of December: Puerto Vallarta's weather once again starts to become temperate, rains stop,                      there is very little breeze. Light summer clothes are                      recommended and at night you can also use long sleeve                      blouses or shirts when going out to a restaurant or                      bar.
