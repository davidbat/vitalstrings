 
Temperature in Ireland
Air temperatures are measured at a height of approximately       1.2 m above a flat surface which is covered with short grass. The thermometers       are housed in a white painted wooden louvred shelter known as a Stevenson       Screen.
The moderating influence of the Atlantic is felt throughout Ireland.             The country therefore does not experience the same range of temperatures             throughout the year as more continental countries do. Although our             inland stations show more variation, even at these there is only             about one day or less per year when the air temperature stays below             freezing point. Minimum air temperature falls below zero on about             40 days per year at the inland stations, but on less than 10 days             per year in most coastal areas. Air temperatures inland normally             reach 18 to 20 °C during summer days, and about 8 °C             during wintertime.
Some of these variations are shown graphically in the diagrams for             Dublin (east coast), Valentia Observatory (southwest coast) and Birr             (inland). In these graphs the solid bars show the difference between             the mean daily minimum and maximum for the month in question and             the thinner lines indicate the range of daily minima and maxima observed             over a thirty year period. The graphs are based on daily reports             from 1971 to 2000 inclusive.
Regarding extremes, the highest air temperature recorded in Ireland             was + 33.3°C at Kilkenny Castle 26th June 1887. The record maximum             during the 20th century is +32.5°C at Boora, Co. Offaly on 29th             June 1976. The lowest air temperature was -19.1°C measured at             Markree Castle, Co. Sligo on 16th January 1881 while the lowest observed             20th century air temperature was -18.8°C recorded at Lullymore,             Co. Kildare on 2nd January 1979. The lowest observed grass minimum             temperature was -19.6°C at Dublin (Glasnevin) on 12th January             1982 which was almost matched by the -19.5°C measured at Lullymore,           Co. Kildare on 2nd January 1979.
