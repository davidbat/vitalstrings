Climate in Tropical Rainforest
     Most people think all rainforests have warm, sunny weather, but they're wrong. Only the      rainforests that are located in the tropics, or ten degrees within the equator have      year-round warm weather. Subtropical rainforests that lay outside of the tropics have      seasonal changes in their weather. There are a couple of types of rainforests. and they      are categorized by the types of weather they have during the year and where they are      located. The names of these rainforests are monsoon, equatorial, and subtropical.
     The tropical rain forest is a very wet      environment, as you hear from the name that contains "rain". The total rainfall      for the year is between 1500 and 2500 mm. There is no dry season. Rain falls nearly every      day. The temperature during the day is around 30ºC - 35ºC. At night it drops to      between 20ºC - 25ºC. There is a little difference between the warmest and the      coolest months. The relative humidity is always high. This type of climate in the tropical      rain forest is known as equatorial climate.
     The result of all of      this rain, is that the rainforest is filled head to toe with lush green vegetation. Many      trees in the rainforest have canopies on them, providing shade for the animals and plants.      The canopies help shield the plants and animals from the scorching sunlight. The      rainforests are very humid due to the warm sunlight, rain and the canopies shading over      the plants keeps in the moisture.
