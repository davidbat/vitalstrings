May 29 2012 Great Lakes Echo One Comment
 
By Sam Inglot and Kam Moore
Every Monday Great Lakes Echo runs video clips of random people answering questions that experts believe environmentally literate citizens should understand. In the last clip an expert explains the correct answers.
This week’s question: “What’s the difference between climate and weather?”
 
This week’s expert is Jeff Andresen , the climatologist for the state of Michigan and an associate professor of geography at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich.
Andresen specializes in agricultural meteorology and applied climatology.

Very good. I love this series. It challenges me to put into words the topics I think are so obvious in my head.
Keep it up! Can’t wait for next week’s question.
