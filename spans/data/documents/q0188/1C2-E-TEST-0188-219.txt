Egypt Weather and Climate
Egypt weather is generally hot and dry, with hardly any rain or clouds.            November through to January are definitely the most comfortable months            for Egypt travel. Days are commonly warm or hot, and nights are cool.
Egypt has only two seasons: a mild winter from November            to April and a hot summer from May to October. The only differences            between the seasons are variations in daytime temperatures and changes            in prevailing winds.
In Cairo, temperatures can rise as high as 95째F in summer            and drop to as low as 45째F in winter. Farther south, the country becomes            hotter.
Alexandria,            in the north, enjoys much milder weather than the rest of the country.            Here, the highest temperature throughout the year will not usually be            more than the mid 80s, and the cool breezes of the Mediterranean make            even the hottest days pleasant.
Winters in Aswan are pleasantly warm, but summer temperatures            can reach 107째F.
Egypt            Geography Facts
Tip from INFOHUB :            Egypt's traditional season runs from late November to late February            , when the Nile Valley is balmy, although Cairo can be overcast and            chilly. However, at these times, particularly during the peak months            of December and January, the major Nile resorts of Luxor and Aswan get            unpleasantly crowded. This winter season is also the busiest period            for the Sinai resorts, while Hurghada is active year round. From May            to September the south and desert are ferociously hot and sightseeing            is best limited to early morning or evening - though August still sees            droves of backpackers From October into early November is perhaps the            best time of all, with easily manageable climate and crowds.
An Egypt weather phenomenon called the khamsin brings very high temperatures            out of the Sahara Desert to the coast between March and June. The dust            winds form in small but vigorous low-pressure areas in the Isthmus of            Suez and sweep across the northern coast of Africa. Unobstructed by            geographical features, the winds reach high velocities and carry great            quantities of sand and dust from the deserts. These sandstorms, often            accompanied by winds of up to 140 kilometers per hour, can cause temperatures            to rise as much as 68째 F in two hours. The winds blow intermittently            and may continue for days, cause illness in people and animals, harm            crops, and occasionally damage houses and infrastructure.
Tip from INFOHUB :            Both decent lip balms and sunscreens are hard to find in most areas            of the world, so bring enough to last you for the whole journey. Take            into account that sunscreens work by penetrating the skin to create            a barrier, while insect repellents work by evaporation, so you should            apply the sunscreen first. Do not use old sunscreens, because sunscreens            more than 2-3 years old have lost their effectiveness.
The best way to deal with Egypt weather conditions is to dress with            lightweight cotton or linen garments during summers. Wool fabrics are            ideal for winter and cool evenings. Do bring sunscreen, sunglasses and            a sturdy hat. Drink plenty of water, too.
