Hawaii               air temperatures follow a seasonal pattern. At sea level, the all day average
air temperature varies from about 78 degrees in August to 72 degrees in February.
Temperature varies depending                 on location.
There are two main factors: Altitude and exposure of the area to               prevailing winds.
The prevailing winds are from the northeast. The northeast side of each               island
is called the windward side. The windward side of each island tends to               be cooler and wetter.
The high temperatures here rarely reach 90° F.
The leeward side is warmer and drier, Temperatures exceed 90° F               several days a year.
The           temperatures at altitudes below 1000 feet very rarely drop to 50° F           .
Above 8000 feet, there is occasional freezing and even snow.
Precipitation
Snow is rare in Hawaii, but does                   occur at very high elevations, above 8000 feet.
Rain:           Offshore, the rainfall is about 25 inches a year. As the warm, moist air passes
over the islands, it must rise and cool as it passes over the hills and           mountains. As it cools,
water condenses. Therefore, the amount of rain depends strongly on           location.
Hawaii's winds usually come from the Northeast. As those trade winds           rise they drop water
on the land beneath them. Therefore, the windward side of the islands           have much more rain
than the leeward sides. In general, the closer you are to the mountains           on the windward side
( usually the northeast ), the wetter it is.
The air, having lost much of its water on the windward side, and               warming again as it moves
down the leeward side of the mountains, clears up. It's clouds               dissipate and the rainfall
diminishes. The driest and sunniest places in Hawaii are close to the               ocean on the leeward ( usually southwest ) side of any island.
The           rainiest season of the year, in most places, is winter. The seasonal           difference is greatest
at moderate elevations, and small at elevations above 2000 feet.
Rain           may be           very heavy at times. Floods are not uncommon near rivers on the           windward
side of islands.
Winds
The trade winds that flow over and               around the                 Hawaiian islands most of the time, must pass
over mountains and through valleys. These winds are usually above 12                 mile per hour.
As they encounter these obstacles, wind speeds are increased as they                 pass through valleys
and their direction changes as eddies form. Winds may be gusty, strong                 and unpredictable
as a result. Winds above 60 miles per hour are rare Hawaii weather                 events, occurring only about
every five years.
Hurricanes rarely hit Hawaii. Damaging hurricanes               that              do               significant               damage
have been separated by about 10 years on the average. Hawaiian               hurricanes are usually
generated between Hawaii and Baja California.
The most recent severe hurricane, Iniki, struck Kauai and parts of Oahu               in 1991.
