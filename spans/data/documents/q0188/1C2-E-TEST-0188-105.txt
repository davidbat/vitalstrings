What is the difference between weather and climate?
Climate is what you expect, like a very hot summer, and weather is what you get on a particular day, like a hot day with pop-up thunderstorms.
Weather is the current condition of the atmosphere at a particular time and place. It can change rapidly and may only affect a limited area. Climate, on the other hand, is the average temperature, precipitation, wind and other weather factors of a large area, taken over a long period of time.
The main difference between weather and climate is that weather may fluctuate on a daily or even hourly basis, but climate remains relatively constant over decades, centuries or longer.
If it’s raining on a particular day then we are talking about the weather but if it’s raining over a season for several years then we are talking of the climate.
Overall, the difference between weather and climate is time. Weather happens daily and climate happens over longer periods.
