The difference :
In this animated short, the relationship between trend and variation are explained with an excellent analogy to a man walking his dog. There is much more variation in the path that the dog takes as compared with the man, but they are both headed the same way. Similarly, weather can be highly variable and climate means long term trends.
I heard that a kitten dies every time a news anchor debunks global warming with an unexpected day of snow.
