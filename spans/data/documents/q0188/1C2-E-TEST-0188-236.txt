Climate Basics
First a definition... What the heck is a climate? Is it weather? Is it the rain? Is it a hot day in August? Yes, yes and yes, but only in one place at a time. Climate is the atmospheric condition in a certain location near the surface of the Earth. Is the Aurora Borealis (Northern lights) a climate? No. Is there such a thing as a global climate? Yes. Kind of. It's all of the climates of the planet added up. If the Earth were getting hotter you would have to say, "All of the global climates are increasing in temperature."
