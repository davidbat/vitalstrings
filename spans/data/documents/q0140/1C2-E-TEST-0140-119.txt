We are located on the    beautiful Central Oregon Coast, just 8 miles North of Florence. We would    like to invite you out to enjoy the amazing sights and sounds of the    Oregon beaches with us!  Were just a phone call away to set up a    reservation.
C&M Stables  offers a variety of horseback riding experiences. Choose a riding adventure that    fits your style!
Beach rides begin by riding on a trail leaving the corral that takes  approximately
25 to 35 minutes to get to the beach. The trail will take you out  through the
scenic dunes and through the coastal pines. As you get closer to the
beach,  you will hear the powerful Pacific Ocean waves pounding  the
surf and you will smell the incredible salt air. Suddenly,  you are on
the beach for a breathtaking ride along the  shoreline.
