Welcome To Seaside Beach Volleyball
Join us for some good green fun!
Players and spectators  enjoy the clear ocean air of one of the World’s most beautiful beaches as described by National Geographic. The beach is home to the Seaside Beach Volleyball Tournament to be played for the 30th consecutive year in August of 2011. It is the largest amateur beach volleyball tournament in the world with over 800 teams playing on 100 plus courts. Divisions range from parent and child to Masters 55+, along with our Men, Women and Co-ed Open Divisions that feature current and retired AVP ranked players. Seaside Beach Volleyball is consistently the highest ranked and most visited amateur beach volleyball tournament around! Our teams travel from as far as the East Coast and Hawaii as well as Canada. Our tournament is known throughout the beach volleyball world and is mentioned by many AVP players as “the one to go to.” And, Seaside Beach Volleyball is as organic as it comes… no bleachers, no required team shirts, no plastic clapping devices and no entry fee for spectators! Best of all when the tournament is over there is no trace of it left on the clean white sands. NEW DIVISIONS THIS YEAR INCLUDE Men’s/Women’s B & BB Doubles, Masters 55+ Doubles, Coach/Player and Parent/Child Advanced 2′s Division
