Assessing the            Temporal and Spatial Variability of Coastal Change on the Central and Northern Oregon Coast
 
During the 1997-98 and 1998-99 winters, the Pacific Northwest (PNW)            coasts of Oregon and Washington were subjected to some of the largest            wave heights observed during the past three decades.  These storms resulted in significant erosion            and damage to properties and infrastructure along many            parts of the PNW coast1.  For example, beaches in the            Rockaway littoral cell (between Cape Meares and Neahkahnie Mountain)            lost approximately 1.8 million m3 of sand, while home owners            spent about $1 million on coastal engineering to mitigate the erosion. 
To understand the effects (erosion or accretion) of future storms,            particularly during major El Niños,            and to improve our understanding of long-term coastal change due to sea            level rise and climate change, staff from the Newport Coastal Field Office of the Oregon Department of Geology              and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) , are developing an "Oregon Beach and            Shoreline Mapping and Analysis Program (OBSMAP)" to document the spatial variability of beach            change at various time-scales (i.e. seasonal, multi-year and long-term            changes).  The broad purpose of this work is to provide            high-quality scientific information of the changing face of the Oregon            coast, which can meet the needs of coastal managers, city and county            planners, the geotechnical community and the public-at-large.
The development of OBSMAP has been achieved through collaborative            efforts as part of the development of the Northwest Association of Networked              Ocean Observing System (NANOOS) , whose primary mission is to "...develop, implement, and integrate the various in-water and              land-based systems that will constitute a fully robust and user-driven              Regional Coastal Ocean Observing System (RCOOS),...to provide PNW, west              coast, and national stakeholders with the ocean data, tools, and              knowledge they need to make responsive and responsible decisions              appropriate to their individual and collective societal roles."  Other key partners include the Coastal Management Program (OCMP) of the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Oregon Parks and Recreation              Department (OPRD) , the Washington Department of Ecology, and Oregon            State University.
