World Wildlife Fund: Plight Of The Penguins: WWF Report Shows Climate Change Likely To Imperil Penguin Populations
Humboldt squid, also known as Jumbo squid , are large sea creatures that can grow up to seven feet long and weigh more than 110 pounds, writes The Associated Press. The species has proven to be an “aggressive predator,” capable of altering its diet to compete with tuna and sharks.
In July 2007, the squid invaded waters off the coast of central California, wreaking havoc on anchovy, hake and other local fish populations.

In July, AP reported that more than 400 baby penguins washed up dead on the tropical beaches of Rio de Janeiro, having likely been swept away from their Antarctic home by ocean currents. Some biologists attributed the problem to pollution and overfishing, which forces penguins out of their comfort zone and leaves them more vulnerable to currents. But others, including Erli Costa of Rio’s Federal University, blamed weather patterns.
“I think instead we're seeing more young and sick penguins because of global warming, which affects ocean currents and creates more cyclones, making the seas rougher,” Costa said.
The situation repeated itself in late September when temperate Patagonian penguins from the southern tip of Argentina began washing up on Rio de Janeiro beaches, “ many emaciated or deceased ,” according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The influence of climate change “is unclear” with regard to the penguins’ movement, but “some scientists have speculated that changes in ocean currents or temperatures, which may be related to climate change, could be responsible.”
