Oregon Beach Monitoring Program
Recreational Water Quality at Oregon Beaches
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) partners with the Department of Human Services (DHS) to monitor the waters along Oregon's coastline. The monitoring is funded by annual grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Marine waters are tested for enterococcus bacteria, which indicates the presence of other harmful microbes. Enterococcus is present in human and animal waste and can enter marine waters from a variety of sources such as streams and creeks, storm water runoff, animal and seabird waste, failing septic systems, sewage treatment plant spills, or boating waste.
From May through September, the DEQ typically collects water samples at 25 beaches and 75 to 100 locations. In winter, 13 beaches are monitored at 45 locations. Beach selection is based on use, pollution hazards, previous monitoring data, and public input. The sampling plan is re-evaluated every other year.
The DEQ and DHS also work with nonprofit groups such as Surfrider and Earth 911. In fact, the current status of Oregon ocean beaches is mapped on the Earth 911 website, linked below.
