With such natural beauty, Oregon is sure to please all visitors in all seasons. Known for its cliffs and rocky shores, cliff divers find paradise here.

Oregon is also known for its rich Native American history and culture. Share in the celebration of these great people with the museums dedicated solely to them, such as the Museum of Western Art and Artifacts. Let Oregon be your next vacation destination.
