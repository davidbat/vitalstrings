A.N. Armstrong is quoted in History of Oregon as having journeyed along the coast in Tillamook County in the 1850's, employed by the Oregon Surveyor General. About Oceanside, he writes that after leaving Cape Lookout at North Latitude 45ยบ34ยบ along the beach trail to Tillamook, "you cross a very high, rugged mountainside, so that it is with the greatest difficulty that mules can pass at all; an animal losing his foothold here would have a clear fall of 300 feet."
In the late 1800's John W. Maxwell, a veteran of the Illinois Cavalry, purchased and homesteaded the entire area where "The Village" now sits. The Maxwell children attended a school located on Bayocean Spit and the family had friends who lived in a big house and owned a razor clam canning factory, both located on Netarts Spit. None of which exist today. The clam cannery business was ruined when the ocean took all the sand away and left a rocky shore. Now over a hundred years later Netarts Spit is again a sandy beach.
