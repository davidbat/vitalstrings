Cannon Beach & Seaside Oregon. April 2012 Tides
These Seaside & Cannon Beach tides are referenced from NOAA's 2012 tidal predictions at the Necanicum River's 12th Avenue Bridge Station in Seaside, Oregon (Units: Feet, Time Zone: LST/LDT). This is the closest official reference station to Seaside, Arch Cape, Manzanita, Cannon Beach & surrounding areas of the Oregon coast.
The tidal predictions below are more relevant to this area than those whose local websites take their numbers from the Columbia river entrance in Astoria. The massive volume of (salt & fresh) water at the Columbia river entrance, the ocean tides & the ever shifting sand bars at the mouth of the Columbia make for vastly different tidal behaviors - than those at Seaside, Cannon Beach, Arch Cape & Manzanita.
The 6th through the 10th of April provide this month's highest tides in the (very) early am hours from Saturday the 7th through Monday the 10th. The best time for (healthy) beach walks, photography, gathering shells & jetsam will be in the mornings from Friday the 6th thru Thursday the 12th & again on Saturday the 21st thru Wednesday the 25th. Certainly the weekend ofÂ  the 7th and 8th will afford magical marine salt water rock pools, low tide photos, walks north through Chapman point to Ecola Park & other great vacation times for all your Oregon coast beach activities.
