Nine miles of wide, walkable beach invite                  visitors to Cannon Beach. The scenic beauty of the seastacks offshore                  and headlands onshore make your stroll down the sand particularly                  memorable. Fly a kite, watch the sea creatures in the tidepools,                  or take pictures of famous Haystack Rock. Relaxing on the beach                  is part of the Cannon Beach experience.
The arts are emphasized in Cannon Beach,                  and some of the best crafts, shopping and galleries on the coast                  are located here. The city is planned for strolling, and many                  visitors take advantage of this to visit the quaint bookstores,                  shops and bistros. Strict planning regulations have helped Cannon                  Beach keep its earth toned, rustic look.
Cannon Beach was named for a cannon that                  was discovered on the beach. In 1846, the U.S. Navy schooner Shark was wrecked while trying to leave the Columbia River. A large                  piece of the schooner's deck with a cannon and capstan attached                  washed up on the beach, and the town's name is based on this event
Haystack Rock, at 235 feet high, is the third largest coastal monolith in the world. Haystack Rock is protected  as part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge as well as a designated  National Wilderness Area. This 235 foot  tall basalt monolith is located on the scenic Cannon Beach on the  northern Oregon coast.  The area below the rock is  referred to as a Marine Garden. The  boundaries of this area are between the extreme high tide line and extreme low  tide line within a 300 yard radius from the base of Haystack Rock. That's the length of three football fields! The tidepools in the Marine Garden are dynamic areas rich with marine life such as seastars, anemones,  crabs, algae, and many others.  Collecting is strictly prohibited and it is crucial to be aware and use  extreme caution while walking in these areas.  The marine life in and around the Marine Garden is very vulnerable to  human disturbance, and research shows that in a small area everything can be  killed with just 200 steps an hour. So  please be careful and try to walk only on bare rock. Barnacles are animals too!
In addition to the diverse ecosystem of the rocky intertidal, Haystack Rock is a vital habitat for an abundance of seabirds.  Here there over 2,000 seabirds that nest on Haystack Rock each year.  While viewing the rock from shore you might see the Tufted puffin, Pigeon guillemot, Black oystercatcher, Pelagic cormorant and others.  These birds are extremely sensitive to human disturbance.  Getting too close to them can result in nest abandonment, dead chicks, and failure to reproduce.  Climbing is not allowed anywhere on Haystack Rock, not only for the safety of the birds but for your safety as well!  Federal and state law requires boats to remain at least 500 feet away and any aircraft (including gliders) must stay at a minimum of 2,000 ft. AGL.  As one of the Oregon Coast's most popular destinations, Haystack Rock provides amazing opportunities to see all kinds of marine wildlife in their natural habitat.  So please be mindful when enjoying this    spectacular Oregon treasure.
For hikers, there are many trails to the                  water through the thick conifer forests of Ecola State Park. Ecola                  Point, near Ecola State Park, has a viewpoint and picnic area,                  where you can see the whole panorama of Cannon Beach, Haystack                  Rock and the Coast Range. This spectacular view is one of the                  most photographed on the Oregon coast. A two mile trail connects                  Ecola point to horseshoe shaped Indian Beach, and a six mile trail                  leads on to Tillamook Head.
