With the distinctive Haystack Rock and Needles marking its shoreline, Cannon Beach is one of Oregon's quaintest and most picturesque destinations. Nine miles of beach make a perfect setting for strolling along the seaside, watching diverse wildlife in its natural habitat and building a sand castle in the annual sand castle building contest. With strict regulations in place limiting the infiltration of large chain stores or restaurants, Cannon Beach retains its small town charm.
