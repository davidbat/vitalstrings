The Oregon Coast is proof of the Northwest's amazing diversity. Stretching from the port   town of Astoria , at the windy mouth of   the Columbia River, south to the temperate shores of Brookings/Harbor at   the California border, Oregon's 350-mile coastline is anything but   mundane. Populated by small and mid-size towns that have come to be   known for their remote, resort-like atmosphere and their defiant ability   to endure Mother Nature's coastal tempests, the Oregon Coast region is   in many ways, a world unto itself.
While good roads link U.S. Highway 101 (the coast's major highway) with   Highway 5 and cities like Portland and Eugene , getting to some parts   of the coast can take a bit of time. The southern towns of Port Orford and   Pistol River, which are separated from Highway 5 by the formidable Oregon   Coast Range, can only be accessed via a northern or southern route. But   then, experiencing the drive to Oregon's more remote locations is part of   experiencing her beauty.
Weather on the Oregon Coast can also be variable. While it is possible to   see snow in Astoria and Warrenton during the months of January or February, temperatures in Gold Beach and Coos Bay rarely dip below freezing   during the winter. Rain however, is a fact of life up and down the   coast, which supports a lush and fertile ecosystem and is bordered by   temperate rainforest.
Oregon's coastal cities have a rhythm and pace all of their own.   Restaurants, festivals, activities and attractions often reflect the   ecological ties of a given area. It is difficult to experience Gold Beach   without experiencing a river ride, or to understand coastal history without   visiting one of the many wind-buffeted lighthouses. To experience the Oregon   Coast is to experience the very elements that have shaped its history - and   its awe-inspiring beauty.
