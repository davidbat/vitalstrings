September 7, 2007 ~ Back on the beaches  of Port Orford :  A couple of years ago I sold my Elk River home and moved away from the Oregon  Coast so we could be closer to family.  Fortunately I still own a hill that  sits above Port Orford, this latest Oregon Pics feature highlights some of the  photos from our recent visit.
August 19, 2004 ~ Bandon's Face Rock Beach :  Jerry and I took a trip to Coos Bay, on our way home we stopped  at Face Rock Beach in Bandon and took some late afternoon pictures of this  beautiful beach.  Bandon has many great state park beaches and Face Rock  Beach is one of our favorites.  Check out our pictures and you'll see why.
August 10, 2004 ~ Pelicans in Orford  Cove .  We normally don't see a whole lot of Pelicans here in Port Orford but on this beach walk there were several dozen of the big majestic birds  here.  Check out the action shots of pelicans feeding along the surfline.
August 4,  2004 ~ Seabirds Feeding in Port Orford Cove .  I came across an unusual scene during a recent visit to Port Orford's Battle  Rock Beach.  The Port Orford Cove was filled with hundreds of various  seabirds feeding on a large school of fish that had congregated close to the  shoreline.
