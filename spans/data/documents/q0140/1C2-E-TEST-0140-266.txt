Over 200 members of the Gold Beach Chamber of Commerce welcome you to our website and to discovering this small seaside community we call home.
Gold Beach is located in the heart of what some refer to as the "banana belt" of the Pacific Northwest, which means our year-round climate is more temperate than anywhere else on the coast.  It's where the pristine Rogue River meets the majestic Pacific Ocean.  Beautiful trees, mountains, rivers, beaches and the ocean define our landscape.  We welcome the opportunity to share it with you - for a day or as long as you like.  Our summers offer pleasant temperatures of 65 to 70 degrees, sunny days, and beautiful evening skies for stargazing.  If you're a storm watcher, our winter months are for you.  While you're here, look for migrating whales, fish for salmon or steelhead, wind surf or just walk our beaches.  Our innkeepers are here to make sure you have a cozy place to stay, our fine restaurants are ready to serve up culinary delights and our art galleries, book stores, outdoor shops and other business owners are ready to make your stay enjoyable and memorable.
We hope you'll take time to learn more about the business community that helps make Gold Beach so special to the people that reside and visit here.   If you don't find what you're looking for on this website, give us a call.  We are serious about making your stay here one of the best experiences you've ever had.
