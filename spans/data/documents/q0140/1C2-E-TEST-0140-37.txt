Northern Oregon Coast • Central Oregon Coast • Southern Oregon Coast
The Southern Oregon Coast includes North Bend through Brookings on NWcoast.com.  This coastline doesn't get quite the same attention as the North and Central Coast of Oregon from visitors, but it is mostly a factor of driving distance rather than beauty or amenities.  North Bend and Coos Bay is rich with history; an old Mill town that even today continues to be a mixture of work and play.  You can enjoy the Mill Casino, or drive west to Charleston and visit some spectacular spots on the Pacific Ocean.
Further south you will find Bandon, which is host to Bandon Dunes, a world-class golf resort. Next you come to Port Orford and Gold Beach: This area offers parks and trails that roll high above the ocean giving sight to breathtaking scenery that is screaming, "take a picture!"  On the far end of the Southern Oregon Coast is Brookings.  Here you will find beautiful beach while you are just a hop skip and a jump from the California Border and unbelievable Old Growth Forests!
