been thinking about years of memories going to the beach with our family. Would love to spend time on the Oregon coast right now!

Wonder if anyone can help me - i'm trying to remember the name of a lil lodging place we saw - i think it was north of newport and south of the lighthouse..  and we saw it walking up the steep hill from agate beach i think.  It's a lil cluster of like seven small identical lil cottage cabins - three or four of which have west facing porches and a few more face north.  It had a kinda regular name like ocean shores or something - help me remember!

Beautiful photos! They are a perfect representation of just how beautiful the Oregon Coast really is (especially Central Coast)
