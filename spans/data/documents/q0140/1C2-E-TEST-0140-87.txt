Newport, OR (June 20, 2012)  The Surfrider Foundation’s Newport Chapter, joined by their Siuslaw and Portland Chapters hosted over 120 kids and 51 competitors for the 4th annual Otter Rock n’ Roll Youth Surf and Beach Cleanup Challenge in celebration of International Surfing Day.  Observed globally, International Surfing Day celebrates the sport of surfing and helps raise awareness about issues facing our oceans, waves and beaches.
The 18 and under surf contest and beach cleanup challenge
kicked off Saturday with spectacular weather, and clear and sunny skies in the protected pocket of Otter Rock/Devil’s Punchbowl State Park. Beachgoers and contest organizers agreed the conditions could not have been much better, save a little fog that crept up in the late afternoon. Kids from two to eighteen competed in various age divisions with the “Parent with Child” division being the most popular with 18 parent/child teams. The beach cleanup challenge, a popular way for the non-surfing beachgoers to participate, awarded prizes for best beach trash art, biggest marine debris haul, weirdest piece of debris, largest piece of foam and many other categories. The challenge teaches stewardship and awareness of marine debris, while rewarding and reinforcing the cleanup behaviors.
The Newport Chapter is extremely grateful to our local sponsors who make this fun, family event so special for our community - Ocean Pulse, Ossie’s Surf Shop, Oregon Surf Shop, Pura Vida Surf Shop, Warm Current, Cleanline Surf Shop Eon Graphics, Bike Newport, Cascade Construction, Savory Café, Coast Home Repair, Dutch Brothers  Newport, Reef and Von Zipper.

Brazilian filmmaker Loic Wirth aims to release Intentio in May
In his own mature-beyond-his-21-years words...
The funny thing about fairy tales, is that we forget about them so fast
And we grow up, we buy things, we build up fences
We sell our innocence and forget our dreams
We forget who we are in order to be something we're not
And we'll keep believing in this so called truths, until we forget how to live
Or until we open our eyes, and wake up.
This is a trailer for Intentio, a full length project I'm working on...
