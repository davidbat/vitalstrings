Wind-sculpted sand dunes towering to 500 feet above sea level provide numerous recreational opportunities including off-highway vehicle use, hiking, photography, fishing, canoeing, horseback riding and camping. Visitors enjoy thick “tree islands”, open dunes, marsh-like deflation plains and beaches. The Carter Dunes Trail and Oregon Dunes overlook provide disabled access for forest visitors.
From Florence to Coos Bay, the Oregon Dunes extends for 40 miles along the Oregon Coast. Formed by the ancient forces of wind, water and time, these dunes are like no others in the world. These are the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America and they hold numerous opportunities for adventure and solitude. Find out more about the geology of the Dunes.
Thousands of off-highway vehicle riders come to enjoy the thrill of riding across these expansive tracks of sand. Three main off-highway vehicle riding areas have been set aside to provide riders with a variety of experiences. There are sand roads and designated rides between South Jetty to the Siltcoos River, small areas with the highest and most dramatic dunes in Umpqua Riding area, and large areas with varied riding opportunities between Spinreel and Horsfall. Whether by sand rail, motorcycle, 4x4, quad or guided trip riders are in for a treat.
If water sports are more to your liking the Oregon Dunes offers a myriad of opportunities. With over 30 lakes and ponds, and numerous streams to choose from, you can enjoy sailing, canoeing, water-skiing, swimming, scuba diving and fishing. Large lakes include Woahink, Siltcoos, Tahkenitch, Eel, and North and South Tenmile Lakes.
Or get away from it all on one of our variety of hiking opportunities and immerse yourself in the quiet solitude of the costal forests extending nearly to the ocean. Many trails rove through forest flourishing in Douglas-fir and Sitka spruce. Some trails wind up, over and through sand dunes offering hikers the chance to experience the natural wonder that makes this area unique. One moment you may be trekking over vast expanses of sand, only to give way to low lying wetlands or a hidden lake at the bottom of a dune. At the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, adventures and wonder are truly around every corner.
