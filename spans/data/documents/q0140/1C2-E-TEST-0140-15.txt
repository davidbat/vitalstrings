Monitoring Beach Water Quality
The Oregon Beach Monitoring Program monitors the waters along Oregon's coastline for the presence of fecal bacteria, and reports elevated levels to the public.
Marine waters are tested for enterococcus, which is an indicator of the presence of other bacteria. Enterococcus is present in human and animal waste and can enter marine waters from a variety of sources such as streams and creeks, storm water runoff, animal and seabird waste, failing septic systems, sewage treatment plant spills, or boating waste.
