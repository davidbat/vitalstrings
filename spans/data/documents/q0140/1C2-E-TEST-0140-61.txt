On the entire coastline of the west coast of the United States there are
only a couple hundred real oceanfront beach hotels.  We have driven the
entire coastline of California, Oregon, and Washington looking for hotels
on the beach, not blocks away. We're confident that our database of
California beach hotels, Oregon beach hotels, and Washington beach hotels
has 99% of all the oceanfront beach resorts and beach hotels on the coast.
While driving the coast we've also made a list of California clothing optional         beaches.
None of them are truly legal, but in most cases you won't
be harassed by law enforcement if you behave yourself and don't pester people.
