Welcome!  Cannon Beach RV Resort had you in mind when designing this resorts' expansive services and facilities.  Our grounds are lush, park-like and quiet; providing privacy for our guests, while offering all the services and amenities we think you want and deserve.  Our Lodge functions as a clubhouse where guests mingle and swap tall travel tales over a great cup of coffee and sometimes a game of pool. The convenience store, gift shop and game room are also housed in The Lodge, as well as a banquet and meeting room for clubs and groups in need of a gathering spot.
We are a non-member facility with 100 paved full hook-ups that accommodate rigs from 28-60 feet and we include 11 pull-throughs. You'll find our full service restrooms are well-stocked and immaculate.
At Cannon Beach RV Resort, we bend over backwards to be pet and family friendly.  All our guests enjoy the wide variety of amenities that include our indoor heated pool and spa, gaming room, picnic tables and brick fire pits for warming toes and world-class s'more making! As you can see from the aerial photo on this page, we are several short blocks from the soft sand beaches and the spectacular views of surging surf breaking against Haystack Rock.  We are a four season resort - winter, spring, summer and fall, there are always new things to discover in and around Cannon Beach.
The town center of Cannon Beach is often compared to Carmel, California, with wonderful galleries, restaurants and local Oregon beach culture. (see area and event tabs for more information).
