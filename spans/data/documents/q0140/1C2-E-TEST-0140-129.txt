General Debris Guidance from NOAA
Be Safe: Use common sense and follow general safety guidelines. If you don't know what an item is, don't touch it. If it appears hazardous, contact appropriate authorities.
Marine debris items or significant accumulations potentially related to the tsunami can be reported to DisasterDebris@noaa.gov with as much information as possible (including its location, the date and time you found it, photos and any relevant descriptions). It is important to remember that not all debris on U.S. shorelines is from Japan, so please use your discretion when reporting items.
For more info, visit NOAA's website.
