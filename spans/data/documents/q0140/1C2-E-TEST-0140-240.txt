Cannon Beach Nationally Recognized on ABC's "Good Morning America"
Of course, you will love Cannon Beach in the winter as well. Come watch a winter storm roll across the sky and the mighty Pacific Ocean put on a one-of-a kind show. This is the time when the summer crowds along the Oregon coast are gone and the pace slows. When you can spend a little more time with your morning cup of coffee or visiting every nook of that special art gallery. Or sit in your oceanfront suite at Tolovana Inn and take it all in by the fireplace. Now and then on a winter day, the sun is glorious because, despite what some say, it does not rain every day at the beach. Check out the area weather and make reservations at Tolovana Inn soon.
