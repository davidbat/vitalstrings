Come see the beautiful Oregon coastline, enjoy the rugged dunes and sea wildlife--birds, deer, elk, seals and occasionally a whale all on horseback!
We have experienced horses for all skill levels and miniature horses to accommodate kids. Ages 6 and up can ride. Guidance and instruction included. We stop to take photos on the beach.
