Historic Nye Beach in Oregon has been providing            joy to visitors since 1866, when one John Nye established it as a premier            Oregon vacation resort area. This quaint neighborhood on the Pacific            Ocean Newport was at one time connected to the bay-front area by a boardwalk.            The public has been flocking to Nye Beach for over a century for pleasure,            relaxation and rejuvenation.
Today Nye Beach is still a pedestrian friendly Oregon tourism and shopping            district. Guest will find a wide variety of lodging options, great restaurants            in a range of prices, shopping, and countless opportunities to enjoy            the visual and performing arts. The beach itself has a convenient oceanfront            parking lot, and also provides differently-abled visitors with access            to Nye Beach. The beach itself features amenities like public restrooms,            picnic tables and a foot-wash area. This is truly a perfect place for            the whole family to enjoy one of the most storied of Oregon beaches.
