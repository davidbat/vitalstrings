For more than a century, these famous boats have gone to sea from this sandy beach and shelter of Cape Kiwanda in Pacific City.
Pacific City has been known for over a hundred years as a quaint fishing village and vacation destination located in a very unique and special geographical and geological area.  Rarely does one see a large river (The Big Nestucca) so close to the ocean shoreline merging with another large river (The Little Nestucca) creating an estuary and habitat for so many of natures species.
Then throw in a small lake stuffed with trout (Town Lake), a spectacular cape (Cape Kiwanda), a pristine beach that you can drive on (Pacific City Beach), a very unique sand spit (Bob Straub Park), one of the most fascinating geological formations off the west coast (Haystack or "Chief Kiawanda" Rock),  an airstrip (PC Airport), 8 parks and campgrounds, many fine hotels, motels, shops and restaurants, and a small community of 900 of the nicest people on earth, and you have ...Pacific City.
Most of our visitors come here year after year and only share their secret spot with family and close friends. Pacific City is located on the Oregon Coast  between Tillamook and Lincoln City on the south end of beautiful "3 Capes Scenic Drive". We are off the beaten path on a short loop 3 miles from hwy. 101. We are an easy (and beautiful) drive from anywhere in Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. Most of those "other people" usually are in too much of a hurry to find paradise in their own backyard.
Take a few minutes and have a slow look at our little community and imagine yourself making a visit to where time hasn't stopped, but has slowed down to a pace you can live with.... Check out links at the top of the page... You will agree we have "everything you want, and everything you need..." After all.... they named an Ocean after us....
