OREGON BEACHES & COASTAL TOWNS
OREGON COAST!
In OREGON, Pacific Coast Highway 1  runs through hills, mountain ranges, cliffs,   beaches, small and big towns.
The view along the  Oregon Coast is one of the  most serene and beautiful.  Giant black rocks  amongst the waves is called "Turtle Rock".
Most of all the beaches in Oregon are public beaches.
