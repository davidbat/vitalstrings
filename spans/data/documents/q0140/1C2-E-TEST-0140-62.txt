If you were to take the entire drive, which is highly recommended, youâ€™d see rocky, tide-battered coasts, beautifully pristine beaches, Sahara-like dunes, and scores of quaint towns with a penchant for serving up legendary seafood.  All that, plus lighthouses, aquariums, mild temperatures and a plethora of state parks.  When you decide to visit, make sure to plan time for the Sea Lion Caves, which are the worldâ€™s largest Sea Caves according to visit, and are always great for magnificent views of these amazing creatures in their native habitat.  Hiking, biking, backpacking, fishing and camping are really best experienced in locales like the Oregon coast, which seem almost made for the adventurous, outdoorsy type.  Vacation rentals in Oregon are a smart choice, as you can expect plenty of room as well as all the amenities of larger, upscale hotels without the wallet-busting price.  Browse our listings of Oregon vacation rental homes for your best options, and visit the Oregon Tourism page for even more trip ideas.
