Cannon Beach is my favorite.  Riding on the dunes in Florence is my second favorite, although haven't done that in a few years.  Now that I think about anyplace on the Oregon Coast is pretty great!

Put me down for a second on Bandon.  But, Charleston is pretty nice too. It's just North of Bandon. This time of the year is awesome - as it's storm watching season down in that area. There is nothing more awe inspiring then to be sitting in one of the storm shelters and having waves going up and over it.

I love Oswald West. My friends and I keep going back there... The hiking, the creek, the ocean, the beautiful geological surroundings... the tidepools even the tiny waterfall near the beach is awesome. That's definitely my favorite =).

since my in-law lives at Cannon Beach, that's where I go the most.  Have been all along Oregon coast, however.

I fell in love with a guy I'd known since pre-school while staying at a beach house in Bandon. We've been together ever since. It's a wonderful place!

I live In Waldport, and there are a few unmarked beaches nearby, that my dog really loves, If i told you where they were, then you'd probably show up there and mess up my solitude and stuff.

Ther'es a little cove below Shore Acres just south of Charlseton. I can't remember the name, but it's small and isolated and great place to sit for hours..There's a weird sensation while sitting on the beach. The waves crash in the very narrow opening (maybe 200 ft wide) into the cove and while sitting in the beach it seems as tho the waves are higher than where you'r sitting.
