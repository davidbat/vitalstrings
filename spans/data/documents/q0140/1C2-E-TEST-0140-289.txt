cannon beach oregon
Portland’s proximity to the coast is one of the many attributes that makes the city such a desirable place to call home. So when you want to get away from it all for a couple of days, you can head west, and in less than two hours, arrive at Oregon’s beautiful, rough-and-tumble coastline.
Cannon Beach is a popular coastal destination for many reasons: It’s easy to get to. It’s charming. It’s clean. And it’s more sophisticated than many of the other spots that dot the Oregon coast. That doesn’t mean you won’t be able to find a jewelry box made entirely of seashells or a tacky T-shirt shop in Cannon Beach, but you could easily avoid them.
Where to stay
For the ultimate getaway—especially a romantic weekend—splurge on a room at the Stephanie Inn . Spoiling guests is what Stephanie Inn does best, from fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies in the lobby to their delightful wine-and-cheese hour each afternoon. Call at least a few weeks in advance to reserve a room that faces the ocean.
Another good, less expensive option is the Sea Sprite guest lodgings, which offers six different accommodations, ranging from a studio to a two-bedroom house that sleeps up to six.
Also consider the Cannon Beach Hotel Lodgings , a set of three quaint inns—all very close to everything you need in town.
If you’d prefer to camp, there’s a state park about 10 miles south of Cannon Beach called Oswald West .
