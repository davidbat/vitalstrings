Welcome to this Gold Beach, Oregon weblog, which is a part of www.GoldBeachOregon.com .
Gold Beach is one of those things in life that is becoming more rare...less obtainable...more precious. 
It is here in Gold Beach that you will enjoy some of the freshest air in the world...it's been filtered by thousands of miles of Pacific Ocean.
It is here in Gold Beach that you will enjoy clean, uncrowded beaches.
And if you are a fishermen...Gold Beach has both ocean fishing, and the Rogue, Elk, Sixes, Winchuck, Chetco, Smith, and Illinois Rivers...just for your fishing pleasure.
Want a lot of nothing...you can get nothing here too.  For example, we have just two stoplights. No more stoplights to the north for 60 miles.  A few stoplights 30 miles to the south.  No stop lights to the east...and certainly no stoplights to the west...just Pacific Ocean.
Another nothing that we enjoy here is no crime.  Well maybe there is a little crime here.  A tiny bit.  A very small amount of crime.  No gangs.  It's been months or maybe years since we had a murder.
Gold Beach does have a few stores...but not too many.  You can buy what you need.  If you want a shopping mall travel to the Willamette Valley...there are lots of malls there.
As I write this I cannot think of a 4 lane road in our area.  Some of them are three lanes...so that you can pass going uphill.
And as I write this I cannot think of many roads that don't have incredible views.  That's right...most of our roads have incredible views.
This blog may be located in several (or more) websites that you browse while exploring Gold Beach, Oregon via the Internet.  I hope it helps you.  Come visit Gold Beach one of these days!
