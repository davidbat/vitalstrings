Nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountain Range, rests Cannon Beach. The city is famed for its forested headlands, towering monoliths and miles of pristine, sandy beaches.
Haystack Rock is a famous landmark. Other attractions readily reached from town include Ecola State Park, Indian and Crecent Beaches, the Bird Rocks and Silver Point. Tillamook Rock Lighthouse is visible out to sea, amidst vistas of waves and seasonal populations of birds. Miles of beach, wooded areas, hiking trails, and parks offer plenty of healthy diversions in the great outdoors.
Attractive business districts provide shops, galleries and services. Community theater, art exhibitions and music events occur year-round.
The Pacific strand running along Cannon Beach’s 3 1/2 miles is a luminous stage, framed on the north end by the “Bird Rocks” and to the south by the monoliths of Silver Point. A walk along the beach is always a visual treat, with its vistas of ocean, mountains and rugged coastal outcroppings.
The delight of breezes pulling a kite aloft is a constant in Cannon Beach.  Kite flying, playing games, picnics, bonfires: a day in the sand is well accommodated here. For those who wish to stroll and enjoy the sights, the shore along Cannon Beach provides a variety of environments to savor; from the gregarious crowds of summer at Ecola Creek to the quiet and meditative stretches towards Silver Point.
The beauty and serenity of the shores along Cannon Beach has not gone unnoticed. Featured in Stephen Leatherman’s book, America’s Best Beaches, the margin of sand bordering Cannon Beach was rated Best Overall Beach in the state of Oregon.
