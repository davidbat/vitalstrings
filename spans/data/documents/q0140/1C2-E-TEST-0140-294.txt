Our purpose is simple: take care of Oregon with the help of volunteers.
SOLVE is a non-profit organization that brings together proud Oregonians (native and newly-transplanted) to improve the environment and to build a legacy of stewardship. By making connections between individuals, business groups, and service and conservation groups through volunteering and education, we are building a stronger tomorrow for this place we all love. This place that, let's face it, is pretty much the biggest reason why we came (or stayed) here in the first place. We'll take care of it, together.
