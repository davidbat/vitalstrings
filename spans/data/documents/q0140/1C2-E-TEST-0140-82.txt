Add a New Surf Spot Regional Overview
Oregon wave-lashed coastline is fully exposed to north-west swells coming down from the Gulf of Alaska and the prolific North Pacific, peaking from November to March. Autumn being the best time to surf with less wind, warmer waters and consistent surf. The summer can sometimes pick up south-west groundswells but they are rare. North-west winds are dominant with the majority of spots being hidden behind a protective headland such as Cape Lookout. Oregon possesses a good mixture of high quality reefs, beaches and points, some being very tide dependent. First surfed in the 1930s by locals off Agate Beach, the waves here are big and so are the sharks. Sea temperatures vary between 7 to 13°C or 45 to 55°F.
