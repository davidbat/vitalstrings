The                Bella Beach community takes                Oregon coast beach house rentals                to a new level of comfort. The                vacation rental houses in this                planned community are a few                short steps from a gorgeous                seven mile stretch of Lincoln                City sandy beaches.                Nantucket-style,                architect-designed beach                cottages feature wide porches                with traditional swings, where                you and a loved one can sit, sip                lemonade or tea, and take in the                gorgeous ocean vistas. Lighted                walkways and two park areas lend                a beach village touch to the                Bella Beach community while a                basketball court and children's                play structure complete the                picture.
