Oregon
The Oregon         coast may be the most beautiful in the United States; certainly the 363-mile-long         coastal Highway 101 provides the best viewing and access to the beaches         in the entire Northwest. Here mountains drop into the sea, punctuated by small sandy plains and beaches where rivers reach the sea.
All         along the northwest coast of Oregon, Northern California, and Washington,         high, rocky headlands, topped with incredibly green spruce and redwood         forests, frame the beaches. The beaches may consist of fine sand, very         coarse sand, or even cobbles, and some beaches are merely thin drapes         of sediment on top of hard rock. During the winter storms, sand and cobbles         can be stripped off the smaller beaches and carried offshore to build         large bars. Therefore, beaches in some localities come and go with the         season and are locally called "vanishing or disappearing" beaches.         This is the stormiest and coldest water in the continental U.S. Swimming         and wading are not prime activities.
Some people make the long trip to Oregon during the summer in order to         escape the crowds and humid weather back home. The beaches, while never         large compared to Atlantic and Gulf coast standards, come in a large range         of sizes and composition. Even black sand beaches, best known to occur         in Hawaii, can be found here as the high waves and swift currents sort         out the river sands, leaving behind the heavier, black-colored ones. During         the summer, the black sand can be so hot that you cannot stand on it,         but then you run into the water that is so cold that you might pass out.         Hypothermia is a major concern for any swimmer or even improperly prepared         skin divers in these cold waters flowing down from the Arctic. These beaches         are nice for enjoying the scenery as well as walking, kite flying, beachcombing,         and bird watching.
The         Oregon coast is literally "pocketed" with little beaches of         all shapes and dimensions, while the sand spits at major bays can be several         miles long. This is the best place in the United States to find a secluded         beach in one of the hundreds and hundreds of small coves along the rugged         coastline. The air coming off the Pacific Ocean and the water are some         of the cleanest to be found anywhere; the mixture of the dark blue water         and the bright green vegetation in this pristine environment is really         breathtaking and well worth the time to stop and enjoy. The freshness         cannot really be described in words, only experienced by the senses. There         are a myriad of state park beaches, offering great camping at very reasonable         rates. Elsewhere, coastal towns like Brookings, Bandon, and Newport offer         amenities for people seeking creature comforts.
Brookings is the most southern seaside town in Oregon, and residents and         visitors alike enjoy a climate more like Santa Cruz, far to the south         in California. Temperatures are remarkably mild year-round; frost is rare         and snow is almost unknown. Like Santa Cruz, Brookings has a southern         exposure and a backdrop of mountains to protect it from the harsh weather.         Wintertime temperatures of 70 degrees are not uncommon here in Oregon's "Banana Belt," making Brookings the home of winter flowers and         host of an annual azalea festival.
The nice, often sunny weather at Brookings is great for enjoying the beach.         Large offshore monoliths and beach rock formations dominate the seascape         at nearby Harris Beach State Park. Strolling along this pristine beach         is good exercise, and it never gets that hot during the summer because         of the onshore sea breezes. Sport fishing is a popular recreational activity         throughout the Oregon coast and so is whale watching.
During December and January, thousands of grey whales migrate south to         more temperate breeding grounds. These gentle giants are best viewed from         jutting coastal headlands, such as at Harris Beach State Park in Brookings         or Ecola State Park near Cannon Beach. The best time to whale watch is         during times of little wind and hence no whitecaps, which often occurs         in the morning. One of the most spectacular sights are these huge whales         breaching the water before they take another deep dive for food. The waters         are also active with frolicking seals and sea lions.
Bandon-By-The-Sea is a quaint seaport village and a popular vacation spot         and artist colony. One of the area's major industries is cranberries.         The bogs can be seen both north and south of town. Bandon's coast is one         of the most photographed on the West Coast because of natural sculptures         such as Table Rock, Elephant Rock, and Face Rock carved by the relentless         sea over eons of time. In addition to wave watching and photographing         sunsets, you can collect agate, jasper and other semi-precious stones         on Bandon's beaches. This makes the area beaches popular with rockhounds         and sunbathers alike.
Bandon's claim to fame is it's title of Storm Watching Capital of the         World. Storm watchers present lectures on weather and beachcombing. Oregon         in the winter is a great place for storm watching as huge waves from the         Pacific Ocean hit the sheer rocky seacliffs and splash up almost a hundred         feet. The raw energy alone is enough to dazzle. A few people brave the         wind and rain along the beach, but others prefer to enjoy the fury from         the warmth of a fire in an oceanside cabin. After the storm, the beaches         are the place to be - it's great fun to pick up what the ocean has washed         ashore. Favorite finds are the colored glass floats that Japanese fishermen         once used for buoyancy of their nets. Storm watching and beachcombing         are very popular pastimes along the Oregon coast.
A 40-mile ribbon of sand dunes along the central coast has been set aside         as Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Some of the 32,000 acres of         dunes reportedly tower as high as 300 feet, making them among the highest         coastal dunes in the world. Entire books have been written by coastal         scientists about these magnificent shifting sands and the various dune         forms and shapes. About half of the area is open to off-road vehicles.         You can bring a dune buggy or arrange a tour from a commercial operator.
The beaches fronting this massive accumulation of sand are fun to walk,         but perhaps more interesting is the vast assortment of freshwater lakes         and ponds, marshes and estuaries, and lush coastal forests on the landward         side of the frontal dunes. Over the millennia, wind-blown sand has blocked         the coastal creeks, forming freshwater lakes. The color of the larger,         clear ponds reflects the color of the sky. Lake Tenmile, Tahkenenitch,         Woahink, and Siltcoos are popular areas for fishing and offer the best         swimming on the Northwest coast.
Some of the best amenities in terms of accommodations and restaurants         can be found at Newport. Oregon's largest coastal port is known for its         seafood, especially crabs, shrimp, and oysters. This seaside resort dates         back to 1856, when the hot sea baths enticed victors to nearby Nye Beach.         The broad sandy beach which extends for five miles constitutes one of         Newport's prime attractions. The northern area is called Agate Beach State         Park because of the colorful translucent pebbles that can be found along         the beach face. Beverly Beach, just to the north of Newport, is also one         of the best state parks along the Oregon coast.
Near         Tillamook is Bayocean Spit, a several mile-long finger of sand that projects         northward along the bay. A coastal town once stood on this barrier beach,         but incessant coastal storms and progressive beach erosion finally took         their toll. The development was abandoned during the early 20th century.         Today the beach is dominated by driftwood and huge tree trunks. In terms         of water safety, logs in the surf are one of the greatest unrecognized         dangers for swimmers. People have been injured and even killed when struck         by a wave-propelled log. Rip currents and hypothermia are also major concerns         for bathers and swimmers along the Northwest coast.
Cannon         Beach is a scenic resort community fronting a spectacular white sand beach.         Just offshore is 235 feet high Haystack Rock. Cannon is one of the most         photographed and popular beaches in Oregon. This seven-mile-long beach         was named for a small cannon that washed ashore in 1846 when the Shark         shipwrecked off the coast. At low tide you can walk far out on the beach,         almost to Haystack. People love to play in and around the water on this         wide, gently sloping beach. The fine-grained sand is great for digging,         and each spring Cannon Beach hosts an annual sand castle building contest.         The town itself is the home of many artists, whose work can be found in         the local galleries and shops.
Seaside is Oregon's largest beach resort and offers an abundance of activities         and good amenities. History was made here when Lewis and Clark reached         the Pacific after a harrowing journey across vast stretches of uncharted         territory. A two-mile boardwalk along the wide sandy beach attracts the         volleyball crowd. There are amusement rides and arcade games for the kids.         At the south end of the beach is The Cove, a popular surfing area. Low         tide brings out clam diggers who scour the beach. Drier sports include         horseback riding and hiking along this picturesque coast. Other attractions         include the Seaside Aquarium and Tillamook Head Lighthouse to the south         of town. All in all, quaint Seaside along the northern Oregon coast is         well worth the visit.
