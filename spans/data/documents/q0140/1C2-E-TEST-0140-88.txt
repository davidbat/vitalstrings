Explore Oregon Coast
A spectacular, green, and pristine wilderness blankets the Pacific coast of Oregon. While less visited than the neighboring coast of California, Oregon's shoreline is equally striking. State parks throughout the region boast dramatic cliffs, alpine forests, quiet bays, and scenic roadways. Charming small towns like Bandon, Astoria, and Newport compliment the rugged landscape with homey restaurants and local galleries.
Most people visit the coast to enjoy outdoor activities, like hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, kayaking, and surfing. Fishing is also a major attraction of the Oregon wilderness. Along the coast, the ocean is filled with such prized fish as halibut, while Oregon bays are a natural salmon habitat. Even clam diggers will have a great time sifting through the sand on Oregon's fruitful coast. If you don't catch a fish yourself, you can always get a plate of unbeatable seafood at one of the many restaurants in Oregon's beach towns.
Here are a few additional suggestions of things to do along the Oregon Coast:
-Fort Clatsop: The famous fort where explorers Lewis and Clark spent the winter of 1806 has been recreated in the small town of Astoria, Oregon.
-Sea Lion Caves: Just north of Florence, visitors can enter a massive coastal cave, home to a huge community of vocal and amusing sea lions.
-Boardman State Park: There are several secluded beaches and some beautiful natural bridges in this coastal reserve.
-Bandon: A charming coastal town, Bandon is surrounded by picturesque beaches and several golf courses.
-Garibaldi: A small harbor town near Tillamook Bay, Garibaldi is a top notch fishing and crabbing destination.
-Cape Arago: Drive the highway along this picturesque cape and admire the sweeping views of the Pacific.
When visiting the Oregon Coast, find a vacation rental in one of the small towns in the region and make it your home base for exploring the area. If you are visiting with the family, a rental home or a two or three bedroom condo can accommodate everyone and their gear. For a romantic getaway, a cozy cabin with ocean views will ensure a special experience.
