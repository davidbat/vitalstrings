Oregon Coast Exploration: shipwrecks, beachcombing, eco-retreats.
Only eight years ago, the New           Carissa perished           near Coos Bay, a reminder that modern ships are not           immune to Pacific storms. It is now being salvaged and removed piece           by piece. Neil             McKown

Route         101 curves and meanders along Oregon’s coast following the contours of its bays, coves and inlets for 350 miles. The drive along the Pacific         Ocean, which my husband David and I completed in May 2008, is among the         world’s most scenic, with broad beaches, sheer cliffs, sandy dunes         and historic lighthouses offering an ever-changing panorama.
To         enhance access to the spectacle of these craggy shores, Oregon has created         a “string of pearls” made up of 47 parks, with additional pull-offs         and view points. From these convenient stopovers, we gazed at stunning waves         curling and breaking over the shallow continental shelf. Rocks and islets,         some smoothed by the pounding surf, others resembling haystacks or spiky         shark teeth, festoon the coast. We were delighted to learn that the entire         coast is open to the public— not a “no trespassing” sign         anywhere.
You are often alone on an Oregon beach. Marianne           Scott
We began our Oregon journey traveling north from California,         first stop in Brookings. Its broad beach was an introduction of things to         come: the tawny sand, its length interrupted by tall limestone rocks rising         like monoliths, twists of dried bull kelp marking the high tide mark while         flocks of sandpipers ran into the surf, madly pecking at minute critters.         As we approached, they’d sweep away and land again on their seemingly         fragile legs yet running like roadrunners.
Oregon’s coastal communities, founded on timber         and fishing but now relying more on tourism, are about 30-40 minutes apart         by car and are usually located on one of the many rivers draining the Coast         Range mountains. As we had sailed in our own yacht along Oregon’s treacherous         coast on our way to French Polynesia, one of our goals was to learn more         about several newly uncovered shipwrecks near these towns.

Oregon’s picturesque seaside rocks certainly add         to the dramatic spectacle when viewed from the land, but they’re deadly         when approached from the ocean. Westerly winds push waves from as far as         the Sea of Okhotsk off Siberia, and the energy of those waves has carried         many a ship into Oregon’s lee shore. Yet somehow, there’s romance         attached to wrecked ships, their stark demise and the power of oceans. Although         no one knows the exact number of lost vessels, Oregon shipwreck historian         Ned Reed’s wreck list counts 230 ships lost between Bandon and Humbug         Mountain alone—a mere 30 miles.
Our first old carcass was the Acme,         near Bandon. The 23-year-old, 154-foot wooden steamship stranded on the beach         on Halloween in 1924, and broke in two. For decades, sand covered the remains         until the fierce 2008 winter storms unearthed the wreck anew. At low tide,         we drove our Subaru onto the beach and found the skeleton half-buried in         buff-colored sand, some of its hoary ribs still covered by planking.
After         inspecting the sad wreck, we spent the night at WildSpring Guest         Habitat, www.wildspring.com in Port Orford.         It’s located on a small peninsula         jutting into the Pacific, and our hosts, the Duartes, work hard to minimize         environmental impact by fostering native vegetation and wildlife. With         cabin TVs only playing resort-supplied movies, we took the cue and unplugged         our cell phone while quaffing wine in one of the five supremely comfortable         cabins and floating in the open-air spa. Serenity reigned, sunlight played         on ferns and tree trunks, a deer leapt away as gracefully as Baryshnikov.         Except for the surf crashing on the rocks below, it was totally quiet.
On our way to more shipwrecks, we drove across a series         of landmark bridges, most built during the 1930s as part of President Franklin         Roosevelt’s job creation program to create jobs and help communities         nearly wiped out by the Great Depression. Designed by Conde McCullough, they         display the streamlined, geometric forms of the Art Deco period. Today, these         huge metal and stone engineering feats tie Route 101 together, a legacy that         continues to demonstrate how government actions can make lasting contributions.         Sometimes we stopped at one end of a bridge and briskly walked its length,         enjoying its intricate structure.

Our         next wreck stop was at Coos Bay’s North Spit, home to the newly revealed George L. Olson, a 223-foot schooner launched in 1917 and wrecked         in 1944. Successive storms have repeatedly interred and uncovered it — with         the latest exhumation occurring this past winter when strong storms shifted         huge quantities of sand along the beach.
To         pay a visit to the Olson requires stamina. Because the nearby dunes         are a refuge for the threatened snowy plover, only pedestrians are allowed         beach access — at         low tide — and it takes 75 minutes to walk to the wreck. We started         our trek at the end of high tide and strode southward. It was invigorating—waves         broke, shells littered the beach, the air was fresh. We reached the Olson and         circled its once mighty bow that has endured the onslaught of waves for decades.         Sand clung between its tarry planks while portholes created circles of light         on the gray strand.

It’s         not Venice, but since 1999, Lincoln City www.oregoncoast.org has         reinvented the Japanese tradition of blown-glass fish floats by hiding 2,000         floats on nearby beaches. Each year, from October through May, volunteers         hide brightly colored hand-crafted balls in the sands and lucky beachcombers         get to keep their finds. We strolled around the beach, full of hope, peeking         under driftwood and lifting seaweed tangles. But that week’s glass         gifts had already been collected.
So         instead, David and I created our own floats at the Jennifer           Sears Glass Studio, www.oregoncoast.org/foundry located in Lincoln’s historic Taft District,         where five young artists teach us amateurs to blow a sphere. Aided by a patient         instructor, each of us had a turn at lifting a steel rod with its orb of         molten glass from the red-hot kilns, rolling our globule in candy-coloured         shavings and squeezing the hot glass with metal tongs to distribute the tints.         Another dip into the kiln, then we puffed our cheeks to inflate the glass         into a transparent, multi-hued globe. You have to breathe forcefully, but         stop before the glass pops like a balloon. What a way to use your own hot         air!

The cold, fertile waters of Oregon       hide many life forms, few of which are visible from the beaches. To learn       about the abundant sea life, we went to the Oregon Coast Aquarium in       Newport, www.aquarium.org one of the       most enticing, educational institutions we’ve ever visited.

Its         interior exhibits display a huge variety of sea life, including starfish,         anemones and jellies as multi-coloured as a garden in bloom. An acrylic tunnel         surrounded by sea water gives the illusion of walking beneath the open ocean,         with sharks, rockfish and bat rays swimming all around us. I wanted to join         the children who screamed in awe of the creatures whirling nearby. We also         loved the outside displays, home to otters, sea lions, puffins and snowy         plovers. A visitor can easily spend a full day learning about the mostly         unseen creatures that share our earth.
That night, we loved our stay at Yachat’s Overleaf         Lodge www.overleaflodge.com with         its splendid natural setting. The hotel is built on the shore next to sandstone         slabs sculpted smooth by wind and waves. The rooms are grand and offer         balconies from which we watched the sun sink in the direction of China.         All night long, natural rhythms and sounds of breaking waves soothed our         sleep.
We spent a week exploring the 350-mile Oregon coast and are         hard pressed to choose the best place. We enjoyed         many walks savoring the  raw beauty of the shore, the golden         dunes, the wide beaches guarded by picturesque rocks, and the fast-flowing         rivers. Lighthouses still warn ships of danger and small towns still offer         strangers a warm welcome.
