Hundreds of Humboldt squid have washed up on northern Oregon beaches in the past few days in a rare die-off attributed to their coming too far north in search of food.
The squid, about 3½ feet long, have been reported as far south as Cannon Beach. Most of the deaths, however, were reported in the Columbia River at Astoria. A number of dead squid also washed onto rocks at the boat basin in Westport, Wash. , last week. Because of the large number of squid available, the Aberdeen Daily World reported the state Fish and Wildlife Department lifted its five-squid daily limit for several days.
The squid are normally found in Southern California and Mexico, but followed the Humboldt current north in search of bait fish such as herring, said Keith Chandler, general manager of the Seaside Aquarium.
The last time any sizable die-off of Humboldt squid occurred on Oregon beaches was 2004, when about 2,000 squid died here, he said.
"Cold upwellings of the Pacific can occur very quickly," Chandler said. "When the temperature drops like that, they just get trapped."
Chandler said he is collecting some of the dead squid to sent to an aquarium in Seattle for further research.
