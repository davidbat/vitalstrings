Explore The   Oregon Scenic Coast
 The beautiful Oregon Scenic Coast offers you miles        and miles of beautiful scenery. There
are 363 miles of silver surf, sand, rocks and beautiful        beaches between Astoria in the north and Brookings on        the southern tip.
I have enjoyed the coast for many years and decided        that I want to share it with the rest of the world. You        won't find any more beautiful scenery than you        can find at the Oregon beaches.
One of the reasons I        love the coast is the storms that are frequent during        the winter. There is nothing better than a romantic        Oregon Coast vacation. You can set and watch the waves        come rolling ashore while sharing a glass of wine with        your loved one.
Recreational opportunities abound        from beachcombing , biking, fishing, whale watching , and kite flying to name just a few choice activities.
The        thing I like about the Scenic Oregon Coast Beaches is        that you never get tired of the scenery and the fun you        can have there.
You can just spend a lazy day        walking the beach and looking for seashells and agates , or just setting and watching        the waves. I can spend hours beachcombing and just        watching the ocean.
If you decide that you want to        go shopping you can't beat the coast for arts and crafts. There are some great art galleries        and craft shops and I will try and tell you about some        of them.
If you are a sportsman then you will love        the coast for the many different kinds of fishing, crabbing and clam digging . Y
