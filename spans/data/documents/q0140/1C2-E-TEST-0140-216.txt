____________________________________________________
Oregon                  beach house rental, The Moonsail, offers breathtaking views and                  luxurious comfort in the perfect relaxing and fun vacation environment.
This spacious 2800+ square foot home is the best combination of                  a family friendly gathering spot and luxurious lodging.
Enjoy impressive views from our massive windows of the spectacular                  Pacific Ocean and beautiful Netarts Bay.
Walk along the beach towards Oceanside and enjoy the beautiful                  crashing ocean waves, shell searching, and stunning views of the                  three arch rocks. Or walk along the bay to Netarts, where you                  can enjoy coffee shops, restaurants, grocery and other services.
Quiet Netarts Bay offers some of the best known crabbing on the                  Oregon Coast. Crab and fish from shore or rent a boat from a nearby                  marina.
View stunning wildlife close-up, including pelicans, sea lions,                  bald eagles and other sea birds. Children can safely swim and                  wade in the bay on most days during low tide, hunting for little                  treasures.
