Sylvia Beach Hotel
The Sylvia Beach Hotel, located just steps away from the beach, is a quiet, 20-room hotel available for nightly and weekly rental throughout the year. The hotel, which bills itself as a hotel for book lovers, has no phones, television, radio or Internet. Instead, the hotel has a large library and lots of puzzles, as well as board games and evening parlor games. There are shared meals every morning for guests who wish to sit and share stories together, and every evening warm spiced wine is served for all. The rooms are individually decorated and named after famous authors. The family-owned owned hotel is also available for small conferences and private events.
