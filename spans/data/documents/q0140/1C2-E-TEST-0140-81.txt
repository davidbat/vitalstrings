Examples of A-1 Oregon Beach House Rentals
One block from the beach, the Nantucket is a quaint 1927 cottage. It accommodates four guests with one king bed and a sleeper sofa. It's got a deck and barbecue grill, as well as a second observation deck that gives you great ocean views and is perfect for sunbathing.
Some of our homes also have attached studio apartments that you can rent to bring extra guests. If this is something you need, be sure to ask us whether it is available or whether it will be rented at the same time you rent the main house. Book your Oregon beach house rental online with us now, or contact us for more information.
