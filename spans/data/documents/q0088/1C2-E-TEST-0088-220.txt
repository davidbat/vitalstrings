Exterior of the Disneyland Hotel
Walt Disney Company
The Bottom Line:
The original Disneyland hotel combines an air of magic wherever you turn with superb service, attention to detail, the best in imaginative design, and a little bit of pixie dust from Tinkerbell herself.
What's Special about the Disneyland Hotel:
The nostalgia of the original Disneyland hotel, the convenience of Downtown Disney and both theme parks within a short walk, and guest rooms completely remodeled within the last two years come together to provide a relaxing vacation environment. Rooms abound with classic Disneyland touches . The Peter Pan themed swimming pool with two water slides (large and small) is open year-round.
Dining at the Disneyland Hotel:
Character dining at Goofy's Kitchen provides good buffet-style meals and opportunities to mingle with Donald Duck, Pluto and Princess Aurora. We found Hook's Pointe pricey for food that didn't impress. Below, the Wine Cellar serves California wines by the glass or bottle; we took them just outside the Lost Bar and enjoyed live music. Croc's Bits 'n Bites (chicken strips, fries, ice cream) and fine dining at Granville's Steak House round out the choices.
Insider Tips:
Rooms in the Sierra Tower that face Downtown Disney have views of both theme parks, and you can see Magic Kingdom fireworks from the upper floors.
Don't miss the nightly "Fantasy Waters" show at 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.
The Wine Cellar has complimentary (and delicious) cheeses at happy hour.
