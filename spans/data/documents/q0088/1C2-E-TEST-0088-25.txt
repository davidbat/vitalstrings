Other Places to Buy Advance Purchase Tickets
There are no advance purchase savings if you buy directly from Disneyland online or by phone, except during special promotions.
AAA
Automobile Club of Southern California offices now sell advance purchase Disneyland multi-day tickets at a slight discount. Be sure to call your local AAA office in advance                  to  check prices and make sure they have the tickets you want in stock.                Sometimes a free parking pass is included with the purchase of multi-day tickets. You must purchase your tickets at your local Auto Club branch. Thanks to pho lishus for info.
Some Central and Northern California AAA offices and neighboring states' AAA offices (i.e. Arizona and                Oregon) sell advance purchase Park Hopper tickets.                  They may or may not be discounted. Be sure to call your local AAA office in advance                  to check prices and make sure they have the tickets you want in stock.                Sometimes a free parking pass is included with the purchase of multi-day tickets.
Supermarkets/Safeway
Some supermarkets such as Safeway (primarily in Northern              California and neighboring states) may carry promotional advance purchase tickets.
Entertainment              Book Discounts on Multi-Day Tickets
If you purchase an Entertainment              Book , you can access a private website that offers discounts on Disneyland multi-day tickets (for Southern California residents and non-residents) as well as Select and regular Annual Passports for Southern California residents.
The initially displayed prices look very tempting, but unfortunately the "taxes" (puzzling because there is no tax on amusement park tickets in California) and "fees" that are added during the ordering process are really high. However, even with the "taxes and fees" added, there are some good deals to be found, particularly for Southern California residents.
Tickets ordered on this site must be picked up at the Disneyland ticket windows. To access the private site, register your Entertainment              Book online, then log in and click on the "Events & Attractions" tab. Thanks to Cherie S for info.
Last              Minute Ticket Discounts
You can get slightly discounted Disneyland tickets at the Disneyland                    Welcome Center in the Doubletree                    Guest Suites Anaheim Resort , located at 2085 S. Harbor Blvd,                    Anaheim, CA 92802. They may not carry the full array of tickets,                    and they do not sell 1-day tickets. Call (714) 383-7052 for                    the latest ticket prices and availability.
Their prices do not beat advance purchase ticket prices from aRes                    Travel . However, if you didn't get around to ordering tickets                    ahead of time, the Disneyland Welcome Center offers better ticket                    prices than are available at the park gate.
Thanks to Darkbeer for info and Cesco G for updates!
Southern                    California CityPass
Planning a "grand tour" of Southern California? Be sure to consider the Southern                California CityPass , which includes discounted admission to Disneyland, Universal Hollywood and SeaWorld San Diego . The San                  Diego Zoo or Safari Park can be added as an option on this pass.
By purchasing this combined ticket, you save a substantial amount vs. buying each ticket separately. In addition, the price of the CityPass did NOT go up when Disneyland and Universal ticket prices increased in May, so now it's an even better deal!
Click                here for more information on the Southern                  California CityPass .
Annual              Passport Deals & Discounts
It may be more cost-effective to buy an Disneyland Annual              Passport if you will be in the parks for more than a few days              during the year. Be sure to include an Annual Pass in your calculations            when deciding on the best pass to buy.
When purchasing tickets for a family, group or couple that will visit              Disneyland together, it is often worthwhile to buy ONE Premium              Annual Passport for someone in the party. That's because in addition              to the admission, a Premium Annual Passport includes parking,              many Disneyland Resort restaurant and shopping discounts and discounts at the Disneyland              resort hotels . Just have the Premium Annual Passholder use the              discounts and parking privileges for everyone's benefit. (Most restaurant              discounts are good for the entire party -- a few have limits.)
Annual Passholder Early Entry
This summer, Disneyland Annual Passholders will be able to enjoy Early Entry at each Disneyland Resort theme park, beginning one hour prior to scheduled opening.
Passholders must register in advance for Early Entry.
Availability is limited each morning, and Annual Passholders may only use this privilege once at each park during the summer (between June 18 - September 13, 2012).
Annual Passholder Early Entry will be offered at Disneyland Park on most Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and at Disney California Adventure Park on most Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
 
How to Buy an Annual Passport
You can buy your pass in person at any Disneyland ticket booth. If you have never had an Annual Passport before, you'll have to get a photo taken by a PhotoPass photographer, which will be associated with the pass.
You can also buy a Disneyland Annual Passport in advance by phone at (714) 781-INFO (4636)                or online . If you buy in advance,                you can order a voucher for an actual Annual Pass. The voucher must be "activated" (exchanged for the actual Annual Pass) at the park. To activate the voucher,              you'll have to show photo ID (for adults).
Many supermarkets in Southern California sell "gift card" style vouchers for Disneyland Annual Passports at full price.
Generally I don't see much point in buying an annual pass voucher in advance, except in the following situations:
The prices are about to go up and you want to lock in the current price. Even if the price goes up after you purchase it, your voucher is valid until the end of the calendar year without paying any extra. After that time the voucher still retains its value (what you paid) but you have to pay the difference in price if annual pass prices have gone up. The Annual Passport is valid for one year from the date you redeem the voucher.
You are a member of AAA and plan to go to an Automobile Club of Southern California office and buy the Annual Passport, which will save you a little money.
You can renew an Annual Passport up to 40 days prior to its expiration date. Renewals are automatically activated immediately after the current pass expires. If you will not use a new Annual Passport within the 60 days after your old one expires, it's better not to renew. Just buy a new pass when you actually need it.
If you are purchasing an Annual Passport that has blackout dates, be sure to read the hint above so that you can maximize your use of the pass at the time of purchase.

Teacher              Discounts
If you are a teacher in the US or Canada, be sure to check with your teachers' union for possible Disneyland ticket discounts.
Members of the California Teachers Association                    sometimes qualify for a great price on Disneyland tickets. To check                    on what's available right now, either visit the benefits website or call TSA/First Financial Credit Union at (800) 537-8491. Thanks to Diane E for info.
MouseSavers.com reader Barbara W reports, "First Financial Credit                      Union may extend this discount to members of other Teachers Associations                      through their toll-free phone line. (The rep I spoke to had no problem                      with my parents' membership in a Canadian association.) These tickets                      must be shipped to a residential address in the US only." Another reader reports that they would not allow a teacher from outside                      California to order. So "your mileage may vary."
MouseSavers.com reader Heather O reports, "the PSEA (Pennsylvania State Education Association) also offers a significant discount on Disneyland tickets.... I found that I could save $25-30 on most multi-day passes!"
College Student              Discounts
Many universities in Southern California offer              one-day, one-park Disneyland and Disney California Adventure tickets at major discounts for              their students. If you are a college student, check with your Student              Union.
Y.E.S. (Youth Education Series) Program
Disney Y.E.S. programs are special educational programs offered in the Disneyland Resort theme parks on selected dates to students in 1st through 12th grade. Y.E.S. is a  wonderful educational program, but it also has an added benefit: discounted tickets. You can get 1-Day/1-Park and 2-Day/1-Park Tickets, or 1-Day to 5-Day Park Hopper Tickets in conjunction with the program.
Normally the Y.E.S. programs are available only to groups of 15 kids or more, but at times Disney offers "individual enrollment" that does not require you to be part of a group. However, if the "individual enrollment" events don't fill up, they may be cancelled. To learn more about individual enrollment, click here .
Youth Group Discounts
If you will be taking a group of 10 or more kids (between ages 3 and 18) to Disneyland, be sure to call the Youth Group Sales department at (800) 232-7980 to see what discounts may apply, or visit disneyyouth.com for more info.
Qualifying Southern California youth groups can buy significantly discounted tickets through the site above, by fax or by phone.

Corporate              and Government Agency Discounts
Many large corporations  (typically those with 200-plus employees) and certain government              agencies in Southern California offer Disneyland            and Disney California Adventure tickets at discounted rates for their employees. Tickets are offered through private websites operated by various ticket suppliers such as Wild at Work, which exclusively service corporate employees. A password is required to access those sites. Ask your Human Resources department whether your company participates and how to get the password.
Credit Union Discounts
Some California credit unions may offer Disneyland discounts to their members. If you belong to a credit union in California, be sure to inquire about this.
MouseSavers.com reader Rebekah M reports that members of Golden 1 Credit Union (which anyone living in certain California counties can join by opening an account - see the Golden 1 site for details) offers very good Disneyland ticket discounts: "Members can order them online. A member only needs to access their online account. Once on that account they select the 'self services' tab. Under the 'special offers' box is a link to member discounts with Disneyland's logo right on the top. The link below the logo directs them to a secure Disneyland website with great discounts."
Military              Discounts
Military Salute Special Ticket Offer
From now through 9/30/12, active or retired US military                   personnel may purchase up to a maximum of six 3-Day Park Hopper Tickets for $99 per ticket, to be used by themselves, family members (including                   spouse) or friends.
Disney 3-Day Military Promotional Tickets for the Disneyland Resort may not be used on the following blockout dates:  12/24/11-1/2/12, 2/17/12-2/19/12, 4/2/12-4/14/12 and 7/4/12 at the Disneyland Theme Parks. The tickets have an expiration date.

You can pre-purchase the tickets at a military base (MWR/ITT office) or buy them at a Disneyland ticket booth.
Rules
The military member (or spouse) who purchased the tickets must be present with military ID in hand when the tickets are used.
These tickets are for active or retired members of the US military, including the National Guard, Reservists and the US Coast Guard, with a valid military ID card. Dept of Defense (CIA, FBI, Secret Service) and Coalition Forces are excluded.
Disney Military Promotional Tickets may be purchased at participating US military sales outlets ONLY by Eligible Service Members or their spouses (but not both), for themselves and other family members and friends.  These tickets may not be otherwise transferred, distributed or resold.
No more than six Disney Military Promotional Tickets may be purchased by any Eligible Service Member or spouse (regardless of the place of purchase and whether purchased by that person or that person's spouse), and all six must be purchased at the same time.
The tickets may be upgraded to Annual Passes, with credit toward the upgrade based on the actual price paid. No  other upgrades, such as adding additional days, will be  available.
Tickets must be used by the same person on any and all days.
This offer may not be combined with any other offer.
Where to Ask Questions
If you have questions about this promotion, I strongly recommend that you call your local base MWR/ITT directly and ask them.
 
In addition to the special offer above, there are ongoing military discounts            on Disneyland admission, so if you need more tickets than you are able to get through the special offer, check with your base MWR/ITT for info.
Hilton HHonors
You can exchange Hilton HHonors points for select  Disneyland passes. Click                here to read about this award (choose country, then Gift Cards & Certificates/Entertainment). Click              here to read more about HHonors.
Canadian            Disneyland Tickets
Select Disneyland tickets are                    sold at Canadian Disney Stores and at some CAA offices. The price of Disney tickets purchased in Canada is adjusted periodically                    to conform to the current exchange rate, so at times it may be possible to  time a purchase to benefit from a sudden change                  in the exchange rate. (Tickets purchased in Canada                   may be intended only for Canadians and there is a slight chance                    you might be asked for ID, so US citizens who live near the           border should keep this in mind.)
Canadians can redeem Air Miles for select Disneyland tickets. See the Air Miles site for details. Thanks to Dawn N for info.
Australia/New Zealand Disneyland Tickets
Aussies and Kiwis can purchase a Disneyland ticket that is not sold at the parks: a 14-Day Disney Vacation Pass, which is basically a 14-Day Disneyland Park Hopper ticket. This ticket is only sold in Australia and New Zealand,  through travel agents.
Expedia.com.au sells the 14-Day Disney Vacation Pass to Australia residents only (not NZ or elsewhere). To find it, in the Book Your Travel box, click on Activities, type in Anaheim as the destination, and pick any date. Thanks to Sandy W for info.
