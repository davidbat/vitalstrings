Pros: excellent in every way
Cons: four days is almost too much time to play!
"I bought four of these for my family and do not live within the suggested use zip codes. Do not worry about it: it did not matter at all to Disney. This is the best possible deal, offering great value and a ton of time at both parks. Excellent for using 'fast pass' between both parks, so you do not have to wait in the long lines (as the place is packed with people). We rode every ride we wanted to multiple times using 'fast pass', the only logical way to do it. Some rides did not offer 'fast pass' so you must wait, but if so wait until later at night when all the strollers and younger kids are in dreamland, sleeping. You cannot beat Costco with this product offering for Disneyland/California Adventure."
