What used to be just plain Disneyland is now the Disneyland Resort.              That's because, in addition to Disneyland -- Disney's first theme              park -- there is Disney California Adventure (DCA) theme              park (formerly called Disney's California Adventure), which opened in early 2001. It requires separate admission unless you have a Hopper pass.
Disneyland Resort also includes Downtown Disney,              a shopping and dining complex adjacent to the parks. Admission to            Downtown Disney is free.
Disneyland              Resort Hotels
The basics: Disney normally offers three "seasons" at the Disneyland            Resort hotels each year. Value Season (roughly January, February,            last three weeks of October, first three weeks of November, and first            three weeks of December) is the least expensive (and least crowded)            time. Regular Season (roughly the months of March, early and            late April, all of May and June, and last week of August through first            week of October) is mid-priced and moderately crowded. The most expensive            and crowded time of year is Peak Season (roughly mid-April, July,            first three weeks of August, and dates around Thanksgiving, Christmas            and New Year). 
Thus, the easiest and most obvious way to get a discount at the Disneyland              Resort hotels would be simply to book in the off-season. However,              you may be able to save much more. Depending on availability and current              promotions, it is quite possible to save as much as 45% off              the full price "rack rates" at the Disneyland Resort hotels. The savings              can add up to hundreds of dollars.

Disneyland Vacation              Packages
Vacation packages for Disneyland are often a good value. Watch for off-season            and other "special" discounted Disneyland packages, rather than            the standard packages offered year-round, which tend to cost the same            as buying all the package components separately at (gulp) FULL PRICE!            I list the latest and best discounts on Disneyland            vacation packages here.
Other              Anaheim-Area Hotels
In the late 1950s and early 1960s hundreds of            non-Disney-owned motels and hotels sprung up around the new Disneyland            theme park in Anaheim and nearby cities. The quality of these accommodations was very inconsistent,            which Walt Disney found frustrating. That's one of the reasons why he bought up so much            land around the planned parks at Walt Disney World: that way Disney would            own or control all of the immediate area around the parks, including  hotels.
However, some of the non-Disney              hotels around Disneyland are just as nice -- and  as close to              the parks -- as the Disneyland Hotel and the Paradise Pier Hotel (which started its life as a non-Disney property anyway). There are              many very attractive choices available, most of which provide reliable, inexpensive shuttle service to the parks. 
Tickets & Passes
Promotional and seasonal discounts on Disneyland and Disney California Adventure tickets            are fairly common, especially for Southern California residents.
In              addition, many discounts are offered on multi-day Hopper passes. There              are over a dozen categories of savings on Disneyland tickets -- be sure to check this section carefully!
Meals,              Snacks & Drinks
There are quite a few discounts available on food at the Disneyland            Resort parks and hotels, if you know where to look! You can save through memberships and various discount programs, or take an easy walk            to Downtown Disney, where even more deals await.
