Disneyland® Resort Park Tickets
Get ready to be floored, because Cars Land is big, really big!
The magical transformation of Disney California Adventure® Park is nearly complete. The Park is being expanded and re-imagined in exciting new ways. Beginning this summer, take a ride on the vintage Red Car Trolley or stop by the Carthay Circle Theatre, which lovingly re–creates the theatre where Walt first premiered Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs almost 75 years ago. Get ready to be floored, because Cars Land is big, really big! Guests will step right into the life-size, 12 acre version of the Disney•Pixar Cars movie, because Radiator Springs has been brought to life with this all-new land!
Guests will meet Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater, race on the stunning rock formations and waterfalls of the Ornament Valley on the Radiator Springs Racers. And you will also want to try out the amazing food locations in Cars Land, like Flo's V8 Café and the Cozy Cone Motel. At night, Cars Land will turn into a beautiful sea of neon—just like it does in the movie Cars! Whether it be day or night, the expansion and immersive storytelling is something for the whole family to enjoy!
