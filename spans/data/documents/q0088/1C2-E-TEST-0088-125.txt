Cutting Costs at Disneyland
If you are a resident of Southern California, you might want to consider purchasing an annual pass to Disneyland.  Many of these annual passes also offer percentage discounts on Disneyland merchandise and dining.  Disneyland also offers special regular admission ticket deals to Southern California residents, including two-for-one theme park ticket prices.
If you are planning a long vacation at Disneyland, consider a vacation package.  Some seasonal offers could mean substantial discounts on lodging and Disneyland Resort tickets.  In addition, keep an eye out for special promotions involving airlines or hotels.  By booking with a certain airline, you may be able to get free extra nights at a Disneyland Resort.
