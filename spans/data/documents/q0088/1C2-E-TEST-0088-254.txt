  DISNEYLAND&REG; RESORT - HIDDEN MICKEY LANYARD PIN COLLECTION
The Hidden Mickey Lanyard Series was introduced several years ago as a unique way for Cast Members to trade pins with Guests. These Hidden Mickey Lanyard Series pins are only available for trade from Cast Members. Guests can trade up to two (2) Cast Lanyard Series pins per Cast Member per day. "Hidden Mickey Pin" is featured in a small box on the backstamp of each pin.
Each year a new series of "Hidden Mickey Lanyard" pins is introduced.
The Walt Disney Parks & Resorts Merchandise Team creates these pins. They are created so Disneyland® Resort and Walt Disney World® Resort Cast Members in ALL lines of business can trade unique pins with Guests. The Disneyland® Resort has a Hidden Mickey Lanyard Series that is different from the Walt Disney World® Resort Hidden Mickey Lanyard Series.
