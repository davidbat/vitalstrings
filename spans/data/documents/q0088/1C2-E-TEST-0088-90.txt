Dear Disneyland Guest Communications,   On Tues Jan 3, Myself  and my two daughters visited Disneyland Park. We come about once a year or two, and this was my Christmas gift to them. I have been coming to the park my whole life of 41 years and I have seen it very crowded on many occasions, but NEVER like this day. I know what its like during the holidays but this was exceptional. There was so many people there that it was very difficult to get from one line to another. Many of the rides kept stopping or closing and re-opening. We would be waiting for a ride, then we would be told the ride was closed (pirates,Indiana Jones, space mountain to name a few) so we walked back and forth all day to get on very few rides. We were stampeded and pushed around all day. Every so often large rushes of people seemed to all be running in one direction or another, probably to get to a parade or event and every time we were stepped on or shoved. There were thousands of disabled people and strollers everywhere, and I only could imagine something happening, like an earthquake or fire to set off all those THOUSANDS of people into a crazy stampede. Scary thought. If people push and shove to get to a ride, what might happen in a bad situation Why do you let SO MANY people into your park For $80 per person I would expect to have a much nicer and SAFE experience. This was absolutely the worst and I regret spending my money and time with my kids at Disneyland that day. Please do something about this, and please consider the safety of your very loyal customers!   Thank You, Marisa Tarpey
