If my last Disney Parks Blog post about WonderGround Gallery in the Downtown Disney District left you “wonder”ing what the big deal was about this new, uncommon art gallery, then check out this amazing video shot on opening day of this popular new location, complete with behind-the-scene chats with several of the artists.
I have to admit, as far as store openings go, this was by far a favorite of mine. The entire vibe of the store – the artists, the cast members and guests – was pure energy! Now, I will admit DJ Wendy brought her own mix to the party as people jammed around her, but I think the space, the art and the artist signings were a surprise and delight to all who came by.
Some of opening day’s most popular pieces included Maruyama’s Hipster Mickey , Svengsouk and Aoyama’s Let Off Some Steam, and Bonatakis’ Swear You’ll Take Us, as well as the debut of one-of-a-kind Vinylmation 95 platforms by several of the artists. Curious about these artists and others? Did you know that once inside the location, you can actually scan QR codes for some of these pieces to find out more about what inspired the artist to create the piece, along with other fun facts and tidbits? For a look at the WonderGround Gallery art and more, visit the Disney Insider .
There’s so much more to see, so I encourage you to stop in as July will bring new artisans and live performances by our Artist in Residence for the month, Miss Mindy.
So if you haven’t had the chance to stop by WonderGround Gallery yet, then put it on your calendar for the month ahead and make sure to put this hip hot spot on your “must-visit” list next time you’re in the neighborhood.
