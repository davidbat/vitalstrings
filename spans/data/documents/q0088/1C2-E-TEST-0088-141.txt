Disney churros are amazing. I swear they must be sprinkling these perfect cinnamony sticks with Tinkerbell's wings ground up in there or something, because they are addictive. Disney churros are wonderfully soft in the middle with a perfectly crisp outer layer, and the sticks are covered in delicious cinnamon sugar. Yum!
After I have one, I'm ready for another. The only thing that deters me is that I have to save room for a corn dog. Who am I kidding? I'd buy two for myself and double fist it if I didn't fear the judgment of the smiley Disney cast member. No self control with these at all I tell ya!
Anyone who bitches about these being overpriced because they could get a churro for $1 at Costco is clearly not paying attention to the taste. Besides, paying a lot for food at Disney is a given. The churros are actually one of the more reasonably priced snacks as far as your options go. Also, it's so easy to walk around with it and it's not messy like a turkey leg. Treat yourself and grab a churro to snack on while you wait in line.
