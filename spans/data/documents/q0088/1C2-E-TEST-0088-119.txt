Zorro at Disneyland
Great Gift For The Vintage Disneyland Fan!
Take a trip back in time to Disneyland almost 50 years ago and pose just like the guests in the vintage shot on the right—and it’s so simple!
>>Use the convenient drop-down Paypal menu below to pick between traditional Black & White or glowing Color 5x7 and whether you want 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4- prints (the more you buy, the more you save!).
>> Email me up to 4 photos of the people you’d like to see in the Matterhorn cutout and the date you’d like on the sign. Photos that work best are clearly focused straight-on shots from the neck up. If you have less than 4 people, no problem! A vintage cartoon face (see photo on the right) will be substituted for the empty spaces.
Ta-da! Your souvenir Matterhorn photo should be on its way in about a week, shipped Priority Mail. Now wasn’t that easy?
