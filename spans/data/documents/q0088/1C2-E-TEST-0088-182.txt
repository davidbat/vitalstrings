Join us!
This group is open to everyone who loves Disneyland, the "Happiest Place on Earth"! This group offers many opportunities to visit the Disneyland Anaheim Resort, including California Adventure and Downtown Disney. We are in touch with Disneyland "insiders" regarding upcoming events and we'll let you know right here about everything coming up! Passholders will be able to take best advantage of most events, but everyone is free to join the Club!
You can also keep in touch with us by visiting the Disneyland Fan Club Blog at http://disneylandfanclub.blogspot.com or by subscribing to our Twitter account at http://twitter.com/#!/DisneylandFans/
Rob hosts many of our events, but we are always interested in expanding our Leadership Team and meeting new people who wish to organize, plan, and/or host events. This group is of, by, for, and about the members! Let your voice be heard and let's do the activities and things that you want to do!
Thanks SO MUCH as always for joining and being a part of this group!
