In 1991, Disney announced the plan to build a second gate in Anaheim, WestCOT, a west coast iteration of Epcot, in place of the existing Disneyland main parking lot, but due to various reasons the project was canceled in 1995, which led to the idea of Disney’s California Adventure (DCA), a park to celebrate and pay tribute to California, providing a  similar experience to stepping inside a California postcard. DCA was  part of the plan to expand the one park property and convert it into a  greater, multi-day vacation resort destination which would be able to  appeal to a greater audience – similar to Walt Disney World resort.
The construction of DCA began in 1998, as part of the Disneyland Resort expansion project which included the new theme park, the Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel, Downtown Disney, and the renovation of the Disneyland Hotel and the Paradise Pier Hotel,  and was completed in 2001. DCA occupies the site of the former parking  lot for 5,000 vehicles, and parking is now provided in the multi-level “Mickey and Friends” parking structure, giving space for more than  10,000 vehicles.
