Disneyland Park
Read our weekly Disneyland Park Update for current news about the Disneyland Resort.
Disneyland. The park that started it all. From this idea that started with Walt Disney wishing there was someplace both parents and children could have fun the "theme park" industry has grown. Something more than just an amusement park, the Walt Disney Company continues to lead the industry, now with eight parks around the world.
Though since surpassed in scope and scale by Walt Disney World in Florida, those who prefer Disneyland feel it retains more of the heart and magic that went into its creation. Situated on 75 acres of what used to be an orange grove, Disneyland has seen a lot of change since it opened on July 17, 1955, to half-finished attractions, iffy plumbing, and immediate popular success.
This park guide will not only give you all the most current information about Disneyland but will attempt to convey the scope and nature of change over the last 50 years. Perhaps the biggest change is that Disneyland has grown beyond just being a theme park into being part of the larger Disneyland Resort, so make sure to check out the Disneyland Resort page for resort-wide information about such topics as tickets, parking, travel information. Also for access to the Disney's California Adventure park guide and information about the three resort hotels.

Park Hours - Hide Section
Park Hours: Disneyland is open seven days a week, every day of the year, holidays included. Hours vary by day of the week and season. Disneyland generally opens earlier and closes later than Disney's California Adventure.
 
Upcoming Hours: Park hours are subject to change without notice. Hours can be confirmed at the official Disneyland Web site .
 
Magic Morning: Magic Morning is a ticket bonus add-on for 3-, 4-, or 5-day park hopper tickets purchased directly from the Disneyland.com Web site or through selected ticket resellers. Each ticket can be used for one Magic Morning entry, which are on each Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Magic Morning entrance allows you into the park one-hour before park opening and access to Main Street , Fantasyland , and Tomorrowland . Most shops and dining on Main Street will be open. Select stores and rides in Fantasyland and Tomorrowland will also be open. While specifics can change without notice the rides normally open during Magic Mornings are:
Tomorrowland: Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters , Disneyland Monorail , Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage , Space Mountain
Additionally, guests of the Disneyland Hotel , Grand Californian Hotel , and Paradise Pier Hotel can also take advantage of any Magic Morning by showing their room key with park admission. As always, these details are subject to change without notice and for any reason so be sure to confirm current details.
 
Mickey's Toontown Morning Madness: Toontown Morning Madness is a ticket bonus add-on attached to most tickets included in travel packages purchased through Walt Disney Travel Company. Each ticket can be used for one Toontown Morning Madness during your stay and will get you access to the Mickey's Toontown land inside Disneyland one hour early (usually, the land opens one hour later than the rest of Disneyland). Rides inside Toontown won't be running but there will be plenty of character meet-and-greet opportunities and the chance to tour the character houses without long lines.
Toontown Magic Mornings are currently available each Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (as always subject to change without notice). This means that on Saturdays it is possible to combine use of both a Magic Morning and Morning Madness ticket add-on if you have them.
 
Late Departure: There are currently no programs or offers that would allow you to spend extra time in the park at the end of the day. However, for an hour after official closing, stores on Main Street remain open "for your shopping convenience."
Facilities - Hide Section
ATMs: ATMs are located at the Main Street Bank, immediately to the left as you enter Frontierland from Main Street, in Fantasyland near Enchanted Cottage, and in Tomorrowland. The ATMs are provided by Chase and will charge a fee for non-account holders.
City Hall: Disneyland's City Hall is just inside the left train tunnel as you enter the park. There you'll be able to get almost any question answered, as well as file complaints or — hopefully — compliments.
Disney Dollars: Disney Dollars are the private currency of Disneyland. Any cash accepting location inside of the park will accept Disney Dollars as well. You can purchase Disney Dollars at several locations inside of Disneyland, including the Disneyana store and the Emporium, both on Main Street. Purchases of Disney Dollars can be made with cash or credit card, and one good tip is that to avoid the fees at the ATMs, you can purchase Disney Dollars instead (they will show on your credit card bill as a purchase and not a cash advance). When making a purchase with Disney Dollars change will be given in U.S. currency. Disney Disney Dollars can be returned for cash at any location that sells them, though there is a limit (around $40) to how many Disney Dollars may be returned without the approval of a manager. Unused Disney Dollars can be spent at Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure, and anywhere at the Walt Disney Resort. They are not accepted at Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland or the Disney Cruise Line.
Equipment Rental: Strollers, manual wheelchairs, and ECVs can be rented inside the park. Rentals are a flat price for the entire day. If your rented stroller goes missing through the day you can return to the rental station (near the right train tunnel as you enter the park) for a replacement. Strollers rent for $15 (two for $25), wheelchairs are $32, and ECVs are $70. Both the wheelchair and ECV prices include a refundable $20 deposit. During peak periods a joint rental operation for both parks may be set up in the Esplanade area between Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure; during slower periods of the year each park runs its own rental operation immediately inside each park.
First Aid and Baby Care: The first aid station and baby care center are located right next to each other at the castle end of Main Street. Take a sharp right as you pass the Kodak Photo Store and go behind the corn dog wagon. The baby center provides a quiet place for feeding as well as size appropriate toilets. The first aid station can provide over-the-counter medicines for aches or pains as well as bandages for blisters and other minor maladies. If the matter is more serious they can refer you to the nearest hospital facilities or get you the assistance needed. The first aid station is manned by registered nurses.
Lockers: Lockers inside of Disneyland are located halfway down Main Street on the right side (as you approach the castle) next to Main Street Cone Shop. Sizes available there are small and large. Three locker locations are also available outside of the park: a large locker room (also containing just small and large lockers) is positioned to the left of the entry gates outside of each park and three sizes of larger lockers are found in the picnic area, outside the security checks on the Downtown Disney side. Rental prices are $7, $10, $11, $12, or $15 for a locker, depending on size. Bills and credit cards are accepted, no change is given. A single payment pays for the entire day and you can open and close the locker without further charge.
Restrooms: Restrooms are of course easily found throughout the park, with varying levels of amenities and theming. Some smaller restrooms are in out of the way corners and the closest restroom may not be where you think. See our Happiest Potties on Earth guide for more details on the restrooms of Disneyland than you'd think anybody would ever want (but you'd be wrong).
Kennel: There is a kennel available for dogs and cats just outside of Disneyland Park, to the right of the main gates. The fee is $20 per day and pets can not be left overnight. For all dogs over four months of age, rabies and distemper vaccination certificates are required.  Cats over 4 months old need proof of vaccination for rabies, distemper, hepatitis, panleulaopenia, rhinotracheitus and calcivirus.
Smoking: Smoking is allowed in only designated areas in the park. Disneyland has three such areas. They are in Fantasyland across from the Matterhorn Bobsleds, in Frontierland just past the exit to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and in New Orleans Square next to the Harbor Galley.
The Lands (Areas of the Park) - Hide Section
Disneyland is divided into eight "lands" or sections. Each land has a theme it tries to stick to, with rides, shows, stores, and dining to choose from. Clicking on one of these links will take you to that lands page where you can learn general information, history, and trivia as well as drill down to all the options within that area.
