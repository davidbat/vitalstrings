 
Disneyland Park Overview
Disneyland Park has attracted millions of visitors since it first opened its doors more than 50 years ago. When you enter Disneyland, the cares and worries of the day are left behind. Once you enter Disneyland Park, you’re transported to a fantasy world where elephants can fly and pirates serenade.
Disneyland California is most certainly a land of enchantment where children and the young at heart find that dreams really do come true. Disneyland Park is a seamless blend of yesterday, today and tomorrow. Smiling train conductors, marching bands and the clip-clop of horse drawn carriages bring you back to carefree days. You can also rocket through the galaxy, board a runaway train or trek through the jungle. Laughter is always in the air, with friendly smiles all around. The secret to Disneyland is its ability to change yet, remain the same. As Walt Disney said "Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world."
