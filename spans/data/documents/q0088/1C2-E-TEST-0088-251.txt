I Can Draw!  Part II
In a recent post I gave an overview of the Animation Academy where you can learn to draw a Disney character in a 20 minute session. 
In Part II of this overview, I wanted to share that this experience is for just about every age that can hold a pencil.  Well, maybe not a 5 month old, but I think you know what I mean.
My 3-year old daughter is a BIG fan of Jack Skellington so as we walked by Animation Academy we saw that there was a lesson about to begin to learn to draw Jack.  We headed over and began our lesson.
She was so excited to see a tab with a giant piece of paper and pencil for her in her seat.  I told her we were going to draw Jack and she couldn't wait!
I told her to follow the Disney animator along on the big screen.  She did very good listening and copying what she saw.  Here's a comparison between my drawing and hers in the same stage.

Once we finished, I was so impressed with her drawing!  It was so beautiful and she was so proud of her work!  
For comparison, here's my drawing so you can see what she was copying.
This is going to be framed in the house!
Since my last visit, they begun posting the characters and times of when you can stop by to draw your favorite character.
