Our vacation can be summed up in one word. Perfect.
- Eric from Canada
We went to Disney World with a group of 15 people ranging in age from 3-65... we never waited in a line for more than 10 minutes.
- Angela from CA
We went into the parks you recommended for each day and waited at most 10 min - even for Splash Mountain at 11:00 in the morning.
- Elizabeth from NH
A little planning goes a long way to increasing your overall satisfaction with your vacation.
- Wesley from Canada
I was so impressed w/the touring plans we used. Our longest wait in line was 42min for peter pan. We rode several of the rides many times.
- Nikki from MI
It truly was the best purchase I have ever made... everyone else was complaining of wait times & we waited no longer than 10 minutes!
- Stacey from Canada
It's great. Recommended the site and m.touringplans.com to others while at the park. They loved seeing what we had!
- M. from CA
The website is easy, the book is wonderful, but the touring plans are BRILLIANT!  ... [We] were able to ride every attraction we wanted multiple times.
- Margo from PA
We had amazing touring in EVERY PARK with no waits. I will always always follow your advice and I pass that advice on to everyone I know that plans to visit WDW
- Melissa from TX
After our last two disasterous Disney vacations... where we fought crowds every day and spent most of our time trying to be patient, this vacation was a real treat.
- Tristy from WA
VERY VERY AWESOME TO THE MAX!!!!!!
- A parent of 2 from PA
We used Lines ALL of the time and by selecting the right parks based on the site information we were able to do most attractions and all parks in 2.5 days.
