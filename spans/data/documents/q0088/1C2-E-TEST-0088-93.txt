Here age relives fond memories of the past...and here youth may                savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated                to the ideals, the dreams and the hard facts which have created                America...with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration                to all the world."

�I could never convince the financiers that         Disneyland
was feasible, because dreams offer too little collateral.�
--Walt Disney
Today, Disneyland, is one of the biggest tourist attractions on the         globe. That fact makes it a little difficult to remember that over 45         years ago, Walt Disney was advised by every amusement park operator in         the country that the amusement center he envisioned would fall flat on         its face. It's also difficult, after Disneyland�s many years of         unbridled success, to recall that following the madhouse opening, most         media commentators declared the Park overpriced, badly managed and a         likely candidate for a quick and early demise.
Walt Disney, of course, ignored the bad press the same way he ignored         all self-appointed experts. The idea of an amusement park unlike any         other had been in the back of his mind for at least 20 years before it         was actually born.
�It started,� Walt said later, �with my taking my two kids around         to the zoos and parks. While they were on the merry-go-round riding 40         times or something, I'd be sitting there trying to figure out what you         could do that would be more imaginative. Then when I built the new         studio in Burbank, I got the idea for a three-dimensional thing that         people could actually come and visit. I felt that there should be         something built where the parents and the children could have fun         together.�
Artist-architect John Hench, who worked on Disneyland from its beginning         (and on Disney films for 15 years before that) recalls when he first         heard about a Disney amusement park: �It was back in the forties. I         lived on Riverside Drive in Burbank, quite near the Studio. I remember         several Sundays seeing Walt across the street in a weed-filled lot,         standing, visualizing, all by himself. I remember one feature was going         to be a singing waterfall, just one of several ideas. But the longer         Walt thought about the park, the more ideas he got, and suddenly the         weed-filled lot wasn't big enough.�
Walt said �It was something I kept playing around with. I'd bring home         plans and work on them over the weekend, then I'd go and get a draftsman         to lay it out and plan it for me. He worked on my personal payroll, and         I had to reimburse the Studio for him.�
Ken Anderson, longtime Disney art director, remembers being one of those         pulled from cartoon features (and the Studio payroll) to work on         Disney's personal project. He recalls that some weeks Walt remembered to         pay him, and some weeks he didn't. But Disney would always make good on         his forgetfulness, and he always did it in crisp new bills that he         failed to count very accurately. It was always more than Anderson         received by check from the Studio.
For all of Walt Disney's early planning, his business partner and older         brother Roy didn't take it very seriously. To one correspondent in 1951         he wrote: �Walt does a lot of talking about an amusement park, but         really, I don't know how deep his interest really is. I think he's more         interested in ideas that would be good in an amusement park than in         actually running one himself.�
�Whenever I'd talk about the idea of the park to Roy,� Walt         reminisced, �he'd always suddenly get busy with some figures. I mean,         I didn't dare bring it up. But I kept working on it, and I worked on it         with my own money. I borrowed on the insurance I'd been paying on for 30         years, and sold my house in Palm Springs to get Disneyland to a point         where I could show people what it would be. My wife complained that if         anything happened to me, I would have spent all the family money.�
By late 1953 Disney had stretched his personal resources to the limit.         At that point, television, in the form of the American Broadcasting Co.,         came to the rescue. ABC had been after Disney to produce a weekly show         for their struggling network. Disney agreed--in exchange for partial         financing of his amusement park. Loans and an investment from the Santa         Fe Railroad covered the rest, and with money secured, work began on         Disneyland in earnest.
Studio employees were taken out of their old jobs of cartooning and set         to work on their boss' latest endeavor. Architects, engineers and         designers were hired. Bill Martin, an art director from Twentieth         Century Fox, came in on the early stages of planning and was amazed at         Disney's attention to detail.
�He went over my plans with a fine tooth comb. I'd drawn sidewalks on         the blueprints with square corners and Walt said: �Bill, people aren't         soldiers! They don't turn in at sharp angles! Curve the sidewalks! Make         the corners round!����� Martin adds, he knew from long experience that it         was easy to cheat on a drawing and make it look better than it was. He         insisted on models and statues being made.�
Walt's employees responded to the new challenges, and helped out when         troubles arose. For instance, there was difficulty obtaining         architects� drawings of turn-of-the-century buildings, so         animator-director Ward Kimball contributed rare books of drawings from         his own collection.
When technical problems arose to block an effect Disney wanted, he had a         serene faith in his staff's abilities to overcome them.
�I was trying to work out a rainbow-colored waterfall for the Mine         Train ride,� says artist-designer Claude Coats. �I thought I had the         thing working pretty good when Heinz Haber, a scientific colleague of         Werner Von Braun's who was working at the studio, came in. He looked at         my set-up, and said it was impossible to make it work for more than a         couple of days. After that, the different color waters would splash and         run together and turn to gray. I told Walt what Heinz had said about the         rainbow waterfall being impossible to bring off. He just winked at me         and said: 'It's kind of fun doing the impossible.' So I started working         about twice as hard and figured out a way to make it work.�
Ground for Disneyland was broken in summer 1954, and an impossible         deadline of the following July was set. Beyond that time, the money         would completely run out. Crews worked double shifts to get finished.         Walt visited the site daily, and still found time to oversee the         burgeoning television and motion picture production at his studio in         Burbank.
�The last few months before Disneyland opened were particularly         hectic,� says Ken Anderson. �In the two weeks before opening day, we         developed the �Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea� exhibit almost         from scratch. I was up all night with two other studio artists just         before opening day painting the giant squid.�
�Walt, who was supposed to be at a party with his wife, Lillian, was         giving a tour for some VIP�s at the Park, but he was too nervous about         everything being ready on time to stay there. He went around from ride         to ride and exhibit to exhibit, checking work, and helping out. He even         came in where we were painting the squid, put on a mask and did a little         painting himself.�
Bill Martin remembers other last minute problems: �The big pirate ship         in Fantasyland was only half completed opening day. It was no more than         an empty shell and we only had time to paint half of it, the half facing         the public. The rest remained bare wood. And two days before opening,         Sleeping Beauty Castle sprang a gas leak. There were little blue flames         burning all around it, but fortunately, we were able to get it fixed.�
Unfortunately, reporters were present to record opening day. The         buildings might have been all painted, but street asphalt was still         soft, and only a handful of rest rooms were operational. Rides broke         down under the stress of opening day crowds. Tempers flared as people         were cordoned off from the special show areas where 22 live television         cameras were set up to record festivities. The show went on the air on         time, but it showed barely-controlled chaos, with miscued cameras and         dead mikes.
After that shaky 1955 start, the public and media's enthusiasm for         �Walt's new toy� grew steadily year by year, entertaining millions,         while becoming one of the premiere tourist attractions of our time.
