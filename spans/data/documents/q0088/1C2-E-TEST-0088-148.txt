Disneyland's statistics, which are readily available to the public, include facts and figures about the park's number of visitors, its most popular rides and attractions, and, unfortunately, the number of accidents that have occurred. Individuals use this information when planning a trip or when deciding which of the five Disney resorts to visit.
Visiting Disneyland
If you are looking to visit Disneyland, statistics show the best time of year to attend is between January and Memorial Day, with the exception of Spring Break, which is usually around the middle or end of March. From Labor Day until Thanksgiving is also another good time of year to visit as well. Statistics also show that Tuesday through Thursday are the least busy days, and Saturdays are busier than Sundays. Forget long weekends such as Labor Day or Fourth of July when the park is about three times as busy as normal weekends.
Since it is usually sunny in Southern California, weather normally doesn't play a factor in deciding when to attend. However, if rain is in the forecast, you can expect the park to be busier the days leading up to the inclement weather.
Disneyland Statistics: Attendance
According to the Themed Entertainment Association , roughly 14.7 million people visited Disneyland in 2008, second only to its sister theme park Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, which drew just over 17 million visitors. Comparatively, Disneyland's reached the following record numbers in regards to attendance since it opened on July 17, 1955:
September 8, 1955 - one million
December 31, 1957 - 10 million
April 19, 1961 - 25 million
June 17, 1971 - 100 million
January 8, 1981 - 200 million
September 1, 1989 - 300 million
July 5, 1997 - 400 million
January 12, 2004 - 500 million
Ticket Prices
Just as attendance has increased over the years, so has ticket prices . Disneyland statistics show that from 1982 to 2009, there have been 21 adult ticket price hikes, some twice in one year. However, in those 27 years noted, there were no increases during 10 of those years.
When the park opened, visitors paid $1 to get into the park, but that did not include the price for rides and attractions, which cost roughly $2.50 every eight attractions. In 1982, when the park stopped charging separately, the price of an adult ticket was $12. In 2009, the price was $69.
Rides and Attractions
Some of the more interesting Disneyland statistics are about the park's rides and attractions. For instance, the most popular rides at Disneyland, which also have the longest lines and offer FastPass, are:
Autopia
