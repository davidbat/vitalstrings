Listen for the music from the nearby            band organ
Disney Trivia: This attraction loads and              unloads painfully, insufferably and excruciatingly slow, often              making for an unbearable, intolerable and agonizingly long wait at              peak times. So if this is on your must see list do you and yours a              favor and hit this one early.
 
Disney Tip: Often times it              is debated as to whether Dumbo is worth the wait. It’s your vacation              you be the judge. One thing that can help is the "Chuck Bubba Relay" as described in Bob Sehlinger’s book "The Unofficial Guide to              Disneyland" It is performed as follows:
One parent will wait in line with bubba. The other parent allows a              certain number of people to get in front of them (32 in the case of              Dumbo) and then gets in line. When Bubba finishes his ride they then              exit and little Bubba is passed to the other parent. Bubba can enjoy              two Dumbo’s for the price of one wait
 
Disney Trivia: When former President              Harry Truman visited Disneyland® park in 1957, Dumbo was one of the              few attractions he didn't ride. Truman didn't want to be associated              with a character related to the Republican party.
This attraction opened in 1955 but              not on Disneyland park's opening day. It was remodeled and relocated              in 1983.
