Disneyland - Rides,                  Secrets, Hours & More
All you ever wanted                  to know about Disneyland
Disneyland is the happiest place on earth, and this site is                  dedicated to a review of all things Disneyland, in particular,                  the Disneyland located in Los Angeles, California (or to be more                  exact, Anaheim).  We are in no way affiliated with                  Disneyland, but instead review, with no bias, Disneyland rides,                  attractions, local businesses and more to help you when planning                  the happiest vacation possible.
In addition,                  we explore Disneyland's other theme park in Anaheim, Disney's                  California Adventure.  While a smaller park, it has plenty                  to offer visitors, including rides you won't find in Disneyland                  and one of the all time favorite attractions, Disneyland's                  Electric Parade.
If you are planning a trip to Disneyland, please take a look                  through our site, browsing the topics to your left.  Want                  to know what Disneyland ride you can't miss, or what the park                  hours are on any particular day?  How about some of the                  guarded Disneyland secrets, the hidden Mickey's around the parks                  or even the secret club located within the park?  It's all                  here in our reviews!
