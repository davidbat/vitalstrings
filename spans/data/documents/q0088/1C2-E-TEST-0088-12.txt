Get Oriented: Disneyland Map
Disneyland was the original theme park, the one all others took their inspiration from. After more than fifty years, you could call it the granddaddy of them all, still popular and for many, still the Happiest Place on Earth as Walt Disney called it.
The theme is simple: take a scene or a classic Disney story: Peter Pan's flight over London or Alice's trip to Wonderland and re-tell it in a ride. At Disneyland, you might find yourself looking for Nemo, careening wildly down the road with Mr. Toad or zipping through the Temple of Doom with Indiana Jones.
Disneyland California is a place designed to offer something to the whole family, with lots of rides gentle enough that the whole family can enjoy and only a few roller coasters that could be called tame by modern standards. Disneyland is perfect place for a family getaway.
