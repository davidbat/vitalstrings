Introduction
Located within Disneyland,    discreetly above the Blue Bayou in New Orleans Square is perhaps one of    Orange County's finest five star restaurants. With a limited membership    of only 487, Club 33 is not open to the public. Members may however    arrange for their friends and associates to experience the club. 
If you are a Disney fan, we truly cannot express what a tremendous    experience Club 33 has to offer. 
Presidents of the    United States, leaders of foreign nations, dignitaries, actors, and    business leaders from around the world have all enjoyed the club. It is  not unusual to be enjoying your meal, only to have a famous actor or    well known celebrity sitting at the table next to you. There are many    such stories, just ask any member or Club 33 staff. 
We hope you enjoy this    web site, finding it informative and entertaining.
