When Walt Disney trotted out his famous mouse in 1928, he won the hearts and minds of America ’s children - and founded an empire that, with its conjured innocence and relentless focus on the bottom line, has become synonymous with America itself. After conquering publishing, film and TV, Disney decided to give physical form to his imaginary world. He opened Disneyland in 1955 and, a half-century later, the crowds - and profits - are bigger than ever.

As you approach the gates, loudspeakers inform you that you’re about to have the ‘happiest day of your life.’ Warning: this may be an exaggeration. Still, you can’t help but be amazed by this alternate universe, where each detail has been carefully ‘imagineered, ’ from the pastel sidewalks to the personal hygiene of the park’s 21, 000 employees (called ‘cast members’ in Disney-speak). While kids tend to swoon over it all - the costumed greeters, the singsong music, the movie tie-ins - some grown-ups find it all a little creepy. Keep such doubts to yourself to avoid trouble (just kidding).
For Disney, too much is never enough, and in 2001 the company opened Disney’s California Adventure (DCA). Located right next to the original park, DCA pays ersatz tribute to the state’s colorful history and natural wonders.
In an effort to reflect Disney’s pristine grounds, the city of Anaheim recently completed a $4.2 billion face-lift widening and landscaping access roads. They’ve cleaned up run-down stretches where hookers once catered to over-tired dads. And they’ve established the first police force in the US devoted specifically to guarding tourists (they call it ‘tourist-oriented policing’).
