Disneyland Address
Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.
The castle reaches a height of 77 feet. The drawbridge of the castle actually works but has been used only twice: first when the park opened in 1955 and when Fantasyland was rededicated in 1983.
When the moat around the castle is dredged all the money found is given to charity.
Below is the Disneyland Address. We also have information about the Disney World Address .
Los Angeles is also a great place to live, so if you are thinking of moving, you can find some nice Los Angeles Apartments near the Disneyland area.
