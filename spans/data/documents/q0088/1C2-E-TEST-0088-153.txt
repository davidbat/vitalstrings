Disneyland® Park
In a Magical Kingdom not so far away - somewhere between a place where you wish upon a star and dreams come true - Disney heroes and heroines live in fairytales that are, happily, never ending.
Endless fun in five magical lands
Pick one that's for you... or pick them all!
Experience your favourite Disney Lands just as you remember them from the classic Disney stories where fairytales really do come true.
Amazing attractions
Thrills that come in all shapes and sizes
Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain Mission 2 offer big thrills for the grown-ups, while little ones can sail around the world at "it's a small world". Of course, family fun can be found in every corner of the Park, from "Pirates of the Caribbean" to the "Mad Hatter's Tea Cups".
