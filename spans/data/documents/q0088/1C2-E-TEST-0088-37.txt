DisneyLand, located in Anaheim, California, was one of the first theme parks in the United States. Disneyland was the vision of Walt Disney; he wanted a place that was clean, safe and that parents would enjoy as much as the children.

.  He was able to realize his dream at the age of 52 when the park opened on July 15, 1955. That opening day was not successful due to a terrible heat wave; it was 115 degrees F in Anheim that day. In fact, that heat wave lasted for 15 days and almost caused the park to go out of business right at the beginning.  However, by 1965, 10 years later, 50 million parkgoers had visited Disneyland.

Disneyland has expanded beyond its old borders and today it consists of Disneyland Park, Disney's California Adventure Park, and Disney's Downtown District.  It also includes Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel and the Paradise Pier Hotel.
