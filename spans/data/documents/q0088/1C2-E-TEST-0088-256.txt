One unique characteristic of this resort park is that it is the smallest as far as Disneyland resort parks go. This is often considered as a negative point and holiday goers are encouraged to visit bigger Disneyland parks. However, it is pertinent to note that a small park too has its own share of attractions. Most of us love the huge expanses of Disneyland resorts. However, some people prefer small parks that are more compact and make the visitors feel as if they are enjoying all that the resort has to offer. One has to make more than one visits to the Disneyland resorts in US, Paris and Tokyo to experience all that it has to offer.  On the other hand, that will certainly not be the case when you are spending your holidays in Disneyland Hong Kong. If you have visited various Disneyland resorts and if you want a change, then spending your holidays in Disneyland Hong Kong is a very good idea.

The Space Mountain ride takes you into the future and you will get the feeling that you are riding in outer space with the fancy special effects, lighting and ambience. If you prefer a more �down to earth� ride, then you can opt for the boat ride within the resort itself. This boat ride is no less than thrilling than a ride in outer space.
