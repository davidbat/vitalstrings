Disneyland     Resort/ California Adventure Admission Prices
I used to provide all the prices for all the types of admission to the Disney  Parks but, as prices are now no longer published by Disney and change so often,  the best way to get accurate information is to visit the Official Disney Website  at:
 
www.disney.com
 
If you want to avoid the queues, you can     buy your passport at any US Disney Store, and some overseas branches.
If you arrive at a busy time, cross over to the       Disneyland Hotel where you can buy your passport at reception. Then take the       Monorail directly from the hotel over to the Park. Be sure to avoid the hotel's       busy times though (11am-12pm when everybody's checking out, and around 2pm-4pm       when everybody's checking in!). In any case, the queue at the Park Gates       usually recedes by 11am).
