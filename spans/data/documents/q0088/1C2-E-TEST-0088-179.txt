Cars Land And Route 66 – A First Look
June 20th, 2012 | Author: Glenn
As you may know, my family and I were fortunate to obtain tickets  for the Annual Passholders preview, It took place  on  June 10, 2012. Our tickets were for the 6:00 p.m. entrance into the park, and was to be topped off with a special showing of the Word Of Color.
 
We left early that morning, and arrived around 3:30 that afternoon,  after checking in at our Hotel, we quickly made our way to the Parks to claim our wrist bands for our long awaited entrance to the newest area of the Disneyland Resort, “Cars Land”.
We first entered the main gate, and made our walk through Buena Vista Street,and I’ll say that was a first in a long time, to enter Disney California Adventure Park and not be routed around to the back door to get inside. You can read more about my thoughts on Buena Vista Street here.
 
When our entry time of 6:00 came along we made our way over to the Wharf area to be able to enter through the stone arch at the back side of Radiator Springs.

The first glance was stunning to say the least. To be able to look in any direction, and not have your view interrupted with a fence, was a treat. The scale of the work that was done to create this Cars Land was finally able to be comprehended.
Yes I had peeked over the fences before, I had even seen photographs taken from the top of the Mickey Wheel.  And even watched every Disney media release put out,  But you can never grasp the size of this place till you put yourself right in the middle of it.
