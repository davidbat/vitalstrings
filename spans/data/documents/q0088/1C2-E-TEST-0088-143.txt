Disneyland was designed, built, opened                         and actually operated by the genius Walt Disney. The park opened in 1955 and                         has been visited by over HALF a BILLION visitors since then. It is the second                         most visited theme park in the entire world (behind the Walt Disney World Magic                         Kingdom in Orlando Florida).
Much                        like the theme park in Florida, Disneyland California Theme Park is divided                        into themed areas or "lands":
Mainstreet USA - designed to                        look and feel like a typical midwestern town from the early 1900's, Main Street                        is the first area you come to when visiting the park.  At the far end of                        Main Street sits Sleeping Beauty's Castle and the hub that will direct you to                        the various other lands.
New Orleans Square - You'll                        feel like you stepped back into "Old New Orleans" when you visit New Orleans                        Square.  This is also home to 2 of the parks most popular attractions: The                        Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean.
Adventureland - for jungle adventures and a journey into the heart of darkness.  The                        remote jungles of Africa or Asia come to mind as you hop on such thrilling                        rides as The Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones' Temple of the Forbidden                        Eye!  Tarzan's Treehouse and The Enchanted Tiki Room give this land a full                        slate of options, from thrill rides to relaxing.
Fantasyland - This is the part of the park that stretches your imagination and takes you                        back to your childhood.  With fantastic rides like Peter Pan, King                        Arthur's Carousel and it's a small world, you'll find yourself drawn back to                        Fantasyland over and over during your day.
Mickey's Toontown - This is                        the best place to find your favorite character for photos and autographs.  A LOT of the characters like to hang out here and around the 2 main rides:                        Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin and Gadget's Go Coaster.
Tomorrowland - Looking towards                        the future with innovation and invention.  Some of the hottest rides in                        the park are sitting in Tomorrowland.  From Space Mountain roller coaster                        to Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster to the famous Star Tours, kids and adults                        will both LOVE this part of the park.
Frontierland - It's like the wild, wild west all over again.  Cowboys, Indians, saloons                        and a wild and crazy time.  Whether you're riding Big Thunder Mountain                        Railroad or searching around Tom Sawyer's Pirate's Lair, you'll have gosh darn                        fun experience.
Critter Country - Watch out                        for bears!  Country bears, that is.  Between the Disneyland Country                        Bear Jamboree and Splash Mountain (a thrilling water ride), you'll find                        yourself staying in this forest area for a lot longer than you expected.
