05/09/2012Great game for the family. My daughter and I can play together to accomplish the challenges. We played for hours once we got it installed. There is also free roaming so you don't have to complete the challenges to see the scenery.

01/25/2012My only complaint is that it's not active enough. And I can't seem to find a setting to make it more challenging. Granted it's Disneyland, and is probably intended to be easy for kids. It gets me over the Disneyland withdrawals though, for those days I need some Disney but can't make it to the parks...

01/25/2012When we first bought this for our 7 year old, we thought he would be the only one playing on it. Boy were we wrong! We all love playing on it! The smaller children especially love giving the characters hugs! I love skiing with my hubby. The older children said that it was better than going to the park itself! It works wonderfully for the kinnect, we've never had a problem. It gives all of us a great workout while spending quality time with each other.
