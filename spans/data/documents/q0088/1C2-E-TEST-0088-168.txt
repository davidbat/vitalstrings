 
Cars Land - Disney California Adventure® Park Grand Re-opening - June 15th 2012
The wait is almost over, and the magical transformation of Disney California Adventure® Park is nearly complete! The grand re-opening is on June 15th, and your whole family will get to enjoy the re-imagined and exciting new additions: Cars Land and Buena Vista Street. The moment you walk into Disney California Adventure® Park you will be transported to Buena Vista Street, and back to the 1920s, when Walt Disney first set foot in Los Angeles. Take a ride on the vintage Red Car Trolley, and be sure to stop by the Carthay Circle Theatre, which is the re-creation of where Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered nearly 75 years ago.

Guests will step right into the life-size, 12 acre version of the Disney•Pixar Cars movie, because Radiator Springs has been brought to life with this all-new land! In this new land, guests will meet Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater, race on the stunning rock formations and waterfalls of the Ornament Valley on the Radiator Springs Racers, fly in Luigi's Flying Tires, and hitch a ride in Mater's Junkyard Jamboree! Guests will also want to try out the amazing food locations in Cars Land, like Flo's V8 Café and the Cozy Cone Motel, which features menu items like Cone Dogs and Chili Cone Queso. At night, Cars Land will turn into a beautiful sea of neon—just like it does in the movie Cars! Whether it be day or night, the expansion and immersive storytelling is something for the whole family to enjoy!
Get ready to make some new memories in the original Disney Park, Disneyland® Park.
