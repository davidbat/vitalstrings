FAN DAY 2006
- Thank you to EVERYONE who made the second Disney Star Wars day such a
success!!  It was a lot of fun, and the group photo went off better than ever!  Even Disney Cast Members commented on the efficiency
of the photo.  We hope everyone had fun and enjoyed the sneak preview of the Pirates ride!

FAN DAY 2005
We had over 120 people show up for the 2005 event and we raised $100 for American Cancer Society!  It was the very first Fan Day and it went off in a success!  The Group Photo turned out great, even though things were pushed forward due to changing parade times.
WHO: All Star Wars Fans from all over the United States! 
Join us June 24th 2012
THIS WILL BE OUR 8TH YEAR!!!
at Disneyland California!
WHAT: June 24 2012. Star wars fans will be at it again. Join us for our 5th unofficial fan day at Disneyland California. We will take a large group picture in front of the castle at 2pm. Please don't be late, and remember to smile (and don't blink!)
WHERE: Disneyland California
WHEN: June  24 2012, we'll meet in front of
the Castle at 2pm for the big group photo.  Please do not be late! 
Star Wars fan clubs usually meet for lunch at Pizza Port at noon. All Fan Force, 501st, and Rebel Legion members AND JUST ANY FAN invited!
WHY:  Why not?  It started as a protest to Disney about the lack of Star Wars Weekends here at our Disneyland and has now turned into a massive fan get together!  This year, we're pushing harder for a cause, all shirt sale proceeds for the event go straight to the American Cancer Society!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
·Are you guys affiliated with Disney or LucasFilm?
- Nope.  This is all for fan, by fans.
 
·» Can I get a picture of the Group Shot?
- Because of time constraints and holding up traffic in front of the castle, there will be only TWO photos taken. 
One by our Photographer (which will be posted on this site after the event) and one by a Disneyland Photopass employee which can be purchased at Disneyland.  We will re-announce this before the group shot.
·» Are there any events planned at Disneyland?
- No, I'm afraid anything special would be too costly or take too much time. So there's nothing except the fan clubs meeting for lunch, and a group viewing of the Jedi Academy Show.
 
·» Can I dress up for the event?
- Sorry, Disneyland doesn't allow people in costumes as you might be mistaken for a Cast Member. Please Feel free to wear any Star Wars shirts you might have!
 
·» Can I help you guys out?
- Well, we have a pretty good size group of people helping out with the planning and such, but the BEST way to help us is to spread the word! Like us on Facebook ,   Post about it on message boards, submit the event to newspapers, magazines, radio stations, TV shows, etc!  Let's try and get as many people as we can and show Disney there are Star Wars fans on the West Coast!
