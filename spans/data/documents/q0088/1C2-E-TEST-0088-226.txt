Upon receipt of the letter the Club 33  secretary will forward an information packet. Please allow six to ten weeks for  the arrival. This packet will contain current pricing, membership privileges and  a brief introduction and history of Club 33.
After reviewing the information you may then  submit a written letter requesting to become a member and therein be placed upon  the waiting list. A letter of confirmation requesting to be placed upon the list  is most important, as many who receive the information packet do not re-contact  the club. It would not be efficient to place everyone on the list based upon a  single contact letter or inquiry.
Please keep in mind, this is a very formal affair and  guidelines are in place to assist in expediting your membership.
Calling the club to determine your exact  location on the list is not recommended and normally the club will  not  disclose your exact position. They may express an approx. wait time based in  years. We recommend to refrain from calling, as the club is quite busy.
The list moves slowly, please be patient.
As the list moves, the club may send you a  letter of intent, confirming you wish to remain on the pending membership list.  A series of these letters were dispatched April of 2007. This procedure is  completed to confirm that would-be members who have been on the list for a high  number of years are still interested. Many applicants during such a  span of time may have moved or re-located for employment reasons.
