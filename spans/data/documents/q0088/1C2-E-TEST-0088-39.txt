One of all-time favorite places!. Even though it is super expensive, there is not much better place than Disneyland. Every year I get the annual pass for me and my daughter (the one without blackout dates trust me is the way to go) and I really do get my money's worth by the end of the year. There are so many great rides that we never get tired of no matter how many times we have been on them! Peter Pan, Pirates....and the parade and water and fireworks show are just magical. I love coming after work just for a few hours when we think, what should we do? Lets go to Disneyland!!!! And when you have a annual pass, you don't have to worry about paying to get in or for parking! The best!â€¦
