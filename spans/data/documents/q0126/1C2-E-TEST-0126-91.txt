"St. Thomas Aquinas, taught that Faith is supported by                    Reason. If we have a intellect, we have to reinforce our                    beliefs with solid arguments. This group can help one and all                    to do it. Thank you for accepting me as your friend."

"I have never left a single oppurtunity to grab hold of                    anything that's related to Catholicism including this very                    'Konkani Catholics Group'."
