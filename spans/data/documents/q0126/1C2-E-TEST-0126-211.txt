Religion has jumped at any chance to claim events like that as a sign.
Remember this one.
Tears of Virgin Mary:* Religious Apparitions have occurred throughout
history. Two very good examples or religious apparitions that were
world-changing were the appearance of Jesus Christ to the
Christian-persecuting, Saul of Tarsus, who later came to be known as the
Apostle Paul and the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mohammed, who
dictated the Koran forming the basis for the Islamic world as we know it
today.
A staue of the Virgin is depicted weeping tears of blood inside a small
chapel in Caracas, March 20, 2003. Hundreds of Venezuelan Catholics are
flocking to this chapel, where the statue has been depicted weeping tears
of blood as a peaceful message against the US - led war with Iraq.
