- We are a new Bible focused local church (since Sep-08), committed to serve our Lord Jesus Christ in the Central Mumbai region.
- We are committed to the primacy of the local body being built through prayer and the systematic exposition of God’s Word (Acts 6:4; Eph.2:20).
- We believe this to be the only foundation on which Christ dynamically builds His church for a life of obedience marked by holiness and a fellowship of sacrificial love. (Acts 2:42; 1Pet. 2:5).
- We believe our witness in word and deed of His grace in the gospel of Jesus Christ will be used by Him in ministering God’s reconciliation to the world around us. (Matt. 28:18-20;  2 Cor. 5:18-19)
“Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!” – Ps.115:1
