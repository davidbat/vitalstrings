Fr. Larry Pereira
Message from the Parish Priest.
One evening two disciples walked from Jerusalem to Emmaus with slow steps, heavy hearts and gloomy faces.
On the next morning they walked back to Jerusalem with a spring in their steps, joyful hearts and cheerful faces.
What brought about the sudden transformation?
It was their encounter with the Risen Lord that changed their sadness to joy and their despair to hope.  As we celebrate the feast of the Resurrection of the Lord may you be aware that he is with you to fill you with hope.
Life, with the Risen Lord, is endless hope.
Life, without the Risen Lord, is a hopeless end!
