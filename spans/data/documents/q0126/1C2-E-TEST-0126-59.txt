Parish
Our parish is reputed to be the third oldest in the Archdiocese of Bombay. Established in 1560, the Church was re-built in 1930 and erected as an independent parish in 1945. Our parish is also considered the Mother-House of the Small Christian Community (SCC) Movement in the Archdiocese of Bombay, since the inception of the SCCs took place in our parish community in June 1984.
God has blessed us with a vibrant community. The presence and power of the Spirit is experienced from within by its members and externally by those who witness His presence through the manifold services and ministries we are engaged in. The parish community drew up our Vision-Mission statement and we are proud to own it. Our Vision challenges us to live as a family, as well as to be a home and school of communion with Jesus and His Spirit. In the light of this Vision, we perceive our Mission as oriented to organize vibrant liturgies, faith formation programmes, encourage Bible study groups and seek in different ways to translate spirituality in action.
