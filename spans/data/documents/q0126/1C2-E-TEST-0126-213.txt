The Internet is a great place to look when you are seeking a new opportunity to serve God in ministry. It is also wonderful for churches and other ministries seeking to fill new positions or vacancies. When I served on my church's pastoral search committee, the Web quickly helped us find many excellent candidates. We saved months of slow research. Using e-mail, we communicated almost instantly and received answers to our detailed questions from each candidate. In a matter of weeks, our congregation was able to meet, interview and hire the top candidate, a qualified Christian youth pastor we found 1400 miles away. The whole system worked great for him and for us.
Here are some of the best places to find Christian ministry employment information—whether you are looking for a job or searching for the right person to fill a position.
