Significance: Shrine of Virgin Mary
Best time to visit : August to September
Velankanni is located 12 km south of Nagapattinam on the Coromandel                  Coast, in Tamil Nadu. The shrine here is dedicated to Our Lady                  of Health, the Madonna of Velankanni and is popularly known as                  'Sacred Arogya Matha Church'. Virgin Mary is believed to have                  miraculous healing powers. Thousands of pilgrims belonging to                  various castes and communities flock daily to this 'Lourdes of                  the East'. The church has an imposing facade with tall spires                  and the wings present the shape of a cross. In a niche in the                  alter is enshrined the statue of Our Lady of Health.
In 1560, Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to a shepherd,                  asking him for milk to quench the thirst of baby Jesus. When the                  shepherd returned to his master, after performing the good deed,                  his pitcher kept filling up with milk. Consequently, a small thatched chapel was built at the site. At the end of the 16th century,                  Virgin Mary appeared again in front of a lame boy, who regained                  the use of his limbs. The actual church was constructed after                  the incident.
The tradition is to offer Our Lady of Health, a candle in the                  shape of the respective ailment- a heart in case of cardiac complications,                  a liver in case of jaundice, lungs in case of tuberculosis and                  so on. In case of the ailment getting cured, many bring with them                  small gold and silver replicas of parts of the body that has been                  cured to donate to the church.
Some times offering are sent in sealed bottles or big hollow bamboos                  duly closed and thrown in to the sea with the address of the shrine                  written on them. Such offerings are believed to reach the holy                  spot. There is a small church museum which has a display of the                  offerings made by those whose prayers were conceded.
A festival is celebrated for ten days from August 28 to September                  10 every year and pilgrims from all over the country and even                  abroad flock to the site, bathe religiously in the sea, have their                  heads shaved and then walk on their knees or roll up to the shrine                  as rituals.
