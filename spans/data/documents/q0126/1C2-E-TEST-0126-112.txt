What is the process to obtain an annulment from the RC Church- Mumbai? - - from Jessica?
I kind of saw this question a bit late. If you are a catholic and you are looking for one. its one of the most difficult things.
As what Mr. Vijay mentioned legally irrespective of the Church Anulling a marriage only a Divorce through a court is valid.
But keeping the religions sentiments which many of us in India are bound to, to have the second marriage recognised by the church: below is how it goes -
Catholism kind of preaches against Divorces and its only Annulment that takes place. For this you would need to go to the local Bishop Palace / Archdioce and meet the Church's Judicial Vicar, present your case. Once the Judicial Vicar accepts your case you and your spouse would be put before the Church's panel and cross questioned, there would be arguements, submission of evidences and after this the Legal team of the Church investigates and only if convinced gives a decree of annulment.
Now this rarely takes place unless Adultry is proved and which is next to impossible!!

And Adultry can be proved only if caught red handed publicly!!
There is a shortcut for this - Go through the courts get a legal divorce and then using the decree/vedict send a legal notice to the Church the Church will be forced to abide by the law of the country and Nullify your marriage!!
