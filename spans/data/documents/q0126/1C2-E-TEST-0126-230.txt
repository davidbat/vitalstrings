Navathy celebrations (1920-2010) of Kollam Mar Thoma Church, Thevally
      - By Sri. N.M. Mathew, 
          Kollam  Pattanam, once the capital of Travancore, being an important  trading  centre also, attracted many to settle there for trade purposes.  A number  of young Marthoma families with school-aged children living  in this  Pattanam found it necessary to have a church in the community  that they  live.
         So  they started coming together for prayer and worship. Rev.   V.I.Philipose, (1883-1966) Vadsakanazhikathu, Kundara gave them the   necessary leadership and they formed a congregation. The Most Rev.   Titius II, Mar Thoma Metropolitan (Mar Thoma XVI) granted its   recognition as a parish in 1920. Rev. V.I.Philipose was the vicar.   Having 14 parishes under his leadership, Rev. V.I.Philipose found it   difficult to carry out his duties, metropolitan appointed Rev. P.E.   Mathew, Neduvelil, Kozhencherry as the vicar who served this parish from   1936-1944.
           The parish organized a one week long Navathy celebrations from November  7 to 14, 2010. The debut Holy Communion service was celebrated at 7.30  am  by the parish vicar Rev. Johnson Varghese. In the evenings meetings   were conducted in the church. Main speakers were Dr. Mohan Varghese  (Mar Thoma College, Tiruvalla), Dr. K.V. Varghese (Rtd. Professor, Mar  Thoma College, Tiruvalla), Rev. Vinod Victor (Co-ordinator,  S.A.Ecumenical Partnership Programme, WCC) and Evangelist Ampotti,  Maramon.
            November 14, 2010  was the Parish Day. Rt. Rev. Thomas Mar Tiimotheos Episcopa  (Trivandrum-Kollam Diocese) celebrated Holy Communion at 7.30 am. 16  children received their first communion on that day.
             This  was followed by a meeting presided over by the Diocesan  Thirumeni.  Retd. Justice of the Supreme Court of India, Padma Bhushan  Justice K.T.  Thomas was the Chief Guest. Senior citizens 75 years and  above were  honoured. Endowment Scholarships were awarded to deserving  students.  Clergy Service Board was unveiled and the Parish Directory  was released.  Sunday school children presented various programs, which  were  commendable.
              They  did not forget their members who were great leaders of yester  years.  Mr. T.M. Varghese, (leader of the State Congress, & Minister), Padma  Bhushan Justice K.T. Thomas, (Retd. Justice of the  Supreme Court of India). Evangelist George Kakkanadan (Senior) and  others.

Churches should listen to criticism: Mar Chrysostom
  - By Adv. Nalloor Sir,          
                  Valiya Metropolitan of Mar Thoma Church Philipose Mar Chrysostom has  said that  the church denominationsshould ponder over the other side of  the truth to know  the real and complete truth.
                  Inaugurating the first-ever general body meeting of the Christian  Editors  and Writers Society at Maramon Retreat Centre near Kozhenchery  on Friday,  Philipose Mar Chrysostom, who was instrumental in convening  the unique event,  said that to understand the other side of the truth,  the churches should listen  to criticisms. The assessment of works  undertaken by the churches for the  society should be made by others,  Mar Chrysostom said.
                  Churches  should be ready to face criticism so that proper correction  could be  made, if necessary. Christian editors should understand the real truth   and publish articles that could enlighten the mass, the Valiya  Metropolitan  said. Mar Chrysostom said that the coming together of the  Catholic, Orthodox,  Protesant and Pentacostal churches under the label  of Christan Editors could  augur well for opening a new chapter in  Ecumenism. The Valiya Metropolitan  called upon the editors for  launching an awareness programme against  liquor. Editors Society  president Fr Paul Thelakkattu presided over the function.  Secretary  Mathew Koshy Punnackadu welcomed the gathering. Thomas Mathew, D   Benjamin, Pastor Philip P Thomas, Rev A T Abraham, Joseph Pulikunnel,  Rev V T  John and Jose Parakadavil spoke.

About this house:
(i) It is the first Christian Church
(ii)   This is also known as the Upper Room where Jesus had his Last Supper   with his disciples. At present this room is underground because the   streets of first century Jerusalem were at least 12 feet (3.6 meters)  lower than those of today.
(iii)  This house belonged to the Mother of Mark. (Mark the evangelist who  traveled with Paul and who brought Christianity to Egypt).
(iv) After crucifixion disciples gathered in this house. (Mark 16:14, John 20:19)
(v) It was here Thomas answered, “My Lord and my God”. (John20:28)’
(vi) From here they went to Mount Olives for the ascension.
(vii) It was here the disciples were together on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1).
(viii)   In 1655, Mar Gregorios Abdul-Jaleel, Patriarch of this Church in   Jerusalem consecrated Mar Thoma I (1653-1670) of the Malankara Church at   Niranam, in Kerala.
Bethlehem.
                  “Peace based on justice only will give safety to the human race,” said  Dr.  Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan in his introductory message at the  Wider  Ecumenical Meeting, held at the conference hall of the Shepherd  Hotel in  Bethlehem on September 28. Mar Thoma continued, “Middle  Eastern countries should urgently find solutions for their internal  problems. People should be able to live in peace.”
                 Palestine Tourism Minister H.E. Daibes-Abu Dayyeh inaugurated the  meeting.

Joseph Mar Thoma- The loving touch to Church and society at large :Oommen Chandy 
- By Sri. Abijith Parayil,
                           (This is a Dubai Marthoma Parish Press Release)
                Sri. Oommen Chandy, Opposition Leader ,Kerala Legislative Assembly and   Former Chief Minister of Kerala opined that Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar   Thoma is the Great Shepherd with a loving and caring  touch to both  Church and  society at large. He was delivering the key note address on  the 80th  Birthday celebration of the Metropolitan at Dubai Marthoma  Parish's  felicitation ceremony.  
                 Sri. Chandy commented  that through Thirumeni's attitude which overcomes the challenges of age and health and also the  creative style which envies the youth, makes us  think that His  Eminence is only 50 years  young and not 80. This comment filled the  whole space with applause. The stand  which Thirumeni used to take at  the times of crisis and problems  attracted people of all denominations  to him. His Project "Snehakaram",  which tends the sick and needy to  make way for his Birthday celebrations  is highly appreciable. These  kindhearted Birthday celebrations justifies His  Eminence's deeds to the  society and the fellow human beings. 
                 In His Grace's reply, Thirumeni underlined the   advising  words of his predecessor Late Dr. Juhanon Mar Thoma  Metropolitan -"To  taste  God Almighty in the situations which are  perturbed by the storm and the  winds,  trusting that He is The Only  Good God and by knowing that take  each step forward  in life", had  always played an impact  in His Eminence's life.'I have  never contested  in any elections,  never got into any positions with  canvassed votes,  all projects which were steered were runaway success,  all because of  the blessings of  God Almighty alone' remembers the  Metropolitan.
                  Thirumeni also recalls taking  the leadership of  many organisations  at the times of  crisis;   KCC  (Kerala Council of Churches), NCC  (National Council of Churches), CASA  (Church's Auxiliary for Social  Action), Mar Thoma Yuvajanasakhyam,etc.,  are only a few  to  say. Thirumeni proudly declares  how God's Grace was sufficient in  dealing with times of crisis,mostly  financially in the  organizations,  citing as examples. With much pride  Thirumeni  wants to share how  the  task of handling a project like  getting  the songs of the Great Maramon  Convention was made into Audio  cassettes under his leadership,  underlines the oppositions he had  undergone to get these into a reality  and now it is one of the  main  source of revenue to the Church. Also,  Thirumeni admits that he had to  face criticisms and hardships in his  life but  is happy to the fact that  under the faithful shadow of the  Almighty he  withstood strongly.
                 Recollecting the  lines of felicitation  letter, by the then Late Catholicose of the East, on   Thirumeni becoming an Episcopa  goes as follows- " let me  express the   happiness on your becoming an Episcopa of the Church and also express  my  hearty Sympathies to you" , Metropolitan said that on each and every   step he had taken these words were echoing in  him which made the  crowded gathering  bursting into laughter.
                The gathering was presided by the UAE  vicar Rev. V Kunjukoshy, Asst.  Vicar Rev.Thomas Mathew, Student Chaplain  Rev. Zachariah Alexander,  Rev. Saju Papachen,  Edavaka Secretary Sri. Sajan Veloor, Trustee Sri. K Y Thomas, Sri. Yohannan Baby, Sri. K A Varghese,  also felicitated Thirumeni.
                 Adv. Varghese Mammen, Sri. Varghese  Mangat, Sri. Victor T Thomas, also were present.

             Sri. Mathew was  born in Alappuzha in 1917 as son of Sri. KC Mammen Mappila of the famous  Kandathil family, and Smt. Kunjandamma.  After taking his BA degree in  economics from Madras Christian College,  he joined the family concern,  the Malayala Manorama group.
              He became the managing editor of  the Malayala Manorama  group of  publications, Kottayam in 1954 and was appointed editor in  1973. Under  Mathew’s leadership, the group scaled new heights of growth  with the  circulation of the group’s flagship publication, Malayala  Manorama  newspaper, crossing a reported 1.5 million copies a day.
              Those  who knew Sri. Mathew  closely say that his prime passion was media business  and he was  always careful to ensure prime place for Malayala Manorama  newspaper  that his grandfather Kandathil Varghese Mappila founded in  1888. Sri. Mathew  was respected also as the greatest integrator of media  business in  Kerala. He always ensured that the Malayala Manorama group  was the  first in Kerala to acquire the best and most advanced  technology.
              His leadership also helped Malayalam Manorama enter  the visual media  field with a 24-hour news channel, Manorama News, and  an FM radio  channel, Radio Mango. He also started a journalism institute  in  Kottayam, Manorama School of Communication  (Mascom).

He was also presented with the BD  Goenka Award  in 1996 and the Press Academy Award in 1997.
                  Sri. Mathew  was almost  always the face of Kerala in international media  conferences. He is said  to be responsible for the healthy competition  in the field of Malayalam  media which led to its stunning growth in  terms of numbers, turnover  and repute. Sri. MP Veerendrakumar, the managing editor of Mathrubhumi daily,  the closest competitor of Malayala  Manorama, remembered Sri. Mathew as the doyen of Malayalam media industry.
 
                 Sri. Mathew was also a member of the  Managing Committee pf the  Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and a  permanent invitee to all the  Association meetings. He was faithful and  loyal to his church and  contributed to the Church's growth in whatever  ways he could.
