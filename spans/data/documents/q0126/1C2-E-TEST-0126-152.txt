I was wondering about the article on celestial or communal God.......I do not understand what was being said about the combining of all religions? I am just very confused on what the author meant.....is this article upholding all religions as correct in the sight of God......b/c I thought as Christians we uphold the cross...Jesus Christ, as the only God of all...well according to the Bible we are. God Bless u all!

The Author of this article is not addressing the subject 'Christian Salvation'. Regarding this, Your view is correct. What he     emphasize is the inter religeo tolerance which is the most important need of this     turbulent age. Love being the most important substance of the New Testament Christianity, the tolerance to be     exhibited by the Christians is utmost. Thanks (LOL)

I was recently introduced to LOL and was impressed by your effort to reach the Kerala Christians worldwide. In times where divisions and calamities abound, an attempt to bring the various    Christian groups together is indeed remarkable. As your guest writer, the honorable bishop of the Mar Thoma Church pointed out, let us accept those things we can agree on and respect our differences. I would like to invite your readers to go beyond the mere acceptance of our    similarities, but whole heartedly participate in a celebration of these.  Keep up the good work. Let us get more churches involved in this effort. May God bless us ALL.

"He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come! see the place where the Lord lay." (Matthew 28:6)  Jesus would have been killed several times. King Herod tried to kill Him when He was a baby (Matthew 2:16); Satan tried to persuade Him to jump from a high place (Matthew 4:6); the people of Nazareth attempted to throw Him over a cliff (Luke 4:29); and on several occasions, the Pharisees sought to kill Him. So the death of Jesus was not the victim of chance, but on the contrary, He willing gave Himself to the will of God. He had to go to the cross (Luke 22:42), but not because He was forced to, but because He wanted to. He did it for us out of love.  He was "the Lamb of GOD slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8). At the right time Jesus died on the cross as a ransom for many. On the third day He has risen as He said!  When Peter and John ran to the tomb after hearing from Mary Magdalene that the tomb was empty, they both ran to the tomb and "found the linen cloths lying there, and the napkin that was on His face was not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself....and when the other disciple (John), came to the tomb....he saw and believed" (John 20:1-10).  The folding of the napkin is a Jewish custom which is being done by a distinguished guest as an appreciation to the host for their warm reception. It is a thanksgiving for their food and a hope for another invitation to dine. That means "would come again". In the empty tomb, Jesus left the napkin as a sign for all that "He was risen, but would come again."  JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD AND OUR SAVIOR, DIED FOR OUR SINS AND MADE US ALIVE FROM THE DEAD OF TRESPASSES AND SINS; AND INDEED HE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD AND WE ALSO WILL RESURRECT LIKE HIM WHEN HE RETURN BACK AND BE WITH HIM FOREVER. IF JESUS HAS NOT RISEN FROM DEATH, NONE OF US HAVE ANY HOPE AT ALL BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO RESURRECTION FOR US.  WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY EASTER

To my brothers in the "Pathrayarkis side" I like to ask whether they could tell from the new testament, of any "appostholan" being subjected to the administrative control of another "apostholan", or any church he set up administered by another church set up by another "apostholan". Can they really deny the functional independence of early churches set up by different "apostholans".

MARCH 2002:
All is set for the historic Malankara Association at Parumala, the holy site of the Malankara Orthodox Church or the Indian Orthodox Church.  The representatives of the Indian Orthodox Church from all over the world will decide on March 20 whether the St.Thomas Christians of India should show any sort of allegiance or loyalty to the Patriarch of Antioch or the present Catholicose Moran Ougen Prathaman Bhava ,the supreme head of the Malankara Orthodox Church, still need the Antiochean Patriarchâ€™s "Kaiveppu" in order to sanctify the priesthood of people wish to serve the GOD joining the Indian Orthodox Church. The same day the representatives will decide the Malankara Orthodox Church can have only one Supreme head and that will be the present Catholicose and His Holiness Moran Mar Beselios Marthoma Mathews II will be the Malankara Metropolitan.
A split in the Malankara Sabha has become inevitable. The decision taken by the Bhava Kakshi, the faction of the Malankara church owing allegiance to the Antiochean Supreme not to send their representatives to the Malankara Association to be held on March 20 as per the directives given by the Supreme Court of India and their decision to hold a parallel Association in Puthenkurishu to take an oath similar to the Koonan Kurish Sathyam taken by the St.Thomas Christians to liberate the Indian Orthodox Church from any foreign bond are the clear indications that the Malankara Sabha is ready to separate itself in to the Indian Orthodox Church and Syrian Indian Church. We, the orthodox Christians believe this will end the decades old bickering in the Malankara Orthodox Church.
After March 20, there will be no more Methran Kakshi or Bhava Kakshi in the Malankara Orthodox Church and the Church will be known as Malankara Orthodox Church or Indian Orthodox Church or a proper name that the Association, Synod and the Malankara Metropolitan decides to assume. The majority decision taken in the presence of the Justice V.S.Mulimud, the representative of the Supreme court of India cannot be challenged in any court in India as is evident in the Supreme Court verdict issued last year which both Methran Kakshi and Bhava Kakshi agreed upon.
March 20 ,2002 will start a new chapter and a new era in the history of St.Thomas Christians in India. It will mark the beginning of the Indianization of the St.Thomas Christians. In this new era we still need to continue the good relationship we had with Antiochean patriarchs but in a different perspective and I hope the Antiochean Patriarch, Bishops and believers will understand the need of the Indian Orthodox Believers in the New Millennium. We still have to have good relationship with other Orthodox believers like Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, and American Orthodox etc. etc.

Happiness is a mere illusion. As human being we are bound by so many natural and unnatural restrictions. When we experience those restrictions, happiness is mere illusions. The question is how do you design the word happiness. Was wise Solomon a happy king? Was his father David a happy king?. He cried out for happiness. Was rich tax collector Zaccius a happy person. Theory not necessarily correlate with practability. Recently a man wrote to Dear Abby's column, says he is perfect and normal individual in every aspect of his     life (giving charities, loving, understanding toward others, etc) but don't believe in God. Physiology has something to do with happiness than the theology. Imitative happiness is not a normal happiness. One can't copy from some one or something on happiness for self-utilization. An healthy personality develop a happy personality without any imitative influence.

The feelings of our most reverend Bishops in India seem to be very critical of capitalism and globalization. Capitalism, restrained by the rule of law, has produced in America the most prosperous and wealthy people in history. Where else but in the Western world are the poorest people more likely to be overweight than the richest of the rich. Freedom of the markets is coincident with democracy and the rule of law. I see no virtue in redistributive policies which limit the individual's capacity to gain wealth if his wealth came not at the expense of others. Henry Ford and Bill Gates were both men of great wealth, but the industries they created were able to allow the whole nation to become rich and prosperous as well. The moral of the American story is that capitalism is at worst morally neutral from a Christian standpoint. Capitalism is strictly an ECONOMIC system. Socialism, communism, colonialism, and other previous economic systems have attempted to be comprehensive socioeconomic systems and have all proven to be impractical, and oft times horrific failures. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, and the many other so called socialist revolutionaries have the blood of more than a hundred million souls on their hands. Capitalism, like democracy, is not a perfect system, but it is the best economic system in the world today. The third world today is not receptive toward capitalism, which can be expected. While America has it roots in a largely middle class heritage. India, among other nations has an ancient heritage of caste system, even among Christians. Poverty, in the third world, is more a social problem then it is an economic issue. The best solution to the problem of poverty in India is to furiously attack and dissolve the social attitudes toward the poor and dispossessed. Equality of incomes is not so nearly as important as the equal protection of laws for all men, regardless of religion or caste. The first step in destroying poverty is to offer freedom and the rule of law to all people.
