Christianity in India
About 2.5% of Indias population         are Christians. Christianity arrived in India almost         about the same period as it arrived in Europe, meaning         about 2000 years ago. Christianity originates in Israel.         The first Christians were Jews and in the beginning         Christianity was seen as a Jewish cult. Most of the         Apostles of Christians acted in Europe to convert the         Europeans to Christianity. But one of the Apostles, St.         Judas Thomas, arrived in India and converted Indians to         Christianity. St. Thomas was a carpenter and a disciple         of Jesus. He was brought to India by a merchant to build         a temple. St. Thomas arrived in Kerala, in south India         in 52 AD. He succeeded in converting local Indians to         Christianity. His converts were called Syrian Christians. One assumption says that some of the Syrian Christians were actually Jews converted by St. Judas Thomas to Christianity. The disciples of Jesus at first intended to convince the Jews to adopt the philosophy of Jesus as new Judaism.          Later on other Christian saints arrived to India as         missioners. But most of the Indian were converted to         Christianity by the missionaries who arrived in India         with the European powers from 15th century.
The European powers arrived in         India for commercial reasons, especially spices. But they         also started converting local Indians to Christianity.         Five European countries sent their representatives to         India, Great Britain; France; Denmark; Netherlands and         Portugal. Of the five European powers the Portuguese were         most enthusiast to baptize Indians. The Portuguese were         the first European power to arrive in India. Their first         ship, under the leadership of Vasco DaGama, arrived in         south India in 1498 after it had circled the whole         continent of Africa. The Portuguese inspired by the Popes         order to baptize people around the world not only fought         wars against the local Indian rulers, but they even tried         to enforced their Roman Catholic prayers on Syrian         Christians.
After many wars the Portuguese         were defeated by local rulers and they had only one big         pocket of control in India, Goa. The Portuguese not only         fought the Indian rulers, but they also fought against other European powers in India especially Dutch and         English. Many Portuguese churches in Kerala were turned         into English and Dutch churches after they were captured         by these powers.
The English missionaries started         acting in India at a much later period. The British,         unlike the Portuguese, didnt allow the missionaries         to enter their territory in the beginning. The British         arrived in India in 1600 and they allowed the         missionaries to enter their territory only from 1813. The         British allowed different churches to establish         missionaries in their territory. The missionaries didnt         only spread Christianity, but they also did humanitarian         deeds giving the needy basic necessities of life like         food, clothes and shelter. The missionaries also built         schools in India and many of them even today have         Christian or European originated name. The British church         missionaries succeeded less than the Portuguese in         converting Indians to Christianity, but unlike the         Portuguese who tried to enforce Christianity, these         Protestant converts were voluntary. The Portuguese were         also aware of the Indian custom according to which the         wife followed her husbands faith and therefore         married their men to Indian women.
There are about 30 million         Christians in India. The major centers of Christianity in         India are Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Manipur and Mizoram.         There is also a big community of Christians in Mumbai.         The main division of Christians in India is like in the         Christian world, Protestants and Catholic. There are also         different denomination among them, Syrian Church,         Armenian Church, Anglican Church and others. Most of the         India Christians were converted by the Portuguese. There         is also an Anglo-Indian community in India.
