 
The beginning of New Life Fellowship Church
New Life Fellowship Church began in a small way in Mumbai approximately 40 years ago. Later Pastor Joseph took on the primary leadership and during those years of serving the Lord, he took a group of young people to fast and pray for specific direction from the Lord for the NLF ministry. It was during this meeting that the Lord gave them a specific vision to reach out to Mumbai and the surrounding regions in India.
