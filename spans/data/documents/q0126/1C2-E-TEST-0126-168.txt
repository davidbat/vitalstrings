To prepare God's        people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up        until we all reach unity in the knowledge of the Son of God and attaining        to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.(Ephesians 4: 12,13 )

The late 30's saw a lot of Christian youths, who had left their native  in search of livelihood settle in Mumbai. Large number of youths felt  the need for worship services in their own mother tongue. Various  denominations of Syrian Christians (Mar Thoma, Jacobite & CMS)  joined together and organised a Malayalam worship service at St. Mary's  Anglican Church, Parel on every Sunday. The first Holy Communion Service  according to Mar Thoma Church rites was celebrated under the leadership  of Late Rev. P.J. Thomas of Angola Ashram on Sunday the 17th Nov. 1940  at St. Mary's Anglican Church, Parel.
