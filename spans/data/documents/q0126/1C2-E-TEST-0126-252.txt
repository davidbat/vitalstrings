Gazetteer of Methodist Missions:
South Asia
At the very start of the period parts of both India and Ceylon were            the East India Company’s fief, but Ceylon soon became a crown            colony and in 1859 the government of India passed from the Company            to the crown. The territories known as the Raj eventually became India,            Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma, while Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka            in 1972. The secluded mountain kingdom of Nepal opened its doors in            the 1970s to western development agencies but not to Christian missions;           officially Christianity was banned there until 1990.
