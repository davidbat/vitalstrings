GOSPEL ON KITES!
Today 'Makarsakranti' OR 'Uttarayan' is being celebrated all over India.  People fly kites with the help of cord coated with glass particles, so that  there can be fight (patch) in the sky between two or more kites. The better cord  cuts the another one and the kite cuts off from that cord and can go anywhere  and in anyone's hand.
We grab this opportunity to spread GOSPEL!! A prayer group in Gujarat got an  idea to print kites with Gospel on it. Now today more than 20,000 GOSPEL KITES  will be flown all over the main cities and villages of Gujarat state.
Please pray that God may use this kites to bring many people in HIS kingdom. We  don't know, but these kites can be caught and be read by anyone in Gujarat. Pray  that God move their hearts to repentance. In history we have people who had been  added to the kingdom of God with such simple attempts. Our great God can use  simple human ideas to do great things.
Please participate with us by praying for the kites and the people who are going  to receive these kites.
