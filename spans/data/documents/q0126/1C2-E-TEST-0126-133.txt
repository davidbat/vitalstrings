For a community numbering only in the tens of thousands, the Parsis are perhaps the most visible minority of Bombay. Originally from Persia, Parsis are Zoroastrians who arrived in India centuries ago, mainly to escape persecution. In Bombay, they became successful businessmen and landowners who established a strong relationship with the colonising Brits, thus permitting their businesses to flourish in the 18th and 19th centuries. Subsequently, many members of the community devoted large amounts of their wealth to philanthropy and the construction of their city. As a result, many of the public and private buildings of Bombay were funded in large parts by the Parsi community and carry Parsi names. The University of Bombay, Petit Library and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel were all built or partially funded by the Parsis. The tight knit community often lives in self-sufficient 'enclaves', or rather exclusive compounds, within Bombay. The most famous of such colonies is Cusrow Baug, shown in the attached photograph.
