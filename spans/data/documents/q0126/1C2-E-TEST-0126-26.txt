During 1500                    - 1600 many churches of the diocese were established: 7 churches                    (in Bassein), 20 churches (in Salsette), 3 churches (in Bombay)                    and 2 churches (in Karanja and Chaul). Among the Fathers of                    this period, two names stand out: Fr Antonio do Porto (Franciscan)                    who built churches in Bassein, Salsette, Karanja and Chaul,                    and Fr Manoel Gomes (Jesuit) who was known as the "Apostle                    of Salsette." 
The year                    1637 marks the establishment of the Sacred Congregation for the Propogation of the Faith by Pope Gregory XV, under which                    the Church work energies of various Religious Congregations                    of nationalities other than Portugal and Spain could be harnessed                    for evangelization in those parts of the world where Portuguese                    (in the East) and Spanish (in the West) Fathers were, for one                    reason or another, unable to reach. From 1622, different Congregations                    were enlisted and sent to India, Malacca, Siam, China, etc.                    under the leadership of Vicars-Apostolic, i.e. Titular Bishops                    who received directly from the Holy See jurisdiction to work                    in certain regions assigned to them within the somewhat indeterminate                    boundaries of existing "Padroado" dioceses.  
The Vicariate                    Apostolic of Bijapur was established by the Sacred Congregation                    for the Propagation of the Faith (hence forth, "Propaganda")                    in 1637. The Vicariate of Bijapur increased rapidly in size,                    absorbing Golconda, and extended from the Arabian Sea to the                    Bay of Bengal, from Madras-Mylapore to Calcutta. It finally                    came to comprise the whole of the Moghul Empire at least on                    paper; hence it was also referred to as the Vicariate of the                    Great Moghul. From the end of the 17th century, this Vicariate                    was served by the Carmelite Fathers, whose head quarter was                    at Surat, north of Bombay. It was probably in 1692 that the                    Jesuit care-taker of the Parel property was expelled from Bombay.                    That ended the Jesuit presence on the island - till 1848 - a                    full one and a half centuries later.
The Decree                    expelling the Portuguese Franciscans from the Bombay Island                    was issued on May 24, 1720. On the other hand they did not want                    to openly break the solemn promise they had made when they took                    over Bombay from the Portuguese: namely that they would not                    interfere with the religious beliefs or practices of the Catholic                    inhabitants of the island. So the British approached the Vicar-Apostolic                    of the Great Moghul, the Italian Carmelite Bishop Fra Mauritius,                    to take charge of the Catholic Community in Bombay. Since the                    British were determined on getting rid of the Portuguese Franciscans,                    Rome approved the entry of the Carmelites into Bombay. Thus                    the Franciscans left Bombay and Bishop Mauritius with four or                    five Carmelites came to Bombay. The churches taken over by the                    Carmelites were four in number: Our Lady of Hope (Esperanca),                    Our Lady of Salvation ( Salvacao), Our Lady of Glory ( Gloria)                    and St Michaels.
In 1828,                    civil war broke out in Portugal between King Dom Miguel and                    the party of Queen Maria da Gloria. Dom Miguel, to whom the                    Religious Orders lent moral and financial support, was defeated,                    and the new government not only suppressed all Religious Orders                    in Portugal but also broke off diplomatic relations with the                    Holy See in 1833. Pope Gregory XVI issued the Brief `Multa Praeclare',                    on April 24, 1838, in which he confirmed the Vicars-Apostolic                    in their office, extended their field of work and deprived the                    Padroado clergy of all jurisdiction within the established Vicariates.                    The authorities in Goa rejected the Papal Brief: though Portugal                    had broken off diplomatic relations with Rome, they claimed                    that since the Brief had not received the ``regium placet'',                    it was null and void. 
Archbishop                    Dom Jose Maria da Silva Torres landed in Bombay on his way to                    Goa in January 1844. The Padroado party, clergy and laity, escorted                    him to Gloria Church in a triumphant procession. In Gloria Church                    and in other parishes, Archbishop Torres administered the sacraments,                    began a series of visitations and generally acted as if ``Multa                    Praeclare'' and The Salsette Decree had never been written.                    The Archbishop's behaviour threw the whole of Bombay into a                    ferment.
When Bishop                    Hartmann came to Bombay in 1850, the one Catholic newspaper                    for those under the Vicar-Aposltolic's Jurisdiction was the                    Bombay Catholic Layman, run by two Irish laymen, who used the                    paper to oppose the first Bishop Whelan and then Bishop Hartmann.                    Rather than cross swords with them, Bishop Hartmann encouraged                    the starting of the Bombay Catholic Standard, under the editorship                    of another Irishman. Soon, disappointed with that paper as well,                    the Bishop approached a certain Mr Borges, a son of the soil,                    who in July 1850 had, on his own initiative, started a monthly                    publication, The Examiner. Three months later in September 1850,                    with Mr Borges' consent The Examiner became the ecclesiastical                    organ of the Vicariate under the Bishop's control and management,                    but another title, The Bombay Catholic Examiner. By 1852, the                    other two publications folded up while The Bombay Catholic Examiner                    kept on going. In April 1905, its title was shortened once again                    to The Examiner.
Hardly had                    Bishop Hartmann come from Patna to Bombay than he found himself                    in the middle of the bitter Padroado-Propaganda conflict. The                    Vicar of the Church set into motion a series of events which                    ended in June 1851 with Salvacao Church transferring itself                    to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa. Then came the                    Bishop of Macao, Jeronimo da Matta in February 1853, on his                    way to Goa. He stopped at Bombay and officiated in the churches                    of Gloria and Cavel, then he passed on to Salsette where he                    said Mass and conferred the sacraments at Kurla, Thane and Bandra.                    Sharing in the rebellious conduct of the Bishop were four Bombay                    priests: Antonio Mariano Soares (Vicar Genreal of the North                    and Vicar of Gloria Church), Braz Fernandes (Vicar of Salvacao                    Church), Joseph de Mello and Gabriel de Silva (Vicar and Assistant                    respectively of St Michael's Church). The Papal Brief of May                    9, 1853, Probe Nostis, completely vindicated the rights of Bishop                    Hartmann and confirmed his claim to the exclusive exercise of                    jurisdiction in the islands of Bombay and Salsette. It also                    condemned unreservedly the behaviour of Bishop da Matta and the four Bombay priests. In point of fact, however, his jurisdiction                    continued to be ignored by the adherents of Padroado: witness                    the series of events at St Michael's Church in 1853 which culminated                    with the transfer of that parish together with the Sion chapel                    to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa in June 1854.
The year                    1853 is also noteworthy in that it marks the success of Bishop                    Hartmann's efforts towards founding a Catholic College in the                    Vicariate. Aware of what he called "the complete want of                    educational institutions for youth'', he first invited in 1850,                    the Sisters of Jesus and Mary to take over the education of                    girls in Bombay. This was the very first Religious Congregation                    for Women to really begin work in the Vicariate. Bishop Hartmann                    then turned his attention to a College which he considered would                    be the foundation stone of the social, intellectual and moral                    renewal of the Bombay Catholic Community. He laboured heart                    and soul to bring the Jesuits to Bombay for this purpose; his                    labours were rewarded when, by the end of 1853, there were four                    Jesuits in the Vicariate of Bombay (among them Fr Walter Steins                    and Fr James Peniston).
On December                    12, 1853 the Carmelite General informed Propaganda that the                    Carmelite Fathers had decided to give up the administration                    of the Bombay Mission. The Holy See accepted their resignation                    and thus ended, after a period of 133 years (1720-1853), the Carmelite administration of the Vicariate of Bombay. On February                    16, 1854 Propaganda officially divided the Bombay Vicariate                    into the northern Vicariate of Bombay (comprising the islands                    of Bombay and Colaba, and Aurangabad, Khandesh, Malwa, Gujrat                    and Sind as far as Cabul and the Punjab) and the southern Vicariate                    of Poona ( comprising the islands of Salsette and Bassein, and                    the regions of the Konkan and Deccan or Bijapur). Further Propaganda                    entrusted the Bombay Vicariate to the Capuchin Fathers and the                    Poona Vicariate to the Jesuit Fathers. Bishop Hartmann was appointed                    Vicar-Apostolic of Bombay and Administrator of Poona.
On August                    13, 1857 Propaganda reversed the 1854 arrangement: the Bombay                    Vicariate was now given to the Jesuits and the Poona Vicariate                    to the Capuchins. When squabbles arose between the Jesuits and                    the Capuchins over the comparatively small financial resources                    of the erstwhile Vicariate of Bombay, the Superior General of                    the Capuchin Order decided to clear the foul air by completely                    withdrawing the Capuchin Fathers from the Bombay and Poona Missions.                    Thus on August 13, 1858 the Bombay-Poona Vicariate came entirely                    into the hands of the Society of Jesus.
