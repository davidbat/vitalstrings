The Western Suburbs consists of the Bandra (queen of the suburbs), Khar, Santa cruz, Juhu, Vile Parle, and Andheri suburbs of Bombay . The boundaries that this article draws for the Western Suburbs are somewhat artificial. Most people would include the suburbs of Northwest Bombay among the Western Suburbs, but that would cover too big a region.
[ edit ] Understand
These are some of the oldest suburbs of the city. In particular, Bandra has existed as a separate town almost as long as Bombay. The area started its history as a bunch of fishing villages. Then it became home to a Christian population which set up its churches, orphanages, and monasteries. It later turned into a place where Bombay's beautiful people live, a status that it holds to this day. It is a very cosmopolitan place and does not have the rundown look of the other suburbs. It still has a lot of old bungalows.
Bombay's only river, the Mithi, flows through this area and also serves as a sewage line. In the 80s, a well-intentioned attempt to set up a new downtown away from Nariman Point resulted in the establishment of the Bandra-Kurla complex. Most of the larger financial banks and companies moved to this place. This is a nice-looking place, but it was built by filling up the mouth of the Mithi river. This is said to have worsened the impact of the worst flood in the city's history on 26 July 2005.
Bombay's airport is located in this district. Most hotels are located here. Many software and BPO companies have their offices in and around SEEPZ, Andheri. The western suburbs also boast of the Juhu beach which was cleaned and cleared of hawkers in 2006.
These suburbs can get extremely crowded in the evenings, with nightmarish traffic snarls.
[ edit ] Get in
This area is served by the Western Railway stations of Bandra, Santa cruz, Vile Parle, and Andheri. Bandra and Andheri are important junctions. The western harbour line terminates at Andheri. Bandra is also a terminus for long-distance trains.
The Western express highway runs through the district, as does SV road (Swami Vivekananda Road). The Bandra-Worli sea-link provides high-speed connectivity from the downtown area. Connectivity from the Central Suburbs is, unfortunately poor. Getting in from Sion or Kurla is a pain, but with the development of the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli link road ("JVLR"). It is now a breeze getting in via Powai.
Bus services are very good. Generally, BEST's "200 & 300" series serves the Western suburbs.
Bandra Fort (or Fort Aguada), at the tip of the Bandra promontary. Built by the Portuguese in 1640 to mark the southernmost tip of the mainland (i.e. Salsette island). Not much remains.   edit

Bhel Puri on Pali Hill, a must have
For street food, quite a few good vendors exist around Bandra. A bloke called Karachi Sweets on Hill Road does a good job.

There are a lot of Udipi and Punjabi Restaurants too. For non-vegetarian tandoor you could try Jai Javan at Linking Road opp National College.
