The        Scottish Churches' Work Abroad
Scotland in India
ALL the branches of the        Scottish Church have had their part in the evangelisation of India, drawn        thither by the irresistible attraction of the country, and impelled also        by a sense of our responsibility for the moral and spiritual well-being of        Britain’s great Eastern dependency. Scotland’s most distinctive        contribution has probably been along the line of educational missions, of        which some account has already been given. Before the Disruption of 1843,        work had been begun in the three great cities. Bombay was the first to be        occupied in 1823, though the College was not founded till 1835. Duff began his great educational work in Calcutta in 1830, and Anderson in        Madras in 1837. After the Disruption, the three Colleges continued their        work under the auspices of the Free Church. Later, the Church of Scotland        reoccupied Duff’s old college and soon made it a flourishing educational        centre. In due time the two Calcutta colleges were happily amalgamated        under the name of the Scottish Churches’ College. The colleges at Madras        and Bombay have had an equally prosperous career, and it is not too much        to say that they have been one of Scotland’s finest gifts to India.
Besides the colleges, other missionary        agencies are at work in and around the three great cities. Street        preaching, medical missions, schools, and rescue work are carried on as        opportunity offers. Up the Hugli, from Calcutta, a successful mission has        been, established in the district between Chinsurah and Kalna. South-west        of Madras, Conjeeveram, the holy city of South India, has been occupied,        and, in addition to other mission work, a leper colony has recently been        taken over. At Chingleput, in the same district, a very notable work has        been carried on among the low caste people who, here as elsewhere, are        crowding into the Christian Church.
Throughout the rest of        India the Scottish Churches are at work in five different fields. These        are the Maratha country, the Panjab, Rajputana, Santalia, and the Eastern        Himalayas.
I
The Maratha country is a        somewhat vague expression, and covers a very extensive region, running        eastward from Bombay through the Central Provinces. Before the Pax        Britannica was established over India, the Marathas were a powerful        and warlike people whose name was a name of dread. As the great Mogul        Empire at Delhi decayed, the Marathas grasped the falling sceptre. Far and        wide their devastating cavalry spread till they could make the proud boast        that they had watered their horses at every stream in India. The East        India Company’s traders trembled behind their desks in Calcutta, and dug        the Maratha trench in front of the town. The inevitable collision came in        1803 when General Wellesley, afterwards the Duke of Wellington, broke the        Maratha power at Assaye. The battlefield lies a hundred miles to the east        of Poona in the neighbourhood of Jalna, both familiar names in the        Scottish missionary history. It was the most fiercely contested battle our        soldiers had up till then fought in India, and by it the Empire of India        passed from the Marathas to the British. Such things are not forgotten in        a century, and patriotic and religious pride have combined to present a        formidable barrier to the Gospel among the Marathas.
Poona was occupied by        missionaries from Bombay in 1831. It was a bold venture, for up till then        Poona had been regarded as a forbidden spot. Ten years before, the        Government, in the hope of conciliating the Brahmans, had set up a        Sanskrit College, "in which well-paid pundits taught well-paid scholars        the Vedas and Shastras in purest Hindu fashion." It turned out hosts of        men who traded on the worst superstitions of the people, and many of the        bitterest opponents of every reform were students educated at this        college. The Government had not yet learnt the truth of the great        principle laid down by Lord Lawrence that "Christian things done in a        Christian way will never alienate the heathen." It is amazing to read        to-day of the lengths to which the Government of India went in        countenancing the idolatries and immoral practices of Hinduism. British        soldiers served as guards of honour in idolatrous processions, while the        native sepoys were carefully secluded from Christian influences, and were        drummed out of the army if any made a Christian profession.
Such things were done in        the name of wise policy and with a view to conciliating native religious        feeling. It needed the terrible explosion of the Mutiny to teach the        lesson that to cultivate superstition is to foster fanaticism. Then at        length Lord Palmerston, that most opportunist of English statesmen,        declared that all were agreed that it was not only a duty but a political        interest "to promote the diffusion of Christianity throughout the length        and breadth of India."
Poona has been spoken of as "the intellectual capital of India." It is certainly a stronghold of        Hinduism, and the Brahmins of Poona have the reputation of being the        cleverest, proudest, and bitterest of their race. On a low hill to the        south of the city stands a famous temple of Parvati, the baneful influence        of which pervades the whole community. For it must ever be borne in mind        that religion in India has little in common with what we understand as        morality. However lofty may be the aspirations that breathe in some of the        ancient books of the East, popular Hinduism is a gross polytheism. The        temples have their walls often covered with lewd and abominable carvings,        and are the haunt of religious prostitutes. So at the famous shrine of        Parvati, fair young girls are bought by the priests or dedicated by their        parents to a life of shame, till, as a native Christian said, the whole        region round has "the smell of Satan."
These influences have made        the work in Poona particularly difficult, but it has been steadily carried        on, not without many tokens of blessing. As Christian education        progressed, a High School for boys was opened, and continued to render        useful service for about half a century, having at one time between four        and five hundred pupils in attendance. Unfortunately, in 1888, the school        had to be closed for lack of funds. However necessary at the time, this        has proved a calamity to the Mission, for it has not only meant a loss of        prestige, but has closed the most hopeful avenue of approach to the        educated classes. In spite of this discouragement, the Gospel has        continued to manifest its power in the bazaars and villages, in the        vernacular schools and the zenanas. One of the earliest converts of note        was Wazir Beg, a Mohammedan, whose friends threatened to murder him if he        became a Christian. He had a somewhat unusual career, for, after        completing his education in Scotland, he became the pastor of a        Presbyterian church in Australia. A more recent convert may be mentioned,        Mr. D. S. Sawarkar, L.C.E., who gave an impressive address to the United        Free Church General Assembly of 1925 on the leavening influence of the        Gospel on Indian thought and life.
Eastward of Poona the        mission has stretched a long arm as far as Nagpur, the capital of the        Central Provinces, which was occupied in 1845 by Stephen Hislop, a great        name in Indian missions, worthily commemorated in the Hislop College. The        Church in Nagpur will long cherish the memory of his remarkable career and        work, how he preached and taught and studied, how he discovered the        coal-fields of Central India, how his first convert lay four months in        prison till Hislop made all India ring about it, how he saved the English        residents from massacre at the time of the Mutiny, and how, at last, his        brave and noble life came to a tragic end, on the dark night when he rode        over the bank of a swollen stream, and horse and rider were swept away.
Another interesting centre        of work among the Marathas is at Jalna, a hundred miles east of Poona,        where a mission was established in 1862. The first converts were won from        among the Mangs, a degraded and almost servile caste, and this created a        prejudice against Christianity in the minds of those of higher caste.        Brahmins sneer and say that the Gospel is only fit for sweepers. But this        spirit was nobly rebuked by the remarkable career of Narayan Sheshadri,        whose name was once a household word in Scotland. A Brahmin of Poona, he        was converted while studying at the Wilson College, Bombay. After teaching        in the College for some years he devoted his life to the Mission in Jalna        and became the friend and champion of the low-caste people. He founded the        Christian village of Bethel for converts who were ostracised for their        faith. It cannot be counted less than a miracle of grace that this noble        Brahmin, renouncing the exclusive privilege of his priestly caste, should        have made himself the servant of the meanest of his people for Jesus’        sake—people whose very shadow in passing is pollution to a Brahmin. Such a        life surely foretells the day when, in Christ, there shall be neither        caste nor outcasts, but one great brotherhood, embracing India’s millions.

The Panjab, as its name        signifies, is the Land of the Five Rivers. It lies in the extreme        north-west, where the encircling Himalayas have grudgingly opened the        gateway of the Khyber Pass. The five rivers, gathering their strength        among the snow-clad mountains, converge in the plain and unite to form the        Indus. On the midmost of the five rivers, the Chinab, a mission of the        Church of Scotland has been carried on with marked success since 1856.
The geographical position        of the Panjab has made it the ancient battlefield of India. Every        conquering race that has entered the country, except the British, has        poured in through the passes of the north-west and struggled for empire in        the Panjab. Two of these invasions have left an indelible mark upon India.        First came our own kinsfolk, the Aryans, who entered India perhaps fifteen        centuries before Christ, drove the aboriginal inhabitants into the south        country or up into the hills, and established a Hindu empire which was        strong enough to set bounds to the ambitions of Alexander the Great.        Later, by the same route, came the Mohammedans, who founded the Mogul        Empire, and from their capital of Delhi reigned as the overlords of India.        These titanic struggles and the proximity of the wild mountains have bred        in the Panjab a people of magnificent physique—strong, proud, and fearless.
Specially worthy of mention        are the Sikhs, who in more recent times ruled the Land of the Five Rivers.        They originated in the fifteenth century as a Puritan sect of Hindus who        rejected idolatry and the institution of caste, preached the existence of        one spiritual God, and inculcated a higher moral life. These pure        religious aims became in course of time mingled with political ambitions,        and the Sikhs from being a religious sect grew to be a military power. As        the Mogul Empire decayed, they established their dominion over the Panjab.        Growing jealous of Britain’s power, and believing themselves invincible,        they crossed the Sutlej, the eastmost of the five rivers, and invaded        British territory, only to be broken in a series of campaigns which ended        in the annexation of the Panjab.
These events drew the        attention of the home public to the Sikhs, and led the Church of Scotland        to adopt the Panjab as a field for missionary enterprise. The first        missionary was Mr. Thomas Hunter, who settled at Sialkot in 1856. Sialkot is the largest town of a fertile and populous zone skirting the        base of the Himalayan range. It is a frontier military station, standing        at the head of a vast plain stretching southwards beyond Amritsar and        Lahore, and also commanding the entrance to the world of mountains on the        north. In this strategic centre the pioneer set to work hopefully. But        next year the Indian Mutiny broke out. It might have been expected that        the Sikhs, a warlike race so recently subdued, would have been ringleaders        in the revolt, but to their honour they kept their plighted word, and so        successfully had they been conciliated by the wise and Christian        statesmanship of Lord Dalhousie and the two Lawrences that they gave        material assistance in the conquest of Delhi. At Sialkot, however, there        was a momentary outbreak of trouble among Bengal troops stationed in the        province. Mr. Hunter remained at his post till the last moment, and then        in attempting to escape he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of a        body of mutineers who brutally murdered him, together with his wife and        baby.
This tragic beginning only        stirred in Scotland the feeling that Sialkot was hallowed ground. The missionary        forces of the Christian Church have often had to advance over the graves        of the fallen, and even so was it in the        Panjab. The fallen standard was soon upreared and the work went forward.        In due course stations were opened at Daska and Wazirabad, across the        river in Gujrat, and northwards at Jammu and Chamba in the heart of the        mountains.
The success of Christian missions in the Panjab is well known, and the        Church of Scotland Mission has shared to the full in this rich harvest.        When Dr. Norman Macleod lay dying, in 1872,        he described a dream which filled him with happiness. "I have had such a        glorious dream!" he said. "I thought that the whole Panjab was suddenly        Christianised and such noble fellows, with their native churches and        clergy." It is a dream which bids fair to become a reality at no very        distant date, for the rate of increase of native Christians among the        martial races of the Panjab has been about 300 per cent. every decade. There is also a considerable movement        towards Christianity among the aborigines in the mountains. As one of them        said, referring especially to medical mission work, "We have not only heard the Gospel, but we have seen       it and felt it." Hindu and Mohammedan strongholds have been severely shaken, and        there is a note of alarm and even of despair in the appeals of their        religious leaders. Take one out of many that might be quoted. "Missionaries have cast the net over our children by teaching them in        their schools, and they have already made thousands of Christians. They        have penetrated the most out-of-the-way villages, and built churches        there. If we continue to sleep as we have done in the past, not one will        be found worshipping in the temples in a very short time; nay, the temples        themselves will be converted into Christian churches." This doleful lament        seems to take us back to the first Christian century, for it reads like        one of Pliny’s famous letters to Trajan telling how, because of the spread        of the obscure sect of the Christians, the grass is growing green in the        temples of Pontus.

The United Presbyterian Church had a good claim to be        reckoned the most missionary        church in Scotland. Not content with missions in Jamaica and in South and        West Africa, it sought a new field in India after the storm of the Mutiny        was past. The field chosen was Rajputana.
Eastward from the Indus a        great desert stretches almost half-way across North India, separating the        fertile Panjab on the north from the Central Provinces. Where this desert        approaches the highlands of Hindostan lies the country of the Rajputs. The        western half consists of barren veldt which fades away into the desert and        is only saved from its encroachment by incessant irrigation. The Aravally        Mountains give more distinction of feature to the eastern half, and here        there are cities famous in Indian history. For in the days of the Great        Mogul the Rajputs maintained an heroic struggle for independence, and in        their mountain fastnesses were often able to defy the forces sent against        them. It is on record that more than once in the last extremities of a        siege the warriors have sallied out to fight to the last man while their        women within the fort made a great funeral pyre and cast themselves upon it.
The British Government has        respected the strong national spirit of the Rajputs, and most of the        country is ruled by its own native princes. This liberal policy has been        rewarded by the loyalty of these princes, who are proud of their place in        the Empire and willingly muster their forces to its aid. The measure of        independence, however, which they enjoy has at times presented a serious        difficulty to the progress of the Gospel. So the Scots missionaries found        it at the beginning of their work in Rajputana. It was easy to occupy        Ajmer, which is under direct British rule, but to gain a footing in the        native States was another matter. Against the veto of the native prince        there was no appeal, for the Government maintains an attitude of        neutrality in regard to such matters.
The Mission was begun in        Ajmer in 1860, the first        missionary being Dr. Shoolbred, who did much by his graphic pen to make        the Mission so popular as it speedily became. For six years he laboured in        Ajmer, seeing around him the proud and ancient cities of Udaipur, Jodhpur,        and Jaipur with their gates shut against the Gospel. At length the key was found, and that key was the medical missionary. It is well known to every        student of missions that the healing of the body has opened highways in        all lands for the Gospel; but Rajputana may be cited as a specially        notable example of this. Jaipur was the first to surrender in 1866. Dr.        Valentine was passing through the city when the wife of the Maharaja was        taken ill, and he was called in to attend her. Under his treatment she        recovered, and in the meantime the missionary doctor had so won the        prince’s confidence that he offered to make him his private physician. To        induce him to accept the post, he appointed him Director of Public        Instruction, and gave him full liberty to preach in the city.
Eleven years later, Dr. Shepherd        unlocked the gates of Udaipur. Cholera having broken out in that lovely        city among the hills, the people gladly welcomed him. The only opposition        came from the Maharana’s favourite counsellor. When, however, this        courtier’s own little daughter fell sick, he forgot his prejudice in        anxiety about his child, and the missionary doctor was called in. By the        time the little patient was well again her father was singing his praises,        and, soon after, the site for a mission hospital was granted by the        prince.
Not less romantic is the story of        how the door was opened in Jodhpur. When Dr. Sommerville sought to enter        in 1885, he was met by the prince’s veto. It happened at that time,        however, that an English engineer, a friend of the Maharaja, died, and his        widow, being asked what she would like for a memorial of her husband,        replied, "A Mission bungalow." So the prince, not to go back on his word,        built it. No doubt the gift was given with a grudge, but in a short time        the heart of the prince and of his people was completely won. To-day there        stands in the city a fully equipped hospital, built for Dr. Sommerville        entirely by his friends in Jodhpur, the Maharaja himself contributing        two-thirds of the cost.
Rajputana, lying as it does on the        border of the Great Desert, is peculiarly liable to suffer from famine.        Life for many of its people is at all seasons a struggle for bare        existence, and if the monsoon fails, they are immediately faced with        starvation. Disastrous famines occurred in 1869, and again in 1900. The        total loss of life will never be known, but in each case the numbers who        perished in Rajputana alone ran into millions. The scenes witnessed were        heartrending. The land was filled with starving men and women and        children. They stripped every leaf from the trees and gnawed the bark.        They tracked the ants to their nests and plundered their winter store of        seeds. They sifted the very dust of the roads to see if, perchance, some        passing waggon had dropped a few grains. The Government did everything        possible, as also did some of the native princes, but others simply sat        still and let their people die.
These years of dire necessity were        years of great opportunity for the Mission. Round the doors of every        Mission bungalow pitiable creatures flocked for help, some so weak they        could only crawl. Everything had to be laid aside for the work of famine        relief. With help sent out from home, relief works were started, doles of        food were distributed, the sick nursed, and hundreds of destitute orphans        taken in charge. Many of these last were picked up from the roadside where        they had been abandoned by their parents, many others were brought at        night and laid down at the missionaries’ doors. No other Christian course        seemed possible than to adopt them and bring them up under the care of the        Mission. Such work brought in due season its own reward. Not only was        there left behind, when the famine passed, a legacy of gratitude and        goodwill on the part of those whose lives had been preserved, but many of        the rescued orphans grew up to be among the most intelligent and reliable        of the church members.
Of the eighteen Rajput States, seven        are now occupied by the Mission. Two States are occupied by other        Missions, but half of Rajputana is still without any Christian agency. Yet        the diffusive influence of the Mission is increasingly felt throughout the        whole province. There has recently been manifest a very deep and        widespread change in the attitude of the non-Christian community.        Christianity is the standard by which everything is measured, even the        gods themselves. Every advocate of any custom or faith, new or old, spends        himself to prove that it is " as good as Christianity." Thus in every way        Christ is preached, and there seems to be opening up a prospect of men        moving, not as units but in masses, towards the Christian faith.

The Santal Mission was begun by the        Free Church in 1870. The Santals belong to the aboriginal peoples of        India, a physically powerful race, nomadic in their habit of life till        about a century ago, when the Government induced them to settle in the        hill country west of Calcutta, bordering on the plain of the Ganges. Here        they formed a bulwark, defending the peaceful dwellers on the plain from        the wild raiders in the hills. Unhappily, however, they in their        simplicity fell into the clutches of the Bengal money-lender, and about        the middle of last century. the burden of his extortions became        intolerable. The Santals set out, twenty thousand strong, to march to        Calcutta and lay their grievances before the Governor. Not a single        Government official could speak their language, and they were met and        summarily dispersed by British troops. Subsequent inquiry brought their        grievances to light, and when these were redressed the Santals settled        down a loyal and contented people.
Among the first missionaries to the Santals was one who        gained a unique influence over them. They are a simple primitive people        with none of the subtlety of the typical Hindu, but with the greatest        admiration for physical strength and courage. Dr. Campbell was a man after        their own hearts, of splendid physique, able in his younger days to keep        up with the foremost in their hunting expeditions, slow in speech, but        wise in council, a veritable rock of a man. Deep in the forest on the site        of a deserted village he founded the mission station of Pokhuria, and soon        changed the haunted spot into a beehive of Christian activities. The        Government recognised the value of his work by giving him the status of an        independent magistrate, and in his later years he reigned like a prince        among his people.
In the glare and dust of the East various eye troubles        are prevalent, and the Santals appear to suffer from them in an especial        degree. Dr. MacPhail, at Chakai, has earned the honourable name of "The        Eyemaker," from the extraordinary number and success of his operations. It        may be confidently affirmed that no living surgeon has performed more        operations for cataract. The number runs into tens of thousands. In 1924        there were two thousand three hundred and eighty eye operations at Chakai, of which one thousand five hundred and nineteen were for cataract. Thus in        Santalia, even as in Galilee of old, the blind receive their sight and to        the poor the Gospel is preached.

One more field of Scottish missionary endeavour in        India remains to be mentioned, namely, the Eastern Himalayas. In 1870 the        Church of Scotland began a mission at Darjeeling. The first missionary was        Mr. William Macfarlane, who laboured for years without visible success and        then began to reap the harvest of his faith. After ten years he left        Darjeeling to the colleagues who had joined him and opened a new station        twenty-five miles east at Kalimpong. Three years later he organised the        Scottish Universities Mission in Independent Sikkim, the territory        immediately to the north.
The situation of the Eastern Himalayan Mission is in        some respects unique. It is perched among the mountains within sight of        the loftiest peaks in the world; below are the sweltering plains of India,        above towers the grandeur of the snowy range. It also lies at a point        where Western civilization, rolling proudly over many lands, comes up        against a dead wall. Darjeeling is in more senses than one the ne plus        ultra of health resorts. Down below in the hot and steamy tea gardens        of the Dooars and far across the plain of the Ganges to Calcutta, sunbaked        planters and engineers and Government officials sigh for a sight of        Darjeeling, and a breath of its mountain air; over the mountains behind,        in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan, a jealous watch is kept against the intrusion        of the foreigner. The district occupied by the Mission may roughly be        compared to a wedge driven northward into the heart of these three great        closed lands.
Corresponding to its unique situation, the work of the        Mission is very varied in character. It ministers to the spiritual needs        of the British residents in the district, especially to the Scots        tea-planters in the Dooars, from whom it receives substantial help. Dr.        Graham of Kalimpong is a name to conjure with in all that part of India.        Besides preaching and medical work among Europeans and natives, he founded        the St. Andrew’s Colonial Homes for AngloIndian children. He also        organised the Kalimpong Mission Industries Association for the development        of native industries. The number and diversity of languages among the hill        tribes presents a formidable difficulty, but as converts are steadily        gathered in, with here a Tibetan and there a Nepalese, and as rumours of        the Mission penetrate far away into the hills, the day draws nearer when a        great and effectual door will be opened for the Gospel into the inmost        heart of Asia.
These Scottish Missions, widespread and varied in their        operations, commanding the devoted services of over three hundred        missionaries, are yet but tiny spots of light in the immensity of India’s        millions. Other Missions are at work in the same great field, and the        number of Christians is about five millions. Among the various Protestant        agencies there is the happiest spirit of cooperation and unity. No one        wishes to repeat in India the ecclesiastical divisions of the West, and        already there has been constituted the United Church of India, with only        the necessary geographical division of North and South. But the        regenerating influence of the Gospel is felt in India far beyond the        limits of the Indian Church. Christian moral and social ideals are        steadily gaining the ascendant, and are subtly permeating the minds of        Hindus and Mohammedans. Every careful observer is convinced that Christ is        coming to His own in India, and none can tell how soon he may be openly        acclaimed as the fulfilment of the religious aspirations of the ancient        East.
This is the gift of Christian Missions to India, and it        may be found in the end to be a greater gift than all that the Government        has done. Both agencies are working for the same high end, and their        relations have never been better expressed than by Sir Charles Elliott,        Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, in a speech delivered at Darjeeling. "As        head of the Government, I feel that the missionaries are, so to speak, an        unrecognised and unofficial branch of the great movement in which we are        all engaged, and which alone justifies our presence in the country. They        occupy a field which the officers of Government are unable to take up. We        are doing a great work in spreading the blessings of civilisation, making        life and property secure, teaching the rule of law, and encouraging the        growth of education, but we cannot directly touch on religious subjects. .        . . Yet we know right well that the only hope for the realisation of our        dream, and for the true elevation and development of the people, lies in        the evangelisation of India, and we know that the people who are carrying        on this work are the missionaries. It is they who are filling up what is        deficient in the efforts of Government, by devoting their lives and their        labours to bringing the people of India to the knowledge of Christ."
