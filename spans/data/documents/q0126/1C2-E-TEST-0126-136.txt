 CHURCH HISTORY
History of Mar Thoma Parish, Kalyan
Kalyan Mar Thoma Church is one of                          the outside Kerala parishes of the Mar Thoma Syrian                          Church of Malabar with its Head Quarters at Tiruvalla,                          Kerala.
During the period 1930-40, many  Syrian Christian members  including                          Marthomites who come to Mumbai from Kerala  started Prayer Groups/Congregational Worships and                          by their relentless efforts a Mar Thoma Parish was set                          up in  Mumbai in Nov.1940,  the present                          Mumbai/Dadar Mar Thoma Parish. It was the first and                          only one Mar-Thoma parish covering the whole of  Mumbai city and suburbs including Kalyan.  The  place of worship was the Holy Redeemer                          Anglican Church, Dadar.  Due to difficulties in                          attending divine services and fellowship gatherings at                          distant Mumbai a few Marthomites staying in and around                          Kalyan formed a prayer cell here in Kalyan and the                          first prayer meeting was held on 28.12.1950 at karnik                          Road  alongwith some members of  other                          Christian denominations.  In due course, a                          representation was submitted to the Metropolitan on                          12th May 1951 for an independent parish  at                          Kalyan.  Meanwhile with  the permission of                          the appropriate Sabha Authorities the first Holy                          Communion  service in Malayalam Order was                          celebrated by late V.Rev.P.J.Thomas of Ankola on                          17.6.1951 at St.Christopher Church, Kalyan. His Grace                          the late most Rev. Dr. Juhanon Marthoma Metropolitan,                          by a  Kalpana dated 10th August 1951 was pleased  to accord sanction for the formation of a                          separate Marthoma Parish at Kalyan and the First  Holy communion service as a parish was celebrated                          on Sunday the 19th August 1951 at the St.Christopher's  Church, Kalyan by V.Rev.C.G.Alexander, the then                          Vicar of Mumbai who was  concurrently appointed                          Vicar of Kalyan Parish also. On this occasion, we                          remember with gratitude the help and guidance given by                          Very Rev.C.G. Alexander, late Rev.T.M.Mathai of                          Kirkee-Pune, Mr.George Alexander (now Rev.George Alexander) and many members in and around Kalyan/Mumbai                          who gave leadership for the formation of the Kalyan                          Parish.  We conducted our worship service at                          St.Christopher's Church, Kalyan till December 1968.
Church Building at Karnik Road
As years passed by, the Marthomite                          population increased in number and we felt the need for                          having a church building of our own.  We raised                          funds through various sources and purchased on                          ownership basis our worship place at Karnik  Road                          named Mar Thoma Centre.  By 1968, this hall was                          ready and the first Holy Communion Service was                          celebrated there on 12.12.1968 by the present                          Metropolitan His Grace Most Rev.Dr.Philipose Mar                          Chrysostem Mar Thoma .This Place was dedicated on 9th                          February 1969 by His Grace Himself.
Our new Church at Masoba Maidan
Due to the inconvenience and lack of space  of the Karnik Road church hall for the                          rapidly expanding strength of the parish and also to                          revitalize our social service projects etc.,  we                          thought of having a larger
place and for this purpose we                          acquired a plot of land in April 1984 at Masoba Maidan.  There, the foundation stone for a multipurpose                          building was laid on
18th January 1987 by  His                          Lordship Rt.Rev.Dr.Joseph Mar Irenaeus (the then                          Diocesan Bishop).  With the sincere co- operation                          of all our members, our sister parishes as well as                          friends and well wishers, the first phase i.e., the                          ground floor was completed and dedicated to the Glory                          of God by His Lordship Rt.Rev.Geevarghese Mar                          Athanasius (the then Diocesan Bishop)  on 31st                          March 1990.  The first Holy Communion service at                          this Church was celebrated by His Lordship himself on                          Sunday the 1st April 1990.
Formation of Independent Parishes
Because of the vast                          industrialization of Kalyan  and its surroundings,                          the Marthomite population increased rapidly.                          Consequently, members from the following areas formed                          separate parishes:
1. Jerusalem Mar Thoma Church,                          Ambernath    (01.08.1965)
2. Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church,                          Dombivli (01.07.1984)
3. St.James Mar Thoma Church,                          Ulhasnagar (01.07.1994)
4. St.Andrews Mar Thoma Church,                          Kolsewadi (15.12.1995)
Thus our parish earned the unique                          distinction of being the Mother Parish to 4 independent                          parishes.
Even after carving out four                          independent parishes from it, the Kalyan parish, today                          has 250 subscribing members with a total strength of                          901 spread over                          Kalyan/Ulhasnagar/Century/Kolsewadi/Thakurli/Dombivli                          areas.
Our Vicars
Since the formation of our parish                          58 years ago, 22 Vicars and 5 Asst.Vicars served in our                          parish. We take this opportunity to express our sincere                          gratitude to all our past Vicars and Asst.Vicars for                          their inspiring leadership and valuable services.  Our present Vicar
Rev. Thomas Koshy Panachamoottil                          along with his family joined us on 1.5.2007.  He                          is deeply involved in every activity of the parish.
Clergies from Kalyan Parish
We are happy to mention here that 4                          members from Kalyan parish are in the active Pastoral                          Ministry of the Sabha.  They are Rev.Varghese                          Mathew, Rev.Saji Joseph, Rev.Sunil George Mathew and                          Rev. Abraham Kuruvilla. Thus Kalyan parish has also                          become the first Edavaka outside Kerala to have gifted                          four Achens to the Sabha. We pray to Almighty God to                          give heavenly wisdom and strength for them in                          ministering His Vineyard.
