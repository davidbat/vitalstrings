Church Connection
 
With over 70,000 church and ministry walls, PrayerGroup is proud to be the largest free online church community in the United States. When we began, our goal was provide virtually every church in the country with a free way to communicate with their membership, share information and grow their fellowship by staying connected with their members. We recognize that for many churches, just maintaining a website is both costly and difficult. PrayerGroup is pleased to subsidize the costs of our free Church services through our founders, sponsors and contributors. By providing everyone access to online church discussions, photos and video sermons, we continue to reach out to Christians across the world. Help us get the word out...find or create your church wall here on PrayerGroup and invite your fellowship to join!
