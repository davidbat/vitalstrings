Church Planting        Ministry is run by Gujarat Regional Conference (MCI). It was started in        1980. This year (2005) it will complete 25 years. In these 25 years we        have 30 missionaries and 35 mission fields. We have "Good Samaritan        English School" at Amreli.
We would like        to enlarge the mission-field in Kutch-Gandhidham and Surat. In this year        we have published a Calendar and a Souvenir. We are planning to arrange        Mission Conference, Retreat and Seminar too.
Please do pray        for the missionary program.
If you want to financially        support us, please issue your crossed cheque in favour of "Gujarat        Regional Conference (CPM)"
