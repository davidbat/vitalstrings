Not only thick forest there is no good communication and it is the shelter for naxalites,so that there is no developments taken place for this people and area.  The people of this place were very different in culture and in all.  I and my wife obey to the call of God and we went to that place. In the beginning we suffered a lot, in one way it is very much hart to reach those people, so we prayerfully reach our tor get.  We use to give some food,clothes,conducting small medical camps and taking care of their children and teaching to them, so that the Lord opens the way to bring them to the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
