Bombay Teen Challenge helps women and children involved in the sex trade. It has a shelter in the red-light district of Bombay (Mumbai) that provides food, shelter and educational assistance for the children of commercial sex workers. The medical facility known as The Village at Ashagram will be located about two hours outside of Bombay (Mumbai). It will provide medication and care to children once involved in the sex trade. This is much needed, because 85 percent of prostitutes and sex slaves rescued from the streets carry the AIDS virus.
