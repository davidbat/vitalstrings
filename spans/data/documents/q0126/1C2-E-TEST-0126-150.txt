 
History 
The present                    Ahmedabad Diocese covers the entire area of the three civil                    districts of Ahmedabad, Anand and Nadiad. Areawise, Ahmedabad                    is the smallest of the four dioceses in Gujarat but with 63,962                    Catholics Ahmedabad is the biggest diocese! Ahmedabad is also                    the oldest diocese in the state. 
Historically                    too the Ahmedabad diocese has great significance. The freedom                    struggle was directed from the Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad which was the headquarters of Gandhiji for meeting the leaders                    of the freedom movement and the British officials till he started                    the Dandi March on March 12, 1930. Karamsad in Anand District                    which comes within the boundaries of the Ahmedabad diocese was                    also the birth place of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man                    of India. 
The Ahmedabad                    Diocese has a long history. There are indications of Christians                    living at Khambhat and Ahmedabad from the beginning of the sixteenth                    century when the Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510. All through                    the 19th century Catholics from outside the states have come                    and settled in several towns of Gujarat. Ahmedabad city had                    a church from 1842 at Sabarmati. 
But the                    beginning of local Christians is traced to the baptism of 18                    people at Mogri on December 11, 1893 by Fr Manuel Xavier Gomes,                    a diocesan priest from the Archdiocese of Bombay. A team of                    German and Swiss Jesuits followed Fr Gomes. Then came more diocesan                    priests followed by the Spanish Jesuits in 1922.  
In 1934                    the entire area of Gujarat State north of the Mahi river including                    Kathiawad and Kutch became the independent Ahmedabad mission                    separated from Bombay Archdiocese, with an Ecclesiastical Superior                    in the person of Fr Joaquin Villallonga, SJ. There were only                    five mission stations in 1934 : Anand established in 1895, Vadtal in 1897, Karamsad in 1907, Nadiad in 1911 and Amod in 1914. 
The Daughters                    of the Cross (FC) were the first congregation of nuns to start                    work in Gujarat from 1898. Then came the Sisters of The Apostolic                    Carmel (AC) to work in Gujarat in January 1923. They opened                    their first school at Ahmedabad in 1929. In 1936 a local congregation                    of the Little Daughters of St Francis Xavier (LD) was founded                    by a Jesuit Priest, Fr Carlos Suria in collaboration with Sr                    Xavier. 
The steady                    growth of the Ahmedabad mission resulted in the establishment                    of the Ahmedabad Diocese on May 5, 1949 covering the entire                    Gujarat area north of the river Mahi much before the present                    Gujarat state was carved out of the Bombay state on May 1, 1960. 
The tenure                    of the first Bishop of Ahmedabad, Bishop Edwin Pinto, SJ (1949-73)                    was a period of consolidation of the Christian community and                    also the beginning of the expansion of the Church to north and                    south Gujarat. 
Meanwhile                    a second diocese in Gujarat was established on September 29,                    1966 as Baroda diocese with the six districts in South Gujarat,                    south of Mahi river curved out of Bombay Archdiocese with Bishop                    Ignatius D'Souza as its first bishop. 
In Ahmedabad                    diocese Bishop Charles Gomes, SJ succeeded Bishop Pinto in 1974                    and he saw to the expansion of the Church of north and central                    Gujarat as well as to the growth of Church personnel especially                    diocesan priests and religious sisters. 
A new development                    took place in 1977 with the formation of the Rajkot Diocese                    under Bishop Jonas Thaliath, CMI as its first bishop. The new                    diocese was separated from the Ahmedabad Diocese, covering the                    entire area of Saurashtra and Kutch-Bhuj. 
Then, in                    1990 Bishop Stanislaus Fernandes, SJ took up the reins from                    Bishop Gomes in Ahmedabad Diocese and saw to the further consolidation                    of the Christian communities in the north and central Gujarat.                    The steady growth of the Church then saw the establishment of                    the new Archdiocese of Gandhinagar headed by Archbishop Stanislaus                    Fernandes, SJ. The new archdiocese was separated from the Ahmedabad                    Diocese in November 2002.  
Bishop Thomas                    Ignas Macwan became the first local Catholic Bishop Ahmedabad                    Diocese in January 2003 indicating the coming of age of the                    Church in Gujarat.
