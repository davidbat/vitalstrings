The        Scottish Churches' Work Abroad
The Dawn of Scottish Missions
THE great Foreign        Missionary Enterprise of the Protestant Churches took its rise towards the        close of the eighteenth century, and its development will be recorded in        history as one of the most remarkable movements of the nineteenth century.
The Churches of the        Reformation had no world-wide vision of the Kingdom of Christ, nor do they        seem to have felt the urgency of carrying the Gospel to the heathen. This        may largely be accounted for by the fact that they were fighting for very        life at home, while at the same time they were completely cut off from        contact with the heathen world so long as Spain and Portugal held the high        seas. In the age of rationalism, however, which succeeded the ferment of        the Reformation, the extraordinary view came to be held, and was formally        defended by theologians, that our Lordâ€™s command, "Go ye into all the        world and preach the Gospel to every creature," was addressed to the        Apostles only. The evangelising of the heathen world was their personale privilegium, and it was not to be doubted that the work had,        in previous ages, been fulfilled. Even America, it was asserted, had been        known to the ancients, and had been evangelised, though subsequently        forgotten. The heathen world was therefore held to have rejected the        Gospel, and to have no other fate in store than to await the Judgment Day.
This monstrous doctrine can never, of course,        have met with universal acceptance, and in the Scottish Church in        particular there are evidences from time to time of a larger vision and a        more Christian spirit. The Scottish Confession of Faith, which John Knox        and his friends presented to Parliament in 1560, bore on its title-page        the text, "This glaid tydingis of the kyngdome sall be precheit through        the haill warld for a witness unto all natiouns, and then sall the end        cum," and it concludes with a prayer, "Give Thy servands strength to        speake Thy word in bauldnesse, and let all Natiouns cleave to Thy        knowledge." The General Assembly of 1647 put on record its desire for "a        more firm consociation for propagating the Gospel to those who are        without, especially the Jews," but nothing came of it. When the ill-fated        Darien Expedition sailed from these shores in 1699 it carried with it        certain ministers who were enjoined by the Assembly to labour among the        heathen. The view was generally held that where a Christian country        colonised it ought also to endeavour to Christianise, but the appeal was        made to Kings, Princes, and States" to do the work, while the divine        commission of the Church was ignored.

In 1709, however, there was        founded in Edinburgh a "Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian        Knowledge" which turned its attention to the Indians of North America. Its        operations were never extensive, but it is worthy of record that, at the        time of the Stuart Rebellion of 1745, it was paying the salary of David        Brainerd who by his saintly character and missionary zeal won a        distinguished name in history. The same Society, a few years later,        undertook the translation of the Bible into Gaelic. This scheme was        opposed for political reasons by those who wished Gaelic to die out,        which, being reported to Samuel Johnson by Mr. William Drummond, a        bookseller in Edinburgh, drew from the great man a characteristic letter,        in which he indignantly exclaims, "To omit for a year, or for a day, the        most efficacious method of advancing Christianity, in compliance with any        purposes that terminate on this side of the grave, is a crime of which I        know not that the world has yet had an example, except in the practice of        the planters of America, a race of mortals whom, I suppose, no other man        wishes to resemble." In deference to this protest the scheme was allowed        to go on, and, in a subsequent letter, Dr. Johnson says," I honour the        translator as a man whom God has distinguished by the high office of        propagating His word."
In the latter half of the        eighteenth century England and Scotland began slowly to recover from the        blight of irreligion which had fallen upon them, and a rising tide of warm        evangelical feeling began to be felt.
This was largely due in        England to the work of the Wesleys and Whitefield, in Scotland to the        Cambuslang Revival and the activity of the Seceders. The modern missionary        enterprise of the English-speaking world was a direct and necessary        outcome of this evangelical revival. Various concurrent events drew the        minds of Christian people to the condition and needs of the heathen world        and opened the way for a vigorous forward policy. The maritime power of        Spain and Portugal had decayed, and Britain was establishing her empire on        the seven seas. The voyages of Captain Cook had revealed a world of        romance among the South Sea Islands. The expansion of our Indian Empire        after the battle of Plassey had begun to bring home the vastness of our        responsibilities in the East. About the same time, the Slave Trade became        a burning question which turned the Christian mind of Britain not only to        the plantations in the West Indies but also to Africa, the homeland from        which the slaves had been torn away.
All these events combined        with the restless spirit of the time to bring to the birth a new era in        missionary history. William Carey, the Northampton cobbler and preacher,        gave an heroic lead when he not only founded the Baptist Missionary        Society but volunteered himself to be the pioneer in India. Not that he        was the first in the field. The Moravians had already sent missionaries to        Greenland and the West Indies, while in South India, Schwartz had        completed almost half a century of noble service. But undoubtedly Carey        was the man of the hour, and his influence has been so profound and        far-reaching that he is worthy to be called the Father of Modern Missions.
Carey sailed for India in        1793, and his work there had the loyal support of friends in Scotland even        after his own Society had turned against him. It was the inspiration of        Carey which prompted Robert Haldane in 1796 to sell his beautiful estate        of Airthley, on the Stirling slope of the Ochils, and devote the proceeds        to found a mission in India. Benares, the holy city of North India, was        selected as the site of the mission, a party of volunteers including        several Scots ministers was organised, but the Government of the day, at        the instigation of the East India Company, refused a permit. One of the        Directors of the Company declared that he would sooner see a band of        devils let loose in India than a band of missionaries. Thwarted in his        noble intention of carrying the Gospel to India, Robert Haldane, together        with his brother James, commenced that career of home evangelisation which        left so deep a mark on the Scottish life of the early nineteenth century.

The year 1796 is a notable        landmark in missionary history. In February of that year the Scottish        Missionary Society was formed, at first under the name of the Edinburgh        Missionary Society. At the same time the Glasgow Missionary Society was        founded in the west of Scotland. These two Societies had the support of        many of the evangelical ministers both of the Church of Scotland and of        the Secession, and while acting independently they cordially cooperated in        the work. The founding of these two Societies naturally brought the        subject of Missions prominently before the mind of the Church, and led to        a memorable scene in the General Assembly. Two Synods had sent up        overtures asking the Assembly to support the missionary cause. To many        this seemed a highly suspicious and revolutionary proposal. It must be        borne in mind that the recent excesses of the French Revolution had        provoked a strong conservative reaction and a nervous tendency to take        alarm at the most innocent innovation. The debate spread itself out into a        battle royal between the two contending parties in the Church of Scotland.        Leading speakers on the side of the Moderates declared that to spread        abroad the knowledge of the Gospel among barbarous and heathen nations was "highly preposterous, in so far as it anticipates, nay, reverses, the        order of nature. Men must be polished and refined in their manners before        they can be properly enlightened in religious truths. Philosophy and        learning must, in the nature of things, take the precedence"! As for the        Missionary Societies it was openly averred that they were nothing but        revolutionary clubs in disguise, "highly dangerous in their tendency to        the good order of society at large." "I do aver," exclaimed one alarmist, "that since it is to be apprehended that their funds may be in time, nay,        certainly will be, turned against the constitution, so it is the bounden        duty of this house to give the overtures recommending them our most        serious disapprobation, and our immediate, most decisive opposition." Dr.        John Erskine of Greyfriars Church, the President of the Edinburgh Society,        rose to reply. He was then in his seventy-fifth year, no revolutionary,        but one of the most revered ministers in the city, a man whose warm heart        had kept his mind awake to the needs of the age. "Rax me that Bible," he        exclaimed, stretching his arms towards the Moderator. With the sacred        volume in his hands he then read aloud the words of Christâ€™s great        commission to the Church, "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel        to every creature "â€”words which, we are told, burst on the Assembly like a        clap of thunder. The effect, however, was only momentary. The swelling        tide of moderate oratory rolled on and the friends of missions suffered        defeat.
That this antipathy to        missions was not confined to the Established Church is evidenced by the        fact that in the same year the Associate Synod pronounced against the        Societies on the ground of the "lowerin o denominational testimony by        promiscuous association in mission work."
III
Nothing daunted by these        official frowns, the two Societies set to work. At first, however, like        the sister Societies in England, they had to grope their way through many        difficulties and discouragements. They had no such gigantic breakdown as        accompanied the first inexperienced effort of the London Missionary        Society in the South Seas, but the early years were years of comparative        failure and disappointment. The field chosen was Sierra Leone, which at        that time was being organised as a settlement for freed slaves. The        representatives of the Scottish Missionary Society were Peter Greig and        Henry Brunton. The names of their colleagues from the Glasgow Society may        be left in oblivion, as they proved unworthy of their high calling. Peter        Greig, like the more famous Robert Moffat, was a gardener at Donibristle,        in Fife, and a member of the Secession Church there. Moved by the love of        Christ and the thought of the heathen world, he used at times to go with        his minister, the well-known Ebenezer Brown, into the little church after        the dayâ€™s work, so that "amid the darkness and solitude he might speak        more freely the thoughts of his heart." He sailed with his companions for        Sierra Leone in 1797, and a beginning of work was made at the Susoos,        about 120 miles inland from Freetown. When he had only been a year in the        country, however, Peter Greig was murdered by the natives. He has the        distinction of being the first missionary martyr of modern times, and, as        such, his name ought to be better known and more honoured in Scotland than        it appears to be.
The field in Sierra Leone        was, after a time, abandoned, and Henry Brunton was transferred to Karass,        between the Black Sea and the Caspian, where the Scottish Society had        begun another mission. This second undertaking was soon brought to an end        by Russian intolerance. After about a quarter of a century of these        discouragements the Scottish Society turned its thoughts to India, while        the Glasgow Society sought a new field in South Africa, with the happiest        results in both cases.
Before speaking of these it        may be convenient to mention here the notable contributions made by        Scotland to the London Missionary Society, which from its inception in        1795 has always had a warm place in Christian Scottish hearts. It has sent        forth, to name but a few, such eminent Scotsmen as Morrison, Moffat,        Livingstone, and John Mackenzie. Robert Morrison, though born in Morpeth,        was of Scottish parentage. He sailed for China in 1807, and by his        incomparable patience, his massive learning, and his invincible faith, he        stands in history as the greatest of Chinese missionaries. Robert Moffat        was an East Lothian man, born at Ormiston. A gardener to trade, he became        one of the most faithful labourers in Godâ€™s vineyard in South Africa, to        which he was sent in 1816. The famous missionary martyr, John Williams,        was set apart at the same time for the South Seas. The original proposal        was that both should go to the South Seas, but Scotland intervened in the        person of Dr. Waugh, one of the Directors, who drily said, "Thae twa lads        are ower young to gang thegither." So Moffat landed at Cape Town, and        pushing north over the Orange River into what was then an unmapped        country, he laboured for fifty years among the Bechuanas, and drew the        eyes of Britain, and especially of David Livingstone, to the vast interior        which the nineteenth century was to see so marvellously opened up. "None        greater, none holier than he," was the recent tribute of General Smuts,        and it was well and truly earned. The length and fruitfulness of his        labours, his peaceful subjugation of Africaner, that notorious freebooter        and signal trophy of grace, his wonderful influence over the savage king        of the Matabele, all entitled him to be regarded, as he was in his last        years, as the Grand Old Man of the missionary world.
IV
To return to the story of        the two Societies, a mission was begun in India in 1822 by the Scottish        Missionary Society. The first missionary was the Rev. Donald Mitchell, a        son of the manse, who had been converted to Christ when a lieutenant in        the Companyâ€™s army at Surat.
Less than a year of        missionary service was granted him, and he lies buried in an obscure        village at the foot of the Western Ghats, but from that lonely grave the        tide of Scottish Missions has spread far and wide over India. At first the        Government forbade access to Poona, the recently conquered capital of the        Marathas and a centre of fanatical Brahmanism, so the pioneers worked for        a time in the jungly foot-hills south of Bombay. The first convert gave a        dramatic illustration of the terrific power of caste. Some weeks after his        baptism he sat down at the Lordâ€™s table, but when the bread and wine were        offered him he sprang up and, crying out, "No, I will not break caste        yet," he rushed out of the church. For some years the work was continued        in the country districts, but, the way being now open, it was resolved to        transfer the Mission to Poona and Bombay. In 1829 there arrived in India,        John Wilson, whose great name and work is commemorated in the Wilson        College, Bombay. He at once commenced educational work in Bombay, and, for        many years, aided by his colleagues, Nesbit and Murray Mitchell, he        exercised a profound and increasing influence both in government and in        native circles. The Indian Mission was manned by ordained ministers of the        Church of Scotland. Accordingly, when the various Scottish Churches,        through the growth and prevalence of a more evangelical spirit, began to        undertake missions of their own, this mission was in 1835 transferred to        the Church of Scotland, under whose auspices it developed rapidly until        the Disruption in 1843, when its missionaries adhered to the Free Church.
In 1824 the Scottish        Society had begun another mission in Jamaica, which was intended        originally for the instruction of the plantation slaves in Christian        truth. This mission had the support mainly of the Secession members of the        Society, and, accordingly, in 1847 it was transferred to the United        Presbyterian Church. With this transference the distinctive work of the        Scottish Society came to an end.
The experience of the        Glasgow Society was very similar. In 1821 it began a mission in Kafraria        which has been, ever since, one of the most powerful Christian agencies at        work in South Africa. The most notable of its pioneers was the Rev. John        Ross, who, going out to Kafraria in 1823, laboured there for fifty-five years, and was succeeded in the work by his        two sons, Richard and Bryce Ross, and by a grandson. The religious        controversies, at that time raging in Scotland, made their influence felt        in the far-off mission field where Established Churchmen and Secessionists        laboured together. At length, as in the case of the first foreign        missionaries, Paul and Barnabas, a separation had to be made, and in 1837        two Presbyteries were formed,        one of which followed the Free Church at the Disruption, while the other        was taken over by the United Presbyterian Church in 1847. The same year,        therefore, saw the end of the separate existence of the two pioneer        Societies and the absorption of their work by the Scottish Churches, whose        members had created and supported them.
This was due to the fact        that in 1824 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had reversed        the unhappy decision of 1796, and resolved to embark on a policy of        missionary enterprise. Warneck, the great German historian, remarks that "with the exception of the Established Church of Scotland, in no        Protestant State Church have missions been from their beginning the        concern of the Church." This statement requires modification, for, as we        have seen, the evangelical party in the Church of Scotland found an outlet        for their missionary zeal through the agency of the two Societies, whose        work they supported for a quarter of a century before the Church undertook        missions of her own. It should, however, be noted as a distinctive feature        of Scottish Church life that missions are the affair of the Church as        such, and are supported and governed directly by the Church courts. In        England and elsewhere missions, while drawing support from the various        denominations, are still under the management of Missionary Societies,        like the Church Missionary Society, the London Missionary Society, etc.        The state of things in Scotland is, doubtless, partly due to the fact that        Scotsmen are strong churchmen, and have confidence in their Church.        Partly, also, it is due to the happy circumstance that the constitution of        the Presbyterian Church is democratic, and, by its gradation of Church        courts, from Kirk Session to General Assembly, provides machinery        admirably adapted for the prosecution of Foreign as well as Home Missions.
This is as it ought to be.        The Christian ideal is that the Church itself should be a missionary        agency, and that membership in the Church should necessarily involve        interest in and support of the missionary cause. Indeed, the distinction        between Home and Foreign Missions is, in a sense, artificial, and ought        not to be unduly stressed. For there is but one great missionary        enterprise to which the Church is called, and in which she is everywhere        engagedâ€”the winning of the nations to the obedience of Christ. The        contribution which Scotland is fitted to make to this supreme task is both        distinctive and valuable, for it will not be denied that she stands high        among the nations in respect of evangelical enlightenment, education, and        national character. And, in view of the approaching Union of the Scottish        Churches, the inspiring prospect is opening out of a time, in the not        far-distant future, when Scotland, with united front and her Christian        forces efficiently organised, may do more than she has ever yet done for        the evangelisation of the world.
