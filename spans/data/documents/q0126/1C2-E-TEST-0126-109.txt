Dear Ed,
Thank you for the initiative in  building this site... the articles, the information, so much of insight into our Catholic faith... keep it up Ed! and yeah... most of us do know what a church means and what Catholic means...
Universal Apostleship.... no one ever considered the Church as a building Sebastian. It is the place where we all meet to share and participate in the Holy Eucharistic celebration.... and we all come under one Authority (thank God for that!!! imagine how confused lot we would be... like our brothers on the other side of the fence who have given up their inheritance and come up with their own interpretations of the Bible and to crown it all... their own  version of the Holy Bible! Alleluiah!!!
Do we need so much of confusion in our already confused and broken community?
Besides the Church, we all meet as a prayer group but once again, in accordance with the permission of the Church... after all one needs to beware of half knowledge and preachers who give out the wrong message...

There are mistakes in your lists:
Church of Immaculate Conception MOIRA is in North Goa, and DABAL-KIRLEPALE is in South Goa.
Similarly, St. Sebastian Church TORMAS-IBRAMPUR is in North Goa, not in South Goa.

Hi, I am Swedish and getting married this year and would love to have a blessing ceremony in one of the Goan churches as I have spent the past 20 years in India. As we are not baptised catholics but anglican/protestant we have found it difficult to find a church that will take us in but I am hoping you might have information on where we can find a pastor who is happy to do this for us in his church. Thank you for any information to my email!
Kind regards,
