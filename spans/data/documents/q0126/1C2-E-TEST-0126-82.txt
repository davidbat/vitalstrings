St.         Thomas Cathedral of Mumbai is situated on the D.N. Road in the Fort         area, near the magnificent Flora Fountain. It claims the distinction of         being the first Anglican Church in the city. The reason for the         establishment of the cathedral, in the year 1718, was to help in the         development as well as improvement in the moral standards of British         settlement living in India. Saint Thomas Cathedral of Bombay owes its         name to St. Thomas, an ardent disciple of Christ.
He came to the country to help in the establishment of the Christian         community in the Southwestern parts of India, especially along the         Malabar Coast. The cathedral also prides itself on being selected for         the UNESCO Asia-Pacific heritage conservation award in the year 2004. A         large number of Britons have been laid to rest at the cemetery within         the premises of Cathedral of St. Thomas, under white marble tablets         engraved with touching eulogies.
A huge rush of devotees visits the cathedral on a daily basis,         including both locals as well as tourists. The beautiful architecture of         the St. Thomas Cathedral is definitely worth having a look at. The peace         and serenity that it offers to visitors further add to its attraction.         Apart from the usual Sundays, the cathedral also witnesses heavy rush on         special occasions, like Christmas and other festivals, when it overflows         with beauty and excitement.
