We trace our roots to the present Cathedral of St. Thomas at  Fort, where in 1718,                Rev. Richard Cobbe, Chaplain to the East India Companyâ€™s Factory at Bombay, founded not far                from the Cathedral, in 1718, a small free school, where twelve poor boys were housed, clothed,                fed and educated by just one master. This Charity school, was the grain of mustard seed from              which Christ Church School, Byculla and Barnes School, Deolali have sprung into mighty trees.
