History of the Church
Services are continued to be held on all Sundays at Holy Cross Church, Umerkhadi.. A large number of members mainly from the Central & South Mumbai are participating in the services. The Main Perunnal of our Congregation is being held at this Church on August 14-15 every year. Fervent efforts are being made to construct our own Church in Central Mumbai. We hope and pray to God Almighty to realize this dream.
