Situated on a quiet hillock in suburban Bandra, Mount Mary       church is one of the most prominent church in Mumbai with exquisite       interiors. As the name suggests, it is dedicated to the Mother of Christ.       The Marathi speaking communities refer the Mother Mary as "Math Mauli".
There is another statue of Mary installed outside the Church. People who       have genuine faith, lit wax candles before the statue and pray for the       welfare of the family and their near and dear ones. Local people strongly       believe that Mount Mary fulfills their genuine wishes if prayers are made       earnestly and faithfully.
In September, the festival of the Virgin Mother culminates in a weeklong       fair, popularly known as Bandra Fair, that has all the excitement of a       small carnival. From the site of the church one gets breath-taking view of       the Arabian-sea and enjoy the sunset.
