Nancy's Story; One MIracle Leads To Another (Mumbai, India)

Miracles have a way of opening doors for more miracles. When we hear of some incredible event that could only have happened by the power of God our faith increases. We then start believing that God could do such things in our life as well. This is what happened in Western India recently.
Two weeks ago we posted the story of Corrina's amazing courage. She faced a lot of persecution as a young disciple in Mumbai twenty four years ago but recently her father became a Christian right before passing away thanks to Corrina's faith and love.
The evangelist of the Mumbai church was preaching in another church in Western India. There, in Pune, two sisters were attending the service. Josephine and Fatima heard the story of Nelson, Corrina's father. They immediately thought of their cousin Nancy who was on her death bed.  As they listened to Nelson's inspiring story of conversion they thought of how they had given up on their cousin and did not have the faith to save her at this late stage.
The sermon changed their heart. After church they went to Nancy's house and asked her to study the Bible. She immediately agreed even though she was extremely weak and barely able to speak. It was obvious Nancy only had days to live. The sisters were swift and got into the Scriptures right away. By the next evening Nancy was ready to be baptized. Of course there was some opposition and scepticism on the part of the relatives and neighbours, but just like the men in    Josephine and Fatima carried their friend to Jesus.
By the next Sunday Nancy had passed away. Praise God for miracles that inspire more miracles and praise God for the faith of those two sisters who loved Nancy so much that they did away with all the obstacles in their way and displayed the kind of urgency needed in that situation.
