The                            Feast of St. Cecilia 
- Ms. Daphne Netto
 
We the members of Sector 1, Baudi Zone celebrated the feast                            of our Patroness “St. Cecilia” on the 24th of November 2004 at the Church Shed from 7.30 onwards.
 
The programme began with the Holy Eucharist celebrated                            by Rev. Fr. Salvador Rodrigues, whose wonderful homily on “the family” has sunk deep into our minds and hearts.                            It was heartening to hear our little children sing and play the organ, as choir at Mass.
 
Thanks  to                            Mr. John Menezes for conducting the programme after Mass. He made it very lively with his jokes and interesting games. All                            praise to Ms. Helen Barreto for the delicious dinner prepared by her and to top it all, was the presence of our Zonal priest                            Rev. Fr. Mario Mendes, who is always there whenever we need him.
 
Hats off to Ms. Joyce George our Councillor and her team                            for planning and co-ordinating the function.

AN ENCOUNTER WITH JESUS
On 4
th November 2004, Hazel Viegas,                            our Parish Councillor together with our animators organized Gospel Sharing for the children of our Zone 1 Sector 3. “Gospel                            Sharing was really a very new thing for me,” says Rachel Pinto. “I did not know what it was going to be like.                            Once there, I realized it was something good.” “And real fun too,” says Merryl Fernandes. Lia Sathe from                            FILMC Team conducted the session for us. She helped us understand the importance of the Bible in our lives as the Word of                            God and taught us how we should respect the Bible. Sweety Kini garlanded the Bible which was placed between two candles. This                            was the enthronement of the Bible. Lia selected the passage which tells the story of Jesus calming the storm from Mark 4:35-41.
The passage was read aloud from our own bibles which also included the children’s version. Lia asked us                            to close our eyes, helped us imagine the scene and then we enacted it. A number of us took part and we enjoyed every bit of                            it. “Our participations was an interactive and enriching experience” says Karla-Ann. This enactment deepened our                            understanding ofthe message. Lia taught us a lovely action song “with Jesus in my Boat”. Oh! How we enjoyed singing                            it. All 23 of us kept rocking in the boat to the strains of the guitar well played by Willie Fernandes, our Animator. Lia’s                            warm personality and her gentleness helped us to interact with her and with one another. “It was the most amazing experience                            for me and I am sure everyone felt the same” says Merryl. Rachel remarks “the lesson I learnt from this passage                            is that no matter how difficult the situation Jesus helped us in all our difficulties.” Merryl sincerely hopes that                            in the future there will be more such programmes for children. She thanked Hazel Viegas and all the nimators who worked to                            make this programme a memorable and special one.

SOMWAR BAZAAR/LIBERTY GARDEN : ZONE II
Christmas                            Skit
- Fiona John, Somwar Bazaar / Liberty Garden
 
      There was a lot of co-ordination                            between the children, youths and adults in putting up the Christmas Skit. We had the bare minimum of costumes. The cooperation                            we experienced has really brought our community together.
 
      We went out of our way to display                            posters in Hindi and Marathi, which are predominantly spoken in our Zone, to invite our brothers and sisters of other faiths.
 
      Bro.  Shaimon,  from Bishop Besco’s team filmed the event.                            The Skit was performed in Hindi interspersed with dances. Fr. Alex witnessed our members enact the birth of Jesus.
 
      We put up a Star as well, which                            also received good community support.
            This Christmas                            endeavour brought the entire community together, as one family, Christians and non-Christians alike.

CHILDREN’S DAY
On November 20th the youth members of our Zone gathered together to celebrate Children’s Day. We had several exciting games for                            children of various age groups. It was wonderful to see our youngsters so happy and joyful, all having  fun intermingling.                            We rarely have this opportunity as we live far apart from each other. Besides, there is no proper place for us to meet and                            enjoy ourselves freely. The tasty snacks and crunchy chocolates that were served made this a day to remember. We are all looking                            forward to more such parties and festive occasions.
We thank our Parish Councillor, Fyona for making this truly memorable event possible.

Hymns both in English and Konkani rent the air.
To make the gathering more meaningful,light snacks were served which were all                            sponsored by our SCC members.

The singing was followed by a game of Housie, and a time to introduce every member of our family.
