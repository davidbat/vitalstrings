Prayer is the practice of the presence of God. It is the place where pride is abandoned, hope is lifted and supplication is made. Prayer is the place of admitting our need, of adopting humility and of claiming dependence upon God. Prayer is the needful practice of the Christian. Prayer is the exercise of faith and hope.  Prayer is the privilege of touching the heart of the Father through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
