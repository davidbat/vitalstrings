PEOPLE: Amen.
PRIEST: Holy
is         the living and Holy Spirit who sanctifieth the incense of his sinful         servant, having mercy upon us, and upon our fathers, our brethren, our         leaders, our departed, and upon all the children of the Holy Church,         living and departed, now and for evermore.
PEOPLE: Amen.]*
* omitted in 1923
 
Deacon: Let us who are of the household of         faith together make profession of our Christian belief, and say:
THE PRIEST AND THE PEOPLE: I believe in one God the Father Almighty,           Maker of heaven and earth, And of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,           Begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light,           Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made, Being of one substance with           the Father, By whom all things were made: Who for us men, and for our           salvation came down from heaven, And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost           of the Virgin Mary, And was made man, And was crucified also for us           under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried, And the third day           he rose again according to the Scriptures, And ascended into heaven,           And sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come again           with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: Whose kingdom shall           have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and the Giver of           life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father           and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the           Prophets.
And I believe One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge           one Baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for the Resurrection           of the dead, And the Life of the world to come. Amen.
 
1923:
Then shall the Deacon           say: Give we the Peace.
THE PRIEST: Grant, O Lord, that free from all guile and         hypocrisy, we may greet one another with an holy kiss.
And, turning to the people, he shall say: The         peace of the Lord be always with you.
AND THEY SHALL ANSWER: And with thy spirit.
Then shall the Peace be given.
And, in the meanwhile, a basin of water being brought           to him, the Priest shall wash his hands therein, saying privately:
Wash away, O Lord God, the foul pollution of my soul,         and cleanse me with the water of life; that in all purity and holiness         I may be accounted worthy to enter thy holy of holies.
Then shall he remove the veil from the sacred vessels,           saying privately:
O God our Father, who of thy tender love towards mankind         didst send thy Son into the world to bring back the sheep that had gone         astray: reject not us who offer unto thee this bloodless sacrifice, for         we trust not in our own righteousness but in thy mercies, and grant that         this mystery which is administered for our salvation be not turned to         our condemnation; but that we may thereby receive remission of our sins,         and may render unto thee due praise and thanksgiving; as also unto thine         only-begotten Son, and to thine all-holy and quickening Spirit, now and         ever, and world without end. Amen.
 
Then, the people standing, the Deacon shall         say:
[And thereafter shall           he cense the oblation, unless it has been previously censed, saying:
We offer unto thee incense, O Lord our God, for a savour         of spiritual sweetness; beseeching thee to accept it before thine altar         in heaven, and to send down upon us the grace of thy Holy Spirit, now         and ever. Amen.]
 
Then the Priest, turning to the people, shall say:
The love of God the Fa
ther;         the grace of the only-begotten S
on;         and the fellowship and indwelling of the Holy Spi
rit         be with you all, my brethren, for ever.
THE PEOPLE: And with thy spirit.
THE PRIEST: Your hearts be with Christ on high.
THE PEOPLE: Our hearts are with the Lord.
THE PRIEST: Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.
THE PEOPLE: It is meet and right so to do.
And, turning again to the altar, the Priest shall           proceed, saying:
It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we         should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O holy         Lord, Father Almighty, Everlasting God.
Here shall follow the Proper Preface according to           the season. After each of which Prefaces shall be said:
Therefore with martyrs and apostles, and with the great         company of thy saints triumphant, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name:         and we worship and adore thy Majesty with angels and archangels, and         with all the host of heaven, who ever fly before thy throne, praising         thee, and chanting, and saying,
 
1923: And thereafter         shall he cense the oblation, saying:
[Here the           Priest may set on incense.]*
THE PEOPLE: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,           heaven and earth are full of thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most           high.
[And here it is to be noted, that from the singing           of Holy, holy, holy, until the end of the           Great Intercession, incense is to be burned within the Sanctuary.] Then           shall the Priest proceed, saying:
Holy in truth art thou, O Father Almighty, Eternal King,         and in thine every gift and work dost thou reveal thy holiness unto men.         Holy is thine only-begotten Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ, by whom thou         framedst the worlds; and holy thine ever-blessed Spirit, who searcheth         out thy secret things.
Even as in truth thou art holy, O Lord, so also that         he might dwell in holiness before thee, didst thou create man in thine         own image; whom, when he transgressed thy commandments and fell, thou         didst not abandon nor despise, but didst chasten him as a merciful Father,         speaking unto him by thy priests and by thy prophets; and, when the fulness         of time was come, thou spakest unto us also by thine only-begotten Son,         whom thou didst send into the world to take our nature upon him, that         he might become man like as we are, and might renew thine image within         us;
Who, in the same night that he gave himself to suffer         death upon the Cross for our redemption, took bread into his holy and         spotless hands, and, looking heavenward unto thee (here the Priest         is to look upward), O God our Father, bless
ed,         brake, and gave it to his apostles, saying: Take, eat; this is my Body         which is given for you for the remission of sins and for life everlasting.
AND THE PEOPLE SHALL SAY: Amen.
Likewise after supper he took the cup, and, when he had         given thanks, he bless
ed         and gave it to them, saying: Drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood         of the New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission         of sins and for life everlasting.
AND AGAIN THE PEOPLE SHALL SAY: Amen.
Do this in remembrance of me; for as oft as ye eat this         bread and drink this cup, ye do show forth my death and proclaim my resurrection         until I come.
THE PEOPLE: Thy death, O Lord, we commemorate;           thy resurrection we confess; and thy second coming we await. We ask           of thee, also, mercy and compassion, and implore forgiveness of our           sins.
And the Priest shall proceed, saying: Wherefore,         O heavenly Father, we thine humble servants, being mindful of the precious         death of thy Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ; as also of his glorious         resurrection from the dead; his triumphant ascension into heaven; and         his session in majesty at thy right hand; do offer unto thee this our         reasonable service and sacrifice, making with these thy creatures of         bread and wine the memorial which thy Son hath willed us to make, and         rendering unto thee most hearty thanks for all thy dispensation towards         us.
THE PEOPLE: We give thanks to thee, we praise           thee, we glorify thee, O Lord our God, and we pray thee to show thy           mercy upon us and to hearken unto the voice of our prayer.
Then the Deacon shall give warning to the people,           saying:
How solemn, O my brethren, is this time, wherein we implore         the holy and quickening Spirit to descend and hallow this our Eucharist.         Let us worship in holy fear.
 
* Omitted in 1923.
1923 adds:
And therewith they shall all fall prostrate with their faces to the       ground, and shall so continue until the Great Intercession be ended. And       the people being thus prostrate,
The Priest shall say the Invocation of           the Holy Spirit:
Shew us thy mercy, we pray thee, O Lord, and upon us and upon these         gifts here set before thee send down thy Holy Spirit, that by his power         this bread and this wine may become unto us the Bo
dy         and the Bl
ood         of thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, and may hallow the spirits, the         souls, and the bodies of all who partake of them, to the bringing forth         of the fruit of good works and to the strengthening of thy Church upon         the rock of faith; through the same Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord,         to whom with thee and the Holy Spirit be all honour and glory, world         without end.
THE PEOPLE: Amen.
Then shall silence be kept for a space, the people worshipping.           And thereafter the Deacon shall say:
 
... the Deacon standing and turning to the people shall say:
 
Let us pray unto the Lord         for his grace and mercy.
Let us pray for the whole state of Christ’s Church.
Let us pray, at this dread time, for all men both living         and departed.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.*
 
* This response omitted         in 1923.
 
And the Priest shall proceed with the           Great Intercession, saying:
O Almighty Lord God and Maker of all things, whose blessed Son, by his         death upon the Cross, made one, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for         all mankind, that with boldness they might draw nigh unto the throne         of grace and find acceptance in his name: receive our supplications and         prayers, which through him we now offer unto thy Majesty; making intercession         before all things for thy holy Church throughout the world, and entreating         thee to endue her with the gifts of thy Holy Spirit and to grant unto         her that peace and unity which are agreeable to thy will.
THE PEOPLE: Amen.
 
 
THE DEACON: Let us remember our         Fathers in God, and the sacred ministers of the holy Church.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: And therein we pray for all Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and         other orders of thy Church, and specially for NN; beseeching         thee to grant them thy grace, that both by their life and doctrine they         may set forth thy true and lively Word, and rightly and duly fulfil the         ministry which thou hast committed to their charge. Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember those who travel, and those in any special         affliction or distress.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: And we humbly beseech thee, O Lord, to remember for good         all them that travel by land, by water, or by air; as also to be mindful         of them that suffer oppression, captivity, bondage, want, sickness, or         any other adversity; and to show thy pity upon them that are vexed by         unclean spirits. Send unto them the angel of thy mercy to comfort and         relieve them according to their several necessities, and to preserve         them to the attainment of eternal life. Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember one another, and our fellow members in Christ’s         Body.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: To us also thy servants, O Lord, and to all thy Christian         people, vouchsafe thy grace and thy mercy; that we may be preserved from         all things hurtful both to our souls and bodies, and may be delivered         from those afflictions which through our sins are fallen upon us. Grant         us to continue in the true faith of thy holy Church, and to walk steadfastly         in the ways of thy commandments unto our lives’ end. Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember those who bear the burdens of authority,         especially Christian Kings and Rulers.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: We pray thee also, O Lord, to remember all Christian governors         and those in authority under them, specially NN; aid them with         the armour of thy Spirit, that in all things they may seek thy honour         and glory, and that under them thy people may joyfully serve thee in all quietness and godly fear. Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember all men, that the needs of every one may         be supplied.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: And we entreat thee also, O Lord, mercifully to bless the         air and the dews, the rains and the winds; that through thy heavenly         benediction we may be saved from dearth and famine, and may enjoy the         fruits of the earth in all abundance and plenty; for the eyes of all         wait upon thee, O Lord, and thou givest them their meat in due season.         Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember those who have gone before us, especially         the glorious saints of God.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: And here, O heavenly Father, we yield unto thee praise and         thanksgiving for thy great glory declared in thy saints from the beginning         of the world, but specially in the glorious and ever-blessed Virgin Mary,         Mother of Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, as also in thy holy Apostle         Saint Thomas (and, if it be the Feast-day of any other saint or saints,         or confessor or martyr, here shall be added: Thy blessed Saint N,         or Saints NN, or thy blessed Confessor N, or Martyr N),         and in all thine evangelists and doctors, who have been thy witnesses         unto the uttermost parts of the earth; and we beseech thee so to unite         us to their holy fellowship that they may share with us in the communion         of this our Eucharist and continually assist us by their prayers. Amen.
THE DEACON: Let us remember the faithful departed.
THE PEOPLE: Lord, have mercy.
THE PRIEST: Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness the souls of         thy servants who have departed hence from us with the sign of faith,         and now repose in the sleep of peace. Grant unto them, we beseech thee,         O Lord, thy tender mercy and everlasting rest.
THE PEOPLE: Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord, and let light           perpetual shine upon them.
THE PRIEST: And vouchsafe unto us their brethren an end both Christian         and free from sin, and gather us beneath the feet of thine elect, when         thou wilt and as thou wilt, only without shame by reason of our faults;         that in this, as in all things, thy blessed Name may be exalted and glorified         together with the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ and of thine all-holy         and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
THE PRIEST: Peace be with you.
THE PEOPLE: And with thy spirit.
THE PRIEST: May the grace of Almighty God
,         and our Saviour, Jesus Christ, be with you all.
 
This and the following six petitions omitted       in 1923.
These three responses omitted in 1923.
 
Then shall the Priest perform the Fraction,           saying privately:
Grant, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, that, as the body of thy blessed         Son was broken (here the Priest shall break the Host) on the         Cross (here the Priest shall make the sign of the Cross over the         chalice with a portion of the broken Host) that we might become         one with him; so we who now partake of these holy mysteries may be united         in the fellowship of his mystical Body and (here the Priest shall         place the portion of the Host in the chalice) share with him in         the glory of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.         Amen.
And, if the number of those desiring to communicate be large, the           Deacon shall assist the Priest in breaking the bread.
And while the Priest performs the Fraction the people shall in the           meantime sing the anthem following:
    We have known the Lord, Alleluia: in the           breaking of the bread, Alleluia.
    The bread which we break, Alleluia: is the         Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, Alleluia.
    The cup which we bless, Alleluia: is the Blood         of our Lord Jesus Christ, Alleluia.
And the anthem ended, the Priest shall say:
As our Saviour Christ hath commanded and taught us, we are bold to say:
AND ALL TOGETHER SHALL SAY: Our Father, which art in heaven,           hallowed be thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done; In earth           as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us           our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead           us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil.
And the Priest shall proceed: Yea, Lord, we pray thee, suffer         us not to be tempted above that we are able, but deliver us from the         power of the evil one: for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,         for ever and ever. Amen.
 
[Here the Priest may set           on incense.]*
THE PRIEST: Peace be with you.
THE PEOPLE: And with thy spirit.
Then shall the Deacon say: Let us pray unto         the Lord that he make us worthy to partake of these his holy mysteries.
And the Priest shall say the prayer following:
Grant us thy blessing, we beseech thee, O Lord; and of         thy mercy vouchsafe that in all purity of heart and mind we may receive         the Communion of the Body and Blood of thy Son: who with thee and the         Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth for ever. Amen.
And, turning himself to the people, he (or the Bishop,           if he be present) shall bless them, saying: May the mer
cy           of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ be with you all, my brethren, for           ever.
Then shall the Deacon say: Give we heed in fear.
And the Priest, lifting the Gifts above the altar,           shall say:
Holy things for holy persons.
AND THE PEOPLE SHALL ANSWER:
 
* Omitted in 1923
    There           is none other Holy save the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy           Spirit. Amen.
    Praise be to the Father and to the Son and         to the Living and Holy Spirit, One God, for ever and ever. Amen.
    Glory to God in the Highest. Amen.
    Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is He         that cometh in the name of the Lord. The Lord is God and hath shined         upon us. Hosanna in the Highest.
Then shall he first receive the Gifts in both kinds himself, saying           when he partaketh of the bread: The Body of Christ, the Bread           of Life; and, when he partaketh of the cup: The Blood of Christ,           the Chalice of Life; and to whomsoever the Gifts be administered,           these same words shall be used therewith.
In 1923 this response was         simply:
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.

And thereafter he shall deliver the same to such of the Deacons and other               persons within the sanctuary, as shall be minded to partake of               the Holy Communion. Meanwhile a hymn may be sung.
The Priest shall turn to the west, and descend to           the Sanctuary step, bearing the Holy Gifts, and saying:
May the blessings of our great God and Saviour Jesus         Christ be on those who bear these Holy Gifts, and on those who dispense         them, on those who receive them, and all who have partaken and do partake         of them. May the grace of God be on us and on them here and hereafter         for ever.
THE PEOPLE: O Lamb of God, that takest away the           sins of the world; have mercy upon us.
    O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of         the world; have mercy upon us.
    O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of         the world; grant us thy peace.
THE PRIEST: Praise be to thee, O Lord our God, for ever.         Praise be to thee. Praise be to thee. O Lord Jesu Christ, may thy Holy         Body which we eat, and thy holy Blood which we drink, be not for our         condemnation, but for our life and salvation. Have mercy upon us.
The Priest returns to the altar.
THE PEOPLE: All the earth shall bow down before           thee, and adore thee. Every tongue shall praise thy holy Name. Thou           art the raiser of the dead and the good hope of those who lie in the           grave. We give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thy gracious mercy towards           us.
Here shall those of the people who desire to partake           of the Gifts come forward.
And to the words of administration, both of the bread           and of the cup, the communicant shall answer, Amen.
And during the administration of the Holy Sacrament           to the people shall be sung:
Strengthen, Lord, for holy service hands which           took thy mysteries here;
Be the ears which heard thy praises shielded from the voice of         fear;
Eyes which saw thy great compassion see thy blessed hope appear.
May the tongues which chanted ‘Holy’ ever           unto truth incline;
Grant the feet which walked thy temple in the land of light to         shine;
Bodies, by the Body nourished, quicken thou with life divine.
With thy worshippers abide thou; may thy love           direct our ways;
Hear the prayers we lift before thee, and accept our thankful         praise.
May thy peace and mercy keep us safe from harm through all our         days.
In the hour of thine appearing may we stand before           thy face;
Raise we ever glad hosannas for the wonder of thy grace;
For thy love hath shined upon us to redeem our mortal race.
Lord, who deign’st on our offences mercy’s pardoning streams to pour,
Grant us grace to own thy God-head and in reverent faith adore,
To thy sovereignty uplifting praise and blessing evermore. Amen.
Or some other hymn
And, turning to the people, he shall say: Peace         be with you.
AND THEY SHALL ANSWER: And with thy spirit.
Then shall the Deacon say: Let us give thanks         unto the Lord, for that he hath vouchsafed us to partake of his holy         mysteries and hath refreshed us with food from his heavenly table.
AND THE PEOPLE SHALL ANSWER: Thanks be to him           for his gift.
Then shall the Priest say this prayer following:
Merciful Father, who of thine abundant goodness towards         us hast vouchsafed to feed and strengthen us with the precious body and         blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and dost thereby make us one         with him and with all the members of his mystical body, and dost enable         us in the power of that sacred communion to overcome sin and to walk         as children of light; for these thy bountiful mercies we most heartily         thank thee, we praise and worship thee. And we beseech thee to give us         grace so to continue in that holy fellowship, that we may ever walk in         the steps of thy blessed Son, and offer ourselves a living sacrifice         acceptable unto thee; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom,         with thee and thy quickening Spirit, be ascribed, as is most justly due,         all praise and thanksgiving now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
THEN SHALL THE PEOPLE SAY: Finished and perfected           is the mystery of thy dispensation, as far as in us lies. We have made the memorial of thy Death, we have seen the symbol of thy Resurrection,           we have been filled with thine inexhaustible bounty, and enriched with           thine undying life; of the which do thou vouchsafe to count us worthy           in the world to come, O Christ our God; to whom with thy Father eternal           and thine all-holy and quickening Spirit be ascribed, as is most justly           due, all praise and thanksgiving, now and ever, and world without end.           Amen.
Then the Priest, turning to the people, shall let           them go, saying:
Unto the mercies of the holy and glorious Trinity, brethren,         we commit you; go ye with the food of your pilgrimage in pea
ce         and gladness.
The Ablutions may be taken after the Communion of           the people, or at this place.
Meanwhile a hymn may be sung, the following or some           other:
From glory unto glory advancing on our way,
We hymn thee, Christ our Saviour, our soul’s eternal stay.
From strength to strength advancing, as from           thy house we go,
We pray thee in our weakness thy perfect strength to show.
Direct our way before thee; preserve us in thy           love;
And grant us through thy mercy thy heavenly realm above.
From glory unto glory advancing on our way,
We hymn thee, Christ our Saviour, our soul’s eternal stay.
And thereafter he shall deliver the same           to such of the Deacons and other persons within the sanctuary and of the choir, as shall be minded to partake of the Holy Communion. And           afterwards, the people shall receive thereof, as they may be disposed.           And to the words of administration, both of the bread and of the cup,           the communicant shall answer, Amen.
And during the administration of the Holy Sacrament to the people           shall be sung:
    O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins           of the world; have mercy upon us.
    O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of         the world; have mercy upon us.
    O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of         the world; grant us thy peace.
Or some other hymn. And when all have communicated, the Priest shall           return to the altar, and shall reverently consume what remaineth of           the Consecrated Elements (except such as he may wish to reserve for           the Communioni of the sick), and thereafter he shall cleanse the sacred           vessels after the usual manner, and again cover them with the veil.
And, turning to the people, he shall say: Peace be with you.
AND THEY SHALL ANSWER: And with thy spirit.
Then shall the Deacon say:
Let us give thanks unto the Lord, for that he hath vouchsafed us to         partake of his holy mysteries and hath refreshed us with food from his         heavenly table.
AND THE PEOPLE SHALL ANSWER: Thanks be to him for his gift.
Then shall the Priest say this prayer following:
Merciful Father, who of thine abundant goodness towards us hast vouchsafed         to feed and strengthen us with the precious body and blood of thy Son         our Saviour Jesus Christ, and dost thereby make us one with him and with         all the members of his mystical body, and dost enable us in the power         of that sacred communion to overcome sin and to walk as children of light;         for these thy bountiful mercies we most heartily thank thee, we praise         and worship thee. And we beseech thee to give us grace so to continue         in that holy fellowship, that we may ever walk in the steps of thy blessed         Son, and offer ourselves a living sacrifice acceptable unto thee; through         the same Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and thy quickening         Spirit, be ascribed, as is most justly due, all praise and thanksgiving         now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
And during the administration of the Holy Sacrament to the people           shall be sung:
Strengthen, Lord, for holy service hands which took thy mysteries           here;
Be the ears which heard thy praises shielded from the voice of         fear;
Eyes which saw thy great compassion see thy blessed hope appear.
May the tongues which chanted ‘Holy’ ever unto truth           incline;
Grant the feet which walked thy temple in the land of light to         shine;
Bodies, by the Body nourished, quicken thou with life divine.
With thy worshippers abide thou; may thy love direct our ways;
Hear the prayers we lift before thee, and accept our thankful         praise.
May thy peace and mercy keep us safe from harm through all our         days.
In the hour of thine appearing may we stand before thy face;
Raise we ever glad hosannas for the wonder of thy grace;
For thy love hath shined upon us to redeem our mortal race.
Lord, who deign’st on our offences mercy’s pardoning streams to pour,
Grant us grace to own thy God-head and in reverent faith adore,
To thy sovereignty uplifting praise and blessing evermore. Amen.
Or this,
From glory unto glory advancing on our way,
We hymn thee, Christ our Saviour, our soul’s eternal stay.
From strength to strength advancing, as from thy house we go,
We pray thee in our weakness thy perfect strength to show.
Direct our way before thee; preserve us in thy love;
And grant us through thy mercy thy heavenly realm above.
From glory unto glory advancing on our way,
We hymn thee, Christ our Saviour, our soul’s eternal stay.
Or this, when the service is not sung:
Finished and perfected is the mystery of thy dispensation, as           far as in us lies. We have made the memorial of thy Death, we have           seen the symbol of thy Resurrection, we have been filled with thine           inexhaustible bounty, and enriched with thine undying life; of the           which do thou vouchsafe to count us worthy in the world to come, O           Christ our God; to whom with thy Father eternal and thine all-holy           and quickening Spirit be ascribed, as is most justly due, all praise           and thanksgiving, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
Then the Priest, turning to the people, shall let them go, saying:
Unto the mercies of the holy and glorious Trinity, brethren, we commit         you; go ye with the food of your pilgrimage in pea
ce         and gladness.
And, the people being thus dismissed, the Priest and those with           him in the sanctuary shall forthwith return to the vestry.
 
THE PRAYERS         AFTER THE SERVICE
The Priest shall say:
O Lord, who hast vouchsafed unto us to be sanctified         by the participation of the most holy Body and precious Blood of thine         only-begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, grant us also the grace of thy         Holy Spirit, that we may be preserved unblameable in the faith, and lead         us into our perfect sonship and redemption, and to the attainment of         everlasting felicity; who with the same thine only-begotten Son and thine         all-holy Spirit art our sanctification and light, now and always. Amen.
Then shall the Deacon say: Be we preserved in         the peace of Christ.
THE PRIEST: Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth         us by the receiving of his holy and spotless mysteries, now and for ever,         and world without end. Amen.
If a shortened form of the Liturgy is desired for           weekdays, the following may be omitted: the incense prayers, the O.           T. Lesson and Psalm, the hymns, the prayers of the Alms and some sections           of the Great Intercessions, at the discretion of the Priest. The Deacon’s           Biddings may be said by the Priest, and the Kiss of Peace given by           touch of hands.
The Kiss of Peace—The deacon takes the chains           of the censer just above the lid into his left hand, and in his right           holds them at the top. He then approaches the altar to the right of           the celebrant, and kissing it, presents the centre of the hanging chains.           The celebrant takes the centre of the chains into his right hand, and kissing them, offers his hand to the deacon to kiss. The deacon kisses           it, and the priest makes the sign of the cross on his (the deacon’s)           forehead. He then relinquishes his hold of the chains, and the deacon,           again kissing the altar, goes to the bishop and other priests in the           sanctuary, if any be present, and receives from them the kiss in the           same way. Still holding the chains as described above, the deacon next           approaches any other deacon or deacons in the sanctuary, and turning           his palms inwards takes the right hand of the other between them, and           so receives the kiss from him. Finally, relinquishing his hold of the           chains above the lid, he holds the censer in his right hand only, and           going to the nearest layman of the congregation, takes the layman’s           outstretched right hand between his joined palms, and so gives him           the kiss. The layman passes the kiss to his neighbour in the same way,           and he to his, and so on until all in the church have received it.
 
THE VESTRY PRAYERS
The Priest, having returned to the vestry, shall say:
O Lord, who hast vouchsafed unto us to be sanctified by the participation         of the most holy Body and precious Blood of thine only-begotten Son Jesus         Christ our Lord, grant us also the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that we         may be preserved unblameable in the faith, and lead us into our perfect         sonship and redemption, and to the attainment of everlasting felicity;         who with the same thine only-begotten Son and thine all-holy Spirit art         our sanctification and light, now and always. Amen.
Then shall the Deacon say: Be we preserved in the peace of         Christ.
THE PRIEST: Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth us by the receiving         of his holy and spotless mysteries, now and for ever, and world without         end. Amen.
(The last two rubrics were omitted in 1923.)
THE PROPER         PREFACES TO BE USED
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
On Trinity Sunday, and all the Sundays of the year           for which no Proper Preface has been appointed.
Who with thine only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit         art one God and one Lord; not one only Person, but three Persons in one         substance, for that which by thy revelation we believe of thy glory,         the same we believe of thy Son and of the Holy Spirit, without any difference         or inequality. Therefore with martyrs, etc.
From the first Sunday in Advent until Christmas Eve,           save when the Proper Preface for any Saint’s Day is appointed           to be said:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who, at his first coming         into the world in fashion as a man, did promise in the form of God to         come again with glory, that he might receive his people into the place         which he had prepared for them, and that as kings they might reign with         him for ever. Therefore, etc.
From Christmas Day, until Epiphany:
Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son,         to be born as on this day (but between Christmas Day and Epiphany         shall be said: as at this time) for us; who by the operation of         the Holy Ghost, was made very Man, of the substance of the blessed Virgin         Mary his Mother, and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from         all sin. Therefore with martyrs, etc.
Upon the Epiphany and seven days after:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, in substance of our         mortal flesh, manifested forth his glory, that he might bring us out         of darkness into his marvellous light. Therefore, etc.
Upon the Purification, as also upon the Commemoration           of the blessed Sacrament, and Feast of the Holy Name:
Because, through the mystery of the Incarnate Word, the         new light of thy brightness has shone upon our understanding, that while         we acknowledge him to be the visible God, we may be raised up by him         to the love of things invisible. Therefore, etc.
Upon the Annunciation, and all other feasts of the           Blessed Virgin Mary save the Purification:
Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son,         to be born for us; who, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, was made         very Man, of the substance of the blessed Virgin Mary his Mother, and         that without spot of sin to make us clean from all sin. Therefore, etc.
Another Preface which may be used on all feasts of           the Blessed Virgin Mary save the Purification:
Because by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost the blessed         and ever-glorious Virgin Mary did both conceive thine only-begotten Son,         and in the glory of her virginity pour forth the eternal light upon the         world, even Jesus Christ our God. Therefore, etc.
From Ash Wednesday until the Saturday before Passion           Sunday, save when any other Proper Preface is appointed to be said:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who for our sakes did         as at this time fast forty days and forty nights, and was in all points         tempted like as we are, yet without sin, to the intent that we, which         are tempted, may, through him, come boldly to the throne of grace, that         we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Therefore,         etc.
From Passion Sunday till Maundy Thursday:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who, being found in fashion         as a man, humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death         of the Cross, that, being lifted up from the earth, he might draw all         men unto him. Therefore, etc.
Upon Easter Day and seven days after; and from the           Monday following the first Sunday after Easter until the Ascension           Day, save when any other Proper Preface is appointed to be said:
But chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious         Resurrection of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, for he is the very Paschal         Lamb which was offered for us, and hath taken away the sin of the world;         who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life again         hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore, etc.
From Ascension Day till Whitsun Eve, save when the           Proper Preface for any Saint’s Day is appointed to be said:
Through thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our         Lord; who, after his most glorious Resurrection, manifestly appeared         to all his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven to prepare         a place for us; that where he is, thither we might also ascend, and reign         with him in glory. Therefore, etc.
Upon Whitsunday, and six days after:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who ascending up into         heaven and sitting on thy right hand, according to his most true promise         did as on this day (during the six days after Whitsunday shall be         said: as at this time) send down thine Holy Spirit upon the children         of adoption, to teach them and to lead them into all truth, giving them         boldness with fervent zeal constantly to preach the Gospel unto all nations;         whereby we have been brought out of darkness and error into the clear         light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy Son Jesus Christ. Therefore,         etc.
Upon Feasts of Apostles and Evangelists, save when           the Proper Preface for any of the Great Festivals is appointed to be           said:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who did vouchsafe to choose         thy servant, Saint N (or thy servants Saint N and Saint N)         to be of the company of the Apostles (or to be an Evangelist), by whose         ministry thine elect might be gathered in from every nation, and thy         Church instructed in the way that leadeth unto everlasting life. Therefore,         etc.
Upon All Saints’ Day, and all other Saints’ Days           for which no Proper Preface is appointed to be said:
Who in the multitude of thy Saints hast compassed us         about with so great a cloud of witnesses, to the end that we, rejoicing         in their fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set before         us, and together with them receive the crown of glory that fadeth not         away. Therefore, etc.
At the Dedication of a Church, and upon the Anniversary           of the Dedication:
Who in temples made with hands buildest up for thyself         a spiritual temple made without hands. Therefore, etc.
At the Consecration of Bishops, and at the Ordination           of Priests and Deacons:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, the great Shepherd of         the sheep, who, for the feeding and guidance of his flock, did appoint         divers orders of ministers in his Church. Therefore, etc.
At the Commemoration of the Departed:
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom there hath shined         forth on us the hope of a blessed resurrection, that we who are grieved         with the certain knowledge of our mortality may by the firm assurance         of immortality be comforted; seeing that in death thy faithful servants         die not, though they be changed; for when the house of their earthly         tabernacle is dissolved, there is prepared for them an habitation eternal         in the heavens. Therefore, etc.
