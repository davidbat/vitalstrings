Hymns We Sing at St Peter's in The Forest Bombay N.Z
Kia Ora This page comes from Bombay in New Zealand. I hope to produce a page that will tell you what hymns we sing here, mainly on Sundays, but also on other occasions we celebrate here. There are not many of us, usually about 20 turn up. The Hymnal we mainly use is "With One Voice" a production of the Hymnal Trust located in Raumati. It has fairly traditional tunes in it and a small selection of NZ hymns. WOV indicates the Tune is from here. WOV is a NZ version of The Australian Hymnal, all Nos before 625 are the same, the rest are a NZ Compilation. As well as that, I hope to have a fewer number of Hymns from "Alleluia Aotearoa" from the NZ Hymnal Trust in Christchurch. These are derived mainly from NZ sources. AA indicates the Tune is from here! I have just got a new book of New Zealand Carols, "Carol our Christmas", put out by the same publisher as Alleluia Aotearoa. COC indicates the Tune is from here. WAI is a collection in a book I call "Waiuku". It started from an evening we had in Waiuku and all the parishes in the Franklin area came & sang their favourite hymns. It was great! Other tunes have been added to it. If you are traveling on a Sunday, why not swing off the Motorway at the Bombay Service Center, a few turns of the wheel up the hill and there we are (1k). You will be most welcome. 9.30 am all Sundays. If there is a 5th Sunday, we will be having a combined service with the Presbyterians here at Bombay,
at either of the two churches, only a couple of hundred metres apart..
 We don't have a Vicar just now, The Rev Bruce Owen is Priest in Charge,  The Rev Betty Keene is our Priest Assistant.
P.S. We usually have a live organist, don't expect me to be playing! I might be singing :)
