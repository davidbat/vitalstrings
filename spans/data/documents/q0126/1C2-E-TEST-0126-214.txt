Welcome to The Wesleyan Church. We're people with loving hearts who strive to reach persons of every nation with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Born out of the nineteenth century struggle for personal freedom, we are called to minister to the needs of a twenty-first century culture with a message of hope and holiness.
