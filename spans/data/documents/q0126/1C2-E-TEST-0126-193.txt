Hindutva attacks against the Christian minority in India
An index (1964-1998)
This            index of attacks by the Hindu fundamentalist forces on the Christian            minority community in India since 1964 reveals the startling frequency            with which the attacks have suddenly increased since the assumption            of power by the Hindu right wing party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)            nine months ago. The number of violent incidents between 1964 and 1997            is 53, which is quite marginal by Indian standards, but in the space            of one single calendar year of 1998 more than 90 violent attacks have            taken place in states as far apart as Gujarat and Karnataka, Haryana            and Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. The pattern            of orchestrated violence by the organisations and outfits related to            RSS is reminiscent of the large scale acts of sustained and continuing            violence by the same forces against Muslims during and after the campaign            for the demolition of Babri Masjid and the 1984 violence against Sikhs.            The dedication with which the the militant wing of Hindu fascism—often            called hardliners—is pursuing its goals is only matched by the studied            innocence with which their political patrons in the ruling BJP are professing            their ignorance of these incidents (the list includes the saffron Home            Minister LK Advani) and denying any link with these.
The            index has been circulated by Mr. John Dayal on behalf of the United            Christian Forum for Human Rights. Further details can be obtained from            there (Fax: 91-11- 3715146; e-mail: johndial@del2.vsnl.net.in)
INCIDENTS            OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN INDIA
The following            is a list--still not comprehensive--of incidents of violence reported            against the Christian community in India in the recent years, in particular,            during 1997-98. All care has been taken to ensure the authenticity of            the data. Wherever possible, the actual FIRs and complaints and reports            of the National Minorities Commission and other government organizations            have been used in this list. A more comprehensive list, with details            of the incidents and the course of the investigations is currently under            preparation. It is called the Unofficial White Paper because the Governments            have so far refused to make public a detailed list of incidents of violence            against the minorities, and particularly against the Christian community,            and also the action taken by the police, district, state and central            authorities on such complaints.

A tractor was driven into the            premises and the playground for children was ploughed. Damage to the            tune of Rs. 15,000 was caused. The land in question was the property            of the late Shantilal Shah who handed it over to the Loyola Education            Trust to build a school in 1984. The Fathers have been running the school            which caters to the tribal students of neighbouring villages and the            residents of Zankhav town (out of the 720 students enrolled, 152 are            Christians and the rest belong to other religions). The "Gujarat Samachar"            and the "Sandesh" dailies, had been systematically printing inflammatory            and vicious articles in Gujarati that the priests were forcibly converting            tribals to Christianity and that only Christian children were being            admitted into the school. Two truck-loads of hooligans from the nearby            Wadi village were let loose in Zankhvav market the next day . In the            ensuing violence, the parents of three students were arrested. Rather            than take punitive measures against the evil-doers, the Gujarat State            Government (BJP), seems to be a tacit endorser of the destructive activities            that have been carried out and are being carried out to create fear            among the tribals and to paralyse the good work done by Christian groups.
