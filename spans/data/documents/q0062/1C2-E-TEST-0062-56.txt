Overview
Tebow is arguably one of the best college quarterbacks of all time.  He has won a lot of games over the years as he is a perfect fit for Urban Meyerâ€™s offensive system.  He will need a lot of retraining when he gets to an NFL camp as he plays out of the shotgun formation and will need a lot of work on dropping from center and setting up in the pocket while reading coverage schemes.  He has a strong arm but his accuracy has been inconsistent over the years as he often ends up throwing the ball when on the move.  He is not generally real quick to pull the trigger once he decides where he wants to throw the ball.
Strengths
Tebow has the size and bulk to hold up at the next level.  Is a highly-competitive player.  Exhibits rare character on and off the field.  Is athletic enough to pick up tough yards with his legs.  Was extremely productive in college.  Possesses very good arm strength.  Is a winning football player.
Weaknesses
Tebow really struggles with his accuracy.  Release is far to slow to fit balls into spots against NFL defensive backs.  Release point and mechanics (elongated, wind-mill delivery which comes out too low) likely need to be altered.  Was not asked to run through pro-style progressions and struggled reading defenses, especially those with NFL concepts, in college.
