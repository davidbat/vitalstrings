John Elway: 'Tim Tebow's not going anywhere'

Everyone has an opinion on Tim Tebow. But the opinion that matters most probably is that of John Elway, who is not only a Denver Broncos legend but also Tebow's boss as the team's vice president of football operations.
That's why it was such a big deal when Elway seemed to suggest as recently as a few weeks ago that Tebow may not be the Broncos' quarterback of the future -- and an even bigger deal that Elway seems to have warmed up to the popular player and now thinks Tebow can turn into the pocket passer he wants to lead the team for years to come.
"Tim Tebow's not going anywhere," Elway said in an interview with the Associated Press. "I mean, he's going to be a  Bronco and we're going to do everything we can and hopefully he's that  guy."
With the unorthodox quarterback as their starter, the Broncos have recovered from a disastrous start and hold a one-game lead in the AFC West with two games remaining. But even after Tebow had improved to 4-1 as a starter a few weeks back, Elway was noncommittal when asked on Denver radio if he was "any closer to feeling if you have  your quarterback on this team?"
Elway paused before answering, "no," and then pointed out that Tebow needed to do better as a passer and on third downs. But now Elway feels that answer "was probably a little bit too blunt."
"I think the big picture with Tim is we've got to see the whole  body of work," he said. "And so really what you want to see with him is the  improvement that's going to happen over time.
"Because, he's done what we knew he could do, and where we've seen his  progress is what he does within the pocket. What we've said, and I said  it when I first got here, was we know Tim's a great player and what  we've got to do is make him a great quarterback, and what I've learned  is you've got to be able to win from within the pocket."
Elway added: "Do I think he'll get there? Yeah, I do."
