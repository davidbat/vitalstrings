It is still early, but it is becoming more apparent that Tim Tebow will not succeed as a starting quarterback in the NFL. I could see him possibly staying in the league as a situational player.
Saturday night, playing the fourth quarter, he fumbled twice and was sacked three times. A report came out last week, citing anonymous Denver Broncos sources, that Tebow has been the fourth-best QB in camp -- even behind a college free-agent QB. Tebow is certainly way behind Kyle Orton and Brady Quinn.
I never understood why the Broncos drafted him in the first round.
