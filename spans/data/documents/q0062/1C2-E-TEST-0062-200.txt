Action hero?
Fans of radio sports talk host Jim Rome got the scoop on the upcoming Die Hard movie Wednesday when Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Tom Rothman dished about the film's title (A Good Day to Die Hard) as well as the future of hero John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, and his troubled son -- a role that has yet to be cast. He also threw out this bombshell: How about Tim Tebow in the part?
Was he serious? It was hard to tell. But Rome hated the idea, saying that while Tebow would rehearse harder than any actor before him (a reference to #15's famous speech while he was still playing for the Florida Gators), he just wasn't tough enough.
Could this guy be Tim Tebow's dad?
Tebow is simply too nice, too god-fearing, Rome implied. "Yippie-ki-yay, gosh golly!" just doesn't have the same ring to it as Willis's similar but R-rated catchphrase.
Still, Rothman seemed to be honestly toying with the idea of casting the Denver Broncos' new starting quarterback .
Some other details from the interview: Shooting will begin in January with an eye toward a February 14, 2013 release; the story takes place in Russia, where McClane goes to help get his son out of trouble.
If Tebow does get the part, it won't be the first time Denver has figured prominently in a Die Hard movie. Good portions of Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990) were shot at the old Stapleton International Airport, long before DIA came into existence.
