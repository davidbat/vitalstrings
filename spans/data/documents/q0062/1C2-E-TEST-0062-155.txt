Are you suggesting that God does not help Tebow (other than his God given talent) along the way? Tebow should take full credit for everything he has achieved? I know he would not say that. No player would.

For most of human history games have been a preview to war.  Children run and scream and battle safely while the men take that skill to the larger death competition man has with himself.
Money is not a true measure of success on the field. “Narrow success” refers to his slight victories.
Tom Brady began his career in a period of lower wages.  If only our real warriors enjoyed such wage inflation.  Instead, the market delivers rewards to those engaged in a silly preparation for physical domination filled with nostalgia of days long gone and tribal connection to our largest city states.
Don’t be so dull.

nothing. you die and that is it. you decay and cell death occurs and the connections are lost. “you” are not a special thing.  
Don’t be afraid of this. Dive into the fire of your fears and confront that fact. what do you think is a complex creature anyway? just humans? that is rather solipsistic. how about all animals as complex creatures? the complexity of a mammalian body is practically the same across the board, just to give an example. I am sure that you do not think that other animals are complex, you are thinking only about humans. you obviously dont understand how evolution works, or anatomy and physiology, or more importantly, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.
we are complex creatures yes, but not so complex, and just because you dont understand something (or choose to apply the complexity and mysticism to only one kind of living thing) doesn’t make it mystical, or better, or great, or scary. parts of you can die at any time, this happens every day for people who have big enough strokes. blood pools on their brain, they lose the ability to speak. where did that part of themselves go? their ability to speak is just gone, its never coming back, and its not waiting for you in heaven. the same thing happens when you die except for everything. you are motorized meat, a fragile bag of interrelated systematic functions that, if punctured the wrong way, or broken in the right place, will die. its not about god.  dont be afraid of this! accept it. it will make you happier.

Why is it a bad thing to thank God for the talents you have. You know, being humble isn’t a bad thing, even if you don’t personally believe in God and believe Tebow’s motives are stupid.
SNL and liberals can’t stand that there is a prominent Christian who is a good kid and role model for kids. It kind of shatters the secularist meme that all Christians are evangelicals who want to take away others’ rights and shout them down.

It’s all about being humble. Thanking a greater power for the talents, abilities, and opportunities you have that 99% of others don’t have. Just because he prays doesn’t mean he’s stupid, even if you can’t fathom why he does it.

I dunno. I’ve been to three games in Denver in December. The first time was a  real lung burner, the wind so biting I learned by the local fans wear thermal underwear and triple heat blankets, the air so thin you stand up to cheer & almost pass out, not to mention the post Rah Rah headaches can be blinding. Seriously, hypothermia is an actual concern. It was easier the second time because I was more prepared but I gave it up after 3 because my wife picked up a chill that lasted a month. It’s not right; it’s ACTUALLY Mile High & they ought to have a covered stadium & give out oxygen bottles at the airport.

That isn’t true. 
It doesn’t offend me that some people believe in god, in fact I can think of great utility in believing in god. 
But god and “the bible” or any religions doctrine, are not, or rather, should not be inextricably linked. 
I think that religious people who do believe in god, should take a critical eye to the belief and the documentation. Just ask questions, think about it in terms of dynamic assessment. Without critical consideration, things like intolerance, hate, and opposition occur.

Wow, you think Satan actually wears red? Or is obvious about what he’s doing?  Does he have obvious horns and a pitchfork, too?  Because it’s pretty hard to deceive people into following you when you look like that, don’t you think?  If I were to picture a literal Devil, I would have to assume he’d be very well-spoken and beautiful, so you’d be seduced into following him; frankly, wouldn’t it be easier to seduce people to your side by seeming as attractive, kind, and good as possible?  If you’re looking for Satan and his work, maybe you should be looking in the places you’d never expect.  Hmm?

A Christful man does indeed give praise as instructed.
“But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”-Matthew 6:6
Liberals so hate the Christians that some even love Christ with whole heart.  Liberals so hate Christians that most love mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers who believe in the literal truth of ancient text.  Liberals so hate the Christians that they live easily in a society where large majorities believe in angels and demons.  Liberals are so angry at Christianity that they allow comedians to dare poke five minutes of fun at a brash phenom who makes his Christ love a central tennent of his public performance.  Most Christians understand all of this.  A few do not.

Everything has a season and a place. Tebowing is as out of place in public festivals as is your piety here. Your example does not make people think, they reflexively laugh. But you know this. You just pretend it is unimportant. In a social situation with us “mortals”, you have to at least show the social competency of having a sense for timing. Neither you or Tim Tebow have mastered this basic social skill. People are going to want to tune you out till you learn and practice this.
As to what I believe, that is another matter. It actually doesn’t matter. The sense of what I’m saying either communicates to you or it doesn’t. Feel free to take a stand or challenge me on an issue or an idea, but if you want to know what I believe on some topic, then ask in another thread ;-)

My faith is just fine, Shonangreg. I am not fearing anything. You are making assumptions.

Wow. How far libs have come when they get their panties in a bunch over Tebow giving thanks to God. I uess the thing that separates him from the non offensive ones is that he actually means it.

Those final lines in Revelation are saying to not change the meaning. The Great Commission describes sharing to truth, and the necessity to translate into a different language is different than changing the meaning.
And, Yes, I do believe that God humbled himself into the form of a man in order to live the sole perfect life in human history. Yes, if God can breath life into you and me he can use a pure virgin to bring Christ to this world. Yes, I believe that Babylon happened.
A majority of arguments against God are in reply to what we, as flawed humans, have done poorly. The Church has been corrupted as points, and it looks bad. No disagreement there. –I am only asking you to look purely at your own existence, look up to the stars, and ask yourself if there is a higher power. For me, I believe there is.

The “Mormon” walk-away line is classic in several ways:
 
* it unexpectedly plays against Tebow’s Evangelical flavor of Christianity
* it caps the theme of the whole sketch, summarized in The Book of Mormon “…believe in Christ, and [...] be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do” (2 Nephi 25:23)
 
* it is literally true and the most penetrating humor is an innovative presentation of a truth.

Please understand that god does not choose to send anyone to hell. It is your choice to make if you spend your life rejecting and denying him. Then why would he make you spend eternal life with him. Please just consider that thought. And please be aware of the terrible mistake you are making by not accepting the forgiveness that Jesus Christ offers.
Again i understand that this is not easy for the non-believer to accept. But put aside your pride and preconceived notions. And just consider the decision and consequences of rejecting Christ. It is your decision not Gods. What if your wrong

so you begin with a false premise and work backwards huh?
where does it say translations do not count for ‘changing’ the words…
by definition–transation is CHANGE..
that is why Muslims and Jews read their scriptures in the original toungue..
if the church is corrupt–so is the religion AND THE TEXT THAT THE CHURCH HAS DEVELOPLED..
who do you think wrote the bible?
and if Jesus is perfect..why did he commit blasphemy on the cross by damning GOD or himself as you say?
FATHER WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?
and God did not breath life into me–
but if God can create a universe and man out of dust..
why does he have to rape a married virgin to become her bastard sone–concieved via means of adultery?
and if babylon happened-where are the ruins? it was only a few thousand yeas ago and after the great flood–that is also impossible.
so about 3000 years ago all men were scattered around the world and changed race? and yet god has allowed man to travel to the moon and send crafts to pluto? yet he would not allow the building a building?

In the beginning Man created God; and in the image of Man created he him. 2 And Man gave unto God a multitude of names,that he might be Lord of all the earth when it was suited to Man 3 And on the seven millionth day Man rested and did lean heavily on his God and saw that it was good. 4 And Man formed Aqualung ofthe dust of the ground, and a host of others likened unto his kind.5 And these lesser men were cast into thevoid; And some were burned, and some wereput apart from their kind.6 And Man became the God that he hadcreated and with his miracles didrule over all the earth.7 But as all these thingscame to pass, the Spirit that didcause man to create his Godlived on within all men: evenwithin Aqualung. 8 And man saw it not.9 But for Christ’s sake he’dbetter start looking.

The skit doesn’t mock belief in God.
The skit mocks people like Tim Tebow who need to put on a show about it.  That’s the whole reason Jesus shows up and tells him to take it down a notch.  Even Jesus is telling him to cool it.
There’s a huge difference between the two, which you seem to be missing.
It just seems like Christians are always looking for a reason to feel offended or persecuted

Let’s also keep in mind that the the Christ described by the right wing seems to be one who’s focus is abolishing the inheritance tax, keeping the rich from being taxed, wars of choice, and loves American’s far more than any of his other children.   The GOP Jesus seems to have gotten pretty bored with all that caring for the poor chatter that dominates the Bible.   In fact if GOP Jesus came back, I’m pretty certain he would drive a Stars and Stripes bedecked Humvee .
However, I think that GOP Jesus would be pretty tough to locate anywhere in any Gospel.  But don’t let that stop from bending his word into anything you need to support your agenda.

your comment tries to make two different points that are not related

2. not understanding how things work? 
or are you trying to say that since i dont marvel at complexity
(which i never said or didn’t say) then that means I don’t understand how things work?
my comment on complexity was with reference to Josh’s comment on complexity 
being necessarily linked to god. I never mentioned my own personal stance on
“marvel” of life. 
complexity of life is marvelous, actually, 
i marvel at (and work with) it all the time in my own profession

the fact of the matter is “we are complex but not so complex” means that:we are very complex, intricately complex actually (that is part of the definition of evolution). A lot of that complexity extends to all living things, and some of it is characteristic of certain living things, but we are “not so complex” that we need god to understand it, or explain it. it is easily understandable, and explainable. without god.
