Tim Tebow, movie star? Well, the Die Hard franchise is coming to a close with the fifth installment (“A Good Day to Die Hard”) set to begin filming in January. Bruce Willis is 57. Why not inject some life into the series with Tim Tebow ?
The topic of Tebow came up Wednesday when Tom Rothman, co-chairman and CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment announced the new film project exclusively on Wednesday on the syndicated sports show The Jim Rome Show, known as The Jungle.
“What do you think of Tebow in the lead?’’ Rothman asked Rome and the listening audience. Rome did not give Tebow a thumbs up.
“He might be too nice,” Rome said, referring to Tebow’s wholesome reputation. “But no one would work harder to make it work.” Rothmans says, regardless, he expects many young Hollywood actors to audition for the part. “We have to find just the right guy.”
Of course, Tebow is heavily religious, so all the drinking, smoking, curse words and gunfire might be too much for the Denver quarterback. Not sure I can picture Tebow getting all throaty and saying, “ Yippie Kai-Yay, Motherfucker !” at the denouement of Die Hard Six (tagline: Forget Dying, He’s Praying).
That being said, there’s no question Tebow the saintly PG action star would trump Brian Bosworth the action star. Stone Cold might have been one of the largest cinematic disasters of the 1990s.
