Tebow was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft . The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens on the first night of the draft on April 22. [104] The Ravens received picks in the second, third and fourth rounds which were used to select Sergio Kindle , Ed Dickson and Dennis Pitta respectively. [105] Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said about his two first-round selections, which included Tebow, "We want players who are tough, smart, have great character, love football and are passionate about coming here and helping the Broncos win a championship. I think both players fit that role, and I think that's something that we're looking for in all of our players. What we're trying to build here is team chemistry and a team that cares about winning and winning a championship, and that's it." He also added specifically about Tebow, "He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick." [106] Tebow responded in an interview, saying, "My greatest joy in Denver is going to be to repay Coach McDaniels for believing in me." Tebow also said of his critics, "I just have a passion to play football. When you do things different than other people sometimes do them, and you don't settle for just being average, you open yourself up for criticism. But, I'm ready for it. I've learned to live with it. I never just wanted to do things the same way everybody else does." [107]
ESPN.com 's Bill Williamson said, "Josh McDaniels' legacy is Tim Tebow." [106]
When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably won't start at quarterback as a rookie; although, he said he'll "play when he's ready." He also said that there could be some packages custom-made for Tebow right away and indicated that he could initially contribute to Denver's variation of the wildcat formation , called the wild horse formation. [106]
The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige praised the pick, saying "Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward...Tebow has become the most celebrated fourth-string rookie quarterback in NFL history, the most controversial quarterback pick by the Broncos since Tommy Maddox was chosen in exactly the same spot in the first round in 1992, the most decorated player and the most determined quarterback, and the most puzzling dichotomy, in the entire draft." [108]
Tebow wore number 15 on his jersey for the Broncos, the same number he wore in college. [109] He set an NFL Draft record for jersey sales. [110] He also had the best-selling jersey in the entire NFL each month since being drafted. The Broncos, as a whole, led the NFL among all teams in jersey sales as well. [111] [112]
On July 29, Tebow signed a five-year contract with the Broncos that had a base value of $11.25 million (he can make as much as $33 million through certain performance-based incentives). The contract also included $8.7 million guaranteed. [113]
On October 17, Tebow scored his first NFL touchdown, which was a five-yard running play against the New York Jets . [114] On November 14, Tebow threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Spencer Larsen on his first career NFL pass attempt, as part of a 49-29 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs . He also added a one-yard rushing touchdown in the game. [115] His performance against the Chiefs earned him his first Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honor. [116]
Tebow started his first NFL game on December 19, which was a 39-23 road loss to the Oakland Raiders . [117] Tebow completed eight of 16 passes for 138 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown pass. He also rushed for 78 yards, 40 of which came on a touchdown run in the first quarter of the game. It was the longest touchdown run for a quarterback in Broncos history and the longest touchdown run in NFL history for a quarterback in his first start. Tebow became just the third quarterback in NFL history to throw for a touchdown of 30 or more yards and run for a touchdown of 40 or more yards in the same game. [118] He finished the game with a 100.5 passer rating, the highest ever in team history for a professional debut.
Tebow's first career victory came in his second start on December 26. The Broncos defeated the Houston Texans , 24-23, in Denver. Tebow helped rally the Broncos from a 17-0 deficit at halftime, as he finished the game with 308 passing yards and one touchdown pass. He also added a fourth quarter rushing touchdown, which capped the comeback. [119] Tebow received his second Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honor following his performance. [120]
Tebow finished his rookie season playing sparingly in six games as a back-up (primarily on plays involving the wild horse formation, which is Denver's variation of the wildcat formation ) before starting the last three games of the Broncos' season. He threw for a total of 654 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed for 227 yards and six touchdowns. Tebow became the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for a touchdown in each of his first three career starts.
2011
Tebow playing against the Kansas City Chiefs in January 2012
Tebow began the 2011 season as the Denver Broncos ' backup quarterback , with Kyle Orton acting as the starter. After a 1–4 start and some poor performances, Orton was replaced by Tebow at halftime during a home game against the San Diego Chargers in the fifth week of the season. Tebow nearly led the Broncos back from a 16-point deficit, as he passed and ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Chargers ultimately won the game, 29–24. Shortly afterward, Broncos' head coach John Fox announced Tebow would start in the following game on the road against the Miami Dolphins . Tebow and the Broncos struggled in the first three-and-a-half quarters against the Dolphins, but rallied from a 15–0 deficit in the last three minutes to win the game, 18–15, in overtime. Denver became the first team in NFL history to win a game after being down by at least 15 points with three minutes to play in a game. [121]
On November 6, Tebow rushed for 117 yards, along with passing for 124 yards and two touchdowns, as part of a 38–24 road victory over the Oakland Raiders . It was the first game in his NFL career that Tebow rushed for at least 100 yards. Broncos' running back Willis McGahee ran for 163 yards and two touchdowns, making Tebow and McGahee only the fifth quarterback and running back tandem in NFL history to run for at least 100 yards in the same game. [122] The Broncos followed up a road win over division-rival Oakland with another road win over a division rival, the Kansas City Chiefs . Tebow completed two passes on eight attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown. His second completion, a 56-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to wide receiver Eric Decker , sealed the game for Denver. Tebow became the fifth quarterback since 1980 to win a game after being the sole quarterback on the winning team to complete two or fewer passes. [123] Four days later, Tebow was 9-for-20 with 104 yards in a Thursday Night Football home game against the New York Jets . He led a 95-yard, game-winning touchdown drive with less than six minutes to play, and the Broncos trailing, 13–10. On third-and-four, Tebow ran for a 20-yard touchdown with less than one minute remaining. The Broncos won the game, 17–13. [124] Tebow guided the Broncos to another comeback victory the next week—a 16–13 overtime road win over the San Diego Chargers. He ran the ball 22 times for 67 yards. His 22 rushing attempts were the most by an NFL quarterback since 1950. [125]
In the 10th start of his NFL career, Tebow led the Broncos to their third consecutive come-from-behind win of the season after trailing going into the fourth quarter, as Denver beat the Minnesota Vikings on the road, 35–32. The following Sunday, Tebow once again guided a comeback victory, this time at home over the Chicago Bears . Denver won 13-10 in overtime after facing a 10-0 deficit with just over two minutes to play in regulation. Tebow's sixth come-from-behind fourth quarter or overtime victory in his 11 career starts was the most in NFL history for any quarterback in that time span. [126]
Tebow and the Broncos' winning streak was broken by the New England Patriots in week 15. Tebow rushed for 2 touchdowns and accounted for almost 300 total yards against the Patriots, but Denver lost 41-23. In the Broncos' 40-14 loss to the Buffalo Bills the following week, Tebow had 1 passing and 1 rushing touchdown, but he also threw three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. He struggled for a second straight game the following week in a 7-3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs , completing only 6 of 22 passes and finishing with a career low quarterback rating of 20.6 But with a week 17 loss by the Oakland Raiders , the Broncos won the AFC West title in a tiebreaker. [127]
After the three consecutive losses, Broncos vice president and former quarterback John Elway said Tebow was playing tentatively and needed to "pull the trigger." [128] [129] On January 8, Denver hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers during the first round of the NFL playoffs . Tebow threw for a career high 316 yards and two touchdowns, including an 80 yard TD to Demaryius Thomas on the first play of overtime, as the Broncos won 29–23. [129] Tebow completed 10 of 21 passes in the contest, setting the franchise record for quarterback rating in a playoff game (125.6) [129] and an NFL record for yards per completion (31.6) in a playoff game. [130] Media sources noted Tebow's passing yards (316) and yards per completion (31.6) evoked the Bible's John 3:16 . The Nielsen ratings for the game also peaked at 31.6. John 3:16 was the top search item on Google the next morning, followed by Tebow and Tim Tebow. [131] [132]
The Broncos were handed a 45–10 defeat by the New England Patriots the following week, knocking them out of the playoffs. [133] After the season, Elway confirmed that Tebow would be the Broncos starting quarterback going into training camp in 2012. [134]
On April 28, 2012, the NFL announced its 91st-100th ranked players of its NFL Top 100 in which Tebow was ranked 95th by his fellow peers. [135] [136]
New York Jets
On March 21, 2012, in the wake of the Broncos signing free agent Peyton Manning , Tebow was traded, along with the Broncos' 2012 7th round draft pick, to the New York Jets in exchange for the Jets' 4th and 6th round picks. [137] [138]
