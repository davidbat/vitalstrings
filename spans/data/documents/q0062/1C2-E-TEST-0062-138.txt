Personal life
Tebow was homeschooled until college.  He is an outspoken pro-lifer , and his mother had been told to have an abortion rather than to give birth to him.   Tebow appeared in a pro-life television ad that aired during the 2010 Super Bowl , risking retaliation against his career by pro-aborts and the liberal media . [2]
Tebow gives frequent interviews to the liberal media and often leaves them speechless. He answered a highly personal question at a press conference about his sex life by revealing that he practices abstinence : [3]
“
I think you're stunned right now.  You can't even ask a question. ... I was ready for that question, but I don't think ya'll were.
”
Tebow volunteers on mission trips, one of which in the summer of 2008 to the Philippines was chronicled in an issue of the ESPN Magazine.
His faith in Christ is a well-known fact inside and outside the sports world.
Tebowing
Tebowing is the act of kneeling on one knee, resting your head on your fist and giving thanks. It is named for Tebow's fashion of public prayer, although some Christian critics have denounced such open practice as this, citing Matthew 6, verses 5 and 6.
And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites. They love to pray when standing in the synagogues and in the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. I tell you truly: They will get what's coming to them. But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
However, Tebow's act can be considered simply an expression of faith and thanks, rather than a prayer. That Tebow bows to God on the field does not mean that he does not also pray to him in private.
