Katy and Tim are scheduled to meet at her hometown church where she used to sing! Will it be love at first sight?
Katy Perry ‘s split from Russell Brand , 36, may still sting for the 27-year-old, but she’s wasting no time moving on and her parents – Keith and Mary Hudson – are 100 percent on her side. They’re even going as far as trying to set their daughter up with the Denver Broncos starting quarterback, Tim Tebow !
“[Katy's] mentioned on more than one occasion how much she likes Tim,” a source tells OK! magazine.”Katy’s mom firmly believes the best cure for heartache is to quickly fall in love again… In her mind, Tebow is the perfect guy for her daughter. He’s handsome, charming, intelligent and above all, a good Christian.”
Katy’s parents have gone as far as inviting Tim to speak at the church Katy used to sing at in Huntington Beach, Calif. Of course — when Katy will be there!
I think they would make a great couple! Plus, he’s totally the opposite of bad boy Russell Brand. What do you think, HollywoodLifers? Would you like to see Katy and Tim date? Vote and weigh in below!
