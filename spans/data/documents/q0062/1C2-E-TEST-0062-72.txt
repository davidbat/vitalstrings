Pat Graham, The Associated Press:
DENVER — Tim Tebow inspired a phenomenon when he dropped to a knee and began praying as his teammates wildly celebrated around him after an improbable overtime victory in Miami last weekend.
That was simply Tebow “Tebowing,” a phrase coined by a fan sitting in a bar in New York watching the popular yet polarizing quarterback rally the Denver Broncos.
Jared Kleinstein was mesmerized by Tebow’s peaceful demeanor kneeling on the turf amid all the chaos that ensued. He launched a website in which fans could submit photos of themselves “Tebowing,” which means getting down on a knee and praying, even if everyone else around you is doing something completely different.
And later in the article:
On Friday after practice, Tebow said he appreciated the spirit of the website.
“Yeah, some people don’t necessarily take it seriously but they’re on their knee praying, so who knows what you’re going to think about after that and how that can affect you?” Tebow said. “Hopefully, it’s a good example for people.”
The Lions’ Stephen Tulloch (after a sack) and Tony Scheffler (after a touchdown catch) imitated the one-knee prayer Sunday. They might have also been inspired by a portrayal of the Lions-Broncos matchup on the N.F.L.’s Web site as good versus evil.
In his own way, the Denver Post columnist Mark Kiszla mocked Tebow:  (He also called him the worst quarterback in the N.F.L.)
So maybe we need a new definition for Tebowing.
It’s a prayer for mercy.
Please, in the name of heaven, bring us somebody who can actually play quarterback.
Extra point  Is it all in good fun?  Tebow invites scrutiny with the very public nature of his religious beliefs, his evangelistic side. But let’s imagine that a player displayed a Muslim religious ritual or one based on Hinduism? Would it be fair to mock those displays as well? If not, why is it fair game for Tebow?
