A buiness-savvy artist in Pueblo, Colorado is selling Tim Tebow Tebowing Christmas cards on eBay.
The artist created a limited edition of 1,000 cards showing the Denver Broncos quarterback Tebowing next to Baby Jesus.
The mystery artist says Tebow stands for what’s right:
“Any football fan who reads the sports pages in newspapers today, or visits the leading sports websites, often sees an unpleasant scene filled with greed, out of control egos, and bad behavior,” the artist writes on eBay . “While Tim Tebow has never claimed to be perfect, his winning combination of athletic ability, determination, friendliness, authenticity, and a deep faith have won him many thousands, if not millions, of sports fans across the United States, and indeed, all over the world.  Sharing these cards, with their simple image of a good guy who never fails to give glory to God, would be a great way to show your support for Tim and all he stands for.”
Here’s what the card says inside:
“May the Love of Jesus
Fill Your Heart and the Hearts of your Loved Ones
In This Joyful Christmas Season
And Throughout the Coming Year!”
The artwork will go up for auction in a few days.
