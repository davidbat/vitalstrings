If Whines Ward could do it, Tebow can do it. (Just don’t expect Tebow to be a cheap shot artist)

I like the guy, he is a good man. I say put him out on the field, he has the skill and ability to play multiple positions, might as well use him seeing as they are low on depth.

In the beginning, Tebow was drafted at QB.  On the sixth day, Tebow was moved to another position. On the seventh day, God rested.

Looks like Houshmanzadeh will have a job by Monday this week.

John Fox after the game, “It is what it is”. Get used to it denver fans.

Tebow’s better built for a tight end than a wide receiver. And if he were coached at it, he might be a great one. The guy is a natural football player and a fierce competitor. He just has poor throwing mechanics and limited experience in a pro system. I hope at some point he can play for coaches who really want to develop his talent, wherever it might lie.

This could be an opportunity to show that he is a leader at any position or in any role his team needs him.

This guy is not an NFL QB the sooner he realizes that the sooner I’ll change my twitter name from tradetimtebow22. He is a fullback or a second Eric Decker but NOT A QB!
