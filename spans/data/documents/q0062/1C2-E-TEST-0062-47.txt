Scouting Reports
Tebow possesses all of the intangibles you want in a quarterback. He showcases great leadership skills and is a guy who his team really seems to rally around. He's a physical runner who knows how to take a pounding, break tackles behind the line of scrimmage and keep drives alive. Tebow has that 'it' factor, as he always finds a way to make a play when nothing is there. He possesses a strong arm and can get the football downfield and will make all the throws at the next level. When he strides into throws, he can sling the ball on a rope and he can be accurate on all levels of the field. However, he isn't natural when passing. The ball never seems to leave his hand with a natural spin, and he struggles with his rhythm in the passing game. He's more of a one-read guy who has a tough time going through his progressions, deciphering information and throwing through a defense. He did not look comfortable vs. Monte Kiffin's Cover 2 defense at Tennessee and he lacks the ability to throw to open receivers through the zone. All the intangibles and physical tools are there, but he's going to need a lot of work.
