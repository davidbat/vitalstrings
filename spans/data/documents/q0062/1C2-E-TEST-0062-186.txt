Why Do Football Fans Love Backup Quarterbacks?
In the 16th century, guys like Martin Luther, the Tim Tebow of his day (the Pope said he was "like a bull in the church's vineyard," an apt description         for Tebow's running style), and John Calvin kick-started what was historically called the "Reformation." This epochal period, which featured the         Catholic Church contra mundum and included such hilariously-named religious incidents as the "affair of the sausages," saw a massive rise in         interest in God's control over all things, including salvation, the life of Christians, and, well, everything. Medieval Catholicism offered Ye Olde         Peasant a worldview in which they cooperated with God to earn salvation; Reformational Protestantism suggested that nothing could thwart the will of         God and that salvation came only through divine fiat.
Luther and Calvin drew upon the teachings of Jesus in formulating the doctrine of providence. In the course of arguing with Pharisees, as he seemed to always be doing, Jesus taught that God superintended everything, including even the most ordinary animals of his creation, like the sparrow. "Are not         two sparrows sold for a penny?," he asked a hostile crowd. "And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father" ( Matt. 10:29 ). In         other words, God ordains—or decides—when the sparrow dies and when it lives. According to Scripture, this is true also of what king rules when, how         many hairs grow on our heads, and every twist and turn our lives on this fragile sphere take (see Prov. 16:33 ; 21:1 ; Matt. 10:30 ). 
BACK TO FOOTBALL
But enough about sausages and Reformers and sparrows—what about Tim Tebow? Does he win because God miraculously propels him to victory? Is the " hand         of God ," as footballer Diego Maradonna famously called it, directing his passes (or at least his fourth-quarter attempts)?
Yes and no. The Bible says that God oversees everything that happens in this world. He ordains what socks we put on in the morning, how burnt our         toast is, what we think about in the day, and everything in between. All things happen "according to the purpose of him who works all things according         to the counsel of his will," as the apostle Paul said in Ephesians 1:11 . So does that include Tim Tebow and his playmaking? Yes, it surely does.
But, as you can see, this is saying less than you might initially think. I believe that God is overseeing all of Tebow's passes, but he's also         overseeing the typing and reading of this paragraph. He's overseeing the Denver Broncos, but he's also overseeing the Boston Celtics (much as it may         seem otherwise at present), the Museum of Modern Art, and the playtime of your nephew.  He's in control of all things. In this sense, which is called         "secondary" causation (God's oversight of all things), the Lord is directing Tebow's life.
But is God directly intervening on the football field in the same way that, for example, he did to cause the virgin birth of Luke 2 (in what is called         "primary causation")? That I don't know. It's not clear to my human eyes how this all shakes out.  I do know that the Lord is working everything out         according to his wise and mysterious counsel which, try as we might, we cannot fully understand.
I can say from the Bible that God oversees the lives of his people, of those who trust the death of Christ for their life in heaven, with special         concern. According to his Word, God is carrying out a mission of salvation ( John 3:16 ; Rom. 10 ; Eph. 1 ). He has a special interest in directing the         lives of his people so that in every endeavor, in myriad fields, they bring him glory.  That's why Paul said to Christians, "whether you eat         or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" ( 1 Cor. 10:31 ). Life affords countless opportunities to simultaneously speak the gospel and live in a distinctly Christian way and thereby advance the kingdom further.
Tim Tebow was given natural and freakish athletic ability. He also has tremendous character and seemingly strong faith, gifts that, according to the         Bible, only God can give. We know from 1 Corinthians 1 that God delights to make foolish "the wisdom of the world," showing that God, and not only         rappers and rock stars, has a subversive side, too ( 1 Cor. 1:20 ). It may be that God is working through the miraculous feats of Tebow on the field to         draw attention to his own glory. God is regularly pleased to do such things, it seems, whether that means rebuking upper-crust Anglicans or bloated         Bible-belt Baptists by raising up believers in massive numbers in marginalized regions of the world or by giving favor to politicians and accountants         and homemakers who nobody else deemed worthy.  
So yes, God may be directly—not generally—working in his wise providence to bless Tim Tebow (for which the Denver Broncos organization is no doubt much         obliged!). But this is not altogether clear. Two things are clear to me, though. First, whatever God does is best. Second, in certain times he grants         unusual favor to his people, as biblical episodes like the life of Joseph show (see Genesis 37-50 ). Most of us muddle along, living unspectacular yet meaningful lives in God's sight, but some are appointed by God for unusual service and prominence.
WHAT ABOUT THE PATRIOTS?
But what happens when Tebow loses? What happens if my New England Patriots, a team I have loved since Dave Meggett was getting stuffed on every punt         return and Drew Bledsoe was completing cannon-like passes to more sideline coaches than receivers, steamroll the Broncos, as they did earlier in the         season? Has God capriciously retracted his blessing on this All-American golden-boy, who runs like a lion yet speaks like a Sunday-school teacher?
This is easier than your average late-night philosophical chat in the college lounge might make it seem. The Bible teaches that no believer is assured         an easy road. In other words, contrary to what health-and-wealth teachers like Joel Osteen say (to the tune of massive earnings), God nowhere promises         to unendingly bless his people in worldly terms. On the contrary, it seems from biblical texts like Hebrews 11:35-38 that Christians will know         considerable suffering in this world. Speaking of the most faithful leaders of the historic church—not the bad boys and girls of the Bible who would         seem to deserve pain—the author says of their earthly sojourn that
Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and         even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep         and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and         caves of the earth.
This is an incredible reality. It's why I have heard famed pastor and apologist Tim Keller of Manhattan's Redeemer Presbyterian Church say, to a         wealthy evangelical audience, "Suffering will get you" (see pages 22-34 in his excellent book The Reason for God for more on this subject).          There is no way to avoid it as a Christian.
What does this mean in light of a possible Broncos loss on Saturday? It means that there is no reason to believe that God has failed Tebow, that the         light of the divine in Tebow's life is extinguished. God's Spirit, directed by God's will, blows like the wind where it wishes ( John 3:8 ). It may be         that Tebow will succeed in spectacular fashion; it may be that he will have the worst game of his life. Either way, the Bible assures us that God         loves his chosen, God is orchestrating every detail of their lives, and God will lead them through success or failure to the end of all things. Sometimes God grants believers great victories, and sometimes he asks them to walk through the fire. This is true whether it is experienced on the         football field, in the office, or in a country that rewards outspoken Christianity with a sword to the throat. 
Perhaps this sounds like a cop-out, as weird as the mystical, linebacker-thwarting wood elves I introduced earlier. But if it does, remember the one         whom Christians worship. Jesus Christ was the Son of God in human form.  He did not come to earth to be lauded, though, but to serve and to suffer ( Mark 10:45 ). It was the will of God to bruise him, and through his vicarious death and life-giving resurrection to make a way to heaven for fallen         mankind. 
There is no greater reminder than this that God uses suffering in the lives of believers to accomplish his will. Whether, as with Joseph, he grants Christians incredible accomplishment and wealth, or whether, as with Job, he leads them steadily through the valley of the shadow of death, he loves         them all the same. Sometimes, we remember, it is through tremendous hardship, suffering even to the point of death, that his people gain the greatest         victories. 
That is the message of the cross, where an innocent man was crucified, naked and gasping, on behalf of the guilty. It is the lodestar of every         Christian, the confession that no one can stymie, whether we make our way through life as a mailman, a child with Down's syndrome, or a football star.
