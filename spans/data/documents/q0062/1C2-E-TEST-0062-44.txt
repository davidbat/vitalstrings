As a freshman at Florida, Tebow served as the backup to starting quarterback Chris Leak and played a key role in the team's national championship season. As a sophomore, Tebow broke NCAA records while scoring 55 touchdowns and became the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy. He led the Gators to another national championship in his junior year and finished third in the Heisman race despite receiving the most first place votes. His senior year fell short of a national championship as the Gators lost to eventual BCS champion Alabama in the SEC Championship game. Tebow did end his college career a winner setting BCS bowl game records in the Sugar Bowl against an overmatched Cincinnati.   « Show less
