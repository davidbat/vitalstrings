Tim Tebow, hopeful Broncos starting quarterback, was one of the first players to arrive for minicamp practice at the Broncos Dove Valley headquarters this morning at 7:45 a.m., according to the Denver Post's All Things Broncos .
The Denver Post goes on to report that Tebow displayed "tremendous coordination" during practice and that dozens of news media members gathered just to see him back in action. But the humble Tebow had this to say about all the fawning:
Honestly, it's just my first day and I'm a rookie just like everybody else.
The Sports Network reports that the dawning of the Tim Tebow era is already underway and that Tebow will very likely become the team's full-fledged starter. NBC Sports ProFootballTalk agrees with that analysis and goes on to say that Brady Quinn is likely to be Tebow's backup. Great news for Tebow and Quinn fans, but bad news for Kyle Orton fans who officially went on the trading block Tuesday at 8 a.m., according to The Denver Post .
Rumors are flying with regard to where the $9 million salaried Orton may wind up, but NBC Sports ProFootballTalk is betting on the Miami Dolphins or the Arizona Cardinals.
Orton, Denver's starting quarterback, has said that he doesn't want to play backup to Tim Tebow and with good reason -- Orton had two of his best seasons playing for the Broncos, throwing 41 touchdown passes and 21 interceptions, according to Fox31 . But, it's clear, Tebow is emerging as the star in Denver.
Broncos continue to practice all week with two public training sessions on Thursday, 8:50 a.m. and 6 p.m. and one on Friday at 2:40 p.m., according to the Denver Broncos website .
First game of the preseason is set for August 11 at 6:30 p.m. in Dallas against the Cowboys.
