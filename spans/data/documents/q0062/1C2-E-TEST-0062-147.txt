'God's a Tim Tebow fan'

Despite Denver's loss this week to the New England Patriots, the vice president of an interdenominational Christian denomination says "Tebow mania" is still alive and well.
 
Before Sunday's defeat, quarterback Tim Tebow had led the Denver Broncos on a six-game winning streak to rise to the top of its division. With many of those games ending in something of a miraculous fashion, it left some wondering if Tebow, the home-schooled son of missionaries who prays on the field and boldly proclaims his Christian faith, had heaven rooting for his team.
 
But Dan Britton, executive vice president of the  Fellowship of Christian Athletes  (FCA), tells OneNewsNow a lot of football fans are getting their theology mixed up.
"God's not a Denver Broncos fan; instead, God's a Tim Tebow fan because God's a fan of his people, his children," Britton says.
He describes Tebow as a humble young man of God.
"Really, his heart is about ministry and impacting people's lives more than [it is about] winning football games, but everyone is all about winning football games and how he's doing it," the FCA executive vice president explains. "Tim Tebow is not praying for wins. He's not praying, 'God, give me a win.' He's praying, 'God, can I glorify you today on the field?'"
Britton is fascinated by how people respond to Tebow. Many are inspired by the young NFL star, while others do not know how to handle his leadership or the bold stance he takes for his faith.
