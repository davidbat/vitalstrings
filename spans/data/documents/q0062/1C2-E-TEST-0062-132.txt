Want a Slice of Tim Tebow 3:16 Pizza?
By Larry Brown January 12, 2012 - Posted in Everything Else
Famous Joe’s Pizzeria out of Madison, Alabama has taken the pizza game to a whole new level. They’ve gotten into the business of putting the faces of sports figures on their pies.
First we have the Tim Tebow 3:16 pizza. The Tebow pizza is an acquired taste; you’re left skeptical of it at first, but it tastes better towards the end. As a bonus: all orders of the Tebow 3:16 pizza are hand delivered by the Lord.
Next we have the Nick Saban pizza:
I’ll tell you this much, it looks a heck of a lot better than the Nick Saban chocolate statue .
And being in Alabama, of course we have the Bear Bryant pie:
The man who makes the pizzas is Joe Carlucci. He’s in the Guinness Book of World Records for highest pizza toss. Maybe these sports pizzas will get him in there as well.
Thanks to Jarrett Myers for sending in the pics.
