When U.S. Olympian Lolo Jones' virginity became the subject of a recent story on HBO's Real Sports, she was instantly linked to NFL star Tim Tebow.
Not negatively, just because of the obvious.
Both are high-profile, good-looking athletes who are in the minority in saving themselves for marriage. They should date, right? A lot of people think so ...
Amazingly, when Tebow entered the New York Jets locker room last week, several of his fellow players immediately started chanting, "Lo-lo! Lo-lo!"
A dedicated Twitter user, Lolo Jones was among the many people who saw the New York Daily News' report on this and responded immediately:
Some memorable lyrics to that song:
"I've been alone with you / Inside my mind / And in my dreams I've kissed your lips / A thousand times / I sometimes see you / Pass outside my door."
"Hello! Is it me you're looking for?"
Right?! The 29-year-old Lolo Jones, who is of mixed-racial descent, then followed up with a second Tweet about her fellow athletic virgin:
Hmm. Well, there you go. If Tebow does in fact enjoy chocolate milk, perhaps a phone call after the summer Olympics is in order ...
