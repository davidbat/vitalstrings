Fantasy Analysis
Tebow has done most of his offseason work with the Jets' offense along with a smattering of special-teams snaps. The quarterback said he'll embrace any role the Jets give him but after leading the Broncos to the divisional playoffs last season it's clear he wants to throw. The only chance Tebow will have to become Fantasy relevant is if Sanchez struggles or gets hurt. Don't plan on drafting Tebow in the majority of leagues, but he could be someone to add off the waiver wire much like what happened to him during his first two years with the Broncos.

Top Impact Rookies for 2012 NFL Season
The NFL welcomes a stout rookie class in the 2012 season. But which rookies will have the biggest impact from a statistical perspective, a game-to-game perspective and a playoff-hunt perspective? Let's break down our Top 10.
Tim Tebow was traded from the Broncos to the Jets this offseason, and he's now expected to be part of a quarterback rotation with Mark Sanchez. The Jets have said they would like to get Tebow about 20 plays a game, and that might not necessarily be all at quarterback. Plans are reportedly in the works to get Tebow time as an H-back, fullback, running back and as a protector on punts. He might be a jack-of-all-trades but it could mean minimal and unpredictable stat production. There's always the chance Tebow beats out Sanchez for the starting job, or simply plays well enough to earn more snaps, but that's tough to figure unless Sanchez falters during the year. That's what happened in 2011 -- Tebow opened the season behind Kyle Orton, got the chance to play and led the Broncos to the playoffs. He had at least 18 Fantasy points in six games with 11 starts and was a star in one playoff victory against the Steelers. But now he has to prove himself again. Tebow should not be drafted in the majority of leagues if he's coming off the bench, but he is someone to monitor. If Sanchez struggles then don't be surprised to see Tebow start. And even in his limited roles he could be a decent source of rushing yards, which could make him worth a late-round pick in leagues that start multiple quarterbacks. (Updated 5/24/12)
