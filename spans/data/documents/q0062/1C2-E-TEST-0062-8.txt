The Jets want Tim Tebow at 250 pounds, about 10 pounds heavier than his playing weight last season with the Broncos.
It's another sign that the Jets view Tebow as a major part of their running game via the Wildcat package.  Per ESPN New York, the Jets see Tebow's legs as a weapon in the red zone.  At 250, the goal-line option would outweigh Shonn Greene by 24 pounds.  It would also be the heaviest Tebow has ever been. Jun 14 - 8:42 AM

Tim Tebow is practicing strictly as Mark Sanchez's backup quarterback during Jets Organized Team Activities.
He's not working on gadget plays or running back.  Though the Jets plan to install a "Tebow package," they appear to be training him to spend the large majority of his time under center.  If Sanchez struggles early in the year, Tebow could take over as the full-time starter.  The Jets' third-stringer is Greg McElroy. May 21 - 4:47 PM

Jets QBs coach Matt Cavanaugh has been "pleasantly surprised" with Tim Tebow.
"Not just watching him play on film," Cavanaugh said. "I think he’s certainly got the arm strength. He has good mechanics. They’re getting better every day." Cavanaugh also said Tebow has been focusing on the "fundamentals of trying to be rhythmic in the pocket" this offseason. Although the Jets' special teams plans for Tebow have gotten all the attention, it appears he'll be called on to attempt at least a handful of passes per game. May 15 - 8:36 AM

Jets special teams coach Mike Westhoff calls Tim Tebow a "more potent Brad Smith."
It could hint that the Jets plan to use Tebow on returns, though it's also possible Westhoff was simply alluding to his Wildcat role.  Smith was routinely used out of the Wildcat in New York, but attempted just seven passes in five seasons.  Westhoff's comments could be an indication the Jets will allow Tebow to be much more of a dual-threat out of the Wildcat than Smith.  If Tebow were actually used in the return game, he'd instantly be the slowest returner in the league. May 7 - 8:34 AM
