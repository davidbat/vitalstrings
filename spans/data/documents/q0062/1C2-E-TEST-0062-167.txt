Is Tim Tebow the NFL's MVP? [Poll]

Tim Tebow is a winner. He's a clutch player and a natural leader. He's a Heisman Trophy winner and a two-time BCS champion.
And he just might be this year's MVP of the NFL.
Don't laugh ... not too hard anyway. Obviously there are many other quarterbacks out there who are more skilled passers and have better numbers than Tebow. But remember, we're talking about the most valuable player in the league, not necessarily the best.
One question frequently asked in determining a player's value is: How good would his team be without him? In Tebow's case, we actually know the answer. The Denver Broncos were 1-4 and going absolutely nowhere before Coach John Fox finally listened to the chanting fans and made Tebow the starter.
The Broncos have gone 6-1 since then and are tied with the Oakland Raiders at the top of the AFC West. If the playoffs started this week, they would host the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round.
Tebow's performances haven't been that pretty or conventional. In many cases he's been bailed out by the defense, which always seems to leave the quarterback in position for one comeback after another late in the game (a.k.a. Tebow Time).
But that unit doesn't seem much different since the first five games of the season. Von Miller, the team's leader in sacks, and Wesley Woodyard, the leading tackler, played in all of those games and standout Elvis Dumervil played in three, all losses.
The one thing that has changed since that horrendous start is the person calling the signals. For whatever reason, Tebow has brought a spark to the Broncos and their fan base. And, with apologies to Aaron Rodgers and the still-unbeaten Green Bay Packers, he's the story of the year in the NFL.
But does all of that make him MVP material? Vote in the poll and leave a comment explaining why you voted the way you did.
