Tim Tebow Add comments
Erin Drewes tells Playboy she isn’t Tim Tebow’s girlfriend and looks totally unbelievable in the process.
Wearing only body paint, Erin Drewes informs Playboy’s Girlwatcher that she is only good friends with Tim Tebow and never was his girlfriend. Simply put, “We are acquaintances through mutual friends and we would see each other here and there. We were standing together talking at a party at U of F and that’s when the now-infamous picture was taken.”
That’s ok, had that not happened we wouldn’t have these wonderful pictures of Erin Drewes.
