Are you fellow atheists so sensitive that you want to outlaw another persons right to say what they believe, or get on a knee for a second?
Can’t you think for yourself and live and let live?  
If a team says you need to be Christian, that’s something different.

He can say what he wants and we can comment on that.  If you make a spectacle of yourself and promote odious organizations like Focus on the Family, then expect to be criticized.

I’ve never understood the Tebow bashing.   Forgetting about the religion – he won the Heisman as a sophomore, he helped lead Florida to national championships.  He’s a great athlete.  Let’s see what he does against the Patriots (less than) stellar pass defense on Sunday.  
David Gann
I am not a religious person however,
Tim Tebow is, among other things, building a Childrens Hospital in the Philipines. I wonder what all these cynics have done for anyone lately.
Tom
Those hospitals are a front for Christian propaganda. Their mission statement is :
“Healing the sick and proclaiming the Kingdom of God.”
Evangelizing for a religion as part of your hospital’s mission is disgusting, and these Christian evangelicals have destroyed many family based cultures in the far east and elsewhere, literally pitting family ‘believing’ members against non-believing family members, and causing rifts in the social fabric. It is disgusting.

I don’t think the Constitution nor the Christ are helped in anyway by this tempest in a bowl sized teapot.
What do you plan to change by taking a stand on a man’s demonstration of his connection to the Divine? �
What does he plan to affect by his public actions?
I was glad to hear Tebow does not thank Jesus for winning but rather, for his gifts.
We should follow his example, if not his particular path.
the divine in me greets the divine in you.

Within the bizarre spectacle that is professional sports, in this case football—overpaid, overgrown kids bashing into each other in a barely controlled orgy of public violence, a mass distraction providing a false sense of community to sheeplike masses—we’re supposed to care about one player’s public displays of fealty to mythological entities.
Wake me when they find another habitable planet.

Actually Filipinos are very religious with or without the Hospital but a lot of Filipino Catholics are leaving the congregation to find a better christian domination. You are right selling a religion in a Hospital is disgusting.
Modavations
Tebow is bashed because the Left has no god.Their god is Govt..Why do you think Christmas is Winter Holiday and Thanksgiving is Fall day,etc,.
Patrick
I don’t think that’s true.  Liberals are the only ones who called for stoning the adulterer Newt Gingrich.
Gregg
Not true, many conservatives want to stone him too. For liberals it’s ideological, they were happy to give Clinton a pass. Ditto Edwards.
Patrick
You’re missing the point – if the right was so god-fearing, they would support public stoning of adulterers.  After all, the exhortations to do so come from the same part of the Old Testament that they incessantly cite in their homophobic screeds.
Gregg
Maybe I am missing the point. I just think there are God-fearing Democrats and I don’t think the Bible advocates stoning adulterers. I’m not sure I want to get your point.
Patrick
Deuteronomy 22:22 – “If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman”
You can cherry-pick the Bible all you want, but that’s what it says, and it’s supposedly the word of god, so…
Gregg
People interpret the Bible many different ways. It doesn’t say stone’m. Some say the Bible tells them to handle snakes too. It’s a faith thing, says it right there. So… if someone “says” they’re a Christian they dern well better get some snakes or they’re hypocrite quarterbacks… obviously Republicans. 
Professed heathens (Democrats) don’t matter, they never said they were angels like the Republicans always do. Republicans want to be in your bedroom. 
I think I get your point. No need to elaborate.
Patrick
Probably no need, but it feels like the right thing to do.  If you claim that the Bible is a source of authority that permits you to bash gays, then you need to explain why its other claims, say, about ostracizing menstruating women, don’t need to be taken seriously.
Otherwise, the Bible is just a jumble of ancient writings, full of internal contradictions, that you can trot out whenever you want to express your dislike of something.  And anyone who responds to such inconsistent claims of authority is a fool, at best.
Gregg
I personally don’t say any of that. And those that do are of all ideological  persuasions.
.
Gregg
Replying up here because of the little box, you wrote: “Otherwise, the Bible is just a jumble of ancient writings, full of
internal contradictions, that you can trot out whenever you want to
express your dislike of something.  And anyone who responds to such
inconsistent claims of authority is a fool, at best.”
I can agree with the first half but why disparage those who find comfort with their beliefs? Nobody knows for sure, it’s impossible. I’m not a Christian but I respect those who are.
Patrick
Now, I’m sure you believe that there are fools in this world.  There are behaviors, or modes of thought, that you consider foolish.
I can fairly say that I respect most Christians, but there are those who claim that, for example, homosexuality is an abomination because of this or that verse in the Old Testament.  However, they dismiss much of the rest of the Old Testament, and don’t view the exhortations to, for example, kill adulterers, as having the same authority.
Those people are fools.  They suffer from the inability, or unwillingness, to bring their capacity for reason to bear on the supposedly “revealed” text that is the Bible.  Consequently, they find themselves believing or saying foolish things.
This is not to say that fools are unworthy of pity, or a degree of respect, but to consider their internally inconsistent beliefs to be as well-founded as those of people who recognize the fallibility and historical context of supposedly “sacred” texts (Bible, US Constitution, etc) is to descend into an abyss of false equivalence.
If you decline to judge those who find comfort in poorly founded and incorrect religious beliefs, then you must also decline to judge those who find comfort in nihilism, drugs, sex, illusions, false superiority, entertainment media, etc.  You thereby give up your right to judge anybody.  Are you really willing to do that?  Based on your body of work, I doubt it.
Gregg
Yea, but your implication is Republicans are hypocrites and fools. It’s a stretch.
I don’t think nihilism, drugs, sex, illusions, false superiority, entertainment media, etc. provide answers to purpose and the comfort of inner peace. I was talking about something a little more profound. And I think it’s above my pay grade to assume anyone has poorly founded and incorrect religious beliefs just because mine are diffferent. I’m okay with judgment if someone is a narcissist or serial abuser of women but that’s different.
Patrick
There are no implications – I’m telling you exactly what I think.
And from my perspective, someone who believes that the earth is 5000 years old, or that the fact that they grew up in a particular religious tradition means that they have an objective claim to religious truth, or that there’s a magic man in the sky who loves Christians and not Muslims, or loves Baptists and not Catholics, or loves Catholics and not ethical Humanists, and will save one and condemn the other to eternal punishment, is living in the grip of a fantasy.  Maybe it makes them feel better; so what?  Anyone who believes these things certainly has the right to do so, but if they don’t want to be viewed as foolish by those of us who are better at thinking, then they should keep their views to themselves.
Gregg
You assume a lot. Spirituality is not the literal interpretation of King James’ version. There’s a little wiggle room to say the least. I  also think it’s quite an assumption to think your thinking is uniquely superior. Look up and contemplate infinity, explain what’s on the other side of the edge of the universe and why. You don’t know any more than the rest of us.
Patrick
That’s true.  The differenceis thatI admit what I don’tknow.

Anyway, your point about “Laissez faires” is a non sequitor.  I’m talking about that cohort on the right that thinks there’s a biblical basis for bashing gays.  Don’t pretend they don’t exist.

I guess I’m basically going on about the absurd religious hypocrisy of the right.  The cognitive dissonance necessary to trumpet Christian values and the ethics of greed in the same sentence.  Al Franken may have said it best, in his illustrated comic “The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus:”
“If people knew I was healing lepers, there would be no incentive to avoid leprosy!”

Tim Tebow was Born in Manila, Philippines Tebow was born in Makati City in the Philippines, to American parents who were serving as Christian Baptist missionaries at the time. His mother, Pamela Elaine (née Pemberton), is the daughter of a U.S. Army colonel, and his father, Robert Ramsey Tebow II, is a pastor.
http://pulse.yahoo.com/_C2STBLZJK4VKQBV27DVQX3I6CU FAX68
That’s why Tim Tebow is very religious because of the parents background and his Family religious belief remains in the Philippines or should I see continue their mission in the Philippines.
That’s explained the Missionary Hospitals.
Hennorama
Mr. Tebow has had unanticipated success which has made for great TV.  But he is not a great NFL QB, and his winning streak will come to a thudding end at some point.
He is of course free to express his faith as he sees fit.
I personally don’t think this phenomenon of athletes expressing their faith has any place on the field of play.  Tebow is just the latest and most blatant example of this phenomenon.
MarkKnoeller
The power of affirmation regardless of religion or philosophy is a very useful tool, and can make our lives better.

Speaking as a fellow Christian, I’m thinking Christ would view all of football as an abomination. No one cares about the players who can’t walk anymore, and then there is the pugilistic syndrome that acts like Alzheimer’s. Would Christ care about football? Football players, sure. But not this stinking, boring game. Tebow might pray about that next time.

Ideology or Religion…?  The Bible has one statement on Homosexuality that is mentioned next to sex slave laws and so on.  Abortion is even hazier.  There is no clear law on abortion and God seems to be a fan of the practice. Nonetheless, these are the two issues become ‘public’ Christianity; whereas, to be wealthy is immoral throughout the entire Bible.  Jesus did not say one word about abortion or homosexuality, but he raised a lot of class warfare.  In America, Abortion and homosexuality are public Christian issues where the government should be involved.  And on the other hand, greed is a private Christian issue.  And I dare say that Christian conservatives don’t even believe that there is such a thing as greed.
Ideology or Religion?
I have always liked Tebow as a football player, but his family has always been stinking rich preachers, erasing whatever cultural fabric the Filipinos have left.

Religion seems to me to be a very personal means of dealing with ones mortality. I remember thinking during Pope John Paul’s final struggle how comforting his faith must have been at his moment of demise. Is it too much to wish that same peace for everyone? No one knows what happens when you die. No label you wear (Muslim, Christian, Atheist) changes that. What’s so hard about respecting each others beliefs?
If Tebow feels it, it’s cool with me.

You must have listened to this report with deaf ears. There was nothing anti-Christian in it. If the media errs, it errs in the direction of appealing to popular opinion.

Zero: Apparently atheists don’t require anything of the sort as evidenced by the exchange with Patrick.
Atheists make assertions of certainty and then are unable and/or unwilling to substantiate them, falling back on the old saw that a negative can’t be proven. Atheism requires, in fact, a leap of faith, and to say otherwise is intellectually dishonest. One doesn’t need threats of heaven or hell. Atheists have baseless certainties they know better than everyone else and assert they are right simply because.  What is more dogmatic than that?
Zero
There is only one certainty: that there is either a god or not.  Now that being said, you and I have not seen or observed a god.  It is not testable and there is zero empirical reason to believe that there is a god.  What is left if an emotional reason to believe that there is a God. Sometimes emotional intelligence good when coupled with reason, but when it is strictly emotional, you got a problem.  You can’t get around that.  You have yet to show me evidence of a God, and I don’t have to provide evidence of nonexistence because it is impossible–that is why the burden is on you.  (E.g., you can’t prove to me that the Purple People Eater is not god…where’s your evidence the Purple People Eater is not god?)  You see how that works? I want to live forever too, but I don’t delude myself because I know that what I want does not determine reality.  All I can do is hope, but I don’t turn that hope into faith in order to distort the reality of death.
Personally, I don’t even know what atheism means–what I do know is that whether a god exist or not doesn’t matter–what matters is an afterlife, and again my desire for an afterlife does not determine that there is indeed an afterlife.  I guess what atheism means is that I and others like me are not in a denial of death.  You are.

Christ is a literary character; a hermetic god rewrite of Dionysus and more humanly Socrates.  The Gospels were written 40 to 100 years after Jesus supposedly lived.  There could have been a homeless guy with a cult following at the time, but everybody who wrote the New Testament never met “Jesus.”  There is more reason to believe Socrates was a real man than Jesus–that is where I stand.

Zero
You are proving my argument.  Science corrects all things including previous science.  I have know doubt that our understanding of the universe will be improved in the future, but only by science, not religion.  God didn’t get us to the moon, science did.  So yes, Imagine what we might “know” tomorrow and tell your fellow Christian conservatives to quit standing in the way of science.
And religious people thought the sun revolved around the Earth, not scientists–in fact Mariners knew the Earth was round thousands of years before Columbus.  Scientific exploration has undone religious superstition for a very long time and will continue to do so.  Religion has fought the science book for hundreds of years and the science book has always won.  This is not dogma–if you can posit a better philosophical argument for determining reality than the scientific method, then please  do so…until then you are looking at reality through a kaleidoscope of nonsense. 
But basically, you are the one not willing to imagine what the unknown might be–that’s why you give up questioning and concede to faith.   
notafeminista
You missed the point.  All of those things happened because someone was willing to say what if?  Religious people didn’t tell surgeons not to wash their hands and it wasn’t religious people who kept us from going to the moon.  As for science and religion I point you to Francis Collins, former head of the Human Genome Project, current head of the NIH and evangelical Christian.  Lefties don’t like religious people because they can’t control them.  I can tell someone not to pray for me all day long, but in the end, I can’t make them stop.  When you try to, that’s when you get gulags and re-education camps.

I am a descendant of many generations of Calvinists who believed that God was stern, inscrutable, and unmoved by human entreaties.
The American notion that God is a sports fan and takes sides is blasphemous, if you are truly devout, and ridiculous, if you are not.�
It implies that an omnipotent deity is entertaining Himself while his creatures are starving, being abused or murdered, buried in earthquakes, drowned in floods, etc. 
If NPR must cover such a story, surely it could include a serious theological* and/or secular** critique. 
*the views of someone who has studied many centuries of theology 
** the response of someone like Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins
 
reject it * as offensive, I mean. 
* the notion that God is a sports fan
Zero
No, Lefties don’t like Christians who try to control other people.  We
have no problem with the Jews for example.  And I personally have no problem with
private Christianity.  I believe in self-mastery, nothing more.  If a
Christian speaks up, I feel I have the right to call them out on his or
her beliefs.
Second, I know about Collins.  But let me submit George Bush who blocked
stem-cell research, which was restarted by Obama–and now the research
has made groundbreaking progress on fighting heart disease.  Because of
Bush the research is years behind, causing people to die sooner than
need be.  That is the kind of superstitious-based abuse I talk about.  I
don’t through all Christians into an anti-science group–I clearly
delineated “Conservative Christians” who are impeding progress.  There is only one thing fighting science–religion.  You can have your religion, but this is a secular country.  Our Constitution is the prototypical Enlightenment document, where there is not one word of “God,” and freedom of religion (which by the way the Christian God is not a fan of).  I could not care less if you remain a Christian or not–what I care about is people like you electing George Bush, a person who has zero desire to increase life expectancy. 
You see, issues like abortion and homosexuality are more about Christian Conservatives trying to control people more than anything else. (Read my religion or ideology comment below.)  But thankfully, we have a secular Constitution and a coequal judiciary branch of Government.  And once the gay marriage issue gets to the supreme court, gay marriage will be legal.  Which is good because Government shouldn’t try to control behavior that is not immoral.  I don’t try to control other people’s sexuality and courtship, and I don’t try to control a woman’s body.  I don’t tell Christian that they have no right to believe in Jesus.  And I don’t tell them they will go to hell for not believing a certain religion.  (Of course I recognize that you have not told me I’m going to hell, but people have not been as polite in the past.)  Bottom line is that I don’t care what you believe, but if you are going to bring it into the fray, then you are going to get an argument.  I have no church to convert you in and have you feed a collection plate.  My biggest ambition I have when I argue religion with people is that they do what Jesus says, and keep your religion out of the public and “in the closet”;i.e., in private.
And I didn’t miss the point.  Faith is a lack of imagination.  Faith is where people go when they’re too tired of searching for the ‘truth’ they’ll (in all likelihood) never find.  If you want to see things differently, then start praying to God with your eyes open.  
notafeminista
And when an atheist (or secularist or humanist or whatever) speaks up  I have the equal right to call them out for their beliefs.
And as for George Bush and the stem cells, you left out one important item in that he blocked embryonic  stem cell research and for good reason.  Have you read the science on it?  The results are horrific, and thus far have not proven themselves to be of use.  George Bush did not and does not have any problem whatsoever with adult stem cell research. 
No..secularists and atheists and humanists don’t try to control a specific action by people.  They just try to control people and when they can’t, they put them in jail.
Zero
First off, you completely ignored the report about heart-disease and stem cell research–there are wonderful, life saving research emerging.  And you are once again proving my case.
Second, your final claim is completely unsubstantiated and ridiculous.  Look, at how Newt Gingrich is mad at appeals courts because there are too many secular decisions–well guess, what?  The Constitution is a completely secular document without one word or “god.”  It is an Enlightenment document to the core.  If the courts are making secular decisions, they are making the right decision because we have a secular constitution. You know the Enlightenment–a philosophical movement emerging out of centuries of religious totalitarianism.  That is what religion is–it is thought-crimes…I cannot think in certain ways…I cannot believe in other gods and so on…that is the purest definition of capital T Totalitarianism. 
And it is all held together with this little word “faith.”  Faith is what blinds you from rationality, logic, and the commonsense that the idea that God would impregnate a virgin with himself, to sacrifice himself, to enable himself to forgive human beings for being human beings…and if you don’t believe, he casts you down to his eternal gas chamber.  Faith blinds you from objective reality.  Most religious people’s definition of faith is believing in things not seen–in fact that was the definition you provided me.  Well, if you can’t see something, then what are you?  You are blind, and once again you are proving my point that it is all in your imagination.  So okay, I concede a little that people of faith have imagination, actually certainly that is true–but your imagination only bends reality, it does not determine reality.  And it certainly is not seeing reality objectively.  Yet, the politics of your ideological Christianity insist that objective reality is what your religious imagination says it is.  That is quite dangerous, especially since you are an ideological and not actually to the finer and more humane points of the Bible, which are indeed the dominate themes throughout that fine work of literature (I presume) you have never read cover-to-cover.
But seriously…how old are you…30s, 40s, 50s…hypothetically say that you have never heard of the Bible, never heard of the stories, nothing, and then one day you randomly pick it off the shelf at a library and read it…would you say to yourself, “Oh yes, this is reality…burning bush, flood, virgins, water-into-wine, Apocalypse…that sounds about right…I believe it”…?  
————————————————
Threatening people with the violence of hell in order to coerce people to believe means that Christianity is a terroristic religion.  I have no problem with people believing in an abstract idea of God…and I really don’t have a problem with non-ideological, private Christians.  And I’m glad you are willing to debate this…but I am not glad that you vote for policy that harms people in the name of religion. 
Susan Sontag wrote a good book on totalitarianism.  You should read it.  And by the way, governing without compromise is called totalitarianism.  Cutting funds to the courts erodes our democracy because low income people can’t afford court fees and representation–and where I live in Florida appointed representation is conditional in order to save the rich from a tax hike.  Do you get it?  Do you get that liberals, for better or worse, believe in the principles of democracy more than conservatives?  And nothing preserves democratic representation more than a secular constitution.

Excuse me, the book is “The Origins of Totalitarianism” by Hannah Ardent.  Not Sontag…I was thinking of Sontag’s “Fascinating Fascism,” which is another good read.

Faith is exactly the opposite of the lack of imagination. Faith is the thing that lets us say what if.  Look at this exchange between you and I.  Your position is that people of faith are somehow lacking in intelligence or creativity or open-mindedness all the while you are the one saying what people of faith think is not possible.  People of faith are willing to consider there might be something out there beyond what they can see.  Secularists are not.

Secularists are people who live their lives in reality, and learn from research what makes things work. “say what if” I could possibly be givin a billion dollars tomorrow. Why should I work then if I have faith in that?
Here is the real deal… People who base their lives in reality, and have the scruples to better their lives with scientific research based off empirical evidence rather than saying “what if”, are the people who are actually willing to consider there is something out there beyond what they can see. They then find out whether or not it’s true and continue on with the same method to better the lives of everyone on this planet.

Sure, until something jars their so-called reality – and then secularists get all exercised and decide to start shoving people into re-education camps.

The same logic and common sense that kept the Church from entertaining Galileo’s experiments?  It wasn’t religion that stopped Galileo, it was thinking that refused to consider all that was possible.�
And I stand by my statement – the Left doesn’t like the faithful because they cannot control them, and when they cannot, they put them in jail.
Read “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich” – a gulag mate imprisoned for no other reason than being Baptist.
Think beyond that which you cannot see.

No, we are not trying to control you.  We are trying to keep the Constitution and the laws secular (which means everybody has equal protection under the law).  The Christian right is trying to control beliefs and behaviors (most notably gay rights).  And prohibiting gays from equal rights is unconstitutional and will be proven so in a few years.  The law prohibiting gay rights is a nice example of superstitious-based abuse.  No drinking on Sundays is another law borne out of the Christian right, that I recently had to obey.  Ultimately, we have a secular court in which the religious right constantly wants to infuse their religion.  This is currently a huge problem in Egypt–the conservative Muslims are going to turn State Law into Sharia Law or whatever their ideological version of Sharia Law they want.  The only way for Egypt to maintain democracy is a secular constitution.  Get it?
The truth is, you are the ones already controlled.  You don’t even believe in the principles Jesus talks about (and I have read enough of your comments over time to see that).  You follow the principles of right wing ideology. 
Next, Stalin dissolved certain churches and used others.  Religion has always been used in totalitarian governments to control the masses.  Napoleon once said, “The only thing keeping the rich from murdering the poor is religion.” This is why the Enlightenment was so dangerous to plutocracies.  Religion keeps people down and living terrible lives while under the illusion they are going to heaven once they die. 
My dad (before he retired) was a top tax bracket republican and an atheist.  But he was the only atheist I knew of who liked Christianity.  He thought it was complete nonsense, but he knew Christianity made people vote against their economic interests.  If I was trying to control you and people like you, I would be like my dad and be a closet atheist defending Christianity. 
I am trying to show you that you are controlled–everybody is controlled to some extent, but especially if you haven’t read the evolution of philosophy and theology throughout Western thought that have formed the ideas, beliefs, and morals you and I currently hold. 
notafeminista
Some inconsistencies in your argument: “Religion keeps people down and living terrible lives while under the illusion they are going to heaven once they die.”
1)Can you at least concede you have no idea what happens after we die?  No one does. That is incredibly intellectually dishonest to say you do.  I have no idea, but I’m willing to consider the possibility of a heaven where are you are not.
2)Terrible lives in what way exactly?  Financially?  Intellectually? Emotionally?  Politically?   Terrible is a matter of perspective.  I’m sure even as you and I have this exchange you assume I live some form of a terrible life – even though you know nothing about me.
3)Do you want to control me on the individual level?  Mmmm no not really.  But the Left very much wants Christians (and Christians only mind you ) to please go away and not speak of their faith in public lest a wandering atheist overhear the discussion.  Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs are fine with the Left.�
4)What do you care whether or not I uphold any or all of the principles espoused by Christianity.  You don’t believe God or Christ is real.  Why do you spend so much time worrying or talking or concerning yourself with that you are certain does not exist?  This should be a non subject for you.
