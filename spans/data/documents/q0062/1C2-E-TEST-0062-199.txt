We know the infatuation with Tim Tebow can be annoying. Hey, it even seems to bother John Elway, who happens to be the vice-president of the Denver Broncos.
Tebow Time seems to run 24-7, with non-stop updates.
The latest twist and turn in Tebowmania:
The Promise Speech, part two (an abridged version).
Broncos coach John Fox asked Tebow to address the team the night before the Broncos faced the San Diego Chargers Sunday afternoon, according to the Denver Post.
Tebow’s message was short and sweet: Proverbs 27:17:  “Iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens nother.”
“It was a huge honor,” Tebow said. “I just tried to share from the heart.”
The message obviously resonated with his teammates. “I’ve never seen a human who can will himself to win like that,” Denver linebacker Von Miller said. “He said iron sharpens iron and men sharpen other men. And I think that’s totally true. He gave us a great speech. We came out (for the game) fired up. And that was a wrap.”
Indeed it was. The Broncos beat the Chargers in overtime and are now 5-1 with Tim Tebow as a starter.
People can rip Tebow all they want. The bottom line is that the Broncos are winning and his teammates believe.
Of course, most fans remember the Tebow lore of his “Promise” speech after the University of Florida lost, 31-30, to Ole Miss in 2008. Florida went on to win the rest of their games and their third national championship.
Stay tuned folks.
