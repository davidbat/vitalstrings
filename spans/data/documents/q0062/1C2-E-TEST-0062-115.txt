Tim Tebow is taking on a new role: advertising sex symbol.
Sponsor Jockey is capitalizing on Tebow-mania with a new shirtless picture of its star endorser posing in its  "Sport" underwear collection on its website .
The image shows a ripped Tebow, stripped down to his skivvies. The headline reads: "Playoffs. It's Tebow Time."

The image went live on Jockey's homepage Monday, the day after the deeply religious quarterback who inspired the "Tebowing" craze led his Denver Broncos to an upset playoff win against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
With Tebow-mania reaching a fever pitch across the country, the image of a shirtless Tebow is the first thing consumers see if they click on the Jockey.com website.
Move over Michael Jordan and Hanes. The charismatic former Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Florida appeals to men and women, says Dustin Cohn, chief marketing officer of Jockey. The so-called "Tebow Effect" is driving up sales of Jockey's men's and women's underwear products.
Tebow's a "lightning rod" for the brand, says Cohn. "Its very exciting for us. He is the hottest athlete in the country today. He's trending among elite celebrity status."
There's "no question" Tebow is attracting female consumers to the more male-oriented Jockey brand, Cohn adds. A few months ago, Jockey aired a TV commercial in which Tebow is seen shirtless. It was only a brief moment, but that's what everyone ended up talking about, Cohn recalled.
"Its funny, you see Tim without his shirt for maybe one second. We got a lot of complimentary e-mails for that one second."
