For Tim Tebow, there are so many mountains to climb, so little time.
But how about this one: action movie hero?
The fifth movie in the "Die Hard" series will begin filming in January with 56-year-old Bruce Willis as John McClane, maybe for the final time.  The aim of the story line will be to pass along the leading role to a younger actor, who would play McClane's son, the Miami Herald reported.
Could that new movie star be Tebow, the former Florida Gators star who this week was named starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos?
Tebow's name came up Wednesday when Tom Rothman, co-chairman and CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment, announced the project on the syndicated Jim Rome sports-talk radio show.
“What do you think of Tebow in the lead?” Rothman asked, likely in jest.
“He might be too nice,” Rome said, referring to Tebow's wholesome reputation. “But no one would work harder to make it work.”
Even if Rothman was serious, there's no word on whether Tebow would be interested in acting.
KDVR-TV, the Fox affiliate in Denver, asked the studio about the possiblity of Tebow going Hollywood. A spokesman replied: “Tim would have to audition for the role just like everyone else … just like he did for the Broncos.” 
Rothman told Rome he expected several young actors to seek the part. 
Willis starred in the first “Die Hard” in 1988.
