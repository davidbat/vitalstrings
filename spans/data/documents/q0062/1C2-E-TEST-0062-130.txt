I would not say that Calvinism is the gospel. For the Calvinist, however, I would say that Calvinism provides the best understanding of the gospel and the God’s actions with man throughout history.
I would imagine anyone who holds to a certain theology whether Calvinism, Arminianism or that imaginary in-between position feels the same way.

I would defer to Charles Spurgeon on this, not because it is Spurgeon, but because I believe it is true (although I also agree Calvinism provides our best understanding of the Gospel – I think it is both, the explanation and the Gospel itself):
“I have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and Him crucified, unless we preach what nowadays is called Calvinism. It is a nickname to call it Calvinism; Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else. I do not believe we can preach the gospel, if we do not preach justification by faith, without works; nor unless we preach the sovereignty of God in His dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah; nor do I think we can preach the gospel, unless we base it upon the special and particular redemption of His elect and chosen people which Christ wrought out upon the cross; nor can I comprehend a gospel which lets saints fall away after they are called, and suffers the children of God to be burned in the fires of damnation after having once believed in Jesus. Such a gospel I abhor.”

justin, it really doesn’t matter what i believe or what you abhor, it is NOT our call – it is all in Our Father’s hands – carlton pearson believes as you and he is now teaching universalism – i sat under his wonderful teaching of just Jesus.
i mentioned that i couldn’t believe you drew attention to calvinism rather than the gospels – calvin and spurgeon were used along with other great men but they were only men –
Our Father shares HIS glory with no man.

seventeen, if Carlton Pearson believed as I do he would not be a universalist heretic. That is an absurd conclusion. You seem to not understand what biblical Calvinism is, which does nothing BUT point to the Gospel and the glory of God. You seem to also believe in the absolute sovereignty of God, so I’m not sure exactly what point you are trying to make, unless of course you really don’t know what Calvinism teaches. It seems you are one whether you understand the label or not. That is ok, but I encourage you to look into this, especially why it is that people call themselves “Calvinist” or “reformed”. It’s just an easy way of stating what you believe about the sovereignty of God and salvation.

perhaps, justin, what i am trying to say is “why do we have to go through calvinism or any other great teacher that Our Father has used.  why not just go to HIM.
i have witnessed older saints who thought they were saved – when it was coming down to facing death, they confessed that what they had believed was all wrong – i am sorry, justin, i believe that a lot of people have been deceived by a false gospel.  friends around me face death and they once knew Yeshua and gave up following Him – i don’t pretend to be their judge – they judge themselves when they face death.  they convince themselves by the statement, “i believe” – once saved always saved doctrine – but down deep inside, they are troubled in facing death.
we have gotten off a long ways from your article re:  Tim Tebow.  i am proud of Tim’s stand but it cannot become a “religion” – as i stated in an earlier blog, i was where tim is now – reading the gospels over and over, i realized that the gate is narrow that leads to life and broad is the way that leads to destruction.  only those that KNOW Yeshua will be saved.  i don’t treat the gospel as a beating post because that is not the way Our Father taught me.
To KNOW HIM is eternal life – john 17 – He drew me to HIM so i would KNOW Him.
it is evident that tim tebow has a great love for Yeshua – i pray his ears will be opened by the Spirit of Elohim to become the great leader that he can be.  but again, it is not my call.
back to carlton, i would never have believed that he could change into the universal heretic that he has become.  but as Yeshua says – if possible, even the elect would be deceived.  my heart still hurts for cp as i know Our Father’s does.

all through John 17 – Yeshua is talking to the Father and He keeps repeating knowing HIS Word and knowing HIS name.  He didn’t mention a single great man’s name – He told us that we could pray in HIS name – HE didn’t mention a man’s name – Just His.  i don’t think the devil would shake much if we mentioned calvin’s name but HE knows that Yeshua paid the price and He has to back off when we KNOW our Saviour and HIS Name.  this is the point that i have been trying to convey – we don’t have to be afraid to go to Our Father without any other man’s name – Yeshua’s will do just fine.

seventeen, I agree with much of what you said, and again, it seems that you don’t understand the concept of using the term “Calvinism” to abbreviate one’s doctrinal positions. I have never read any of Calvin’s works (not yet anyway), so to say one is a “Calvinist” is not saying they follow Calvin or “go through Calvin”, but that they hold to the biblical doctrines of grace (TULIP). Please do read the link I posted to Desiring God as I think it will help you understand what I am trying to convey to you. Or, you might check out the series I did a couple of months ago for further examination of the Scriptures: http://airocross.com/2011/10/10/10-reasons-man-needs-a-sovereign-savior/

justin, i did read the article you suggested: http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/saying-what-you-believe-is-clearer-than-saying-calvinist
still don’t understand why it is necessary to go the round about way instead of straight to the source.
thanks for your love and understanding through our differences.
December 16, 2011
Thanks, seventeen. To be clear, when I say I’m a “Calvinist” or I am “reformed”, it’s just a simple way of stating what I believe instead of giving 100s of verses to say what I believe every time the issue comes up. That’s all. Hope you have a great weekend.

Justin,
Here is another problem with this story, it leads to Tebow being exalted. This news story is along those lines, http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/tebow-discovers-cocaine-765312
Also, do people really think God is allowing Tebow to miraculously pull off wins just because he is a Christ follower? The Bible teaches we will face trials, tribulations, testings, etc. Nowhere does it state we will be successful, popular, and wealthy. If one believes otherwise, how do you explain that to a brother or sister in Christ who is in hiding, who gathers in secret to worship Him, who memorizes entire books of the Bible because they do not have freedom to worship or read God’s word?
By the way, I am not blaming Tim for this.

The news story is kinda funny. Imagine if the dog was named Brady; it would keep looking like it’s falling for sympathy.
You bring up some good points, and we have to be careful to not assume that Christ will be our magic genie in all things. That said, it does seem that He is using Tebow for something specific, and I have a theory on what that something is.
I think that Tebow is being used by God right now to prove a point; look at all the anger and hate being given to Tebow and why. Nobody is claiming that he is a hypocrite, or stealing money, or even of being overly judgmental or condemning. By all appearances, he is simply a Christian who is living out his faith. He is staying out of trouble, giving glory to God, and those that know him make it clear that it’s not a show, or a good-luck charm.
And it is driving the world into rage-filled spasms. And they are openly declaring that it is because he is just a Christian living his faith.
No excuses being made here by the world either. No “he’s too mean” or “he’s just doing it for show.” In fact, many have said that they WANT him to be causing trouble, just so his testimony would be damaged.
When the day comes that they stand before the Lord, they will not honestly be able to say, “But how did I hate your followers without cause?” Because they are living out their hate for Christ and His followers openly.

I wanted to not take “sides in this debate, but Justin you do not understand when someone says, “enough said!”
Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Which came first, Christian or Calvinist?
You believe that Calvinist position is the correct scriptural position, fine; but saying that Calvinism predates “Let there be light” is incorrect.  IF Calvinism is correct, then it is not Calvinism!  It is Christianity!  However, the same is true for all denominations and/or labels created by men. The name “Christian,” and perhaps a few others are Scriptural (perhaps a “follower of the Way” is one of these).
Interestingly, in a sermon I recently heard on-line, John MacArthur stated that the United States of America has already been abandoned by God, because  of our sins. You may recall the old saying, “If you feel far from God, guess who moved!” If America has become nation abandoned by God, who moved? Who changed? Not the immutable Yahweh! The blame for the decline in American society, can be laid at the feet of Christians themselves; for instead of being salt and light to the lost, they have turned away from His Word and allowed evil to prosper. The acceptance of the lie of evolution is one example of this, the division into denominational factions is another. It may be that the the increasing persecution of Christians will soon force us into abandoning all such labels, whether Lutheran, Baptist, Methodist, or whatever, including Calvinist. In this sense, it does not matter who you are; all such labels are sinful, being born of pride, instead of humility. No wonder the world does not accept the Gospel—there are too many different “versions” of Christianity!  The Church has been forced underground in many places; if it happens here, when you (anyone) are fleeing for your life you will not be claiming to be a Baptist or any other denomination when you are seeking refuge with other believers!
What can be done? Back to the Bible, everyone!  Throw out all man-made creeds, confessions, catechisms, etc. and with humility seek the Father.  Do not demand that your way, is the only way.  This applies to all of us. And please, Justin, just because someone does not believe the same way you do, do not accuse him or her of failing to understand “exhorting, admonishing, encouraging, teaching, and correction.” There are those here who know the Bible as well as you, but have every bit as much confidence in the way they have learned tho’ it is different from your way.

Hi Emcee, you made a charge that there was “Tebow Bashing” going on, so I simply asked you to point that out so I could examine it. It bothers me when people make accusations but do not provide evidence.
The reason why “Calvinism” predates “Let there be light” is because the doctrines of grace come from God Himself. In eternity past, when only God existed, the plan of redemption was created between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Before God said “let there be light”, the Father chose a subset of a future fallen humanity to show mercy, the Son was foreordained to shed His blood to purchase this people, and the Holy Spirit promised to regenerate and seal forever all whom the Father gave to the Son.  This is the essence of “Calvinism”, and as Mark mentioned earlier, it gives us the best understanding of the Gospel. Truly, this plan of redemption is Plan A. It was designed before the beginning of time and has been carried out to the T, all for the glory of God (go here for Scripture: http://airocross.com/2011/10/10/10-reasons-man-needs-a-sovereign-savior/ ). If you want to call it Christianity, that is fine by me. I agree. But because there are differences among Christians with regards to these biblical doctrines, using the term “Calvinism” merely distinguishes one’s doctrinal positions.
As far as questioning someone’s understanding of biblical correction and accountability, I stand by that statement. Mike continued to demonstrate that his arguments were based on his emotions and feelings, and not on Scripture. He took issue with raising these questions as to Tebow’s Gospel presentation and methodology, as if Tebow is untouchable or on some pedestal. No one is on any such pedestal, and we are each accountable to each other and before the Lord, especially in matters of the Gospel.
So at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter what you believe or what you have learned if these beliefs do not line up with Scripture. We can’t all be right. But if one is going to make an argument against a position, they would do well to back it up with Scripture or else be entirely discredited.
