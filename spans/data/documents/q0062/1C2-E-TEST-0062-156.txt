His next test will be tonight, in a rematch against New England led by QB Tom Brady (a matchup that, according to a "Saturday Night Live" skit featuring Jesus Christ, pits Tebow against "God's nephew").
Tebow takes it all in stride. James Brown, host of "The NFL Today," sat down with Tebow for an interview (airing on CBS Saturday night, 7:30 p.m. ET, before the Broncos-Patriots game) and asked the quarterback how he keeps it in check:
"Number one, what my mom and dad preached to me as a kid. Just because you may have athletic ability and may be able to play a sport doesn't make you any more special than anybody else," Tebow said. "It doesn't mean that God loves you more than anybody else. We play a sport, and it's a game. At the end of the day, that's all it is, is a game."

He's just trying to lead his team to the promised land - that's Indianapolis, for Super Bowl XLVI.
Appearing on "CBS This Morning: Saturday," Brown said that Tebow's marketing potential is big given his appeal: "We want to hear good stories, and he's a good story so far," Brown said. "
Of course, Tebow has to stay healthy, and win: "A huge test tonight - probably the biggest thing playing in the Patriots favor [is] all the attention to Tim Tebow today. It's interesting to see what happens. Eventually he has to win the Big One" to capitalize on his marketing potential, Brown said.
