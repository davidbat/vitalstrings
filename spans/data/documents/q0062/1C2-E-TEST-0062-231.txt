Tim Tebow announced plans to build a hospital in the Philippines.
The foundation started by Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow will help finance construction of a children’s hospital in the Philippines.
Donors to the Tim Tebow Foundation and CURE International, which announced a partnership in October, will share the $3 million cost. This is the first joint project for the two organizations.
Tebow was born in Makati City in the Philippines, but grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., where the foundation he started in January 2010 is based.
The 30-bed hospital will be built in Davao City on the island of Mindanao, and about a third of its patients are expected to be charity cases, the two organizations said.
The groundbreaking for the Tebow CURE Hospital will be in January, with an opening expected in mid-2013. The hospital will focus on orthopedics.
“I was born in the Philippines and my parents have been missionaries to that area since 1985,” Tebow said in a statement. “The Philippines have always had a special place in my heart. I’m excited to be a part of this hospital that will bring healing to thousands of children who would not otherwise have access to care.”
