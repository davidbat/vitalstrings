Former Denver Broncos wide receiver Brandon Lloyd was a guest on ESPN-101 in St. Louis to talk about his move to the Rams and his reunion with former head coach Josh McDaniels.  Of course, the topic of Tim Tebow came up during the interview. 
The first question regarding Tebow had to do with Lloyd's opinion on whether or not Tebow could succeed in the NFL:
 
"I don’t know. I think only time will tell with that style of  play. I think it is effective last Sunday, but I just don’t know how  effective that style can be over the course of long games and playing  formidable opponents."
The follow-up was even better.  Lloyd was asked, as a wide receiver, if Tebow's mechanics - or lack thereof  - were an issue:
"It’s just the timing. The timing is an issue. There’s just not  that much separation that you can get in the NFL. You got a yard on the  guy? That is wide open. [Laughs] You got a yard or two yards on the guy  you are wide open, but that window…you are not open very long. Any delay  in delivering the ball or any delay and not being in the position to be  ready to throw the ball when that separation happens or I take that  back. Not being able to deliver that ball before the separation happens?  It just throws a monkey wrench into all the time and anything you are  trying to accomplish down the field."
We definitely saw a bit of that on Sunday, but we saw some positives as well.  There is little doubting, however, that Lloyd wanted out of Denver and the Broncos were right to oblige.
