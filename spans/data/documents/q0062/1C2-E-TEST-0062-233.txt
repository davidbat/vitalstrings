Triston27, the only Bronco player who came out in support of Tebow was Brandon Lloyd. I’ve read stories that Denver players anonymously told reporters they wanted Orton. Yeah it’s not working, but do you really see them scoring more with Tebow? Do you think, after two weeks, he won’t be putting up stats Orton did last week? He’s not an NFL QB and will never be.
What about Quinn? If he’s the #2, why isn’t he starting? I’d feel more comfortable, as a Broncos fan, with Quinn in at starter.
Gerard, you are correct, they need to draft well. But what if they lose their own (good) players to Free Agency because of this?
I’ll admit, part of this is sour grapes because I’m used to Denver being in playoff spot contention every year. I’m not used to losing and Top 5 draft picks. I think Tebow has heart and works hard as hell and he’s a good role model and all, but he won’t succeed at the NFL level at QB. If he’s willing to be a TE/H-back and come in for trick plays, then I’d love him. But I hope he tanks, they let him go after this year and get a real NFL QB.
