Mixing football phenoms with pop music can often lead to disastrous results (the Black Eyed Peas halftime show, the Super Bowl Shuffle ) but leave it to — who else? — Tim Tebow to restore the faith. Tebow has already been the divine inspiration for catchy, clever fan mixes and a genius rewrite of “St. Elmo’s Fire” ( “Tim Tebow’s Fire” ) by none other than John Parr himself.
Last night Jimmy Fallon joined the legion of  musical reimaginings about the Denver Broncos quarterback when he turned David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” into an ode to Tebow. (Tebode?) Dressed in full Ziggy Stardust regalia (and a Broncos jersey), Fallon cut off communication between Ground Control and Major Tom to Tebow and, of course, Jesus Christ. (Sample lyrics: “Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ / Can’t win by myself / But with your help, I might”…”Jesus Christ to Tim Tebow / Please leave me alone / Don’t you know my day of rest is Sunday? / And I’m sick of watching all these Broncos games.”)
While it’s not quite on par with Fallon’s other classics, like the brilliantly surreal “Whip My Hair” number, the Late Night host made you want to pray for a Broncos victory on Saturday when he crooned, “Though I pass 316 yards / there’s still two games to go / If I want to make it to the Super Bowl / And show everyone on Earth how to Tebow ” and then commanded the almighty Tebow by doing just that.
Go, Broncos. If only to keep this comedy-musical miracle going. Commencing countdown. Hut, hut, hike!
What did you think of Fallon’s Tebowie ballad? What should be the next Tim Tebow musical mash-up? (I vote Jai-Tebow, which would be Tim Tebow + “Jai-Ho” . Don’t tell me that wouldn’t get you pumped for Saturday night’s game!) Share in the comments section below!
