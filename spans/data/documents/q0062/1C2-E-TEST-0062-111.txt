Tim Tebow
Most recently in the news for a reported trade to the New York Jets , Tim Tebow has for the past year made headlines nationwide for   his faith in Jesus Christ, his "miracle" plays for the Colorado Broncos, and for the peculiar habit of kneeling down on the field in reverence during game time (a.k.a., "tebowing".)
Born Timothy Richard Tebow on August 14, 1987 in the Philippines (where his parents worked as missionaries) the Florida                Gators star quarterback (and now playing professionally for the Denver Broncos) began his early football career in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
Home-schooled by his mother along with four other siblings, Tim was by Florida law required to joined a local athletic school program and chose the nearby Nease High School football team. There he revealed an early and unmistakable star quality on the field.
He later helped bring the team to a state title, working his way up to a Division -A recruit, despite the controversy over his status as a home-schooled student.
With his pick of top football colleges assured, Tim later entered the University of Florida in 2006 and by sophomore year became the Florida                Gators starting quarterback, breaking records for touchdowns and adding the Heisman Trophy to his list of accolades  as the first sophomore                ever to win the coveted award.
Already the subject of many newspaper and magazine profiles, he has been a main topic in an ESPN "Faces in Sports" documentary, was featured in a Sports Illustrated "Faces in the Crowd", and was named one of the "Breakout Players of 2007" for college football by Sporting News before the penultimate media spotlight glared with his Heisman Trophy win.
Tebow was honored                at the 2008 ESPY                Awards for Best Male College Athlete and later that  season continued                to shine with a record five touchdowns on November 1, 2008 in a                crushing 49-10 defeat against the Georgia Bulldogs.
He later ended                the season leading the Gators to a 31-20 over Alabama for the SEC                title.
In July 2009,                Tebow became the only athlete to win Best Male College Athlete Award                two years running when he took the title again at the annual ESPY                Awards.
In his last                home game in November 2009 Tim Tebow made the most of his final                appearance by throwing three TDs in Florida's 37-10 victory over                Florida State. He later capped his storied college career with his                finest performance to date as he led the                Gators to a 51-24 victory over Cincinnati at the 2010 Sugar Bowl .
Early in 2010,                Tebow again made headlines by appearing in a controversial Super                Bowl commercial with his mom as a spokesperson promoting the                anti-abortion movement. Although protested for weeks by women's                groups around the country, the ad sponsored by Focus On The Family                quietly appeared during the big game without much fanfare amid dozens                of other Super Bowl ads.
Kicking off his professional career, the college football superstar was named a first-round NFL draft pick in April 2010 signing a $11.25 million contract with the Broncos, Tebow's NFL career began September 12 in his hometown of Jacksonville when the Broncos play the Jaguars in the season opener.
Since then, Tebow has gone fulfilled his promise as both an NFL football powerhouse and a lightning rod for controversy. Praised by fans, he is also reviled by critics for his deep religious beliefs that he his still not shy about promoting, on or off the field.
Undaunted, during the 2011 season Tebow was responsible for creating the  Internet meme, ' tebowing ", a practice he exhibits  by getting down on one knee and praying on the field. While  the widespread Internet craze for imitating Tebow's signature pose began as  a source of derision, Tebow fans say it must be working --- as the NFL star continues to go from victory to victory.
For the 2012 season, by all reports Tim Tebow is now off to New York City where he has been traded to the New York Jets -- with a promise to bring the razzle dazzle of "Tebowmania" to the Big Apple as he plays alongside Jets' superstar quarterback Mark Sanchez ,
