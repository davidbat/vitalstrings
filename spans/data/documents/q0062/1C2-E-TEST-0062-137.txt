NEW YORK (WFAN) – Jets quarterback Tim Tebow has steadfastly maintained he is a virgin living the high-profile life of a professional athlete .
Well, controversial website AshleyMadison.com apparently wants to challenge one of Tebow’s core beliefs. They’re offering up big money to any woman who can prove she has slept with the NFL sensation.
CNBC sports business reporter Darren Rovell tweeted the rumblings of a $1 million bounty late Monday.
The company retweeted Rovell and on Tuesday morning issued a confirmation via Twitter: “@darrenrovell @TimTebow – It’s true Darren…we’re just worried it might cost us millions!”
Ashley Madison provides matches for those seeking an extramarital affair. The company is described on its homepage as the “most recognized name in infidelity.”
Throughout his career in both college and the pros, Tebow has proudly declared his devotion to Christian beliefs, which include abstinence until marriage. He is scheduled to appear at two Christian universities this week in Ohio for a forum on “faith and football.”
According to Ashley Madison, it’s more like sex and football.
“Sports and sex (and of course, infidelity) go hand in hand,” site founder Noel Biderman said in a statement, according to Rovell. “If Mr. Tebow is indeed abstaining from adult relationships, I would encourage him to find a nice lady or two and enjoy his youth and fame as much as possible.”
The offer will run through Tebow’s first season in New York, Rovell reported.
“I guarantee that no man of Tebow’s stature could survive a season in New York without succumbing to the temptations of the city,” said Biderman.
Tebow’s faith-based decision of premarital celibacy has endeared him to many, though it has also been a target of ridicule. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski joked earlier this month he’d “‘F’ Tebow to take his virginity” during an appearance at the University of Rhode Island.
