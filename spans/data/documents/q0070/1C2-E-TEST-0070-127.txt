Ichiro's management company BowPlanning told the Kyodo News of his donation, but the player declined to comment.
The Seattle Mariners will also dedicate their first six home games of the upcoming season to raising money for the victims of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan.
The Mariners will make a donation to the Red Cross that matches all contributions from front office employees and fans during the homestand against the Cleveland Indians and Toronto Blue Jays April 8-13 at Safeco Field. The team guaranteed a donation of $100,000 from the club's charitable arm, Mariners Care.
Also, Nintendo Co., Ltd. of Japan, the parent company of Nintendo of America, Inc., the majority owner of the Mariners, is donating $3.7 million to disaster relief.
The Mariners have strong ties to Japan through their ownership and business partnerships, Ichiro and a large fan base in Japan.
