[ edit ] Biographical Information
Ichiro Suzuki was drafted in the fourth round by the Orix Blue Wave in 1991 . Ichiro's first manager Shozo Doi said at the time that Ichiro would never hit with his batting stance. He won one minor league batting title. Doi was let go by the Blue Wave after the 1993 season, and new manager Akira Ohgi was hired; Ohgi placed Ichiro at the top of the lineup, and Ichiro responded with an all-time Nippon Pro Baseball hit total of 210 in 1994 which he held until 2010 (when Matt Murton broke it after NPB expanded their schedule by 14 games), batting .385/.445/.549 with 13 HR's and 54 RBI. He also set records for most consecutive games reaching base (69 in 1994), times hit by a pitch (18 in 1995, a mark broken within a decade) and most at bats without a strikeout (216 in a row in 1997). Ichiro would continue to shine in the NPB, becoming one of the best players ever. Ichiro batted .353/.434/.522 with 118 HR's and 429 RBI. Ichiro totaled 1,278 hits and stole 199 bases over his 9 year NPB career. Ichiro won 7 consecutive batting crowns from 1994 to 2000 (every year he was a regular in NPB), won 5 consecutive hit crowns from 1994 to 1998, was a 3-time MVP (1994-1996), was selected to seven Best Nine squads (1994-2000), and was a 7-time Gold Glove award winner (1994-2000). Ichiro has the highest career batting average in NPB history among players with 2,000 or more at bats - runner-up Randy Bass is 16 points behind. His seven batting championships tied the record set by Isao Harimoto . He led the Pacific League five times in OBP, once in steals, three times in total bases, five times in hits, 4 times in runs, once in doubles, once in RBI (part of a 3-way tie) and six times in intentional walks. He held the record for singles in a season in Japan until it was broken first by Norihiro Akahoshi and then Norichika Aoki during the 2005 season.
Ichiro spent spring training with the Seattle Mariners in 1999. He was posted by the Orix Blue Wave in the 2000 offseason. The Seattle Mariners won his rights for $13,125,000. Ichiro shined in his first year, batting .350 with 8 HR's and 69 RBI and 242 hits. Ichiro was named the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year , being the first player to win both MVP and ROY since Fred Lynn did it 1975 . Ichiro broke the all-time Major League Baseball single-season hit record in 2004 with 262 hits; the record was previously held by George Sisler .
In his first ten seasons in the major leagues (2001-2010), Ichiro, had a .331 average with 90 HR's and 558 RBI and 2244 hits in the majors. Ichiro displayed excellent defense in both right field and center field with the Mariners, with a great arm and overall defensive ability. Ichiro has won 10 Gold Gloves so far in the majors. He has also been selected to 10 All-Star squads since switching countries. Also, Ichiro holds the record with the most hits in his first five years, breaking the previous record held by Paul Waner .
Ichiro meets the President before the 2009 All-Star Game
Ichiro appeared in the second to last episode of Furuhata Ninzabur≈ç , a Japanese television police drama that he loves; the episode aired January 4 , 2006 . He played a fictionalized version of himself who kills someone and is arrested.
Ichiro Suzuki went on to play with the winning Japanese team in the first World Baseball Classic , batting .363 (12-33) with 1 HR and 5 RBI.
He went 3 for 3 in the 2007 All-Star Game to win the All-Star Game MVP Award . He hit the first inside-the-park homer in All-Star Game history that year.  On July 29 , 2007 , Suzuki reached 1,500 hits in his 1,060th major league game. Only Al Simmons (1,040) and George Sisler (1,048) had taken fewer games to get to 1,500 hits in the major leagues. Suzuki topped 220 hits for the fourth time that year, becoming only the third major leaguer to do so that often - only Rogers Hornsby and Jesse Burkett had done so before. Exactly a year later, Ichiro collected the 3,000th hit of his MLB-NPB career; only Isao Harimoto had reached 3,000 in NPB. The Associated Press and other media ignorant of international sports claimed Suzuki had 1,278 hits in "the Japanese League" when there is no such league.
Ichiro assumes his signature bat stretch during his first home at bat in 2011.
On September 17 , 2008 , against the Kansas City Royals , Ichiro recorded his 8th consecutive 200-hit season, tying "Wee" Willie Keeler (1894-1901) for most consecutive 200+ hit seasons. He broke Keeler's record in 2009, then in 2010 tied Pete Rose for the most 200 hit seasons in a MLB career (10).
In the 2009 World Baseball Classic , Suzuki was Japan's right fielder and leadoff hitter. He hit .273/.273/.364 with 7 runs in 9 games. He tied Akinori Iwamura for the team lead in runs. He had the third-worst OPS of a regular position player on Samurai Japan, ahead of only Kosuke Fukudome and Michihiro Ogasawara . He still tied Keun-woo Jeong and Iwamura for 5th in the Classic in runs and tied Norichika Aoki and Frederich Cepeda for the most hits (12). He saved his best for last, getting four hits in the finale as Japan beat South Korea 5-3 to win its second straight Classic; the 4th hit was the game-winning 2-run 2-out 10th inning single off Chang-yong Lim , scoring Seiichi Uchikawa and Iwamura with the winning runs.
On April 16 , 2009 , Suzuki got the 3,086th hit of his pro career, a single off Joe Saunders . That broke Isao Harimoto 's record. Suzuki reported that back in 1995, Harimoto had told Suzuki he was the "only guy who could break my record." On April 2 , 2011 , ten years to the day after his major league debut, he overtook Edgar Martinez for the most hits in Mariners franchise history.
