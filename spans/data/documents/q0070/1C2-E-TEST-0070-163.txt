Ichiro has essentially been Juan Pierre. The scenario so many have predicted for so long is finally here. (Not that they deserve credit - they've been predicting decline for years.) Ichiro and Pierre have both made a lot of contact, put a lot of balls on the ground, hit a number of singles, and stolen some bases. There have been some differences - Ichiro's been the better base-stealer and, as Grant Brisbee put it, "Ichiro can throw Juan Pierre farther than Juan Pierre can throw a baseball" - but, overall, the outcomes have been the same. Ichiro and Juan Pierre have played just about every day, and neither has been demonstrably more valuable than the other.
I find that to be simultaneously really shocking, and really not shocking at all. As a Mariners fan, I've bought into all the Ichiro wizardry over the years. I couldn't imagine a time that Ichiro wouldn't be Ichiro. But yet, I've also never been able to silence the rational part of my brain, the part of my brain that told me baseball players can't be good baseball players until they die of old age. That part of my brain has told me this would happen eventually, and so that part of my brain isn't surprised by what we've seen.
Of course, there's evidence to suggest that Ichiro might bounce back to some degree in 2012. His BABiP is way below where it's been in the past. And, because he's Ichiro, I choose to believe that he's capable of making the necessary adjustments over the offseason, maybe finally turning to a more power-based game as has long been rumored. This whole Ichiro-as-Juan-Pierre thing might only be temporary.
But then, it also might not. This just might be how things are until one or both of them get worse and walk away. And in that case, baseball will have lost a true magician. On the plus side, at least then we'll be able to better appreciate just how magic he really was.
