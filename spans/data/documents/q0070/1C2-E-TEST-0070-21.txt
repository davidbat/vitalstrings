Ichiro Suzuki

Age has obviously taken the shine off, but this is what it is. I the Number one spot, Ichiro is .206 with two SB Out of the three spot, he's .271 with seven SB. Why the mariners continue to try n grind his legs in the leadoff spot rather than let him take it a bit easier in the 3 hole is beyond me. Mismanagement of Ichiro for the player he IS now and not the player he WAS then is the reason for concern, not Ichiro himself.
