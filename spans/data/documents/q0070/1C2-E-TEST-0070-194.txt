In 2000, the M's took a chance on a Japanese phenomenon named Ichiro. The speedy, smart, clutch-hitting outfielder has since become possibly the best player in baseball.
Nobuyuki Suzuki, Ichiro's father, is largely responsible for helping develop Ichiro's athletic talent. From the time Ichiro was 8, the elder Suzuki would help him practice his fielding, throwing and hitting. They also made countless trips to a local batting center. These practice sessions continued through Ichiro's high school years, culminating in Ichiro being drafted out of high school by the Orix BlueWave.
Ichiro spent most of the time with the BlueWave minor-league team from 1991-93. But after a managerial change, Ichiro became a starter in 1994, and took over the league. Among numerous accomplishments, Ichiro holds nine Japanese baseball records, including the following:
· Seven-time PL batting champ
· 210 hits in a season (1994)
· Reached base in 69 consecutive games
· 216 straight at-bats without a strikeout
While in Japan he also won three MVP awards and in his last season (2000) batting .387.
Ichiro and wife Yumiko Fukushima yearned to come to Seattle, especially after Ichiro spent spring training with the Mariners in 1999.
The Seattle Mariners were awarded the negotiating rights to Ichiro in 2000. In blind bidding among several major-league teams, the Mariners submitted the highest figure  a staggering $13.125 million (1.4 billion yen) that went to the BlueWave. The Mariners then signed him to a three-year, $14 million contract.
Ichiro's agent, Tony Attanasio of San Diego, said one way to measure the impact Ichiro's signing had in Japan would be if a Japanese team signed the likes of Derek Jeter or Mark McGwire. "When you mail Ichiro something from the States, you only have to use that name on the address and he gets it. He's that big." Ichiro is the Michael Jordan of Japan, so popular and so watched that he and Yumiko, well known herself in Japan as a sportscaster, had to go to Los Angeles to be married.
In 2001, Ichiro Suzuki became the first Japanese position player to play in the major leagues (he was closely followed by right fielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo of the New York Mets). He has not only been embraced by the fans in Seattle but has been recognized around the majors as an extremely skilled player.
Highlights from his first season in Seattle:
· 2001 AL MVP
· 2001 Rookie of the Year
· Led ML in batting average (.350)
· Led ML in stolen bases (56)
· Had 51 hits in August, 2001, which led the league
· Set M's club record with 242 hits
· First player since 1980 with three hitting streaks of 15 games or more
In 2002, Ichiro struggled to repeat his rookie-year success. He had 208 hits, 111 runs, 27 doubles and a .321 average, and stole 31 bases. He led the M's in average and was second overall in the majors in hits.
As for last season? And the future?
"I'm still young at professional baseball here in the States," said Ichiro in March 2003. "I just am loving the experience and want to play every day, so I will never ask for a day off."
What Ichiro does best is play the game at his tempo, which forces the opposition to make serious adjustments. His speed on the bases, speed with the bat, arm strength, defense and amazing hitting ability all shift the opposition out of their comfort zone and puts them firmly on the defensive. Pitchers must change up their "out" pitch because he hits anything, anywhere. Infielders must rush and hurry throws.
Defensively, his arm gets respect  baserunners are stuck with singles rather than end up on an Ichiro highlight reel for an attempted double.
At a mere 160 pounds, Ichiro breaks the standard of baseball players and changes the way everyone around him plays.
