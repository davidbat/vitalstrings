Of course he doesn't drive in runs, He's a career lead off hitter. Do you know what that means? That means he bats number 1 in the batting order, which is right after the 7th, 8th, and 9th hitters. They are 7,8 & 9 for a reason cuz they don't get on base as much as someone in the top of the order. Your an Idiot if you expect a leadoff hitter to drive in a shit load of runs. If Barry Bonds batted in the one spot the season he hit 73 HRs he would probably have had only 90 RBIs . A lotï»¿ of solo HRs
