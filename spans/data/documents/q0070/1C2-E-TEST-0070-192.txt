Scoreboard: Today's games
SEATTLE (AP)  Ichiro Suzuki was away for just 10 days. Yet he can be excused for not recognizing his own team.
Remade with new leadership and direction after it lost 101 games last year, Seattle went a surprising 5-2 on the road to begin the season. These new Mariners played Ichiro-like defense, found stellar pitching and bought into the new regime of rookie manager Don Wakamatsu and his entirely fresh staff — all while their All-Star and Gold Glove outfielder was on the disabled list for the first time in his career, because of a bleeding ulcer.
THE DAILY PITCH: Pitching has Mariners, Padres off to a surprising start
The surprise equals the best seven-game start for the Mariners since 2001, the last time they made the postseason.
"I guess I'm a little upset we lost two games," Suzuki deadpanned Monday, when he rejoined his team.
The 35-year-old cornerstone got hugs from teammates gathered for an offday workout prior to Seattle's latest home opener since 1982 — scheduled Tuesday against the Los Angeles Angels. Barring an unexpected setback such as a final blood test coming back abnormal — he has had normal ones in the last week — Suzuki will make his season debut Wednesday when he becomes eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list.
Suzuki said he feels good.
"Up to this point, I've been able to play baseball with my health. And I took it for granted," Suzuki said through interpreter Ken Barron. "Now, I truly understand the joy of playing while healthy."
Suzuki had been remarkably healthy since arriving in Seattle in 2001, missing just 16 games before this year and only three games in the previous five seasons. He had played in 197 consecutive games.
The only man to have eight consecutive 200-hit seasons to begin a major league career sprayed line drives as usual during batting practice Monday.
"Everything looks like it's going that way," for Suzuki's return Wednesday, Wakamatsu said. "It's nice to have the whole team back."
Sure, it's still way early. But for the Mariners, any sustained success is a big deal.
Longtime team president Chuck Armstrong strolled into the dugout and proclaimed Monday was the first time in six years Seattle has held "uncontested" possession of first place. The Mariners entered the day atop the AL West by 1½ games.
The last time they had such a big lead in the division was following the games of Aug. 23, 2003.
Players who have underachieved for years came home after eight weeks of spring training and a road trip to Minnesota and Oakland, then were greeted by a new banner across the top of the clubhouse exit that leads to the field.
"Each individual has the potential to maximize his potential and, by the same token, squander his potential," the banner reads. "Understanding the control you possess over that is the key. This isn't something that only applies to baseball, it applies to life."
Wakamatsu ushered in first-time general manager Jack Zduriencik after Monday's workout to read it. The GM absorbed the message with his arms folded across his chest.
"We just had a meeting to continue playing the way we are, which is as a team," said Wakamatsu, who has emphasized accountability. "I couldn't be happier."
Neither can Ken Griffey Jr. He joked with Suzuki, for whom the 39-year-old slugger has played some in right field in the last week. And he hung out with his sons, teenager Trey and 6-year-old Tevin. They joined him from the family home in Orlando
On Tuesday, Griffey will play his first home game for the Mariners since Sept. 26, 1999, months before Seattle granted his wish to be traded to Cincinnati. Griffey returned in February with a one-year contract worth $2 million in salary, plus as much as $3 million more in bonuses if he stays healthy and fans flock to him.
The home opener that was iffy to be sold out before Griffey signed is now a sellout. But he is downplaying his return, saying he does not want to answer any more questions about it.
Tuesday will also be special for the 46-year-old Wakamatsu. The former minor league manager for the Angels is the first Asian-American manager in the major leagues.
His grandparents, 93-year-old James Wakamatsu and 91-year-old Ruth Wakamatsu, will attend the game. During World War II, the U.S. government sent them to live in internment camps at a horse racing track in Portland, Ore., then to California, Arkansas and to the Chicago area. Their house in Hood River, Ore., was built partly from the barracks where they were interned.
Wakamatsu's parents, including his father who was born in one of those internment camps, will also be at Tuesday's game.
"It's going to be an awfully big day for all of us," Don Wakamatsu said.
