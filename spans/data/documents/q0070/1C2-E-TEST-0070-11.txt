Ichiro sees time at DH : Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki was used as the team's designated hitter for the first time this season during Tuesday's contest against the A's. Manager Eric Wedge said he used Ichiro as the DH in order to give him a bit of a break without taking him out of the lineup. "It helps a little bit," Wedge added. "It's not the same as an off-day, but it does help him physically a little bit. A true off-day is more about the mental side than anything, but this does help him physically."

Fantasy Analysis
Wedge has made no secret about trying to find ways to get Ichiro some rest, especially after the veteran is hitting .461 (12 for 26) since his last full day off. Ichiro has been able to raise his average up from .255 to .273 during his hot streak, so look for the Mariners to try and find ways to him a breather as the season progresses. While Ichiro hasn't performed up to standards this year, he has still been productive enough to leave active in the majority of mixed formats moving forward.
