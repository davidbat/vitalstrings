Seattle Mariner Ichiro Suzuki has donated 100 million yen to Red Cross relief efforts, according to Geoff Baker of the Seattle Times.
Though the yen has fluctuated since the disaster, his donation amounts to about $1.2 million.
The right fielder hasn't spoken to the media since the devastating earthquake and tsunami occurred in Japan on March 11.
The Mariners have also announced that they will match any front office employee and fan donation, hold a silent auction and have volunteers collecting donations for the Red Cross.
