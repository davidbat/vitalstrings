Ichiro Suzuki Stats
Ichiro Suzuki was born on Monday, October 22, 1973, in Kasugai, Japan. Suzuki was 27 years old when he broke into the big leagues on April 2, 2001, with the Seattle Mariners. His biographical data, year-by-year hitting stats, fielding stats, pitching stats (where applicable), career totals, uniform numbers, salary data and miscellaneous items-of-interest are presented by Baseball Almanac on this comprehensive Ichiro Suzuki baseball stats page.
"Everyone struggles, everyone has been through bad spells, bad halves, bad seasons. In '97, I hit .223. Think people told me I was done? Last year, I hit .229 the first half. That is scuffling. When most guys can't find it, they hit .180. When Ichiro (Suzuki) can't find it, he hits .260." - Second Baseman Bret Boone
