Ichiro Suzuki doesn't like to get days off, and he accentuated his desire to play in dramatic fashion once he got back on the field.   The Seattle Mariners right fielder opened Tuesday's game with his 2,500th career hit and went on to collect three more hits, two of them doubles, in the Mariners' 10-inning, 12-9 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. "If you look...

PHOENIX  Ichiro Suzuki showed again Tuesday that he can do about anything he wants at the plate. This time it was enough to render one of the Diamondbacks' best offensive games of the season moot.  Suzuki had four hits, including the 2,500th of his major league career, but it was his sacrifice fly in the eighth inning that started the Diamondbacks on the way to a 12-9, 10-ininng...

Positive Reinforcements You would be hard pressed to find positive milestones on the current Seattle Mariners squad if you really looked. Their last few years of futility have garnered nothing but negative responses and negative outcomes. Ichiro Suzuki finally brought a positive to this franchise when he singled against the Arizona Diamonbacks three days ago. That hit was his 2500th...

Jason Vargas is Seattle's winningest pitcher this year at 7-7, but he's lost three games in a row, and Wednesday's 4 1/3-inning, 10-run outing leaves his ERA at 4.66.   More than that, he's leaving his pitches up. He'd allowed five homers in the previous three starts before yielding five homers Wednesday at Arizona, the worst home run performance of his career...

To all critics who think the Mariners don’t have any good fans, or that these fans fill an unwelcoming ballpark, look no further than, “Cheeseburger!” This fastfood taunt was yelled by a Mariners fan sitting behind the camcorder this past Saturday’s game, while Giants 3rd baseman Pablo Sandoval (otherwise known as Kung Fu Panda in MLB circles), was batting. It’s little...

Another season of cellar dwelling could have the Seattle Mariners making more changes as we head towards the non-waiver trade deadline. One of these changes though could signal the end of era in the Pacific Northwest. The face of the Seattle Mariners franchise for over the past decade, Ichiro will turn 39-years-old this October and has since seen his 10 year streak of 200+ hits a...

When Seattle Mariners manager Eric Wedge moved Ichiro Suzuki from the No. 3 spot in the batting order to the leadoff spot, the idea was that it would increase Ichiro's productivity.   He was only batting .271 as the No. 3 hitter with one homer, and for a career .323 hitter, returning to his comfort zone should get him hitting.   It has not worked out that way.   The right fielder...
