Since his debut in 2001, Seattle Mariners right fielder Ichiro Suzuki has been a beacon of consistency. He's a 10-time All-Star who has recorded more than 200 hits and has batted over .300 every year of his career. He owns two batting titles, an MVP award and was named rookie of the year. This season, however, Ichiro seems to have started his decline. He's hitting just .271 and will surely snap his streak of 10 consecutive seasons with at least 200 hits.
Experts point to Ichiro's age, 37, as a reason for his ebb, but another explanation could be that Ichiro is the unfortunate recipient of superb fielding on the balls he puts in play.
