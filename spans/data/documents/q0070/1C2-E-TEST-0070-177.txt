Which leadoff hitter in his prime would you start your team with, Ichiro Suzuki or Rickey Henderson?
Steven R- Ichiro won the AL MVP in 2001.
Rickey Henderson and it's not even close. Rickey could get on base, hit for power, and of course steal bases. Ichiro doesn't take pitches and has a low on base percentage and no power.
Drew, I think you need to check your stats first Ichiro has had only one season of on base percentage of .414 is his highest. Henderson had 17 seasons over .400 on base percentage with his highest being .439
Hence there is really no comparison between Ichiro and Rickey. Most stolen bases in a season for Ichiro a meager 56 ouch! Rickey Henderson 130 and had 10 seasons of 60 stolen bases or more.
Ichiro's career high in homeruns and rbi's are 15 and 68
Rickey Hendersons is 28 and 74. Rickey had 4 seasons of over 20 home runs and Ichiro has 0. Most runs scored in a season for Rickey Henderson 146 and Ichiro is 127. Total seasons of over 100 for Ichiro is 7 and for Rickey Henderson is at 13 seasons. Yeah I'm going to say that Ichiro sure he could hit a single and get on base but he was never as dangerous as Henderson.
Henderson has one mvp and Ichiro has 0.
Ichiro Suzuki
