Re: Ichiro Suzuki vs Juan Pierre

Ichiro vs Tony Gwynn.
Who would you rather have, and why?
I'd take Ichiro for his superior defensive ability, although Gwynn was pretty good himself, and often gets slighted because of how he looked.  And for the extra benefits on the base paths.
That said, Ichiro's slap and slash approach at the plate doesn't advance baserunners the way Gwynn's more traditional approach does, so I do believe Gwynn is a slightly better option strictly at the plate.
In the current structure of the game, and particularly during the height of the bash era, Ichiro's approach just wasn't going to allow him to be a singular piece to build a team around.  But if you put him on a good team with real power behind him, the guy would be an absolute menace.  He'd see more pitches, and he works counts like crazy.  And that arm on a serious roster would probably be playing full time in CF because most good teams have power in the corner outfield spots.  Batting two in any of the big time major market teams for the next five years would change the historical perspective on the guy even more, and he's already held in rediculously high esteem, and I'd guess is already a HOFer in this country, based on very close numbers, and the social impact of being the first Japanese born position player over here.
