Ichiro Suzuki Biography
By Scott Jack
Ichiro Suzuki is one of the best baseball players to ever play Major League Baseball and he only started playing back in 2001. Ichiro was un-drafted, but in 2000 the Seattle Mariners decided to sign him to a pretty huge deal. Ichiro Suzuki has continued to play with the Seattle Mariners since signing with them back in 2000 and he has done superb with the team.
Every year that Ichiro has played baseball he has won a gold glove award and also made the All-Star Game. He is undoubtedly the best Japanese born baseball player to ever play the game. Ichiro was also the first Japanese born player to ever play a starting position on a Major League Baseball team.
Ichiro started playing baseball when he was only seven years old and he had the help of his father. They have a strict routine which was followed everyday to ensure that Ichiro could become the best baseball player that he possibly could. Ichiro is already a member of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and I'm sure when he retires from MLB he will be inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame.
Suzuki isn't the biggest baseball player by any stretch and he doesn't hit for power very often. However, he manages to keep up one of the best hitting averages year after year with his constant slugger mentality. He likes to just make contact with the ball and let the baseball do the rest and he ends up with more hits then most players every single season.
Suzuki is by far my favourite baseball player of all-time and I can't wait to see what he has in store for all of us in 2009-2010. The Seattle Mariners look like they could be a strong team this year and I hope that Ichiro has a great season with another gold glove award nomination hopefully.
