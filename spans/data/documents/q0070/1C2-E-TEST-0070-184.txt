 
About Ichiro Suzuki Autographed Photos
Nicknamed the ‘Hits Man’ by the fans and the media,  Ichiro Suzuki  was born on October 22 in 1973 at Kasugai in Nishikasugai in Aichi Prefecture in the Japanese archipelagos.  One popular magazine says that when Ichiro was seven years old, he joined the first baseball team of his life and he had asked his father to teach the nuances and the proper tactics of the game so that he can be a better player of the team.
 
Since then every day, the father and the son duo would go out early in the morning with a long run in the hills followed by a strict training regime that consisted of throwing around fifty balls for pitching, running around the field and fielding fifty in and out of the field balls, respectively, and scoring around five hundred runs through the pitches, with two hundred and fifty from the pitching machine and another two hundred and fifty from his mentor, which is his father.
