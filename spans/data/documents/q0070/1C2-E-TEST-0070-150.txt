The great Ichiro Suzuki has had a Hall of Fame-caliber career since he came over to the Seattle Mariners from Japan in 2001. But 2011 was a hugely disappointing year for Suzuki. The Ichiro Suzuki statistics for 2011 showed that the outfielder had an off-year. The 38-year-old hit .272, and he had 184 hits. This was the first time in his MLB career that he didn't get over 200 hits. He did steal 40 bases, though, but for Ichiro Suzuki and his fans, it was a disappointing season.
So what does it all mean for fantasy baseball 2012? Well, the Ichiro Suzuki statistics are going to change with one big thing â€“ plate appearances, something the star has led the league in for most of his career. Ichiro Suzuki may have batted leadoff for his entire career, both in Japan and in the United States, but Seattle Mariners manager Eric Wedge recently announced that Ichiro Suzuki would be batting third this season. This is a huge change, and there are question marks about how Suzuki will do in the No. 3 spot.
To add insult to injury, Ichiro Suzuki is losing the leadoff spot to Chone Figgins, the disappointing star who hit just .188 last season. (Is Wedge aware that the No. 1 spot usually goes to the player with the highest on-base-percentage on the team? Figgins OBP was just .241 last year.)
Anyhow, the big question when it comes to fantasy baseball 2012 is what to expect from the Ichiro Suzuki statistics in 2012. Did Ichiro Suzuki simply have an off-season, or is age starting to catch up with him? And how will the No. 3 spot do for his numbers?
Only time will tell whether Ichiro Suzuki will be able to bounce back from the disappointing 2011 season. But his value will most likely drop for fantasy baseball 2012, and Ichiro Suzuki is most likely going to draft lower than in previous seasons.
