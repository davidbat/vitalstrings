Ichiro Suzuki is having the worst year of his 11-year MLB career, but that doesn't mean that it won't be a historical one.
The future Hall of Famer has one very historic streak on the line. The Seattle Mariners have 29 games left in the season and Ichiro is currently sitting at 153 hits.
Ichiro has made MLB history since Day 1 and hasn't stopped. He became the first Japanese position player to play in the majors in 2001. That year, the Mariners won a record 116 games as Ichiro won Rookie of the Year and MVP honors—what an entrance.
Ichiro has had at least 200 hits in all 10 of his MLB seasons. He is currently tied with hit king Pete Rose for most 200-plus hit seasons. Ichiro also holds the MLB record for hits in a season with 262.
Let's not forget that Ichiro has at least 25-plus steals and a Gold Glove in all 10 seasons, too. 
The numbers this man has put up are simply jaw-dropping. One can only think about how many records Ichiro may have if he played in the States his entire career. He entered MLB at the age of 27 and would've undoubtedly surpassed the 3,000-hit plateau already if he had entered just a few years prior. 
Now, the 37-year-old Ichiro, for the first time, has struggled. It may be that the Mariners have struggled all season, posting just a 57-76 record. It may be that Ichiro is entering the latter days of his career. Whatever the reason, as a baseball fan, I haven't seen enough of Ichiro.
