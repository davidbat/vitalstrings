Seattle Mariners manager Eric Wedge decided to move Ichiro Suzuki back to the leadoff spot recently and it has not gone very well. Up to that point, he had been batting third in the Mariners' lineup this season, finding a bit of success in that role. With Dustin Ackley finding himself in a huge slump in the leadoff role though, Wedge bumped Ichiro back to the top.
Ichiro got moved to leadoff against the Chicago White Sox on June 1, going 1-for-5 in the spot. He then followed that up with two home runs in his first two at-bats on June 2. Since then though, Ichiro has not had a hit.  That's 19 straight at-bats without a hit, counting his first two plate appearances against the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night (June 6).

Since stepping back into the leadoff slot, Ichiro is a combined 3-for-26. That's a .115 batting average and something that Mariners fans are not happy about. After he hit those two home runs though, it seems like Wedge is not ready to move Ichiro away from that leadoff spot; maybe to the detriment of the team. It was far too early to throw in the towel on Ackley, especially since this is a team trying to figure out how things will work for the future.
At 25-33, the Mariners reside as the third place team in the American League West, nine games behind the Texas Rangers in the division.
