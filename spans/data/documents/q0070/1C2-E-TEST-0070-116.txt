Posey, Melky homers put Giants over M's
Buster Posey led off the second inning with a solo home run into the second deck of the left field seats, National League hitting leader Melky Cabrera added a two-run shot in the eighth inning, and the San Francisco Giants opened a three-game interleague series with a 4-2 win over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.
Ichiro Suzuki had his worst campaign in the majors in 2011 as he posted career lows in some significant categories. His .272 batting average was more than 50 points down from his career mark and his five homers were his fewest since coming over from Japan in 2001. His on-base percentage (.310) and slugging percentage (.335) were also way down. Despite struggling in those aspects, though, he was still able to produce with 47 RBI and 40 stolen bases. It appears as though Father Time has finally caught up to the 38-year-old and it doesn't look as though he will be able to return to the elite Fantasy option he once was. But with a young up-and-coming team surrounding him in Seattle, he should be able to still hit for a decent average and steal bases for Fantasy owners. Since he will continue to see steady at-bats for the Mariners, consider Suzuki worthy of being taken in the middle rounds in mixed leagues on Draft Day, and target him a little higher in Rotisserie formats.
