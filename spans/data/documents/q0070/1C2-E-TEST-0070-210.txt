You will probably get a whole bunch of responses saying "It's because in Japan they put a person's family name first and their first name last" While that is correct, it has nothing to do with Ichiro's name on his jersey. Otherwise there would be a bunch jersey's saying Hideo, Hideki, Kazahiro and Daisuke. Whether you write your family name first or last, it is still tradition to put your family on your jersey.
It is simple a marketing thing and a reflection of his fame - he has "branded" himself simply as Ichiro. It is an uncommon practice in baseball but more common in soccer, especially Brazilian players (Pele, Ronaldo, Ronaldhino, and many many more). It's a reflection of an athlete's fame that they become known simply by their first name.
