Fantasy Baseball Hot Stove Says:
We all know that Ichiro Suzuki has a great batting average year in and year out. The part that does not get enough emphasis is the weight that his batting average takes on for a given team. Joe Mauer finished with a .327 average last year while Ichiro hit .315. That 12 point gap gets narrowed when you consider Ichiro and Carlos Quentin combined for a .286 average last year, and Mauer and Quentin combined for a .288 average last year. And that's taking into account that last year was a down year for Ichiro in terms of his average.
Ichiro has led the majors in hits since 2006. I don't mean his 1,114 hits are tops in the big leagues since that time (which they are) - I mean he led the league in hits in 2006, did it again in 2007, did it again in 2008, and so on. For the category of batting average, he is simply the best player in the game - even if he's not the batting champ.
Skeptics Say: Throughout his brilliant run over the last decade, many have argued that Ichiro could hit for more power if he wanted to sacrifice his batting average, but it wouldn't be worth it. That maybe true, but if there was ever a season for him to test out what he could do in terms of power it was last year when the Mariners offense was just atrocious. The fact is that Ichiro's career high of 15 will never be surpassed, and I would be surprised if he ever got 10 again. He'll be 37 this year, and I don't expect him to change his approach on account of the fact that his legs might slow up.
Ichiro is owed $17 million this year and $17 million next year. Then he will become a free agent. With the Mariners going nowhere, you wonder if they could move their face of the franchise over the last decade for something useful. Ichiro fantasy owners wouldn't mind if they at least gave it some thought.
