Featured here is the Official Worldwide Ichiro Cardography, where we document and picture nearly every Ichiro card made from 1993 through 2003. Each image is easily viewed by clicking the baseball icon that follows the listing.
Along with approximately 350 different Japanese cards, we cover about 4,000 American cards!
Except the four Hilo Stars issues (Hawaii, 1993), the American cards began in 2001, his first year in Major League Baseball.
Regarding the American cards, the primary focus of this site is those made between 2001 and 2003.
Two exceptions are factory-issued cards signed by Ichiro, and factory-issued one-of-one cards. Especially fascinating in this regard are the 1/1 issues from NSA (National Sports Authenticators).
We plan to document any new signed cards, that is if others ever come out — along with anything else we believe we can't do without. Other than NSA products, our one-of-one coverage ends with 2006.
We shall also maintain a complete listing of all cards made in Japan, or elsewhere overseas.
Collecting Ichiro is strictly a hobby for us! As such, there is not enough free time to keep up with the hundreds of other recent issues that continue to pour forth from the American card companies. By specializing in 1993 through 2003, we can concentrate on keeping those 11 years accurately documented and thoroughly comprehensive.
Cards are grouped by year of issue, which usually matches the copyright date shown on the back side. Look for it to be in tiny print near the bottom. Date made is in some cases different than product description. Often, cards manufactured in November or December refer to the following year in set titles and publicity.
Also shown are value estimates accurate at the time of issue. Prices may have moved in either direction since then. All pre-2004 items are priced  from the most common to the world's rarest!
To stay current, we encourage your input. Additions and corrections are greatly appreciated, and will add to the overall value of this free reference source.
Note: none of the cards documented on any of our pages are for sale! They are listed and pictured for reference ONLY!
Be sure to visit the “Area 51 Trading Post” to see a list of the Ichiro cards and memorabilia we want to buy.
