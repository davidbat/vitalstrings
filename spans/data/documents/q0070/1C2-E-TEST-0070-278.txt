ABOUT
I’m Steve Mandich . I was born in Seattle, I live in Seattle, and the Seattle Mariners are my all-time favorite baseball team. And, ever since his 2001 Major League debut with the Mariners, Ichiro Suzuki has been my all-time favorite baseball player. This blog has tracked Ichiro’s game-by-game progress since 2011 -- including his attempt to become the only player to accumulate 200 hits in 11 seasons -- along with plenty of fun sidelights... Disclaimer: this blog is a labor of love, and is not affiliated with Ichiro Suzuki, the Seattle Mariners, or Major League Baseball.
