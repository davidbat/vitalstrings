Ichiro Suzuki is not in Monday's lineup.
Ichiro has struggled to the tune of a .206 batting average this month and is hitting just .255 this season, so he could probably use the breather. Michael Saunders will take his place in the leadoff spot. Jun 18 - 5:47 PM

Ichiro Suzuki went 2-for-5 with a homer and three runs scored versus the Angels on Wednesday.
Ichiro has three homers in June and four for the season. He finished with just six and five the last two years, but his career high for homers was 15, established back in 2005. Jun 7 - 1:36 AM
Ichiro Suzuki blasted his second and third home runs of the season, helping to lead the Mariners to a 10-8 victory over Gavin Floyd and the White Sox on Saturday.
Ichiro finished the game 2-for-6 with the two solo shots off of Gavin Floyd. He only hit one home run in the entirety of his time hitting third in the lineup, and then blasts two in his second game back in the leadoff spot. Perhaps he’s just more comfortable in his regular role. He’s now hitting .271 with three homers, 19 RBI and eight steals on the season. While he may never hit .350 again, he still has value hitting atop an improving Mariners lineup. Jun 2 - 8:29 PM
Ichiro Suzuki is batting leadoff Friday for the first time this season.
He hit third in the order for the first 52 games before a day off Wednesday, but Ichiro has batted just .271/.305/.367 with one home run, so it was time for the Mariners to make a move. Third baseman Kyle Seager is hitting third against the White Sox. Jun 1 - 3:32 PM
