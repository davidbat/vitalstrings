Ichiro Suzuki
Ichiro Suzuki is a Japanese-born menswear designer based in London. He graduated from the London College of Fashion in 2006 with a first-class degree with honours, after which he joined Savile Row bespoke tailors Henry Poole & Co, where he has been trained in the art of cutting. As several awards in various international competitions will testify, Ichiro has an unrelenting obsession with design and bespoke tailoring.
As Ichiro's designs indicate, although his major influences are rooted in traditional British bespoke tailoring, they also display a classicism and eccentricity that, while meticulously adhering to luxury craftsmanship, also reveal elements of breath-taking originality. His aim is to revitalise the customs of English tradition with an artistic and unique approach, while still embodying the luxury that the highest end of the industry still offers. In short, his creations are a marriage between sartorial tradition and innovative design.
In order to further sate his creative drive and develop his aesthetic, he is currently studying for a masters degree at the Royal College of Art. This is with a view to complementing his fine traditional background in Savile Row tailoring with his innate creativity and innovation, which will no doubt be honed while studying artistic design at the highest level. Ichiro lives and breathes design, and aspires to create designs that live and breathe also.
