Discusses the life and accomplishements of Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese position player to make it into the American major leagues.
Editorial Review - Reed Business Information (c) 2004
Gr 4-6-With their readable prose and detailed sports action, these titles will appeal to baseball fans. Leigh opens his account with a description of Suzuki&#39;s first game as a Seattle Mariner, when he became the first Japanese position player to make the leap to the American major leagues. The majority of this book details the superstar&#39;s development and play in Japan, and readers will learn quite a lot about baseball in that country. The portrait is balanced with quotes from coaches and fellow players, and accurate, up-to-date statistics. Marlin begins his account of Mantle&#39;s life in 1953 with the &quot;Washington Wallop,&quot; the athlete&#39;s first tape-measure home run. The author goes on to describe his subject&#39;s impoverished background and career with the Yankees. Viola begins with a dramatic account of July 4, 1939, &quot;Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day,&quot; when Gehrig made his touching &quot;Luckiest Man&quot; speech. His baseball prowess was undeniable, but he spent much of his career in the shadow of Babe Ruth, and then Joe DiMaggio. All three titles have a handful of black-and-white photographs and a few pages of statistics. These solidly written and well-crafted books will be welcome additions. Leigh&#39;s entry also offers a fine introduction to baseball in Japan.-Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA
