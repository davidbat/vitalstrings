A Look At The 2009 Seattle Mariners
As I type this article the 2009 major league baseball season is winding down. There is a lot of excitement as teams from the American and National Leagues position themselves for the playoffs.
The Seattle Mariners had a miserable season in 2008. But 2009 has been a different story. They have played really good baseball and are on their way up. It does appear that they will miss the playoffs again however. But they have two of the most exciting players in baseball in King Felix Hernandez and Ichiro Suzuki.

Felix Hernandez And His 2009 Season
Cy Young Award Candidate
The Seattle Mariners have one of the best young right handed pitchers in the American League in Felix Hernandez. Felix is coming off a 5-4 win against the Toronto Blue Jays where he struck out 11 batters and got his 17th win of the 2009 baseball season.
King Felix is 17-5 with an impressive 2.49 ERA. As well as 207 strikeouts to his credit. Felix has a shot at the 2009 American League Cy Young Award. Although there is a guy in Kansas City that will probably win it. Of course I am talking about Zack Greinke. Zack made the Red Sox hitters look like little leaguers yesterday as he pitched 6 scoreless innings in the Royals' win.
Hernandez has 2 starts left of the remaining 2009 baseball season. If he can get two more wins and pitch really well, he will definitely have a shot at the American League Cy Young Award.
That would put his win-loss record at 19-5 for the 2009 season. King Felix's last two starts will be against the Oakland Athletics and the Texas Rangers.

Ichiro Gets Ejected From Game
9/26/09-Seattle Mariners vs. Blue Jays
Ichiro was thrown out of today's Mariners-Blue Jays game. Ichiro took a called third strike and the pitch appeared to be way outside. Ichiro argued with the umpire and that was ok. But what he did next is what caused him to get thrown out.
Ichiro took his bat and drew a line in the batter's box to show the umpire where that pitch was. That is a "No-No". Major League umpires do not like getting showed up by players. As soon as Ichiro drew his line, the gave him the old "Heave-HO!" and threw him out.
Ichiro Suzuki has been in the Major Leagues for 9 years now. And unbelievably, that was the first time in Ichiro's great career that he got thrown out of game. He was also the first Mariners player to get run from a game all season.

A Look At Felix Hernandez Rookie Cards
If you are looking to start collecting Felix Hernandez rookie cards, don't forget that his true rookie cards are in 2004 baseball sets. Not 2005!
In my opinion Felix's best rookie card is his 2004 Bowman Chrome Refractor AUTO. Pictured here.

Ken Griffey, Jr Homers In Mariners' 7-0
Brandon Morrow pitches 8 shutout innings
Ken Griffey, Jr hit a 3 run home run in last night's 7-0 win over the Oakland Athletics. It was Junior's 18th homer of the season and the 629th of his remarkable career.
Griffey's homer helped back up some solid pitching by right hander Brandon Morrow. Morrow pitched 8 innings and gave up 2 hits. Now I know he wasn't facing the Yankees or Red Sox and the A's are not a great offense, but Morrow was getting lit up earlier in the year by every team. So it was good to see him pitch well in his last start of the 2009 baseball season.
Meanwhile, Ichiro collected two more hits with a single and a triple. Ichiro has 219 hits for the season and he's batting .351. Ichiro would be in the running for the AL Batting crown if not for a guy in Minnesota named Mauer!
Ichiro Gets 2 More Hits In Mariners' Win Over The A's
The Mariners just got through beating the Athletics tonight at Safeco Field, 4-2. Doug Fister got the win for the Mariners. Ichiro picked up 2 more hits and now has 221 for the 2009 season.
Three games left against the Texas Rangers and that will be it. The 2009 baseball season will be over.
Ichiro Ends the 2009 Baseball Season With One More Hit
Ichiro finished his 2009 season today with one more hit to add to his total. Another great year for this hitting machine!
Ichiro's final numbers for the 2009 baseball season as follows. He had 225 hits, 11 home runs, 46 RBI, and a batting average of .352. Just another super season to add to his future hall of fame career.
Ken Griffey, Jr Ends His 2009 Season With A Hit!
Ken Griffey, Jr's return to the Seattle Mariners this year was a complete success. Junior was a positive presents in the club house for the M's.
And he hit a little bit too in limited duty. Here are Griffey's final numbers for the 2009 baseball season.
Junior ended up with 19 home runs, 57 RBI, and 19 doubles. And he did that in only 117 games. Junior still has the prettiest swing in baseball. I hope he comes back to the Mariners in 2010. We shall see.
