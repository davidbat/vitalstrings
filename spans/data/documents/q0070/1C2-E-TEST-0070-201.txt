523 SBs
.340 Batting Average
As many already know, thisÂ means that the combined Ichiro has eclipsed the career 3,000 hit mark already — last summer sometime.
Now, let’s do some conservative estimations. Let’s say he ends up this year with 210 hits, that would put him at 3,293 for his combined career. He turns 36 on October 22nd. So I’ll assume he has four more solid years, averaging 200 hits each season. Then let’s add on justÂ two more after that, at ages 40 and 41, where he’ll get another 100 hitsÂ in each.Â That would add another 1000 hits in all, and he’d then have 4,293 — which means he will have passed Pete Rose’s mark of 4,256!
Again, I’m not really suggesting we could then legitimately consider Ichiro the all-time hits leader — since 1,278 of them came while playing in the Japanese league. But surely we would then have to consider carefully where we’d want to rate Ichiro amongst all-time hitters, and I think we’d have to consider him (if not already) amongst the top five singles or batting-average hitters (non-power) of all-time.
Keep it up Ichiro!
P.S. Per the comment I received from Gilbert Martinez, I’ve updated this post with what I now assume to be the correct numbers for Ichiro’s time in Japan, obtained from this website . I had been using the numbers from this Sportsline page , but they oddly have double entries included for his 1992 and 1993 seasons, something I noticed at the time I wrote this post but forgot to look into further before finishing my article. Sorry for any confusion!
Â P.P.S. As further noted in the comments received, when I made the change noted above I forgot to update my math at the end. I’ve now re-written the last part of this article to take this into account.
