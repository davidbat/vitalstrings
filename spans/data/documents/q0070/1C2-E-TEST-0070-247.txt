Ichiro! According to the Wall Street Journal’s Private Properties section , Seattle Mariners’ superstar Ichiro Suzuki is listing his home at 4409 164th Ln SE, Issaquah  WA 98027 for sale for $1,750,000. The listing description says it was formerly listed as high as $3.2 million, which certainly makes this a steal for any baseball fan that can afford estimated monthly mortgage payments of $7,558 according to Zillow Mortgage Marketplace ‘s calculation of a 30 year fixed mortgage with 20% down ($350,000) at an interest rate of 5.05%.
Is Seattle’s Zen master outfielder leaving town because the original king of the Mariners — Ken Griffey Jr. — is returning ? Nah. Ichiro is just like every other homeowner. He bought a place in a better location closer to Lake Sammamish. Natch.
