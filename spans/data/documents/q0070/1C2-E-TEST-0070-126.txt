Pitching in high school.
1973-1991: Youth
Ichiro Suzuki was born on October 22, 1973 in Kasugai, Nishikasugai District, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He grew up in Toyoyama Cho, just north of Nagoya, near the Nagoya airport. He began playing baseball at age seven for his elementary school team, and soon asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki, to help him to one day become a professional. The two began intensive hitting, throwing, and fielding drills every day, playing in a field adjacent to the airport's main entrance. As a teenager, Ichiro was chosen to play in the prestigious baseball program at Nagoya's Aiko-Dai Meiden High School. ("After I went to high school, all I did was baseball and sleeping.") Though he was primarily used as a pitcher (with a 93 mph fastball), his career high school batting average was .505.
Following his final season at Meiden, Ichiro was drafted by the Orix Blue Wave of Japan's Pacific League in November 1991. The six-team Pacific League and the six-team Central League together form Nippon Professional Baseball, Japan's top organization. (The NPB's twelve teams each represent a sponsor, not their home city. Orix is a Japanese financial services group; the defunct Blue Wave played in Kobe.) Despite Ichiro's impressive numbers, he wasn't drafted until the fourth round, as many teams thought the five-nine, 124-pound 18-year-old was too small compete professionally.
Though Ichiro left Nagoya to play in Kobe, his father continues to maintain a Nagoya museum dedicated to his son, the Ichiro Exhibition Room .
1992: Orix Blue Wave
After his high school graduation in March 1992, Ichiro spent most of his first professional season playing for the Blue Wave's minor-league team. Skeptical Blue Wave manager Shozo Doi mostly kept Ichiro down because he didn't approve of his unorthodox, pendulum-like leg motion, swinging his leading right leg back and then forward upon every swing of the bat. Still, Ichiro hit .366 in 58 minor-league games, and in 40 games in the majors, the 18-year-old hit .253.
1993: Orix Blue Wave
Ichiro again spent most of the season in the minors, hitting .371 with 8 homers in 48 games. He had 64 at-bats in the majors that year, hitting .188 with one home run. That homer, his first in the majors, came off Hideo Nomo of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who two years later would join the Los Angeles Dodgers and become the National League Rookie of the Year.
1994: Orix Blue Wave
Akira Ogi, who took over as the Blue Wave manager, made Ichiro his everyday right fielder, and soon, his permanent leadoff hitter, and Ichiro became a superstar. In that breakout season, Ichiro's .385 average set a Pacific League record, and his 210 hits set an NPB record. (No previous Japanese player ever had 200 hits in a season, which lasts a relatively short 130 games.) He also led the league with a .445 on-base percentage, and reached base safely in 69 consecutive games. Along with 13 home runs, 54 runs batted in, and 29 stolen bases, Ichiro easily won the Pacific League MVP award, as well as a Gold Glove award and the Matsutaro Shoriki award, annually given to a player who greatly contributes to the development of Japanese professional baseball.
1995: Orix Blue Wave
Ichiro again led the league with a .342 batting average, and had career highs of 25 home runs and 49 steals. With his 80 runs batted in, he won his second consecutive MVP, Gold Glove, and Matsutaro Shoriki awards, and led the Blue Wave to its first Pacific League pennant in twelve years.
1996: Orix Blue Wave
Ichiro led the Pacific League for the third straight season with a .356 average, won his third straight MVP award, and he led the Blue Wave to the Japan Series title, beating the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants. Following the season, and after playing in an exhibition series against visiting American Major League all-stars, Ichiro decided that he too wanted to one day play in America.
1997: Orix Blue Wave
Besides playing in his fourth consecutive all-star game, Ichiro's .345 average led the Pacific League for fourth straight season, he won his fourth consecutive Gold Glove award, and he set an NPB record of 216 consecutive plate appearances without a strikeout.
1998: Orix Blue Wave
The model of consistency, Ichiro won his fifth straight Gold Glove and batting crown (hitting .358), and played in his fifth all-star game. He also notched more walks than strikeouts for his fourth season straight.
1999: Orix Blue Wave
Before the NPB season began, Ichiro traveled to Arizona to work out with the Seattle Mariners (and his favorite player, Ken Griffey Jr.) at Seattle's spring training camp... After returning to Japan, Ichiro won his sixth batting title (hitting .356) and sixth Gold Glove, and his .412 on-base percentage led the Pacific League for the fourth time. He also tallied his 1,000th career hit and 100th career home run, but his season was cut short in late August after getting hit by pitch, breaking a bone in his right hand.
2000: Orix Blue Wave
In his seventh and final full major league season in Japan, Ichiro's .387 batting average was not only his career best, but also set the Japanese record with seven straight Pacific League batting titles. He won his seventh consecutive Gold Glove award, played in his seventh straight all-star game, was named to his seventh straight "Best Nine" end-of-season All-Star team, and his .460 on-base percentage led the league for the fifth time. Though his season was again cut short (this time with a rib-cage injury), Ichiro played in the Blue Wave's final game of the season, and ultimately his final game in Japan. Altogether, in his nine NPB seasons, Ichiro amassed 1,278 hits and a .353 batting average, and became the most-recognized person in the nation.
After the season, Orix felt they could soon no longer afford to keep their superstar, and allowed him to negotiate with Major League teams. Through the posting system, the Seattle Mariners won the right to negotiate with him, and on November 18, 2000, the M's signed him to a three-year, $14 million contract, making Ichiro the first-ever Japanese position player to sign with a Major League club.
2001: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro's American debut with the 2001 Seattle Mariners was not only one of the greatest seasons any player has ever recorded, but it was also one of the most-watched, as the Japanese media sensation quickly gained superstardom in the U.S. The leadoff hitter's .350 batting average led the majors, as did his 242 hits (a rookie record, and the most by any player in 71 years), as well as his 56 stolen bases. He also dazzled with his defensive prowess in right field; in his first week in Seattle, his putout of Oakland's Terrence Long at third base gained legendary status as "The Throw." Ichiromania was in full swing by the All-Star break, as he was the first rookie ever to lead all players in All-Star balloting, with 3,373,035 votes. (Coincidentally, the game was held in Seattle.) Ichiro was a major contributor to Seattle's 116-win season, tying 1906 Chicago Cubs for the regular-season win record, though the M's fell short of the World Series, losing to the Yankees in the American League Championship Series. Ultimately, Ichiro stifled those critics who claimed he would be too small and frail to make it in the American majors. Instead, he won both the American League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards, the only player besides Fred Lynn to do so.
2002: Seattle Mariners
After his 2001 onslaught, Ichiro experienced a relative sophomore slump, but he still had a .321 batting average and 208 hits. He became the sixth player in MLB history with 200 hits in each of his first two seasons, and those combined 450 hits were the most for any player's first two seasons. He was again among the league leaders in several offensive categories, and he led All-Star balloting for second straight year.
2003: Seattle Mariners
With his .312 batting average and 212 hits, he became the third player with 200 hits in his first three seasons. He was yet again among the league leaders in several offensive categories, and he led All-Star balloting for third straight year.
2004: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro's 262 hits set the all-time Major League single-season hits record, breaking George Sisler's 84-year-old record of 257. Ichiro also set season records for singles (225, breaking Wee Willie Keeler's record of 206 in 1898), road hits (145, breaking Harry Heilmann's record of 134 in 1925), and 50-hit months (three). He became the first player in MLB history to reach 200 hits in each of his four seasons; his 922 hits during that period were more than anyone during any four-year period. And, having amassed 2,000 career hits between NPB and MLB, he joined the Meikyukai, Japan's exclusive Golden Players Club. Unsurprisingly, he again led the majors with his .372 batting average.
2005: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro experienced his "worst" season to date, batting .303 with 206 hits. Still, he became just the sixth player to collect 200 hits in five consecutive seasons, but was the first to do it in his first five seasons. He also hit 15 home runs, his MLB career-best.
2006: Team Japan
Ichiro led Japan to a gold medal in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, an international baseball tournament played over 17 days in March 2006. Japan had a 5-3 record in eight tournament games, including a 10-6 win over Cuba in the final contest in San Diego. Ichiro hit in every game, going 12-for-33 for a .364 average, with seven runs, four stolen bases, and one home run.
2006: Seattle Mariners
Back in Seattle, Ichiro led the majors with 224 hits, extending his 200-hit season streak to six, joining Wade Boggs and Wee Willie Keeler as the only players ever to do so. He batted .322 and stole 49 bases, including 39 in a row.
2007: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro racked up a league-leading 238 hits, becoming only one of eight players to collect 200 hits in seven career seasons, and the only player besides Wee Willie Keeler to do it in consecutive years (Keeler had eight). While compiling his .351 average, he set the Mariner record with a 25-game hitting streak, and set the American League records with 45 steals without getting caught. On July 10 he won the All-Star Game's MVP award, going 3-for-3 with an inside-the-park home run. Three days later, he signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension, keeping him in Seattle through 2012.
2008: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro's 213 hits extended his streak of consecutive 200-hit seasons to eight, tying Wee Willie Keeler's record. On July 29, he collected his 3,000th professional hit (combining his 1,278 career hits in Japan with 1,722 such hits in the U.S.). The 34-year-old reached the milestone at a younger age than the previous record-holder, Ty Cobb. In July, he visited the grave of George Sisler, outside St. Louis.
2009: Team Japan
In March, Ichiro and Team Japan won their second gold medal in the second-ever World Baseball Classic. Over nine games, Ichiro batted .280 (12-for-44), with seven runs and five runs batted in, including a tenth-inning, two-out, two-run single, leading Japan to a 5-3 victory over Korea in the championship game at Dodger Stadium.
2009: Seattle Mariners
Due to the stress of defending Japan's WBC title, Ichiro missed the first eight Mariner games of 2009 with a bleeding ulcer, making his first-ever trip to the disabled list. (In his first eight seasons, he had never missed even two consecutive games.) Returning to the lineup on April 15, Ichiro's grand slam tied him with Isao Harimoto as the all-time Japanese-born hits leader, and he broke the record the following night with his 3,086th professional hit (1,278 in Japan, 1,808 in the U.S.). From May 6 to June 5, his 27-game hitting streak set both personal and team records. On September 6, Ichiro became the second-fastest player in history to collect 2,000 MLB hits. On September 13, he surpassed Wee Willie Keeler to become the only Major League player with at least 200 hits in nine consecutive seasons. (Keeler's streak ended in 1901, exactly a century before Ichiro's streak began.) Ichiro also joined Pete Rose and Ty Cobb as the only players to have nine career 200-hit seasons overall, though Rose took 15 seasons to reach the milestone, while Cobb needed 20. Ichiro also has more hits over a nine-year period than anyone in MLB history. He missed another eight games near season's end (sitting out 16 overall in 2009), but he still led the majors with 225 hits. He batted .352, but it was the first season he failed to score at least 100 runs or steal at least 30 bases. He had his first career walk-off home run, but he also received his first ejection for arguing balls and strikes.
2010: Seattle Mariners
Ichiro led the majors with 214 hits, extending his record streak of consecutive 200-hit seasons to ten, and tying Pete Rose for the most career 200-hit seasons. (It took Rose 17 seasons to reach the mark (he was 37 at the time); the 36-year-old Ichiro did it in ten.) In August, he visited the grave of Wee Willie Keeler in Queens.
The Future
Assuming Ichiro remains healthy and continues to get at least 200 hits per season for the next four years -- not too far-fetched -- here's what'll happen:
2011: Ichiro would set the record with 11 career 200-hit seasons. He would also set the Mariner career hits record, currently held by Edgar Martinez with 2,247.
2012: Ichiro would set the record with 12 career 200-hit seasons. It will be the last year of his current contract with the M's, when he'll be 38.
2013: Ichiro would set the record with 13 career 200-hit seasons. With at least 2,844 hits in his MLB career, plus 1,278 hits in his Japanese career, he would have 4,122 career hits. He would also likely play for Team Japan in the third World Baseball Classic.
2014: Ichiro would set the record with 14 career 200-hit seasons. With at least 3,044 hits in his MLB career, plus 1,278 hits in his NPB career, he would have 4,322 career hits, passing Pete Rose's MLB career mark of 4,255 (and Julio Franco's international career record of 4,229). Ichiro will be 40 during the 2014 season. Though Rose's MLB record appears out of reach, he would become roughly the 30th player with 3,000 career MLB hits.
Hall of Fame? Ichiro's ten Major League seasons through 2010 have met the minimum required for Hall of Fame eligibility. Five years after his retirement, he will need to be approved for the Hall by a screening committee made up of members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. Ichiro's numbers alone should make him a shoo-in as the first Asian HoFer, but his role as the MLB's first Asian position player, opening the door for more such players, and thereby giving the American game a more international appeal, should guarantee his induction.

Above are some uniforms Ichiro has worn for various Mariner turn-back-the-clock games; most of the other uniform combos he's worn throughout his professional career appear elsewhere on this page.
So why only his first name on his uniform? During the 1994 season, when Ichiro was one of four Orix players named Suzuki, Blue Wave manager Akira Ogi had him replace the last name on his jersey to his first name, a publicity stunt to promote the rising star. Ichiro was initially embarrassed by it, but the name caught on in Japan, and later, in the U.S. While "Ichiro" means "first son," he actually has an older brother, fashion designer Kazuyasu Suzuki.
As for his uniform number, Ichiro wore 51 for Orix, and he was also issued the number when he joined the Mariners. At first he was reluctant to wear 51, since it was previously worn by former Mariner pitching sensation Randy Johnson, but he agreed to it anyhow: "I'm very fortunate the Mariners would let me wear 51, and I'll work hard not to damage the reputation of the number."
Like many other major leaguers in the 2000s, Ichiro routinely wore long pants. Then, in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, he began wearing short pants to expose his navy socks, a look that he's sported ever since.
Equipment
Ichiro wears Mizuno ball gloves (handmade for him by legendary leather craftsman Yoshi Tsubota ), Mizuno batting gloves and wrist bands, and he uses Mizuno bats, which he keeps in a humidor. He also wears Asics spikes and Oakley Ichiro Juliet Signature Series sunglasses (more on those here ).
"When a person gives a gift to another, it is expected the gift will be treated well. But baseball players throw and kick their baseball gloves that have been given to them by makers of baseball equipment. I feel that is a contradiction... Equipment -- bats, glove, and spikes -- should look cool and get kids who play baseball want to wear them."
