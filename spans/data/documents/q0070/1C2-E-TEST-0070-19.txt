Ichiro Suzuki, 2001       Upper Deck SP
 
After the season, Ichiro        played for a Japanese all-star team in an exhibition series against a        group of touring     major leaguers. American players had little respect for the brand of baseball        being played in Japan, and gave little credence to the possibility of        a Japanese     position player making it in the majors. That changed when they got a load        of Ichiro Suzuki. Most of the time he looked like the best player on the        fieldfor      either side. Catcher Mike Piazza told the local press that Ichiro could easily      hold his own in the majors. As a result Ichiros status in Japan grew     ever larger.
The 1997 season saw Ichiro win      a fourth straight batting championship and reach a new personal high with      91 RBIs. During one stretch he went 216 at bats without striking out to set      a new league mark. That fall, Ichiro again dazzled a team of American stars,      stealing bases at will and batting well over .300.
Ichiros fame was through      the roof. He was the wealthiest and most adored athlete in Japan. His marketing      power was incredible. In fact, he canceled a lucrative deal with Nike to market      his own line of clothingand it quickly became the countrys top     seller. The downside of fame and fortune, however, was beginning to take     its     toll. Privacy became a luxury that Ichiro rarely enjoyed. He could not leave     his apartment without being followed. He could not eat at a restaurant without     a wall of bodyguards between himself and the other diners. He and his girlfriend,     television newswoman Yumiko Fukushima, found it impossible to have a normal     date. When they decided to marry, they flew to Los Angeles under assumed     names     and had the ceremony performed there. They were afraid that a wedding in     Japan would bring the country to a grinding halt.
Perhaps inevitably,        Ichiros      mind was beginning to wander on the ballfield. He still won the batting championship        in 1998, and led the league in hits, but his RBI and stolen base totals        plummeted.     When the Blue Wave failed to reach the postseason for the second year in        a row, Ichiro started thinking more seriously about playing on the other        side     of the Pacific.
Like all Japanese players, Ichiro      was under contract for a minimum of nine seasons. Though his salary was the      richest in Japanese history, he was still counting the days when he could      test his skills against true major leaguers. The Orix Corporation, the large      leasing company that owned the Blue Wave, knew its young star had his heart      set on playing in America. They were willing to let him go, as long as they      were compensated. In 1999, they set in motion a plan that would make Ichiro      and Orix both very wealthy.
That March, the company        sent Ichiro and two other playersNobuyuki Hoshino and Nobuyuki Ebisuon        loan to the Seattle Mariners. Publicly, Orix claimed it was simply a way        to foster     better relations between American and Japanese baseball. But everyone knew       the truth: Ichiro was being marketed to the majors.
Ichiro had a blast during his      stay with the Mariners. He learned a lot about life in the big leagues, got      along with the other Mariners (with the help of an interpreter), and gained      important insights on how he would have to mold his game to succeed in the      majors. Specifically, Ichiro saw that he would have to cut down on his big      leg kick; American hurlers were bigger, faster, and could throw more pitches      for strikes than their Japanese counterparts. Over the next two years he would      gradually shorten his stride.
Ichiro loved the relaxed        atmosphere of the Mariners clubhouse, and was a big fan of American baseballs        shorter practices. He also appreciated the fact that he could walk down        the     street without someone sticking a camera in his face. Deep down, he was convinced        that this was where he belonged. Refreshed and rejuvenated, Ichiro rebounded        with an excellent season in 1999. Though a wrist injury cut his year short        by five weeks, he clubbed 21 homers and captured his sixth consecutive        batting     title.
This set the stage for        the 2000 campaign. After the season, the team would post Ichiro.        This meant that other teams would be invited to submit a sealed bid for        the right to     negotiate with him. The highest bidder would then have 24 hours to reach        a contract agreement. Whether Ichiro stayed or left, Orix would keep the        posting     money, which in his case was likely to run into eight figures.
Ichiro gave Japanese baseball      fans a memorable farewell season. He batted over .400 for the first half,      until a strained rib cage muscle slowed him the rest of the way. He still      ended up with a personal-best .387 average, which was good for a seventh batting      championship.
MAKING        HIS MARK
On November 1, 2000, Orix notified      Hiromori Kawashima, the commissioner of Japanese baseball, that it planned      to post Ichiro. Kawashima then contacted Bud Selig, the Commissioner of Major      League Baseball, to let him know that the bidding process would soon begin.      Ichiro had hired an American agent, Tony Attanasio, to help with what can      be a tricky situation. Attanasio informed interested teams that it would take      more than money to sign his client. Ichiro and Yumiko wanted to live in a      city with a solid Japanese community, and play for a team that had a realistic      shot at winning the World Series.
These requirements scared off          most major-league organizations, leaving the Seattle Mariners, New York          Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Anaheim Angels as the only clubs submitting          bids. On November 9, Seattle was declared the winner with a bid of more          than $13 million. Ichiro was thrilled. A three-year contract worth more          than $14 million (plus an additional $9 million in incentives) was quickly          hammered out, and Ichiro and his wife started packing for Seattle.

The couple arrived in December      and stayed in a hotel while they got their bearings and looked for a place      to live. Ichiro flew down to Arizona in January to get a head start on spring      training. An enormous throng of Japanese reporters was already waiting for      him.
Ichiros principle        concern heading into spring training was to get his timing down at the        plate. For     several weeks he concentrated on staying on top of the ball, and growing        accustomed to the different rhythm of American pitchers. Ichiro was not        driving the ball,     but rather grounding it around the infield. Hits were few and far between        in the early going, which made the Seattle brass a little nervous. Had        the     team committed $27 million to sign a slap hitter? Ichiro remained patient        and started to round into form. Just when word was spreading among pitchers        that the Japanese superstar was a weakling with the bat, he started rocketing       line drives all over the place.
Back in Japan, a whole        new brand of Ichiro-mania was building. Reports from the various newspaper,        magazine,     television and radio correspondents stationed in Arizona kept fans updated        on every miniscule development. Seattles first game of the exhibition      season, a charity event against the San Diego Padres, was televised live in      Japan at five in the morningcreating a not-so-small army of bleary-eyed      factory and office workers that day. For many fans, the 45-plus Mariner games      the government planned to air on Japanese television were not enough. Many      went to travel agencies for special Ichiro Trips to the U.S.     cities where he was scheduled to play.
The Mariners opened           the season against the Oakland As at home in Safeco Field. Seattle           had lost its best player, Alex Rodriguez, to free agency, yet there           was an air         of confidence on the field and in the clubhouse. The Mariners sensed           that they had a special player in their midst, and could hardly wait           to unleash         him on the rest of the league.

The hits kept coming for Ichiro      in May. After putting together early-season hitting streaks of 15 and 23 games,      he was on pace to challenge the all-time mark of 257 hits, set by Hall of      Famer George Sisler in 1920. And the victories kept coming for Seattle; with      each win, the all-time record of 116 seemed less far away.
As the All-Star Game        approached, Ichiro-mania had swept Seattle. Sushi joints were serving        Ichi-rolls and the     seats behind the teams new star were renamed Area 51 after      his number. That the team gave Ichiro the number that had once been worn by      Randy Johnson was no coincidence. Fans were still angry about the trade that      sent him to the National League in 1998as well as the subsequent departures      of Junior Griffey and Alex Rodriguezso this was a great way to show      them that they were bringing in new superstars to replace them.      Meanwhile, the rest of the country was discovering Ichiro. As All-Star balloting      drew to a close, he was announced as the leagues top vote-getter. Ichiro      was the first rookie outfielder since Tony Oliva in 1964 to crack the ALs     starting lineup. Ichiro got a hit in the All-Star Game, which was played     in     Seattle. Ironically, it came against Randy Johnson.
As the Mariners embarked upon          the second half of the season, manager Lou Piniella began to rest his          key players. Ichiro had not had a day off, so when his average began to          slip in July, he was given a breather. Revitalized, Ichiro went on a 21-game          hitting streak that lifted his average into the .350s.

Ichiro was having a great time.      He was playing well, the team was winning, and he adored Seattle. The only      problem was an old and familiar one: The Japanese media was getting out of      control. Despite warnings from the team, they were hounding Ichiro all over      the place. One magazine offered $2 million for a picture of him naked, so      he could no longer dress with the other players in the locker room. Ichiro      and Kaz Sasaki decided they would boycott the Japanese reporters. Without      quotes from their two headline-makers, they suddenly realized their jobs might      be in jeopardy, and things calmed down considerably.
Seattle ended the regular season      with a record of 116-46, and won the division by 14 games. Although several      Mariners had MVP-caliber seasons, Ichiro was unquestionably the engine that      pulled the train. His stats were eye-popping. He won his eighth batting championship      in eight years, led the majors with 75 multi-hit games and 56 steals, and      had the highest average in baseball both with runners in scoring position      (.445) and the bases loaded (.545). He obliterated the all-time record for      hits by a rookie (242), and broke the AL mark for singles (192).
The perfect ending to this record-smashing      season would have been a World Series ring. But baseball rarely works that      way. The Mariners ran into trouble in the playoffs, first against the Indians      and then against the Yankees. Seattle split the opening games of its Division      Series with Cleveland, then got torched in Game 3 by a score of 17-2. One      loss away from elimination, the team pulled together and tied the series on      a clutch, bases-loaded single by Ichiro in the seventh inning of Game 4. The      Mariners pulled out Game 5, 3-1, to move on to the American League Championship      Series. Ichiro, who banged out 12 hits, got his name in the books again with      a record .600 average.
Seattles struggles           continued, however, against pitching-rich New York in the ALCS. The           Mariners dropped         the first two games at home, then went to Yankee Stadium needing at least           two wins to stay alive. They nearly evened the series, but the more           experienced         Yankees were just too tough, and Seattle went down in five games.

After the season came        a cascade of honors and awards for Ichiro. He won a Gold Glove (he made        just one error all year), took Rookie        of the Year      honors, and edged his old Hawaiian League foe, Jason Giambi, for the American      League’s Most Valuable Player award.
On paper, Ichiro’s rookie year ranked among the greatest ever. The        reality of it was arguably far more impressive. Ichiro wasn’t just        learning a new league. He had to acclimate himself to an entirely new        game, new culture, and new language. As always, he had confidence that        his way        was the right way, even when most baseball people (including for a time        his own manager!) thought he would be a mere shadow of what he had been       in Japan.
As expected, the fanfare        and media crush surrounding Ichiro died down somewhat in 2002. This seemed        to be just fine with the Japanese star,          who picked          up right where he left off. At the All-Star break, Ichiro was leading          the AL in hitting with a .358 average. With a winter of video under        their belts,          opposing pitchers had adjusted their approach to Ichiro, but he in turn          had adjusted to them. He was far more selective in 2002, drawing as        many walks by late July as he had during his rookie campaign, and his        on-base          percentage was up significantly. His average continued to climb, at       one point approaching the .400 mark.
Meanwhile, the first-place        Mariners seemed ready for a big stretch run. The team looked similar to        the squad that ran away with the AL West            in 2001. Garcia and Moyer remained the aces of the starting staff,        Sasaki anchored            the bullpen, and Olerud, Boone, and Cameron comprised the heart of        the batting order. Of the new faces in Seattle, Jeff Cirillo, Ruben Sierra,            and Desi       Relaford were the most prominent additions.
The final two months        of 2002 did not play out as planned, however. Once again, Ichiro seemed        to tire in August, but unlike the year before,              he was unable to snap back into form and endured his first prolonged              slump              in the              majors. Enemy hurlers began running fastballs in on his hands, taking away his ability to serve the ball to leftfield. There were a lot              of              lazy flies              to right in August and September, and not enough grounders in the       hole between short and third.
With fewer opportunities        to run the bases, Ichiro’s production sagged.                So too did the Mariners’ fortunes. The team lost its lead in the AL                West, and Seattle fans watched in dismay as the A’s and       Angels knocked them out of the playoff hunt.
Ichiro’s late-season woes were not immediately evident in his numbers.                  Even when he was dragging, he was still a terrific player, ending the year                  with a .321 batting average, 208 hits, 111 runs scored, and 31 steals. All,                  however, were below his rookie numbers. The silver lining was that Ichiro’s                  68 walks more than doubled his 2001 total. He also played in 157 games—proving       his durability over a long season.
The 2003 campaign was        pretty much a mirror image for Ichiro and the Mariners. He started the        year in a slump, but picked                    up the                    pace come                    May. Over                    the next three months Ichiro batted better than .370, scored                    62 runs and stole       21 bases.
Not coincidentally,        Seattle played its best baseball of the year during this stretch. Boone        was putting up MVP-type numbers,                      while                      Randy Wynn,                      one of the new faces on the team, injected more speed into                      the lineup. The former                      Tampa Bay outfielder came over to the Mariners as part of                      an offseason deal that saw manager Lou Piniella leave to        run the                      Devil Rays.                      Bob Melvin was                      hired to replace him, and seemed to push all the right buttons.                      He also got great efforts from Moyer and youngsters Gil        Meche, Ryan Franklin       and Joel Piniero.
But come August, after        spending half the season atop the AL West, Seattle collapsed. Part of        the problem was an injury                        to Sasaki                        that threw the                        bullpen into disarray. But a sluggish finish from Ichiro                        also                        contributed to the                        team’s woes. The Mariners dropped to second behind the A’s,                        then fell from the Wild Card race. Just as in 2002, Ichiro’s final                        stats—including a .312 batting average, 111 runs, eight triples and                        34 steals—looked good on the surface. But his inability                        to sustain his scorching mid-summer tear raised some new       questions about him.
Ichiro altered his        approach in 2004. He knew enough about the U.S. game to see where he could        be most productive,                          and had                          learned enough                          about                          himself as a major leaguer to pace himself through the                          162-game schedule. The compromise                          Ichiro made was to concentrate on hitting hard grounders                          and serving up soft liners, while taking big cuts only                          in certain                          situations.                          This meant                          sacrificing his extra-base hit production, but it would       leave him fresher when the dog days arrived.
Unfortunately for the        Mariners, the dog days started before the All-Star break. Newcomers Scott        Spiezio and                            Rich Aurilia                            did not                            contribute                            as hoped, and reliable veterans like Boone, Olerud        and Edgar Martinez got                            off to sluggish                            starts. Without run support, Moyer, Garcia and Pineiro                            had trouble racking up victories, and the bullpen—now led by free agent Eddie Guardado—rarely                            got to do the job it was paid for. Meanwhile, the Angels, Rangers and A’s                            were all playing winning baseball, leaving little                            for the Mariners to do but win back a little lost       respect.
Early in the year,        Ichiro seemed to be having another typical season. He started slowly but        caught fire                              in May, recording                              a 50-hit month                              to bring                              his average up into the mid .300s. The hits continued                              to come in bunches during July and August, with        a couple of                              five-hit                              games. Hitting close                              to .500 in the second half and rarely walking, Ichiro                              began to close                              in on                              a record that had heretofore been considered unassailable:                              George Sisler’s                              257 hits. He had made a run at the record as a rookie,                              but fell well short. This time, however, it seemed                              less likely Ichiro would wear down in September.                              He was feeling strong and was still locked in at       the plate.
Obviously pleased that        he wasn’t fading down the stretch, Ichiro actually                                loosened up in the clubhouse and truly seemed        to be enjoying the game. He kept rolling singles through the infield,        beating out choppers, and dumping                                hits in front of the outfielders, and as play       entered the final week he passed the 250-hit mark.

As          is typically the case when a time-honored record falls, the critics          started coming out of the woodwork. Ichiro’s detractors pointed          to several instances when he laid down bunts in inappropriate game situations,          and swung at pitches that would have been ball four—all presumably          in his quest to surpass Sisler.
The debate was still          raging when he passed Sisler on the final Friday of the season against          the Texas Rangers in Seattle. With Sisler’s daughter, Frances.          and other family members in attendance, Ichiro chopped a first-inning          single over Hank Blalock’s head for hit number 257. In the third          inning, he grounded a ball up the middle against Ryan Drese for number          258. Ichiro added a third hit later in the game. He finished the season          with 260 hits—including a record 223 singles—and won his          second batting title with a .371 average.
Baseball traditionalists          may attempt to dismiss Ichiro’s hit record because of the context          in which he achieved it—playing for a losing team, eschewing walks,          and concentrating on singles instead of longer hits. It might be worth          reminding his detractors that Sisler faced identical criticism. In an          era when first basemen were beginning to blast balls out of the park,          Sisler stubbornly continued spraying singles.
Perhaps the only          inescapable conclusion that can be drawn from Ichiro’s record-shattering          2004 season is that he has digested everything he can on this level          of baseball and has found a way to do what he likes best: outhit everyone          and win batting titles. A unique player when he arrived in 2001, he          has evolved even further and discovered a remarkable path to success.
It is a success that          raises an interesting question for American baseball—the same          one, in fact, that it did in Japan: Has the traditional way of teaching          and playing baseball brought out the best in its most talented players?          It may take a while before the sport can answer that question, and longer          still until it acknowledges the existence of a new paradigm. But at          the very least, Ichiro has opened baseball’s eyes to the talent          pool on the other side of the sunset, and opened its mind to an ocean     of intriguing new possibilities.
 
 
ICHIRO        THE PLAYER
Ichiro’s quirky        hitting style enables him to time and adjust to almost any pitcher, get        good hard swings, and spray hits        from line to line. An      excellent situational hitter, Ichiro has the power turn on a pitch and drive      it into the seats. More often, he picks a hole and laces the ball through      it. His bunting ability forces infielders to play closer, which means he      can dump hits into shallow left.
While other top hitters        adjust from game to game, he adjusts from pitch to pitch. Depending on        the pitcher, the pitch, and the game situation, Ichiro        can employ one of five distinct swings. In 2004, he became particularly        adept at banging fastballs into the turf with a swing that has him leaning        toward first. On these strokes, he can make it down the line in 3.7 seconds,        forcing infielders to make perfect plays.
Ichiro’s baserunning        is as potent a weapon as his hitting. In fact, it often seems he is taking          his first step toward first base as he swings.          This leads to a ton of infield hits and creates a lot of bobbles and        hurried          throws. On the basepaths, Ichiro is quick and daring. He almost always          has the green light, and will steal on any pitch. This puts catchers        under intense          pressure, which sometimes leads to their calling for fastballs when        off-speed pitches are in order. Obviously this benefits the Mariners hitting        behind          Ichiro in the lineup.
Ichiro’s defense is absolutely sensational. The only reason he plays            right field for Seattle is because Randy Winn is in center. Both have plus            arms, but Ichiro’s is stronger and more accurate, and thus better            suited for right. He made a couple of highlight-reel throws to third early            in the 2001 season, and after that enemy runners stopped challenging his            arm. Ichiro gets as good a jump on fly balls as anyone in the league, and            never seems to take a bad angle. On short hits he charges the ball aggressively            and always comes up ready to throw.
