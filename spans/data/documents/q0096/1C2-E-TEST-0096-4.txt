Getting Here
The TD Garden is located in Boston's Downtown North section on Causeway Street, minutes from the historic North End and Faneuil Hall. Ticketed patrons should enter the TD Garden through the North Station terminal, on Nashua Street or on Legends Way.
If you are driving to the TD Garden, keep in mind that typical backups on local streets begin about one hour before the scheduled game or event. Traffic delays are especially common in the following locations: Leverett Circle, Storrow Drive East, Martha Road, and Causeway Street.
