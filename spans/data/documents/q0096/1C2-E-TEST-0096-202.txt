Redesigned to eliminate the pole seats in the old Boston Garden this facility lacks the charm and fan experience that the garden provided.  The nosebleed seats are not worth the price.

The TD BankNorth Garden (previously the Fleet Center and the Boston Garden before that) offers a fair fan experience.  The seats range from excellent to poor (for nosebleed seats).  For Hockey, you may be better off watching on TV than sitting in the top section.

The TD Banknorth "Garden" is the newer replacement to the old Boston Garden. It offers nicer amenities than its predecessor, but I have to admit I miss the old grungy Garden, it just had a magic that is missing in the new one.

No matter how beautiful this building is, I miss the old Boston Garden!  There was nothing like watching a Bruins game in the old Garden.  You were crammed in like sardines, but loved every minute of it.  The TD BankNorth Garden is great though.  Nice seats, good lines of vision.  The laser lights that they use are very hi tech, and of course the old Garden never had anything so fancy. The sports museum here is a must see.
