TD Banknorth Garden Parking, Boston Bruins Parking Information and Tips
Traffic is a major headache in Boston so allow enough time as backups are frequent. Parking is also a chore here, little free street parking and most ramps and the garage under the arena charge anywhere from $18-$25 for event parking. Surface lots are few and far between.  Another option is to leave your car at a park and ride lot, and take the subway or the commuter train, known here as the "T". Either way make sure you have a plan before heading out.
