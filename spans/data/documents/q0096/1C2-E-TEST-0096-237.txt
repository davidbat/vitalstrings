I think I have to give up and go to work.  I believe there's a radio presale on the 8th before the general sale on the 9th.  So folks can look into that.  Register for the e-mail blasts of the stations that play them.

I never got the email. Went to http://theblackkeys.artistarena.com and kept hitting refresh until I got in. Username: elcamino and password: tickets and was able to get tix to the Boston show. Pre-sale for Boston is sold out now however.

I got my e-mail around 10:45 for some reason and it was too late by then - pre-sale already sold out.  The Ticketmaster site says there is another presale on 12/8, but I can't find any info. about it.  Anyone know anything?  I thought perhaps WFNX would have a pre-sale code or something, but nothing mentioned in today's e-file.
