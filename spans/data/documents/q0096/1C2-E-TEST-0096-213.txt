How is the sports deck at TD Banknorth Garden?
I want to buy Celtics-Cavs tickets for my boyfriend (he's form Cleveland but we're both in school/working in Boston). I can afford to get us tickets to the sports deck which is like a bar area where seating is first come first serve and the rest is standing room only. But I wanted to get some input from other sports fans first...has anyone ever been to the sports deck at the Banknorth Garden? It looks pretty cool on the website but the seats are high up and I want to make sure it's worth the price.
