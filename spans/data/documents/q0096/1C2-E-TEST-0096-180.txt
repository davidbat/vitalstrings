Mr Garden Welcome to the most stressful gardening work. I'm an angry gardener and your goal is to cut the flowers in the order I ask. My flowers grow unless they're cut and they change colour each growth. Use the left mouse button to cut them. Do it before I get angry! Careful with a flashing yellow line for if you cut the last flower, 5 new will grow there. That will be your chance! Cutting the shining yellow seed will help you proceed!
