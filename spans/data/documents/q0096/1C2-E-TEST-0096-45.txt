For a big hockey arena the sound here isn't bad. I try not to sit up in the balcony, I think that Lodge 6,7,8,and 9 are the best sections for an end stage show at this building. If you can get floor seats right up front for your favorite band, I'd do it, but I think the sound is best in those lodge sections about 150-200 feet away from the stage. When you're to close, or off to the sides the sound isn't very clear.
