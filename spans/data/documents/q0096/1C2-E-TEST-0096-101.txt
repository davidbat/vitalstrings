Sports Museum
The Sports Museum is located on the 5th and 6th floors of the TD Garden . The museum is actually part of the Garden—corporate suites are located on these levels—which  is fairly unique. Sports Museum visitors can walk around on two horseshoe shaped floors, and the exhibits are in the hallways and corners of the building.  A nice feature about the museum is you can sit down in certain areas inside the arena, rest for a few minutes, and then view more artifacts.
The major exhibit areas of the museum are organized by sport:  Hockey (Boston Bruins, Hartford Whalers, Olympics), Basketball  (Celtics), Football (New England Patriots), and Baseball (Red Sox). The concourse gallery  contains artifacts about Boxing, Rugby, Soccer, and the Boston Marathon. The exhibits are not limited to professional sports, there are also items from  high school to farm league teams.
There are life-size statues of Carl Yastrzemski, Bobby Orr, Larry Bird, and Harry Agganis. There is an Old Boston Garden hockey penalty box  one can sit in, and an open theater with Old Garden seats. There are thousands of items in the museum, and sports history fans could spend many  hours viewing them. An obscure feature of the museum is that visitors may see aspiring amateur athletes within the museum; inspired by  the Garden and dreaming about the future.
Boston is rich in sports history. The Sports Museum of New England is a great place to visit and experience some of this history.
