Madonna TD Garden Concert Ticket Information
The seating arrangements for TD Garden concerts are significantly different than sporting events. We invite you to look over the following information before you purchase Madonna tickets for the concert on September 4, 2012.
TD Garden Concert Seating Guide
Floor - Fans purchasing TD Garden floor concert tickets should note that the floor level may be divided into different sections. Typically, the TD Garden Floor sections run A-G, but the seating arrangement will be contingent on how the stage is set up.
Loge - (Sections 1-22) - Fans interested in seats on the Loge Level directly to right and left of the stage should examine our selection of TD Garden Loge concert tickets in Sections 14 & 21.
Balcony - (Sections 301-330) - The second tier of seating at the TD Garden allows concert goers to see music's top acts in concert for a low price. Sections 318 and 329 located on either side of the stage are often the most popular seating sections in the Balcony.
