The TD Garden (formerly the Fleet Center) might not have the character of the original Boston Garden, which operated from 1928 to 1995, but the new Garden has amenities and comfort that the old facility couldn’t match. The TD Garden is home to the Boston Bruins of the NHL and Boston Celtics of the NBA as well as world-class concerts and entertainment events.
