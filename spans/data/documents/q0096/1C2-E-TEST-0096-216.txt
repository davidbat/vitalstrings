Porter's on Portland Street has good burgers and such. Right up Commercial on the edge of the North End, there's the Waterfront Cafe, which has surprisingly excellent pizza and pub grub. I second Anthem for upscale comfort food (kids will LOVE the meatloaf on Texas Toast). NEBO, also on the edge of the North End (North Washington) is also kid-friendly and has pretty good pizza in addition to some other nice Italian specialties. Antico Forno on Salem Street in the North End is an all-time fav.

I second the NEBO recommendation - good menu, never usually super crowded, fine for kids but good for adults too - good drink list etc.

A better sports-oriented place is The Fours on Canal right near Causeway. I used to see Red Auerbach and the Celtics brass in there all the time. This is a real Boston hang-out.
