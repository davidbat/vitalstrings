[ edit ] Name
The FleetCenter was renamed TD Banknorth Garden on Thursday, March 3, 2005 and thus this article shall be redirected to a new namespace.

Hurrah! The Gahden's back! -- Saint-Paddy 19:44, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC) I'm going to add a temporary logo I cropped off fleetcenter.com
What's the deal with [1] ? Obviously all but TD Banknorth are temporary one-day things, but should this be mentioned in the article? -- SPUI ( talk ) 17:30, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
And the article should probably be moved back to FleetCenter , as that's the last stable name it had. -- Cyrius | ✎ 17:32, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Nah, looks like this one is permanent - [2] "Despite Thursday's announcement that TD Banknorth agreed to a 20-year, $150 million naming-rights pact, the Celtics' home arena will be called the FleetCenter until July 1. New exterior and in-arena signage for the TD Banknorth Garden is expected to be completed late this year. . . . " -- SPUI ( talk ) 17:37, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
The succession of one-day names is already mentioned in the article, having been included when the eBay auction of one-day naming rights was announced. The link you give, however, provides the one-day names chosen by the auction winners, so I'll add that link. JamesMLane 19:24, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I was a little confused by the page at the actual "FleetCenter" site. Corporations don't seem very interested in clarity. -- Cyrius | ✎ 01:38, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Wasn't it called the Shawmut Center before being named the Fleet Center? Shawmut was a bank that merged with Fleet in the 90s.
Is there a reason that Center is usually (but not always) spelled Centre in this article?

I think someone has been trying to standardize the article to international English, per Wikipedia standards, but that shouldn't apply here, seeing as the FleetCenter is a proper noun.
I have changed all references to the incorrect proper noun of "Centre" to the proper spelling "Center." -- Assawyer 18:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
Per Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English any generic uses should be "center" being as the subject is in Boston, Mass, USA. ccwaters 20:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
[ edit ] stole a redirect page
Fleet Center used to redirect here. I've turned that page into a disambig showing this page and 50 Kennedy Plaza in Providence. If anyone thinks one is far more appropriate than the other, we could always throw up a "This page is about X, for the building Y, see _____" at the top of the more used page to avoid the disambig. Any thoughts? -- Loodog 04:42, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
[ edit ] Image in stadium infobox
I personally think that the image of the stadium in the article's infobox is very amateur, as it seems someone took the picture from the inside of their moving car as it was raining. I think the article deserves a much better picture than that.
[ edit ] Construction period
This article says the Fleet Center opened on September 30, 1995, and Boston Garden says the last event there was on September 28, 1995. What exactly did this two-day "rebuilding" involve? Or is this incorrect? -- Beland 00:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
I'm not sure what the question is. ccwaters 13:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
I think I know what he's asking. The Fleet Center was built what seemed like inches from the old Garden. Then, a short time later, the Garden was torn down and became the Fleet Center parking lot. So, it might've taken two days for the games to switch venues, but both buildings were co-existant on virtually the same spot CSZero 14:25, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
So he's asking why neither venue had an event scheduled on sept 29? Venues don't have things going on everyday http://www.tdbanknorthgarden.com/calendar_m.asp ccwaters 15:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
I think he means, and maybe the article should mention, that it's not like the Garden was torn down and the Fleet Center was built in its place, which is obviously an impossible task in two days, but one was built right next to the other. CSZero 16:29, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
[ edit ] North End?
The arena is not in the North End section of Boston. If it is preferable to describe the location in a neighborhood, it would be better placed in the West End. It's really in between the two, directly above the Bulfinch Triangle. Inputting the former Boston Garden address of 150 Causeway Street on the City of Boston's site [3] (TD's listed address of 100 Legends Way doesn't work) it lists the address in the West End. TD's site [4] lists the arena in the Downtown North section, which I don't believe is a formally recognized section. -- 63.215.27.57 18:12, 18 June 2007 (UTC) Steve
Agreed and changed, although West End is probably not a term known to too many people, especially those outside of the city. Might as well give the directions in yards from Scollay Square :-) CSZero 18:16, 18 June 2007 (UTC)
Thanks .... looking back at the edit history, it appears the North End/West End description has been changed a few times (November 15, 2005, May 1, 2006) ...hoping it stays with it's correct neighborhood from here on out. -- 63.215.27.57 19:23, 18 June 2007 (UTC) Steve
[ edit ] Not "The Vault"
As noted in my edit- I've never heard anyone refer to it as "the vault", and even searching with suggestive/favorable google searches like: "the vault" garden boston
...I found nothing supporting.
The Vault was the name of a group of Boston power-brokers and moguls who met in a large bank vault in downtown (financial area) Boston to coordinate their influences on the city.
If you're going to reinstate the references to "the vault", back it up with some supporting citations, please. Otherwise, you'll just confuse people...
