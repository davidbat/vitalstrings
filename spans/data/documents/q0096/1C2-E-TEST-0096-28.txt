Wish parking & signage were better!. Attended the 1/13/06 Rolling Stones concert, driving there from Troy, NY.  The Garden website gave directions to take Storrow Drive exit off I-93.  I did, & was met with construction & detours...and NO signs pointing towards the Garden.  I drove around the area blindly.  Why no signs for the Garden?  I actually was alongside it & didn't know it, until I saw the sign "Causeway St." Several drivers honked & made rude gestures at me because I couldn't tell where to go.
Used underground parking...$23 was stiff...we needed a handicapped spot, & I think the Garden should offer handicapped parking for a lower rate, or the City should offer some free handicapped spots on the street.  Isn't it mandatory for public buildings to have accessible handicapped parking?
Otherwise, the facility itself was very impressive, seats comfortable, bathrooms clean, concessions plentiful & varied.  One of the best venues I'v ever visited!â€¦
