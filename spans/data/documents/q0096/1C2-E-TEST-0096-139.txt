About Boston
The city where Americans first fought the British and declared independence, Boston offers more than just colonial history. With shopping on Newbury Street, dining in Cambridge, and partying on Lansdowne Street, Boston never lets it Puritan background stop its denizens from having fun.
While chain stores infiltrate NYC, Boston welcomes a growing class of entrepreneurs following the likes of successful boutique mainstays like Louis Boston, Jasmine Sola, and E6 Apothecary. The recent arrival of Boston Common and Daily Candy are proof that shopping and entertainment options are only growing.
Back Bay is the center of Boston proper, Newbury Street is its hub for people watching, shopping, and dining. During the summer, you'll find wealthy Boston University students lunching at outdoor tables at Armani Caf√©, yuppies showing off their latest Burberry finds at Stephanie's on Newbury, and trendy hopefuls sipping martinis at Sonsie.
During the day, big spenders and window shoppers flock to Louis Boston, the renowned multi-floor mainstay that houses home accessories, obscure beauty products, designer clothes, a spa, and offers valet. Designer shops along the main drag include Marc Jacobs, Oilily, and Vera Wang, while local boutiques include Jasmine Sola, In the Pink, and Mudo.
