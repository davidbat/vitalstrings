The TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, is home to the Boston Celtics, the Boston Bruins, and the annual Beanpot Hockey Tournament.  Nick Garner of www.SportsTalk4Kids.com visited the TD Garden and the Boston Sports Museum, which is in the Garden's lobby.  The museum exhibits show all the highlights of the Celtics, Bruins, the New England Patriots, the Red Sox, the Beanpot, the Boston Marathon, the New England Revolution soccer team, and other historic sporting events in the Boston area.  Famous athletes are featured, including Larry Bird, Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Bobby Orr, Milt Schmidt, Tom Brady, Drew Bledsoe, Jim Craig, Bill Rodgers, Joan Benoit Samuelson, and Red Auerbach.  The museum was inexpensive and fun, and Nick got to even shoot a few baskets on the TD Garden court.
