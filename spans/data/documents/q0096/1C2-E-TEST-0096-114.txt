Boston - TD Banknorth Garden
TD Banknorth Garden, named after its sponsor, TD Banknorth, and is often called simply the Garden, or the traditional Boston Garden, is the home arena for NHL's Boston Bruins, and NBA's Boston Celtics. When opened on September 30, 1995 to replace the aging Boston Garden the arena was called FleetCenter.  During the construction phase, the naming rights were sold to a major Boston-based regional bank, the Shawmut Bank.  However, just as the Shawmut Center was being completed, Shawmut merged with its somewhat larger rival, the Providence-based Fleet Bank.  Shortly before the new arena opened, every seat, which had been stamped with the Shawmut logo, had to be replaced. Also, the entire color scheme for the interior had to be adjusted.  On March 3, 2005, Maine-based TD Banknorth, the U.S. subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank, announced its purchase of the naming rights after FleetBoston's merger with Bank of America.  It was officially named the TD Banknorth Garden on July 1, 2005.
It is site of the annual Beanpot, and hosts the annual Hockey East Championships. It has also hosted many major national sporting events including NCAA basketball, figure skating, gymnastics and WWE wrestling.  Like most sports arenas, it also hosts other events like concerts, conventions, graduations, circuses, and most notably the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
Just as the Boston Garden was, The TD Banknorth Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station.  Connections to the Orange Line and Green Line are at the eastern entrance. The Green Line formerly ran on an elevated train in front of the building: however, a Green Line tunnel was completed in 2004 and the elevated rail was demolished.
