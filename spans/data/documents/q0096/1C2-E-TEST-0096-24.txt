Boston Celtics (NBA) (1995â€“present)
TD Garden is a sports arena in Boston, MA  which is currently home to the Boston Celtics of the NBA
On September 29 , 1995, the old Boston Garden closed its doors to the public for the last time with a nostalgic evening of entertainment. The following night, a spectacular gala was held at the sparkling new FleetCenter to usher in a new era for sports and entertainment in New England.
On March 3 , 2005, the FleetCenter era came to an end when TD Banknorth Inc. and Delaware North Companies reached an agreement on a 20-year deal to return the Garden name. Under the agreement, "TD Banknorth Garden" became the official name of the 19,600-seat, state-of-the-art facility through 2025.
With many of the historical reminders from the old structure having now been moved next door, the tradition of building memories begins again.
