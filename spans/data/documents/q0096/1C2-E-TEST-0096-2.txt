[ edit ] Construction
Planners drew up designs for a new arena in the early 1990s after years of pressure on the owners of the Boston Bruins hockey club to replace the aging Boston Garden , which had been considered inadequate as a major league sports facility for many years. Plans for the new stadium stated that it would be slightly north of the old facility. The term "slightly north" ended up meaning that there was only nine inches (23 cm) of space between the two buildings when construction was completed. [6] The site for the new stadium occupied 3.2 acres (13,000 m2). It eventually cost $160 million. Ground was broken on April 29, 1993. In 27 months, quick by today's standards, the stadium was built. That included seven weeks of delay caused by heavy snowfall. [6] The Shawmut Center opened on September 30, 1995.
[ edit ] Naming
When constructed to replace the aging Boston Garden as the home of the Boston Celtics basketball team and the Boston Bruins hockey team, the arena was called the FleetCenter. The arena opened on September 30, 1995.
During the construction phase, the naming rights to the "New Garden" were sold to a major Boston-based regional bank, Shawmut Bank . However, just as the Shawmut Center was being completed, Shawmut merged with its somewhat larger rival, the Providence-based Fleet Bank. The merger was negotiated in secret while Shawmut and Fleet's marketing departments were simultaneously engaged in a spirited bidding war for the arena's naming rights. The post-merger bank had effectively been bidding against itself. The bank which won the competition for the "New Garden's" naming rights, Shawmut, was the bank whose name disappeared during the merger. Shortly before the new arena opened, every seat, which had been stamped with the Shawmut logo, had to be replaced. Also, the entire color scheme for the interior had to be adjusted.

The name of the arena was expected to change as a result of the April 1, 2004 merger of FleetBoston Financial with Bank of America . On January 5, 2005, FleetCenter's owner, Delaware North Companies , announced an agreement under which the bank made a payment to be released from the remaining six years on the naming rights agreement. The agreement left Delaware North free to sell the naming rights to another sponsor. On March 3, 2005, Maine-based TD Banknorth , a U.S. subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank , announced its purchase of the naming rights for $6 million per year. [7] The first major event after the announcement was the 2005 Hockey East men's tournament. The company named the facility "TD Banknorth Garden" in honor of the original Boston Garden. The name officially became the TD Banknorth Garden on July 1, 2005. Prior to that date, it went under the name "YourGarden."
In early 2005, while still searching for a long-term corporate sponsor, the FleetCenter conducted auctions on eBay to sell one-day naming rights. From February 10 to March 13, the FleetCenter sold the naming rights 30 different times on eBay. The net proceeds of $150,633.22 generated during the auction was donated to charities in the Greater Boston area, and $40,000 worth of My Grandma's Coffee Cakes was donated to local food banks. The FleetCenter also made private arrangements with a few companies for one-day naming rights, and offered one day's rights in an employee raffle .

During the name auction, only twice were names reported to be rejected. Kerry Konrad, a New York City lawyer and Yankees fan, won naming rights for March 1 with a bid of $2300. He proposed the name "Derek Jeter Center," after the New York Yankees shortstop , a stab at fellow Harvard College alum and Boston Red Sox fan Jerry Rappaport, Jr., with whom he had a 25 year-old rivalry. Being in the heart of Red Sox Nation , the name did not sit well with the executives and was rejected. An agreement was reached in which Rappaport added $6300 for a total bid of $8600, representing the 86 years of the Curse of the Bambino , and named the arena "New Boston Garden, Home of The Jimmy Fund Champions." Fark.com founder Drew Curtis held a contest on his website to name the arena after he bought single-day rights. A user vote resulted in the "Fark.com UFIA Center" coming on top, but the name was rejected due to its inappropriate meaning. The name eventually selected by Curtis and company was " Boston Garden ".
Including its present name, the TD Garden has had 33 different names.
Celtics players dubbed it "The Jungle" during the team's 2002 playoff run.
In April 2008, TD Banknorth became TD Bank , after a merger with Commerce Bancorp , a New Jersey–based bank. Owner Delaware North Companies announced on April 15, 2009, that the building would be renamed TD Garden in July 2009. [8] [9]
[ edit ] Renovations
Before the 2006–07 season, the TD Garden underwent a major overhaul, installing a new HD entertainment board. For basketball, video advertising panels (installed by the NCAA for the 2006 Women's Final Four) replaced the traditional scrolling panels, and added a see-through shot clock, joining the FedExForum , Wachovia Center , Philips Arena , US Airways Center , United Center , Quicken Loans Arena , and the Time Warner Cable Arena . In addition, for hockey, a vintage siren , just as the original Boston Garden had used was added to replace the end-of-period horn, although the latter is still used for basketball.

TD Garden is one of two NBA arenas (along with Amway Center , home of the Orlando Magic ) with parquet floors. The Celtics are best known for the tradition of the parquet floor, originally built after World War II because of cost and the scarcity of lumber in that time. However, a traditional floor was used in the 2006 NCAA Women's Final Four and the 2009 NCAA Men's East Regional (NCAA rules require a special NCAA-specification floor be used for all tournament games). When the 2012 NCAA Men's East Regional was held at TD Garden, a lighter-shaded parquet floor was used, with the same NCAA-specific design.

2005 Hockey East Tournament
Just as the Boston Garden was, the TD Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station , a major transportation hub. The Commuter Rail waiting area becomes crowded during events due to this design: the fans shared a relatively small area with commuters and several fast food concessions. (There is a concourse on the second floor which is about the same size as the former main ground floor concourse, but this is utilized only as an entryway for the arena.) Work finished on the expanded North Station concourse in early 2007. A new, larger, railway concourse gives railway passengers a waiting area which does not interfere with patrons entering or leaving the Garden.
Connections to the Orange Line and Green Line are near the eastern entrance to the Garden. The Green Line formerly ran on an elevated train in front of the building: however, a Green Line tunnel was completed in 2004. (The original plan was to tear down the rail tracks before the 2004 Democratic National Convention , but in the end the tracks were purposely left up through the convention, to serve as a platform for security forces.) The elevated rail has since been demolished.
