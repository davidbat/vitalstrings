TD Banknorth Garden Tickets
Often, fans of the NBA's Boston Celtics call their home arena simply "the Garden." That is probably because TD Banknorth Garden in Boston has an unusual naming history. Formerly known as the FleetCenter, the arena was searching for a long-term corporate sponsor in 2005. The arena sold one-day naming rights online for a month giving 30 different names to the home of the Boston Celtics and the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). The name auction raised more than $150,000 for charity and another $40,000 of food donations to local food banks. TD Banknorth Inc. ended the naming ritual with its $7.5 million per year naming agreement. The agreement is one of the most expensive naming rights deals to date, but $150 million doesn't buy the top price spot. Atlanta's Philips Arena receives $9.3 million annually. TD Banknorth Garden became the new name July 1, 2005. It was named after its new sponsor and the Boston Garden, the historical arena it replaced. TD Banknorth Garden houses many historic artifacts from its predecessor. Prior to 1997, TD Banknorth Garden was also home to the Boston Blazers lacrosse team.
TD Banknorth Garden opened in 1995 with a 19,580 maximum seating capacity. It can seat 18,854 for basketball when the 16-time NBA Champion Boston Celtics take to the court. Hockey seating capacity is 17,565. TD Banknorth Garden cost $160 million to build. It has 104 executive suites, 2,442 club seats, and 135 ledge seats.

It hosted the 2004 and 1998 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship, the 2001 US Figure Skating Championships, and the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.
