Jason Snell - A syncing ship
By iTunes has become a bloated, unwieldy mess, and Apple needs to fix it, writes Jason Snell

These days, iTunes is simultaneously Apple’s most important and most problematic product. It’s a music and video player. It’s a store where you buy music, videos, ringtones and apps. And it’s a syncing system, connecting the Mac to a range of Apple devices, from the iPad, iPhone and iPod to the Apple TV.
