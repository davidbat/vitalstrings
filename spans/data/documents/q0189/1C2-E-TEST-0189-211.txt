Welcome to the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests
 
 
The George Washington and Jefferson National Forests stretch along the ruggedly beautiful Appalachian Mountains, extending from one end of Virginia to the other and even crossing into parts of West Virginia and Kentucky.  Whether you are driving a back-country road, enjoying our glorious fall colors, using binoculars to spot colorful neo-tropical birds, or savoring the peacefulness of wilderness, remember that national forests are special places.
