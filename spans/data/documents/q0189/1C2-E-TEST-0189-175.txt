2xv3xcg [mnpointz]       Head: Building a Business Plan That Works By Tim Berry In the United States business market, there is a certain standardization about business plans. You can find dozens of books on the subject, about as many websites, two or three serious software products, and courses in hundreds of business schools, night schools, and community colleges. Although there are many variations on the theme, a lot of it is standard.  What is a Business Plan? A business plan is any plan that works for a business to look ahead, allocate resources, focus on key points, and prepare for problems and opportunities. Business existed long before computers, spreadsheets, and detailed projections. So did business plans.  Unfortunately, people think of business plans first for starting a new business or applying for business loans. They are also vital for running a business, whether or not the business needs new loans or new investments. Businesses need plans to optimize growth and development according to plans and priorities.  What is a Start-up Plan? A very simple start-up plan is a bare-bones plan that includes a summary, mission statement, keys to success, market analysis, start-up costs and funding, and break-even analysis. This kind of plan is good for deciding whether or not to proceed with an idea or venture, to tell if there is a business worth pursuing; but it is not enough to run a business with.   Is There a Standard Business Plan? A normal business plan, that follows the advice of business experts, includes a standard set of elements. Plan formats and outlines vary, but generally, a plan will include standard components such as descriptions of company, product or service, market forecasts, management team, and financial analysis.  Your plan depends on your specific situation. If you're developing a plan for internal use only, not for sending out to banks or investors, you may not need to include all the background details that you already know. Description of the management team is very important for investors, while financial history is most important for banks. Make your plan match its business purpose.  What is Most Important in a Plan? What's most important in a plan? It depends on the case, but usually it's the cash flow analysis and specific implementation details. • Cash flow because it is both vital to a company and hard to follow. Cash is usually misunderstood as profits, and they are different. Profits don't guarantee cash in the bank. Lots of profitable companies go under because of lack of cash. It just isn't intuitive. • Implementation details because that's what makes things happen. Your brilliant strategies and beautifully formatted planning documents are just theory unless you assign responsibilities, with dates and budgets, and then regularly and consistently follow up and track results. Business plans are really about getting results, improving your company.  Can you Suggest a Standard Outline? There are predictable contents of a standard business plan. For example, a business plan normally starts with an Executive Summary, which should be short and interesting. People almost always expect to see sections covering the Company, the Market, the Product, the Management Team, Strategy, Implementation and Financial Analysis.  If you have the main components, the order doesn't matter that much, but here's the order I suggest. 1. Executive Summary: Write this last. It's just a page or two of highlights. 2. Company Description: Legal establishment, history, start-up plans, etc. 3. Product or Service: Describe what you're selling. Focus on customer benefits. 4. Market Analysis: You need to know your market, customer needs, where they are, how to reach them, etc. 5. Strategy and Implementation: Be specific. Include management responsibilities with dates and budgets. Make sure you can track results. 6. Management Team: Describe the organization and the key management team members. 7. Financial Analysis: Make sure to include at the very least your projected Profit and Loss and Cash Flow tables.  I don't recommend developing the plan in the same order you present it as a finished document. For example, although the Executive Summary comes as the first section of a business plan, I recommend writing it after everything else is done. It will appear first, but you write it last.   Form Follows Function  Make the contents of your plan match your purpose and adjust the outline to match your type of plan. For example, if you are developing an internal plan for company use, you don't need to include a section about the company. If your plan focuses on well-known existing products or services and is intended for internal use only, you may not even need to include the details about the products.  Another example that comes up frequently is the level of detail required in your market analysis. Business plans looking for investors need to have some convincing market data, but a plan for a small local business, to be used mainly by a small group of people close to the company, may not need as much research. Is there an opportunity to improve the company and the plan by learning more about the market? Then do it. If not, it may be overkill.   Market  The market segmentation concept is crucial to market assessment and market strategy. Divide the market into workable market segments—age, income, product type, geography, buying patterns, customer needs, or other classifications. Define your terms, and define your market.  Segmentation can make a huge difference in understanding your market. For example, when a local computer store business defines "high-end home office" and "high-technology small business" as its customer segments, its segmentation says a lot about its customers. The segmentation helps the company plan focus on the different types of potential customers.   In today's business it's easy to see segmentation in action. Consider the different tone, content, and media for ads that sell products to kids, compared to those that sell the same product to parents. Car companies change their advertising substantially from one type of program to another. Stand-up comedian Richard Klein used to joke about the beer company ads that changed the style of the music to match the audience. He complained that he kept getting the country music version, but he liked the blues version better. The company that did those ads used the styles of music to address different target customer groups.  In developing segmentation, consider what factors make a difference in the purchasing, media, and value patterns of your target groups. Does age matter in choice of restaurants, or is style and food preference more important? Is income level a key factor? Education? I suspect some restaurants will sell more meals to college graduates than others. Is this because of education, age, or income levels?  After you find out about your market for a business plan, you also want to communicate that knowledge to the readers of your plan. Keep your explanations clear and concise. The depth of detail in market analysis will depend a lot on the type of plan. You may not need to provide a complete market study in a plan developed for internal use, when all of your team knows the market well. Maybe you'll just cite the type of customers you attract, and the part of town you serve. The market analysis section in a business plan is the section that is most likely to require research for information from outside your business, while most others require thinking and analysis of factors within your business.  This is a good point to add a word of caution about the level of detail required. Remember that planning is about making good decisions, applying focus and enforcing priorities. A business plan doesn't have to include a market analysis suitable for a Ph.D. candidate in market research. Planning is not about testing your knowledge. If you are looking for investment, then you may have to use this section to display your wisdom and understanding of your industry, but don't overdo it. If you are planning an internal plan and have no audience other than your own team, I recommend enough market research to make sure you're not missing key points.  As you deal with segmentation, you should also introduce the strategy behind it and your choice of target markets. Explain why your business is focusing on these specific target market groups. What makes these groups more interesting than the other groups that you've ruled out? Why are the characteristics you specify important? This is more important for some businesses than others. A clothing boutique, for example, might focus on one set of upper-income customers instead of another, for strategic reasons. An office equipment store might focus on certain business types whose needs match the firm's expertise. Some fast-food restaurants focus on families with children under driving age. Strategy is focus; it is creative and it doesn't follow pre-written formulas.  Look to market trends as a way to get ahead of the market, to know where it is going before it gets there. You should also understand and explain market growth in each segment. Ideally you cite experts, a market expert, market research firm, trade association, or credible journalist.    Strategy is Focus Think of strategy as focus. Of the whole range of possible market segments and the whole range of services and possible sales and marketing activities, which are your main priorities? Avoid making long lists of priorities. More than three or four points makes them more like a laundry list or to-do list than a strategic focus.   Imagine a pyramid made of three levels. The top of the pyramid is a single box, which contains a strategy. Strategy is an area of resource focus. In the middle level, you have three or so boxes which contain tactics. In the third level, you have four to six boxes that stand for programs.   Your definitions don't have to be exact. A strategy is a main focus, which might be on a specific target market, product opportunity, positioning statement, or some other important or fundamental element.  Tactics are there to implement strategies. For example, if a computer store's strategy is to build long-term relationships with business customers, its tactics might include increasing networking, training, and support.  Programs are specific business activities, each of which has concrete dates and responsibilities, and probably a budget. In the computer store example, programs for the strategy might include upgrade mailings, seminars, installation services, network training and others, each of which is built on specifics.  The Value Proposition  Value-based marketing is another conceptual framework. Like the pyramid described above, it doesn't have to be in your business plan at all, but we include it because some people find that the framework helps them develop their strategy. Obviously, this has to be a quick treatment. There are textbooks written about value-based marketing, and the business literature on this topic is rich and varied.  This framework begins with defining your business offering as a value proposition. The value proposition is benefit offered minus price charged, in relative terms. The definition encourages you to think in broad conceptual terms, with emphasis on the real benefit offered, rather than the specific tangible. For example, a national fast-food chain probably offers the value of convenience and reliability, probably at a slight price premium (at least when compared to the weaker chains). A prestigious local restaurant, on the other hand, is offering a completely different set of benefits (luxury, elegance, and prestige, for example) at a marked price premium. A graphic designer is probably selling benefits related to communication and advertising, not just drawings. Once you have a value proposition defined, look at your business—and your business plan—in terms of how you: Communicate the business proposition, and Fulfill your promise.

His book, Hurdle: the Book on Business Planning is a step-by-step guide to practical business planning.      ************************* Sidebar ************************* Eight Common Business Plan Mistakes  While including the necessary items in a business plan is important, you also want to make sure you don’t commit any of the following common business plan mistakes:   1. Putting it off.  Too many businesses make business plans only when they have no choice in the matter. Unless the bank or the investors want a plan, there is no plan.  Don't wait to write your plan until you think you’ll have enough time. "I can't plan. I'm too busy getting things done," business people say. The busier you are, the more you need to plan. If you are always putting out fires, you should build firebreaks or a sprinkler system. You can lose the whole forest for paying too much attention to the individual burning trees.   2. Cash flow casualness.  Most people think in terms of profits instead of cash. When you imagine a new business, you think of what it would cost to make the product, what you could sell it for, and what the profits per unit might be. We are trained to think of business as sales minus costs and expenses, which equal profits. Unfortunately, we don’t spend the profits in a business. We spend cash. So understanding cash flow is critical. If you have only one table in your business plan, make it the cash flow table.   3. Idea inflation.  Don't overestimate the importance of the idea. You don't need a great idea to start a business; you need time, money, perseverance, and common sense. Few successful businesses are based entirely on new ideas. A new idea is harder to sell than an existing one, because people don't understand a new idea and they are often unsure if it will work. Plans don't sell new business ideas to investors. People do. Investors invest in people, not ideas. The plan, though necessary, is only a way to present information.  4. Fear and dread.  Doing a business plan isn't as hard as you might think. You don't have to write a doctoral thesis or a novel. There are good books to help, many advisors among the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), business schools, and there is software available to help you (such as Business Plan Pro, and others).   5. Spongy, vague goals.  Leave out the vague and the meaningless babble of business phrases (such as “being the best”) because they are simply hype. Remember that the objective of a plan is its results, and for results you need tracking, you need specific dates, management responsibilities, budgets, and milestones. Then you can follow up. No matter how well thought out or brilliantly presented, it means nothing unless it produces results.   6. One size fits all.  Tailor your plan to its real business purpose. Business plans can be different things: they are often just sales documents to sell an idea for a new business. They can also be detailed action plans, financial plans, marketing plans, and even personnel plans. They can be used to start a business, or just run a business better.   7. Diluted priorities.  Remember, strategy is focus. A priority list with 3-4 items is focus. A priority list with 20 items is certainly not strategic, and rarely if ever effective. The more items on the list, the less the importance of each.   8. Hockey-stick shaped growth projections.  Sales grow slowly at first, but then shoot up boldly with huge growth rates, as soon as 'something' happens. Instead, it’s better to have projections that are conservative so you can defend them. When in doubt, be less optimistic.            Head: Chatting with Vito Ceniti of DemoDemo   Interview by THS staff  DemoDemo was launched in Sept. 2002 and is the pioneer and market leader in Flash tutorials for the hosting industry. Vito Ceniti, president, discusses his company’s ongoing success and new plans.  THS: How did the idea of Online Hosting Tutorials come together?   VC: As a Web host, I noticed that many support requests that I received from my clients related to basic questions regarding routine tasks such as setting up email, creating auto responders and databases. These are all questions that most Web hosts address in their FAQ or Knowledge Base sections of their sites, but seemingly customers are reluctant to wade through pages of dry text to find the instructions they are looking for. As a result, they end up sending in a support ticket. While the questions are easy to address, it does take time and money to have adequate staff to handle the tickets. It occurred to me that there is a more effective way to grab the attention of the customer – Flash movies. By nature, people are very visual. They prefer to actually see how something is done rather than having to read how it’s done. So after some research into the most commonly asked questions that Web hosts receive, I decided to produce some Flash based tutorials to help Web hosts reduce the overall number of support tickets they receive.   THS: Who are your typical clients and what are they hoping to gain by using the tutorials?  VC: Our customer base, well over 2,000 Web hosts, ranges from the small reseller right up to the high profile datacenter. The size of the company is irrelevant. Basically, if you offer Web hosting in any capacity, you can benefit from offering our tutorials in your Support Center. DemoDemo tutorials, when properly presented, significantly reduce the total number of support tickets that a web host receives related to routine tasks in the operation of a website. Given that on average, 50 percent of a web hosting company’s expenses are allocated to customer support, there is a real and valid concern of rising support costs. Outsourcing support, while effective, is an ongoing expense. On the other hand, DemoDemo tutorials are a one-time expense. Many DemoDemo customers have found the tutorials extremely effective in addressing their customers’ questions, particularly if placed strategically on their site. Generally, web hosts will place them in their Help Desk or Customer Service areas. One particularly effective method is to include links to the tutorials in the Welcome Emails they send out to new customers. After all, the new signups are the ones who generally need the most help. Numerous DemoDemo customers report an immediate drop in support tickets by as much as 80 percent.  THS: What are the most popular features in the tutorials? What are users most impressed by?  VC: Flash tutorials are a big hit with end users simply because they clearly walk the user through the given task step by step. The playbar at the bottom of each tutorial allows the user to pause the movie while they simulate the process in another browser window. Users are not overwhelmed with confusing text instructions. They can actually see how to perform the given task. As well, careful thought is given to the actual content we include in the pop up text boxes throughout. We describe each step in very simple understandable terms so that the end user is able to follow our direction without confusion. When produced properly, a Flash tutorial can be an extremely powerful and effective support tool.  THS: How has the feedback been from the Web hosting companies using this service?   VC: Feedback has been tremendous, reassuring and extremely validating. We have obviously hit a nerve. Clearly, we have been effective in reducing the number of support tickets received. You can see a small sample of the feedback we’ve received on our Testimonials page. The amount of repeat customers we have served clearly indicates that they are pleased with the results they enjoyed with our tutorials.  THS: By featuring Online Tutorials are hosting companies acquiring more customers or even reducing churn?  VC: Absolutely. Many of our customers openly display the DemoDemo tutorials to all site visitors. When someone is shopping for a new host, they look for signals that reflect the host’s commitment to customer service. The fact that a host makes the investment to offer helpful innovative tutorials to their customers clearly demonstrates a decided effort to provide top shelf support. Clearly, we are not the main reason that visitors click to the order page, but I will profess that we definitely contribute to conversion rate. Every shopper has a checklist. No doubt we add to the credibility and saleability of the host’s offerings.  Churn is undesirable yet unavoidable for any business. It’s a fact of life. The challenge is to keep it to a minimum. Ultimately, the web host must strive to do everything possible to improve customer satisfaction, reduce frustration and encourage “self-empowerment”. With our tutorials, the end users can easily enable themselves to manage their sites with minimal Help Desk support. Everybody is happy. The client feels self sufficient, the host reduces support costs. A definite win-win relationship.   THS: What are the advantages to the tutorials versus FAQs on the website?  VC: The point is that particularly on the Internet, people seem to have a very limited attention span. It is exceedingly difficult to keep people interested in reading text if it goes beyond a paragraph or two. So while Knowledge Bases and FAQ can be very concise and to the point, the fact of the matter is that a proper step-by-step description of many tasks often requires more than a few paragraphs. Shortly after starting to read the instructions, many customers lose focus or interest and decide to send in a support ticket instead. Flash tutorials, when properly produced, keep the viewer’s attention throughout. Of course, it is also essential to design the tutorials in a concise format. Otherwise, customers would find them overwhelming as well. The key is to keep them short, dynamic, informative and easy to follow. Each tutorial covers only one specific task. When a customer wants to know how to perform a task, the answer is a click away. They simply click to play, sit back and actually see how it’s done. That’s the other critical part of the equation. Visual by nature, people prefer to see how it’s done rather than read how it’s done. It’s basic human nature.  THS: What projects are you working on now? Are there any plans to introduce new services soon? What about future expansion?  VC: We are constantly adding new product to our inventory. We currently have over 1,400 tutorials in our library. I expect that we will reach 2,000 tutorials by Q4 2005. In terms of expansion, our immediate goal is to add additional series to our collection such as Mambo, HSPComplete, SSL, Spyware, Antivirus, and a few more. In the long term, we plan to add translated tutorials including Spanish, German, Chinese, Dutch and Japanese.   THS: Tell us about the launch of Netasis.com? What goals have you set for the new company?   VC: Netasis.com is a partner site to DemoDemo.com. The site was launched in September 2004. Admittedly, it has kept us very busy. The site was immediately embraced and accepted by visitors, much like DemoDemo. At Netasis, we offer multimedia product. This includes TalkingFAQ, Flash 404 error pages as well as multimedia sales presentations. But I suggest you put on your seat belt. In the very near future, Netasis will be launching a few new products that will really knock your socks off. Needless to say, we are very excited about the future of Netasis.com.  Head: Q and A with John Roberts Interview by: Cliff Boodoosingh  Subhead/deck: John Roberts, Clint Oram and Jacob Taylor quit their jobs with Epiphany, Inc., specialists CRM solutions, on April 10th last year and the talented triple-threat founded SugarCRM the next day. Backed by venture capitalists, Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), Roberts took the CEO position while Oram and Taylor hold VP of Open Source and VP of Engineering posts, respectively.  After an explosive few months, SugarCRM has enjoyed tremendous commercial success with more than 100 paying customers and in excess of 100,000 user downloads for its Sugar Open Source Edition.    THS: Tell us about the timing of the start-up of the company and product launches.  JR: We started getting frustrated because the commercial software industry doesn’t necessarily build great products, it builds okay products. There are types of companies that are dependent upon extreme sales and marketing budgets, large sales forces and very few deals. But, (there are) only a very few in relation to actual customers using the software versus the number of businesses out there. As a result you end up are hijacking what you think is a good product and you just kind of do whatever it takes to make your numbers in a large company. We started seeing in the December time frame JBoss got funded, MySQL got funded, and we started spending a lot of time on SourceForg.net and we looked at nearly 45 CRM projects out there and we thought they were okay, but what we really saw was kind of a lot of hope. We thought that it was only a matter of time-- we had to get the IT and operating system support with RedHat; we had the database with MySQL; programming with PHP and an app server with JBoss. The business application phase was the next layer to really spawn a new company and we did think that the market was right for it.   THS: And the company was born at that point?  JR: We had the strong sense that it was a commercial open source CRM application, that was built using a distributed development environment and the basis of this company is our open source project. And what we are able to do is basically develop a very large user base and user community of our software for free… for really the cost of building and designing a great product and not spend a huge amount of money on sales and marketing. That’s kind of what open source gives you if your project is good if your software is good, and if you don’t have to market your product, the open source has to stand on its own. Then we felt that, and it certainly turned out to be the case, that a percentage of the people that use it will upgrade it to more advanced functionality.    THS:  What percentage need to upgrade for you guys to be successful?  JR: Five percent  THS: On your website, it says most CRM apps are not in tune to business IT and cost savings and as much as 70 percent of that goes into marketing cost.  JR: Yeah, the thing that really caught my eye, I guess, was in a December issue of BusinessWeek and basically it was they did this kind of half page thing and basically the reporter was saying: “We’ve always been so amazed that why Salesforce.com is always offering us to fly out and pay our expenses to come to San Francisco or go see the Dalai Lama.” And I’m actually only using the Dalai Lama as an example. We always wonder how can they afford to do such extreme thing and the reason is for every dollar they take into revenue they spend about seventy cents of it funding sales and marketing operations but only nine to 11 cents of it into real product R &D. Siebel does the same thing. I’m not saying that they weren’t innovative but we really believe that the software industry really is changing.  THS: What’s the biggest change?  JR: The internet is probably one of the most cost effective ways to build software. But if you can develop large user community you can leverage wonderful ideas from people all over the world and so it’s not just about commoditizing software. It’s really helping us develop what we think is far more revolutionary software than one single proprietary software company can build on our own. I say that having spent my career building proprietary software.  THS: How many downloads a day are you getting?  JR: We’re doing 20,000 and we don’t spend a dime, to generate these downloads. Companies know what business applications are and they don’t need sales engineers, which I was in the mid ‘90s. You would go in and you would do these slick demos to senior management and presented the solution. I’m not sure if they need that anymore. Now, here is the software, download it… the open source version is really designed for 20-users and under. You can run it to a thousand users if you want to but what happens is over 20-users you get more advanced functionality and also at that point organizations they want to buy anyway. They want a support contract, they want a relationship, they don’t just want to use free software and be completely on their own. So, price really isn’t an issue at that point anyway. But under twenty users, in a sense we are kind of nuking the market. We are saying why get a 10-user pack from a proprietary guy and spend five to ten thousand a year versus fully functional version. Have you seen our software at all?  THS: I’ve looked at the website, but I didn’t take the Demo.  JR:  What is interesting about us is that we really did break a lot of rules, if you just go to our website if you click on demo it just brings you right into the app. We don’t show you a flash Demo; we don’t ask you for your birthday and stuff like that. If you want to download it, download it here. We even put forums on our website and in the forums we have developers ripping apart different things. I mean it’s all the good, the bad, the ugly, most software companies would never do that because they want to show you just the minimum amount before you buy and then maybe after you buy they’ll let you into a support site where you can see the ugliness found in the software. We are very different, I mean, here is the Demo, play with it as much as you want; here download the open source version it is fully functional; here are our forums you can participate whether you’re a customer or not; here are our bug lists; and here’s our road map.  If you see value, then upgrade to the Pro and get additional functionalities.  So, now things have changed, you build if you bring some smart minds together some great architects, UI designers, business process designers and you build a great product a small group of people can build a highly innovative product and release it to the planet in a matter of months. You know, it’s interesting when we put out our 1.0. Everybody was asking us to internationalize it, so we internationalized it and then within two weeks it was translated into fifteen languages and now half of our revenues come from overseas.    THS:  Is that because of the advent of Linux to begin with?   JR: Well, we run on Windows, Mac OS10, Unix... you have people I think that kind of grew up with the PC, and they understand how software works, how it’s developed, how to communicate, how to collaborate without actually being in the same room together over different geographies. There is a trend now to outsource and move everything to India and China (but) I’m really happy because we don’t have to do that. In our  2.0  version (released) in October, within the first week it was downloaded five thousand times and for the first two weeks it just got hammered on and the people who cared about the product were QA testing it and they had the source code and they could either report bugs or run the fix at the same time. And I think if you look at QA and building quality software you are not going to get a better QA process than that.   THS: Attracting that many people that quickly, great for business, right?  JR: Well, people have to believe in what you are doing, and you have to be really, really straightforward in terms of how you are going to make money, how you are making money. And, you have to prove that you listen.  THS: Tell us about the quick installation process.   JR: Jacob has a masters in Computer Science and is all about algorithms. The one thing that we were really frustrated with J2EE (Java2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) was that we generated a slow app, really complex, really nice apps but they were they turned out to be pretty slow, in terms of two to three seconds response time. One of the things that we wanted was a really fast app in terms of a UI standpoint and he saw scalability. And Clint saw a rapid application development environment; I saw a massive portability across all platforms and huge install base of developers, so we wrote the app as a LAMP  (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP ) application. We spent a lot of time on the installation of our software, so it literally takes fifteen minutes to drop sugar on a Linux box.  THS: Another huge selling point.  JR: We would not have the download if we weren’t easy to install. It’s as simple as that, and it runs on Windows, it runs on MacOS10, Linux, and Unix. Half of our users use Windows, half of them use RedHat and we don’t have to recompile the code, it’s just one set of code. Even with J2EE if you want to go from BEA to JBoss to web server you’ve got to completely repackage the whole thing, different admin consoles for each one of them. Anyway, my point was that I think that the pain of implementing these apps now is just not there because you can download and install and send out an url and say: “ Hey! What do you think?”    THS: Ok, when a customer comes to you and they are not sure if they need a CRM system but they are investigating the possibility, what kind of things do you go into before you do a demonstration.  JR: What’s really interesting is that we never do a Demo. I spent a lot of years building tool power points and stuff like that. People they come here, they hear about us, they look at us as a top project, they download us and then basically the IT personal set it up and then the business person goes “Cool!” and/or the CIO goes we want to use more open source; we want to get off this proprietary guys, and then they call in and ask if we are real. That’s a lot of what we get, they ask us if we are a bunch of part time programmers or if we are a real company and yeah we are a real company we are not just an open source project, we are a commercial open source.  THS: Some companies must have more involved questions they need answered?  JR:  Sure. So I didn’t see this feature, when are you going to have this feature or we’d like this to be built out here, that kind of thing. We do a lot of consulting all out of our Cupertino headquarters… if we have larger Fortune 500 companies and they want to have a two month evaluation project, we might have a lot of technical calls so we are on the phone quite a bit (with) technical conversations. What we do a lot, is an evaluation agreement for a pro-code and most of the time we just create (and) put them on an on-demand server and we say here is your server, here is your full pilot and here are the keys of the server, here is everything. And then they start really getting into it, then we help them in terms of doing their evaluation (but they’re) doing the majority of the work and that’s basically answering questions.   The way you buy our software just go right into our shopping cart and all of our agreements are online click-through agreements. Then we do discounts and our sales reps go in and add the discounts and to complete the transaction just verifies credit card and create the invoice. So we really, streamline the whole buying process. Somebody said it, “SugarCRM is software that is bought, not sold.”   THS: A lot of the frustrations that may be responsible for failed projects in the past can be attributed in measuring the success of using these programs. So much time is spent on implementation. You know how to collect the data, but many users don’t know how to use it to positive ends, the relationship management aspect in the equation. Maybe they scrapped projects because maybe they didn’t know how to measure success properly using CRM systems. Does that make sense?  JR: Yeah, I think people, I think they don’t know. CRM is a fairly mature app, the people that are really using it are the vice-presidents of sales. They graduated in the late ‘80s early 90’s; they got laptops they were the first people that really used CRM and they suffered. My belief is that as much as they never used Siebel ‘98 or whatever, they thought if we were really to use this we probably would be more efficient as an organization but it’s a shame that we don’t. And that is why the other systems failed. Now, I think like in our website you click on our Demos, you see we don’t have Flash demos, because even business people know what they want and what they don’t want in an app just like when you go buy a cell phone today. You know what you want and what you don’t want. I don’t want a little web browser in my little tiny cell phone ‘because I’m not going to use it. I know how to evaluate and that’s kind of what we are seeing. It is kind of a mature industry in that regard. They know they need an interface that is permanent and fun and easy and it has minimum mouse clicks to get what they need. IT needs something fast and easy to maintain and they don’t have to spend thousands of dollars on consultants and they want basically an open system that’s got a big community around it, not just one proprietary vendor’s consulting organization or their paid partners.  THS: Ok, that makes sense so the actual consumer just through the process of trial and error has figured this out and they know the intrinsic benefits of using it properly.  JR: They know. I bet if you go to a typical medium size business with twenty or more reps they are going to have a sales operations person, I bet a VP of sales. By now this is their probably 3rd or 4th CRM system in the last 10 years. They know what worked and what didn’t work so that’s a large percentage of the companies out there. I do think we are getting a lot of virtual smaller companies now as these are coming up and they look it up and they go “well I can manage my contacts, my accounts, my opportunities, my cases, my leads, activity management.” It’s not that complicated. CRM is kind of interesting; the fundamentals of CRM are not that complex. What’s really complex is creating a user experience that makes it really simple and in having an architecture that is easy to maintain and I think that’s why you have a million CRM apps out there but very few that have real followers behind them.   THS: In terms of your ideal customer would it be the guys that are knowledgeable that have gone through the trial and error stage or  the novice?  JR: Well, it’s like ourselves, we are about fifteen employees, pretty simple, we don’t customize any of it; we just use it out of  the box. Our needs are pretty simple and the application is designed to be to meet the needs under twenty users -- everything that they would need without any customization, a few tweaks here and there. Above twenty users, at that point they need a configurable environment and that’s when open source and the modern stack of software platform is really appealing to them so it kind of meets the needs of both worlds.   THS: In looking at future things for the company you obviously have to have certain benchmarks for success? How have the last few months unfolded?  JR: People always ask us how you did it so fast. Well it was ‘because we had been doing it for a long time; we’ve been working together for a long time and we knew exactly what we were going to do. We didn’t write any code before we left Epiphany but we’re pretty experienced guys and we have been in this industry for a while. We picked each other not because we were the best friends, we are very good friends, but because we were simply the right skills set. I think our belief was, the top project, the top business, the top CRM project in SourceForge was maybe doing a thousand downloads a month. We did 21,000, so it happened. Things have happened much faster and I think it’s really validated, that commercial open source is really here, and it is really viable. We are changing the space and if we went away tomorrow our project would continue to evolve. It’s funny, no one ever asks us for references, they just don’t. We have over 100 customers right now no one has asked us for references. They see the source code and they see our full developer community.   THS: Have you set goals for the rest of the year?  JR: Our open source community means more to us than anything else. It means more to  than our paying customers it means more to us than anything and for every release over fifty percent, well it varies, but forty to fifty percent of every release that we do is pure open source code for free. It is very clear when you are in a proprietary company you have a very subset, a very small subset of people that work for the company care about the apps and this is where you are getting your requirements from. By having an open source community even if we are generating the revenue by 5 percent of them, they are providing unbelievable insight in terms of ideas, in terms of where we are going. I think we are building more revolutionary software and we don’t really have to put a stake in the ground, we are going to go where our community asks us to go. We weren’t planning to do internationalization right after 1.0 one month out. We were going to wait to put it out in December and this is way back in the summer. We said ok we’ll put it out and we cranked hard to internationalize the whole app, two weeks later boom, fifteen languages.  You know there is this book, it came out not too long ago, is about crowd theory. Basically the basis of the book is if you get a lot of individuals that are communicating they are can actually make more intelligent decisions than super smart people by themselves.   We are really are listening to the crowd and the intelligence of  the crowd is making us a great company. That’s our philosophy, and I think we are going to have a world class CRM application.   Head; Q and A with Marc Benioff Interview by: Cliff Boodoosingh  Subhead: Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com,  has been recogized "for almost single-handedly legitimizing the ASP business model" for software distribution. BusinessWeek named him one of the 25 people responsible for turning eBusiness around. His “End of Software” philosophy has helped make Salesforce.com ‘the’ household name in on demand CRM with an industry leading 227,000 subscribers and 13,900 customers and counting.   THS: Halsey Minor from Grand Central Communications  made a statement recently: In four years basically the whole notion of enterprise application software is going to be dead.” That’s kind of your mantra is it not?   MB: Yeah, well Halsey started Salesforce.com with me (in 1999). So he was my business partner and he owns 10 percent of Salesforce.com. He’s financially-incented.  THS: So, basically, you are on the same page with that. That’s basically the “the End of Software” philosophy you’ve promoted.  MB: Yeah, we believe that this new idea of on-demand services will replace the traditional very high cost, very complex, very high failure rate traditional enterprise software and that’s what we’ve been working on the last six years is to do everything we can to destroy that software industry. We even registered a URL theendofsoftware.com in 1999.  THS: The endofsoftware.com, is that just adjoined to your website or is it totally different?  MB: No, is not even a live website, it was just kind of our stake in the ground that we believed strongly enough in the end of software that we would even put it down as a URL.  THS: I have spoken with your company before. A few years ago I spoke with Cary Fullbright, Vice President  f Product Strategy, and at that time we were very excited about the ASP model that was set for take off. We all know what happened. But now again there is a kind of a resurgence in the ASP model, a validation of sorts,  and I was wondering what has changed in the last couple to resurrect the model.   MB: Well, honestly I think Salesforce.com has been a lot of it. We have proven that this is a real model, that it can work that you can generate revenue and profit and take a company public and that has raised a lot of eyebrows you know we have been very fortunate to be able to execute well in this market place and to severely injure Seibel systems and other enterprise software companies and show customers that they were paying more than they needed to pay for this type of functionality and because of that I think we are at new level now and we have a lot of other on-demand service providers starting up. In fact, even, we have a community starting up around us, we have a lot of what we call Sforce partners who are building solutions on top of salesforce.com to get to our customers.  THS: Ok, do you think there are any market indicators that shows that this has legs the ASP model?  MB: I’m sorry I don’t understand the question.  THS: Are there any market indicators things in the market, trends for example that says it got to be a sustained incline in acceptance of the model?  MB: Well, the best to do I think is to look at our company, we remain one of the fastest software companies in the world at a time where enterprise software companies aren’t growing at all. So, that’s a pretty good indication that there is a tremendous opportunity with the model itself.  THS: Ok, in the last quarter there are some excellent numbers revenues increased 82%, you obviously know this paying subscribers 81% net income 84% customer gain 62%   MB: Which Company is this?  THS: This is yours.  MB: Oh yeah, that sounds familiar.  THS: Your Q3 numbers, how do you plan to sustain that level of productivity in your company, that’s very hard to replicate obviously.  MB: Well, the most important thing is of course we have had sustaining these numbers for the last five years as we probably have developed our past financial also. But the most important thing to us is making the customers successful. Most of our leads come from our existing customers and the most important thing for us is to show people this model works, there is still a lot of  naysayers out there and we have to deal with them one at the time and we have to work hard to make sure that companies realize that they can be more successful than they ever been before using this model.  THS: To add to that, also on while we are on the topic of numbers, your revenues or the gross margins of sales and marketing are pretty high, I think up to 70% or 80% with that in mind, are there any plans to take that down so that if there were an lapse in revenue you would have something to fall back on?  MB: I would advice you to listen to the conference call when we release those after quarter numbers because we were asked that question and there are a number of answers there on the poll that would help you.   THS: All right, in terms of your marketing strategies a number of them have been an extravagant thing, I was just wondering if there was a method to that madness, what you gained from those type of marketing events?  MB: We needed to get our message out there, and there was a crowded market when we launched our company in ‘99 there were a lot of other companies, and of course we survived but a lot of companies didn’t survive. But one of the ways that we survived is we had to build our brand quickly, we new we weren’t going to be able to build it through advertising or through other traditional marketing means so we developed this kind of approach which we call customer success marketing, and customer success marketing is all about promoting customer successes through outrageous events like the ones you sighted   THS: So, as far as you are concerned you are going to continue with those, they have proven to be effective.  MB: That’s correct.  THS: Can you quickly give us your thoughts on the Oracle/PeopleSoft merger, or acquisition, whatever you want to call that.  MB: Well, you basically have with Oracle/PeopleSoft the enterprise software industry is basically mature now, and in enterprise applications these companies are coming together because there really aren’t any other major growth opportunities unlike in our industry we are still relatively young industry with a high growth rate.   THS: Do you think that trend in the industry would continue?  MB: Well, there just aren’t that many enterprise software companies to put together that’s the problem.  THS: Do you think, on a smaller level maybe not even the enterprise some of the smaller players, are going to get scooped up by some of the bigger players?  MB: Well, you know we’ve heard about this for about two years this consolidation trend, but how many have there been? One a year? Two a year? I mean I don’t know, I would just say look at the path and it will probably continue.   THS: Ok, do you have any thoughts about the competition or the open source CRM companies that are starting to emerge, do you perceive that as a threat to Salesforce?  MB: Not really, I think even if the software is free, they can’t afford it. Because the majority of the total cost of the ownership of software is still buying the hardware, buying the other application components, the load balancers, the security, the application servers, the database servers, there is a lot of different components and people to run all of it. What we did was, we removed the complexity, we removed the people, we removed the upgrading and the updating and the complexity, we removed the risk and those companies certainly are not removing the risk in fact if anything they might be adding more to it.   THS:Ok, on some other trends that are starting to emerge the integration of RFID into retail operations, do you have, how is that going to impact anything that you do in terms of new releases and in terms of how you work with existing customers to help them in that supply chain.   MB: Well, I think RFID is going to create really big databases of information much more so than we’ve seen before and how it relates specifically to CRM is you know we’ll be able to fully integrate it access to the systems to bring our customers better information on how their customers are doing.   THS: Would you say this is part and parcel of integration of CRM to other software programs perhaps.  MB: Yes THS: Do you see that as a driver for not just your company but for CRM companies in general?  MB: Yes.  THS: In terms of how you follow market trends with your own customers, your own relationships with your customers, do you follow some other technology trends and get involved in them, for example you know voice over IP is going to have an impact in call centers and things like that. How involved are you with those types of technologies as you make plans for your own company.  MB: Well, we are very involved with a lot of different software vendors, you may know about our Sforce program which allows other customers to build applications on our platform and in fact there is over a hundred Sforce ISVs at this point who build production solutions on top of our platform over 60 of them display their solutions that are DreamForce conference which happened in November (2005). I would say that is very important for us to continue to succeed to be as open as possible to make our web services capabilities as broad as possible so that we continue to develop our ecosystem.   THS: So, you would say your Sforce 5.0 release I guess was September-October how well is that going? How is your customer receptivity for that?  MB: Very good, Sforce has been around now I guess about a year and a half, and in that time we have seen tremendous uptake of Sforce in our customers and also by the ISV community and we are extremely pleased with that.   THS: Would you have the same thoughts about CustomForce.com.  MB: CustomForce.com is still an emerging new technology, it’s only been available for a few months as you probably know, but we are seeing a lot of customers begin to build and deploy new type of functionality into our systems and we are studying that very closely. CustomForce.com lets customers build new applications using our tools like inventory or HR or even manufacturing capabilities and bringing that to the on-demand model between customers built sset management application and all kinds of things we can never imagined. And we expect CustomForce to be a tremendous opportunity for our customers to fully customize our product as well as to create entirely new apps.  THS: In terms of metrics I’m sure you probably read about them and you are fed up about them, but I still want to get your reaction to them. For example when Gardener and companies like that come up with failure rates on CRM implementations for example, they say 65% in 2002 to 85% in 2004 and you haven’t seen that in the WallStreet Journal where you see a CRM article and is often cited that there is 50 to 80 percent failure rate. What customers see this kind of thing, and you are trying to win customers, how do you rationalize how you deal with that issue?  MB: That is because most customers really have experienced those failure rates with the large software products like Siebel and that’s why we have been so successful because they are looking to get away from those failure rates, by moving to an on-demand model.  THS: The tipping point quote you make where we are at the tipping point in on-demand software maybe we can wrap up with that, can you elaborate on that?  MB: We really believe that we are on a threshold time where companies are willing to look at on-demand democratically for the first time. Small, medium or large companies we are seeing you know a lot more traction for on-demand computing and what we think that means is that this is the time when customers when they are evaluating a new product they’ll look at software and they’ll look at on-demand and that’s very exciting because the company can make a purchase decision based on that and before, maybe in a year ago they were only willing to look at software products now they are willing to look at our model as well.  THS: Maybe I can ask one more thing, since is the start of a new year 2005, any plans for salesforce.com, any major objectives that you have set for the company this particular year.  MB: Well, I think exactly what you did ask me, we are really working hard to make this the tipping point for on-demand computing and we want to make sure that when companies are putting together their short list for evaluating new services whether is salesforce.com for on-demand CRM or SupportForce.com for on-demand call centers or contact centers, or CustomForce.com for on-demand application development or Sforce which is basically our on-demand platform that customers are willing to evaluate us as well as looking at the software alternative and that is our big goal for 2005 is to get into the minds of customers and to let them know they’ll be more successful than ever before using this capability.      bfrancis@salesforce.com  sustaining growth in general not the numbers    By Irwin Soonachan  When you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose. In early 1999, Benny Ng was ready to take a few chances. He had just been named marketing director for Hurricane Electric (www.he.com), a Silicon Valley-based hosting outfit with a 12-person staff operating out of a budget-sized 2,000 sq. ft. office/data center.  The good news: Silicon Valley was at its bacchanalian peak, with so much money flowing into its smog-ridden gills that every local assumed their piece of the pie would arrive post haste. The bad news was that Hurricane Electric was one of the very, very few companies in the area not seriously pursuing venture capital. The local competition included national, capital-flush giants who were marketing like it was … 1999.  Without the capital to open the velvet rope via traditional methods, Ng (pronounced “ing”) did the only thing he could: Try every technique possible to get Hurricane Electric in front of customers.  “We wrote all the options down on a sheet of paper,” Ng says. “You’ve got print, direct mail, TV, radio, etc. All the ones we could do financially at the time, we tested. Obviously, we did small tests. If something worked, we started throwing a little more money into it.”  After firing off a few rounds of all the budget-friendly marketing devices they could think of, Ng and co. turned to one of the unhippest, old-economy advertising outlets in existence.  On paper, radio made sense. Radio ads were (and remain) very inexpensive. Arbitron, the radio ratings firm, estimates the average daily round trip commute time in the United States at 54 minutes long, and traffic congestion in Silicon Valley and the greater San Francisco Bay Area probably forces motorists to spend even more time in their cars.  Moreover, since the Silicon Valley economy is driven by the tech industry, a fair percentage of listeners understood the technical aspects of the ads, which featured one character complaining about poor web hosting and another recommending Hurricane Electric, mentioning entry-level pricing, bandwidth, and the strength of its network.  “I’m sure some of the content was a bit over the heads of some of the listeners, but our target knew what our ads were saying,” says Ng.  Suddenly, Hurricane Electric was hot. The 2,000 sq. ft. suite was expanded by an additional 2,000 sq. feet. Ng wanted to saturate the market on a low budget, so he only ran ads Tuesdays through Thursdays, and took advantage of packaged deals to grab a few inexpensive weekend spots.   When the tech bubble burst and debt-rich competitors began to disappear, many of the Bay Area enterprises left stranded without a hosting provider turned to Hurricane Electric. Within a couple years, in the midst of Silicon Valley’s worst recession in 25 years, Hurricane Electric expanded to nearly 50,000 sq. feet of floor space.  “We had people signing up for service listing radio and the stations they heard us on (when asked how they found out about Hurricane Electric),” Ng says. “We had sales calls, and they would mention our ads to us. We would have random meetings with other people in the industry, and one of the first things they would say is how they noticed our ad on the radio. And when I met with friends or went to the mall, people would come up to me and ask if I worked at he.net, and say that they had heard our spot on the radio. We were getting great reach, and frequency.”  Not everything Ng tried was successful. After the initial success with radio in the San Francisco Bay Area, Hurricane Electric explored other markets but couldn’t find the right city.  “We looked in L.A. and we looked in New York, but the prices were a lot higher than we had hoped for,” Ng says.  “Then we started looking in smaller markets such as Seattle and Arizona, but those markets were just too small.”   Ads on local television missed the mark as well. “We saw better results doing radio,” says Ng.  Today, Hurricane Electric is taking a break from radio advertising after nearly six years, focusing instead on managing the rapid operational growth they credit, in part – along with a great sales team and strong support – to their radio ads.   “I can’t say that all of it is accredited to the radio ads; we have great salespeople and other good marketing. But when we were with salespeople from different organizations, prospective clients, hiring new employees, they’d literally walk in the door and say, ‘Hey, I heard you on the radio the other day.’”  Hurricane Electric still advertises in the normal trade venues frequented by their competitors, and see a return to radio on their horizon.  Their success promoting web hosting on the radio might be a phenomenon unique to their region – a place where techies per capita is higher than anywhere else in the United States and radio ads are affordable. The real lesson of Hurricane Electric is that by looking into opportunities the competition ignored, and by being willing to devote small portions of its marketing budget to experiment with new venues, they identified a company-making opportunity.   “Radio was one of the things that a lot of other companies were doing, but not hosting companies, and actually, not that many technology companies,” Ng says. “We thought it was worth at least a test to see if radio ads were a worthwhile investment.”  For Benny Ng and Hurricane Electric, the only way to find out was to try.  Irwin Soonachan is Strategic Content Manager for Mercury Interactive, a technology company in Mountain View, Calif., providing software to optimize the quality and performance of enterprise applications to customers worldwide.

Cornering a Market Might Be Easier Than You Think By Thomas Leo  Pay-per-click advertising -- that used to be the best way to grow a shiny new hosting business. A few years ago, spending around $1,000 per month in search engine pay-per-click (PPC) advertising always returned as much in sales.  As the years have passed, however, everyone has gotten into the PPC ad space, and many are willing to bid ridiculous amounts. What business model can remain profitable at $10 per click? With so many hosts out there, what’s the owner of a small hosting company to do?   A majority of small hosting companies have fewer than 1,000 hosted sites, with no employees other than the owner (and perhaps a spouse). Hosting is not their only source of income, the advertising budget is not very big, growth is very slow, and they absolutely hate trying to gain new clients through cold calling and other typical sales pitch techniques. If any of the above describes you, then read on.   A friendly competitor, Larry Dozier, gives this advice: “Lazy people are the best people for the worst jobs, because they tend to find innovative ways to make the job easier.”  When it comes to “doing sales,” many hosts are lazy. They don’t like schmoozing and pushing business cards because it makes them feel like used-car salesmen. They find the aggressive sales process demeaning to both them and their clients. They care about clients too much to try to sell them something they don’t want, and perhaps don’t need. In these respects, PPC looks like the ideal marketing tool. But with PPC not performing as well as it used to, a new strategy is needed.   A Strategy That Works  What if you could... • have a sales force of entrepreneurs like yourself? • get people to talk about your business regularly? • find potential clients without advertising, cold calling, PPC?  What if the solution were easy and inexpensive? What is this new magic bullet for getting sales? It’s not new, it’s not magic, but it does get sales. It’s network marketing.   Networking marketing is a technique that works well in spite of a limited budget and small company size. In fact, it probably works better for smaller hosts that for larger ones. It has proven itself to be lucrative, rewarding -- even easy.   The term “network marketing” conjures up some negative impressions, in spite of its proven success. Perhaps you associate it with multi-level marketing (MLM), those times when distant acquaintances — with whom you’ve not been in contact for months — call you up and ask to introduce you to “this new business opportunity to make unlimited income in you spare time.” Don’t worry. Network marketing is not an MLM scheme; there are no up-lines, down-lines, or secret handshakes.   Block Out The Competition  One of the best advantages for small businesses in joining a network marketing group is that, unlike most Chambers of Commerce, only one representative from each industry is allowed to join. Once you join a group, your competitors are then blocked from joining the same group. So even if you’re in the backyard of one of the largest hosting companies in the world, once you join a particular networking group, you and only you will have the opportunity to market your services to the business leaders in that group. Some companies join multiple groups, sending different representatives to different groups in order to corner the local market.   Relationships First  Network marketing is about relationships and about giving as much as receiving. Sure, it’s about growing your business and gaining new clients, but first, it’s about several non-competing business owners agreeing to help each other in business. Before anyone is going to endorse your business, they must know you, trust you and understand your business. And what better endorsement than that of someone who actually knows you?    Network marketing involves a weekly meeting of local business professionals. Yes, weekly. How else are you going to learn to promote the businesses of the others in the group but by spending time with them, getting to know their business? How else are you going to learn what the other members of the group need? Your commitment to the other members will be returned by their commitment to you. How the meetings are conducted varies depending on the group, but every good network marketing group has several professional entrepreneurs learning about each others’ businesses and building relationships of mutual trust — even friendships.   During the week, while your network marketing partners are out doing business for themselves, they may hear a client, friend or relative express a need to promote their business or organization. This provides the perfect opportunity for your friend to recommend you as a professional in the field of web site hosting, development and marketing. And you will do the same for them. That’s what network marketing is all about.  It’s About Educating Yourself on Other People’s Businesses  Each week, the meetings give members an opportunity to update each other about their businesses. This information is key to understanding the types of business the others are seeking (for example, is the realtor specializing in commercial or residential property?). If you are a host who doesn’t do design or programming, you might ask the group to help you find a reputable designer in the area and invite him or her to join the group. Over time, these folks can turn into your best resellers.   Educate the group on the type of business you’re looking for. Do you want power users who know the value of having all the bells and whistles on their accounts, or the small business owner who can get by with a browser-driven website building program and email? Are you specializing in realty websites or eCommerce stores? Educating the group on the specific type of business you’re seeking will help them find the kind of leads you’re looking for.   Explain what kind of business you’re not looking for. Explain to the group what a bad lead would be. For example, if a potential customer is MCSA- (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator) certified and looking for hosting company when all you do is Linux hosting, it’s probably a bad lead.   Educate the group on what key phrases to listen for, like “eCommerce” or “online marketing,” that are signals that the person might have a need for your services. Let your fellow networkers know that if they come across a person who complains about their website, you want to meet with that person.   Warm Referrals vs. Cold Leads  There are few leads less productive than someone who says, “I know this guy who has an ugly website, and here’s his business card. You should give him a call.” And yet, a lot of people think that this qualifies as a helpful lead! A good networking group discourages this type of cold lead. The most successful network marketing groups give warm referrals, where the potential customer has specifically expressed interest in hearing from you. And what could be better than getting endorsements from a trusted third party?   A good networking group encourages members to listen to the needs of the people they come in contact with and getting them together with someone who can meet that need. For example, say your networking group includes a banker named Tom and a mortgage broker named Rick. If, during the course of the day, you hear someone complaining about credit card debt, you know that you can put them in touch with Tom, who can help them find better ways to manage their debt. Or Rick, the mortgage broker who specializes in helping people who have tarnished credit to get refinancing so that they can get out of trouble. The advantage is that you know Tom and Rick personally because you meet with them every week, and perhaps have even used their services yourself. You ask your friend if he or she would like to talk to Tom or Rick. Your friend says yes. You exchange business cards. And now you have a warm lead to pass along. And in return, Rick and Tom are out there telling others about your Web hosting business, drumming up warm leads for you.  Top networking organizations close billions of dollars worth of business every year, through warm referrals just like those described above. And you can get a slice of it.  Unlearning what you know  It’s easy to be selfish about our businesses. Society encourages us to ask “what’s in it for me?” Network marketing takes a different approach, creating a measurable process of business development based on giving to other entrepreneurs as well as gaining from them. The by-product of this give-and-take approach is that business growth happens for everyone involved.   Some people never understand this. If you only pitch your business to members of your group, trying to get them to buy, instead of educating the members to do your pitching for you, the maximum benefit from the group is not attained.  Your Weekly Sales Meeting  Consider the meeting of your network marketing group as your “weekly sales meeting.” They are your sales team. Just as larger companies have sales teams, so do you (however, yours only costs a few hundred dollars a year). The weekly meeting is your chance to educate your sales team on special deals, new products, updates on services, and all the other elements that make up a good sales meeting.   The Resulting Bottom Line  Of course, network marketing is all about business and improving the bottom line. But like a great recipe, you have to add measured ingredients in order to make a great meal. A mouthful of pure sugar is nothing compared to chocolate chip cookies! The “ingredients” of personal relationships, warm referrals, regular attendance, and a generous attitude contribute to the effectiveness of your network marketing group and, ultimately, your bottom line. The new business you generate — plus the savings you may receive on other members’ products and services will more than pay for your membership in the group. Think of it: several thousand dollars in Web design and hosting business, just for showing up for breakfast or lunch once a week. You can’t get a better deal anywhere.

While several recent hijackings of domains such as eBay Germany’s and that of ISP Panix have made headlines, most victims are common end-users. A much-publicized recent change in domain transfer policy by ICANN has also increased the vulnerability of domains to hijacking. Resellers spend a lot of time answering questions from end-users about security. And, when a domain is hijacked or expires, resellers are put on the defensive, wasting time and resources explaining what happened to their customers. To reduce the drain on resources and enhance security for their customers, every reseller should proactively educate their end-users about some simple steps they can take to protect their domains. But first, it’s important to briefly review the myriad threats to domains.  A sizable percentage of domains are insecure or easy prey for criminals primarily due to human error or a lack of institutional protocols. A common mistake is for an organization to task an employee with registering its domains. All too frequently, this person innocently registers the domain in his or her own name, instead of the company’s, and the organization learns it doesn’t have rights to its own domain when that employee leaves. Additionally, a single employee is often the only person aware of the passwords for managing a firm’s domains. This risks a disgruntled or former employee changing critical information, stealing their employer’s domains or redirecting renewal notices. Resellers can help reduce their corporate customers’ exposure by helping them understand the dangers such practices pose.  End-users also regularly lose domains because they fail to renew them on time. Despite the fact that the onus is on the customer to respect renewal timelines, they routinely vent at their reseller over their loss. Resellers can indemnify themselves from such strife by encouraging their customers to set their domains to auto-renew. Resellers should also partner with a reputable registrar with a track record of consistently sending multiple, timely domain renewal notices to registrants.  It’s common knowledge that criminals, cyber-squatters, unscrupulous telemarketers and marketers routinely mine public WHOIS information in an effort to steal identities, send fake renewal notices to trick an owner into transferring their domain (“slamming”), or to send spam and other unwanted solicitations. To avoid this many registrants enter fake information. As a result, they do not receive renewal notices sent by registrars and their domains expire. Regardless of their culpability, customers again often complain to their reseller. To reduce their own risk, resellers should explain the value of, and promote to their end-users services such as Private WHOIS Registration, which shields an end-user’s contact information from prying eyes. It is incumbent upon resellers to help end-users understand that it is both risky and unnecessary to enter false WHOIS information when privacy protection services are readily available.  Given the alarming, mounting security risks, and the enormity of what’s at stake for resellers and their end-users, what’s a domain owner or reseller to do? Below are some simple suggestions that resellers can use to educate their customers about improving the security of their domain portfolios. If implemented, they will save resellers and their end-users time, aggravation and future losses.  - Use free transfer lock services such as TransferGuard by BulkRegister to protect your domains from unauthorized transfers. - Enter correct information in WHOIS and use Private WHOIS Registration – offered through resellers by BulkRegister and several other reputable registrars – that shields your contact information from public view or substitutes the registrar’s contact information for your own. The registrar will filter for spam and scams and only forward legitimate correspondence to you. - Check message boards and other resources to ensure you choose a reseller that is backed by a reputable registrar with sound communication practices. - Respond to all legitimate emails from your registrar or reseller. - Routinely check your email to ensure you don’t miss any renewal notices. - Don’t use email addresses provided by free email services that will automatically suspend your email account if you don’t use it enough, thereby leading you to potentially miss out on renewal deadlines. - Keep track of expiration dates for all of your domains. - Consider consolidating all of your domains under one registrar to more easily track expiration dates and streamline communications. - Set your domains to automatically renew. - Never give passwords for managing your domains to others. - If you have an employee register domain names for your company, ensure that the company is listed as the legal domain owner, not the employee. - Ensure your organization doesn’t give control of its domain to one employee, that several people know your firm’s passwords and that they are changed frequently.  - Use a multi-lock domain management system that requires several people to enter their passwords and approve any changes.  While scam artists and criminals will continue to find new ways to steal domains from both sophisticated multinational organizations and everyday end-users, resellers and their customers can work together to make it much harder for them to succeed.

UNED--HOSTING VALUE ADDED SERVICES – Do accessories make the man?  For years we’ve been conditioned to avoid thinking about “dot-coms,” due in no small part to the violent drop many retirement funds took around mid 2000 as a result of paying too much attention! The once legion numbers of “value added” Internet technology providers left a bad taste in many mouths. Yet recently there appears to be a resurgence in the number of small technology companies catering to ISPs and hosting providers, and their end-user customers. The service provider category has quietly yet inexorably built up new feature momentum that you can see in trade shows, magazines, the Web and most importantly of all, in the services offered by providers.  “What’s the buzz? Tell me what’s a happenin’!”  Could it be the return of the value-added service? Once again in seemingly unprecedented amounts, VA services seem to making a comeback from the heyday/mayday of the dot-com boom/bust. So what are we talking about and is it good news, bad news or no news?  A good working definition for a value-added service could be:  “Any complementary feature or application delivered as a service that enhances a core service such as ISP access or hosting. It can be billed incrementally or bundled.”   The point is, it adds value, by providing a function that in some way increases end-user satisfaction, diminishing churn, adding competitive differentiation or an incremental revenue opportunity.  The categories abound. Examples include:  • Internet call waiting (supposedly big in the dial explosion days) • Search Engine Optimization • Spam filtration • Virus protection • Directory services • E-commerce • Email Marketing   …and too many more to mention.  The automotive equivalent of the value-added service to hosting and access services may well be the auto performance enhancement shop, where your basic vehicle can be kicked up with after-market engine parts, rims and the like. For providers seeking to tune up their hosting services however, the question may well be, will value added features “pimp your ride?” Or, merely spend your money and frustrate your users.  The best answer as usual is a combination of know your customers and their needs, plan and execute well and sprinkle that with a generous dose of “caveat emptor.” Value added Internet services can be the IP-equivalent of snake oil to the unwary service provider and user.  Yet to the astute service provider who thinks as much about the sales, marketing, delivery and customer care facets of value added services, there are indeed diamonds to be reaped in financial returns.  How Big is the Market?  The first myth that needs dispelling in value added services is the gross revenue opportunity or subscriber count potential. In short, how well do these services sell? The answer, in general, is not very well at all. Examples abound. Long before the explosive adoption of broadband services, dial up Internet ruled. A hot new service hit the streets called “Internet Call Waiting.” IDC research reckoned that as many as 20% of all dial users would adopt this seemingly invaluable feature for incremental monthly fees to a dial plan of $5.00 or more per month. What business or home wouldn’t want to surf the net and take phone calls at the same time? Yet, it just never took off. Surprisingly it wasn’t broadband that killed the appeal. Even today there are millions of happy dial users in North America who still have not adopted ICW in numbers much more than 5% on a good day. Under 2% is more typical.  In general, many value added services fail to earn customer adoption or “take rates” above the low single digit level. Even the most compelling of applications among which I include “dial up accelerators” (meaning the ones that really work!) struggle to earn 10% of conversion on a user base. Internet providers might see two such value added applications in five years.  So, if you are a hosting service provider feeling threatened by competitors who seem to launch a new, clever value-added widget every three months… in real financial terms, you needn’t be. The bottom lime is, the vast majority of these applications simply don’t sell in compelling numbers. Factor in the low monthly fees many command, frequently approaching “free” and the revenue picture can be bleak.  So what’s the answer?  Don’t Sell Value Added Services – Bundle Them  Trying to cross-sell a new customer into extra services isn’t easy. The old “would you like fries with that?”… works up to a point. But in the hosting world, what are “fries?” Would you value offer be one of the following?  • Would you like more disk space with that? • More email with that? • Virus protection with that? • Search engine optimization? Before you check out, may I suggest some email marketing and some free Google ad words sprinkled in?  This approach sounds absurd but it’s more common than you think. The domestic auto industry of the ‘70s offered very little as a “standard feature” in a car. Your new Buick looked like an unmarked police cruiser until the dealer added numerous “options” to make it drivable.   All that changed when the hassle of managing all the combinations and permutations of “options” became too costly for Japanese auto makers who had to manage the business from around the word. So along came the accessory packages as included features. If you wanted a better stereo or power windows over a Tercel, you’d upgrade to a Corolla and get it all “included.”  Web hosting services are not entirely different. Service providers have a hard time (like the Japanese auto makers of the ‘70s) managing the order process, provisioning and support for a myriad of separate add-on features. It’s a lot easier to sell “Plan A”  or “Plan B” and simply include progressive features in each upgrade. Certainly your billing system will appreciate that approach.  It turns out, your customers may like it better also. Market research confirms that majority adopters, who are buying the most hosting services in large numbers today, want value and simplicity. A hosting plan that includes generous disk space, adequate email accounts and comes with spam filtration and virus scanning is expected as minimum desirable table stakes. Making these “features” billable extras, even if the base plan is stripped down and cheap, seems complicated to new users. Getting a car for $9,000 is no deal if the tires and AM radio are extra billable options.  In fact, whether your customers want it or not, bundling may be what your competition forces you to do. Symantec’s email anti virus service is available to ISPs at a low monthly cost per month per email box. It may seem a good idea to mark it up and resell it to your end users for a nominal profit. But look out if the big hosting guy down the street is a) getting a huge volume discount from Symantec and b) throwing into his hosting/email service as a “free” feature. You won’t look too attractive to your prospects by comparison.  Value Added Services Reduce Churn and Drive Sales  Bundling may not justify itself as an incremental revenue generator for the value-added service as a discrete service. No matter. If adding some new features free to you hosting plans makes users happy, that’s an important win. VA services are proven in many cases to reduce churn by adding “switching barriers.” The classic example is unified messaging such as “fax-to-email.” Imagine being a user who adopts this service. All your inbound faxes come to a unique 7-digit number and convert to an email document. Try switching to an alternate hosting provider now. No more faxes unless you carefully select and switch over to a competing unified messaging service. I call this “binding your customer with velvet ropes.” They are tied to you, but not unpleasantly. (Let’s not explore that metaphor too much.)  VA services will drive your core hosting sales whether your customers use them or not. Sound fishy? Thank consumer electronics. Does every stereo purchaser actually need HDTV, 7-channel sound, Dolby I, II, DTS, Neo and thirty six special effects modes? Consumer studies show that VHS machines with the clock set on blinking 12:00 is the norm for over half of all users. Yet the extra features have appeal that drives the initial purchase. People want to know they can use the extras if they want to, but not necessarily right now. (Or ever.)  In essence, the extra VA features provide you with credibility, consumer appeal and differentiation. Features sound good. As long as they don’t cost too much extra, why not buy them? Fundamentally, your hosting service requires numerous value added services simply to compete and appeal to the end user.  Value Added Services Don’t Sell Themselves  Many service providers are disappointed in the take rates and revenues for many value added services. The Search Engine Optimization vendors would have us believe that 30% of all users will rush to spend $29.99 to optimize their sites. “That’s twice as much as the hosting costs,” say we, but the hype continues. What’s real?  As mentioned earlier, the majority of VA services have a hard time exceeding low single digit take rates. However there are ways to improve on this.   The sales and marketing tactics employed by many providers are weak. We call this your “go-to-market” activity. Are you a passive marketer or an active one? Simply adding a link to your hosting sign-up pages saying “click here to order SEO and optimize your site for $29.99 per month,” won’t move many buyers.  Majority adopters require education, selling and sometime evangelism to get on board. Yet for some services costing $5.00 per month, how can you afford to spend the time and effort to actively sell the feature?  Numerous economical techniques drive enhanced take rates:  • Run flash demos of the value added application on your site; • Feature static screen shots showing the ease-of-use • Negotiate free trial periods with you VA service vendor and give the feature to all your users on a trial basis • Use permissioned email to your in-house base to promote the feature • Offer links to user cases and testimonials for your users to learn the benefits  None of these tactics require expensive selling programs or people, yet they work.   In a controlled test conducted by Hostopia in 2002 offering an email anti virus (paid) service for $5.00 per user per month, two hosting providers attained 3% and 5% take rate on their entire hosting users bases within 120 days while others languished below 1% for over a year. The difference? Email promotion of the service to the user base backed by a free 30-day trial offer.   Any combination of the above go-to-market tactics will dramatically impact your take rates and overall business success with VA services.  Easy Is the Word  “Easy-to-use” has become the ultimate cliché of the software and applications business. It has lost its value by over-use.  Yet “easy” is critical in more areas than the actual use of the application. The best value added services today are “end-to-end” easy.   • Easy to learn about;  • Easy to buy;  • Easy to get started and  • Easy to get support.   Any missing element in these “easies” will kill take rate and can generate the ultimate horror-show for a service provider: negative word of mouth that erodes the core service.  Finding out a customer dumped your hosting service along with 20 email accounts because they didn’t like the way your free-bundled search engine submittal worked out is a bad hair day. And not uncommon.   The best service providers today put some well-structured effort into their website that for an ounce of prevention delivers kilos of cure in a successful roll out of a VA service.  Kurant Storesense is a fast-growing e-commerce application www.kurant.com. Kurant markets largely via distribution partners such as Hostopia.com The secret to successful value added services selling is making the entire experience rewarding for end users before they are even a customer. Kurant’s president W. Curtis Pierce elaborates, “We’ve learned by five years experience that even the best services don’t sell themselves. Our most successful distributors rely heavily on a wealth of marketing support that we make available to them. Product collateral material, online tutorials, web-ready fact sheets and FAQs, feature matrices and live demo applications are all essential to successfully offering our service, or any other in our opinion.”  Hostopia research and experience with over 280 hosting service providers validates Curtis’s view. A study conducted on customer registration sites where your website visitors can order your value-added services can do much to help or kill a product’s success. This author found that unintuitive forms, difficult navigation and ambiguous e-commerce terms for the service in question will drive “site abandonment” exceeding 20%. Interested prospects looking at your add-on services will simply abort if they don’t feel assisted throughout the online buying experience.  The best value added service vendors will assist their ISP customers in all these areas.  Bottom Line: What’s Hot and What’s Not  There are a lot of moving parts to the formula for getting a value added services program working profitably for a service provider. Still and all however, the most significant part of your go-to-market strategy is picking the right services to launch. The buffet table is piled high with value-added widgets for hosting providers these days, but as we say in sophisticated marketing terms, “sometimes the dogs don’t like the dog food.”  Here are my picks, right or wrong for the hot value added services of the next two years.  Value Added Service Demand Revenue Comments     Site Builders Very High Low Drives new user site sales; market maturing but still growing Business Chat  Low Moderate Category still nascent for SME users, but market is open to new service offerings and showing early growth. Ecommerce Tools e.g. Kurant Storesense Moderate High Market still new but getting more mainstream with popular backing by eBay and easy to use payment gateways Search Engine Optimization High Moderate Category is new and growing and prices are high but will likely decline as vendors proliferate Spam and Anti-Virus Very High Very Low What started as an incremental revenue generator is considered table stakes in any email offering today. Email Marketing Tools Low Moderate Products such as Constant Contact by Roving Software work very well but are still “crossing the chasm” towards significant adoption.  Commercial Blogging Low Low Mainstream in personal sites yet still finding traction in business applications, especially for billable revenue streams. Unified Messaging Low High Fax to email, email to voice…still struggling with low consumer adoption. Business Directories Low  Low Offers more of a “feel-good” service to hosting customers but proven business results are dubious and almost impossible to charge for.   Wrap Up  The three golden criteria for success for any service provider when considering value added services are:  1. Product: Choose your services well and pick the right vendor;  2. Pricing: Shrewdly plot your pricing strategy: whether to offer bundled or as an incremental billing option;  3. Promotion: Get 100% behind promoting, educating, trial-offering and web-site supporting your new services to generate maximum take rate.  With a well-executed strategy for value added services, you can generate impressive growth in your core services, differentiate from your competitors and make your customers very, very happy.       ED--Cornering a Market Might Be Easier Than You Think By Thomas Leo  Pay-per-click advertising -- that used to be the best way to grow a shiny new hosting business. A few years ago, spending around $1,000 per month in search engine pay-per-click (PPC) advertising always returned as much in sales.  As the years have passed, however, everyone has gotten into the PPC ad space, and many are willing to bid ridiculous amounts. What business model can remain profitable at $10 per click? With so many hosts out there, what’s the owner of a small hosting company to do?   A majority of small hosting companies have fewer than 1,000 hosted sites, with no employees other than the owner (and perhaps a spouse). Hosting is not their only source of income, the advertising budget is not very big, growth is very slow, and they absolutely hate trying to gain new clients through cold calling and other typical sales pitch techniques. If any of the above describes you, then read on.   A friendly competitor, Larry Dozier, gives this advice: “Lazy people are the best people for the worst jobs, because they tend to find innovative ways to make the job easier.”  When it comes to “doing sales,” many hosts are lazy. They don’t like schmoozing and pushing business cards because it makes them feel like used-car salesmen. They find the aggressive sales process demeaning to both them and their clients. They care about clients too much to try to sell them something they don’t want, and perhaps don’t need. In these respects, PPC looks like the ideal marketing tool. But with PPC not performing as well as it used to, a new strategy is needed.   A Strategy That Works  What if you could... • have a sales force of entrepreneurs like yourself? • get people to talk about your business regularly? • find potential clients without advertising, cold calling, PPC?  What if the solution were easy and inexpensive? What is this new magic bullet for getting sales? It’s not new, it’s not magic, but it does get sales. It’s network marketing.   Networking marketing is a technique that works well in spite of a limited budget and small company size. In fact, it probably works better for smaller hosts that for larger ones. It has proven itself to be lucrative, rewarding -- even easy.   The term “network marketing” conjures up some negative impressions, in spite of its proven success. Perhaps you associate it with multi-level marketing (MLM), those times when distant acquaintances — with whom you’ve not been in contact for months — call you up and ask to introduce you to “this new business opportunity to make unlimited income in you spare time.” Don’t worry. Network marketing is not an MLM scheme; there are no up-lines, down-lines, or secret handshakes.   Block Out The Competition  One of the best advantages for small businesses in joining a network marketing group is that, unlike most Chambers of Commerce, only one representative from each industry is allowed to join. Once you join a group, your competitors are then blocked from joining the same group. So even if you’re in the backyard of one of the largest hosting companies in the world, once you join a particular networking group, you and only you will have the opportunity to market your services to the business leaders in that group. Some companies join multiple groups, sending different representatives to different groups in order to corner the local market.   Relationships First  Network marketing is about relationships and about giving as much as receiving. Sure, it’s about growing your business and gaining new clients, but first, it’s about several non-competing business owners agreeing to help each other in business. Before anyone is going to endorse your business, they must know you, trust you and understand your business. And what better endorsement than that of someone who actually knows you?    Network marketing involves a weekly meeting of local business professionals. Yes, weekly. How else are you going to learn to promote the businesses of the others in the group but by spending time with them, getting to know their business? How else are you going to learn what the other members of the group need? Your commitment to the other members will be returned by their commitment to you. How the meetings are conducted varies depending on the group, but every good network marketing group has several professional entrepreneurs learning about each others’ businesses and building relationships of mutual trust — even friendships.   During the week, while your network marketing partners are out doing business for themselves, they may hear a client, friend or relative express a need to promote their business or organization. This provides the perfect opportunity for your friend to recommend you as a professional in the field of web site hosting, development and marketing. And you will do the same for them. That’s what network marketing is all about.  It’s About Educating Yourself on Other People’s Businesses  Each week, the meetings give members an opportunity to update each other about their businesses. This information is key to understanding the types of business the others are seeking (for example, is the realtor specializing in commercial or residential property?). If you are a host who doesn’t do design or programming, you might ask the group to help you find a reputable designer in the area and invite him or her to join the group. Over time, these folks can turn into your best resellers.   Educate the group on the type of business you’re looking for. Do you want power users who know the value of having all the bells and whistles on their accounts, or the small business owner who can get by with a browser-driven website building program and email? Are you specializing in realty websites or eCommerce stores? Educating the group on the specific type of business you’re seeking will help them find the kind of leads you’re looking for.   Explain what kind of business you’re not looking for. Explain to the group what a bad lead would be. For example, if a potential customer is MCSA- (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator) certified and looking for hosting company when all you do is Linux hosting, it’s probably a bad lead.   Educate the group on what key phrases to listen for, like “eCommerce” or “online marketing,” that are signals that the person might have a need for your services. Let your fellow networkers know that if they come across a person who complains about their website, you want to meet with that person.   Warm Referrals vs. Cold Leads  There are few leads less productive than someone who says, “I know this guy who has an ugly website, and here’s his business card. You should give him a call.” And yet, a lot of people think that this qualifies as a helpful lead! A good networking group discourages this type of cold lead. The most successful network marketing groups give warm referrals, where the potential customer has specifically expressed interest in hearing from you. And what could be better than getting endorsements from a trusted third party?   A good networking group encourages members to listen to the needs of the people they come in contact with and getting them together with someone who can meet that need. For example, say your networking group includes a banker named Tom and a mortgage broker named Rick. If, during the course of the day, you hear someone complaining about credit card debt, you know that you can put them in touch with Tom, who can help them find better ways to manage their debt. Or Rick, the mortgage broker who specializes in helping people who have tarnished credit to get refinancing so that they can get out of trouble. The advantage is that you know Tom and Rick personally because you meet with them every week, and perhaps have even used their services yourself. You ask your friend if he or she would like to talk to Tom or Rick. Your friend says yes. You exchange business cards. And now you have a warm lead to pass along. And in return, Rick and Tom are out there telling others about your Web hosting business, drumming up warm leads for you.  Top networking organizations close billions of dollars worth of business every year, through warm referrals just like those described above. And you can get a slice of it.  Unlearning what you know  It’s easy to be selfish about our businesses. Society encourages us to ask “what’s in it for me?” Network marketing takes a different approach, creating a measurable process of business development based on giving to other entrepreneurs as well as gaining from them. The by-product of this give-and-take approach is that business growth happens for everyone involved.   Some people never understand this. If you only pitch your business to members of your group, trying to get them to buy, instead of educating the members to do your pitching for you, the maximum benefit from the group is not attained.  Your Weekly Sales Meeting  Consider the meeting of your network marketing group as your “weekly sales meeting.” They are your sales team. Just as larger companies have sales teams, so do you (however, yours only costs a few hundred dollars a year). The weekly meeting is your chance to educate your sales team on special deals, new products, updates on services, and all the other elements that make up a good sales meeting.   The Resulting Bottom Line  Of course, network marketing is all about business and improving the bottom line. But like a great recipe, you have to add measured ingredients in order to make a great meal. A mouthful of pure sugar is nothing compared to chocolate chip cookies! The “ingredients” of personal relationships, warm referrals, regular attendance, and a generous attitude contribute to the effectiveness of your network marketing group and, ultimately, your bottom line. The new business you generate — plus the savings you may receive on other members’ products and services will more than pay for your membership in the group. Think of it: several thousand dollars in Web design and hosting business, just for showing up for breakfast or lunch once a week. You can’t get a better deal anywhere.

By Patrick Gaul  Pullout (if required): Finding the right match, much like the dating process, can take some trial and error, but the right fit can make for a happy arrangement and, consequently, happy customers. The classic win-win scenario.     Technology product and service companies have long adhered to the “change or die” mantra. It’s not just a way of keeping competitive. Many times it’s a means of survival. Web-related industries, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Web hosting companies continually partner with other product or service providers to help them meet growing customer needs or to maintain a broad offering to stay competitive. These companies must continue to reinvent themselves to remain profitable.  In the ISP world, companies such as Earthlink and AOL offer valued-added products that meet newly expanded (or just more visible) customer needs, such as “free” spam protection or, in the case of NetZero, offering high-speed Internet at a premium versus its “free”, restrictive dial-up service.   The Web hosting industry is no different when it comes to finding value-added service offerings to improve the attractiveness of its services. Why generate a couple of dollars a month to host a site, when you can also create revenue streams by offering interactive services, email marketing, search engine optimization and other complementary services that position your company as more of a comprehensive ‘one stop shop’ provider.  For many customers, managing all of the services that go into having an effective and profitable Web presence are cumbersome. Customers are increasingly looking for more comprehensive service offerings that meet not only their hosting needs, but also their Web design and marketing needs. Many customer prefer dealing with one vendor for all of their needs, enabling them to put their website worries out of sight and out of mind.  This is wonderful in theory, but in practice, it takes real legwork and capital to take on the expense of growing your service offerings. For this reason, savvy industry players provide more comprehensive service offerings through reputable third-party vendors or partners. Finding the right match, much like the dating process, can take some trial and error, but the right fit can make for a happy arrangement and, consequently, happy customers. The classic win-win scenario.  What are some things you should consider when you are looking for the right service provider to accent your current service offering? More importantly, how do you find a partner that truly presents a revenue opportunity, but also echoes the values or your service offering to customers? After all, a partner is a reflection of your reputation and credibility. It’s not enough to add a new service, your partner needs to provide the same quality and caliber of services that your customers are familiar with. The wrong decision can cause customer churn and dissatisfaction. The right choice can pay huge dividends.  First, what you should consider. As you make this kind of business decision, understand a couple of things:  1. This will change, in some way, the dynamics of your business. Be sure this is a product or service your customer base will react to (positively). Take the time to survey customers, do market research, anything to validate your opinion before investing the capital and energy to seek out the right vendor partner. Most importantly, determine that the new service is one that your customers want to buy. 2. Again, this partner is an extension of your brand and your reputation—if the service is unreliable, or worse, sub par, regardless of why, it will be you that is at fault in the eyes of the customer. Maybe they know it’s “powered by X”, but in the end your company delivered it and is therefore either the hero or the punching bag. 3. Look at your prospective partner’s track record and customer base. If their customer base is similar to yours, and they’ve not only earned industry recognition and accolades for their product, but also for their customer service, it’s a safe bet that your customers would react similarly. 4. Look at your potential partner as a way to strengthen your brand. If you’re looking to add a vendor in a particular category, you may want to avoid going with the new kid on the block. This decision can actually weaken the strength of your brand. Look for established players with good brand recognition in the industry. Just like companies that position themselves as Microsoft Certified vendors, a strong brand name partner can add to the credibility, reliability and value of your product offering. 5. Determine how your partner will work with you to grow the business. If the partner is merely providing you with a solution to resell, that’s not enough. How can the partner bring more business to the table for your core service offering? You’re investing in ways to bring them more business, a true partner should want to reciprocate. You should consider pooling marketing resources and human capital to sell your combined services.   Of course, you must also know what products or services you want to offer. In order to determine what products and services you should consider offering, it is best to compare notes from numerous sources. Industry analysts will offer their thoughts on emerging technologies and the next big thing, but what will really hit home with your customers—today and quarters from now?  Customer surveys are good ways of getting a pulse on what your customers consider top priority features and services. Step back and take a good look at what your customers are spending money on. Look for growth opportunities in your industry. If you’re a Web hosting company that notices customers spending $50 a year on Web hosting and $10,000 a year on search engine marketing, what service would you rather offer? By combining industry research with customer buying patterns, you should be able to identify new areas of growth for your company.  (Bold first two lines below / maybe italics to see if it looks better ) Once you determine a field of possibilities for your extended service offerings, it is time to consider the provider. Ask yourself the following questions about your relationship with the vendor:  1. Am I comfortable with the supplier’s suite of offerings and confident in its reliability and delivery?  2. Can the supplier help me meet my customers’ needs—do they have the infrastructure to meet demand?  3. Does the supplier recognize my value and truly understand my business?  4. Is the supplier’s channel strategy supportive of, as opposed to competitive with, its reseller partners?  5. Am I one of a select few resellers for this vendor’s wares?  6. Does the supplier invest in activities that help my business?  7. What kind of revenue sharing arrangement can be agreed on? 8. Can we sell into each other’s customer base and does that present significant opportunities for my company, or is that more a value proposition for the partner? You should also consider questions around the vendor’s relationship with your customers: 1. Is there technology leadership, a clear vision for its channel or distribution strategy and good primary demand creation in the marketplace? Do they have adequate customer service to support the needs and answer the questions customers will have? 2. Does the product/technology align with the added value you have created or are creating for your customers?  3. Does the product or technology allow you to penetrate existing customers more deeply and/or create new customers? Will it create a potential churn situation?  4. Through this relationship, can you secure the investments necessary to make a go of it? A thorough and clear assessment of all the necessary investments--including technical education, certification requirements, sales training, etc., all need to be considered.    (Bold this sentence below)  As you narrow down the field of potential suitors for your company, try to avoid some common pitfalls as well:  1. Unclear expectations or rules—Ensure that communication with your potential partner is crystal clear and you both have an understanding of what the other is after, how the arrangement will work and what the limitations are, if appropriate. Meticulous documentation of all phone calls and correspondence will help create a paper trail of the partnership’s evolution and can be useful if there is a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the agreement. 2. Realistically set expectations—it is the rare case where an added product or service will create instant millionaires over night. Ensure that both sides have an understanding of the costs involved, timelines, processes and reporting procedures to track customer responsiveness and, if the offering does not catch on, at what point it would be time to sever ties? 3. Flexibility with technology—Because your partner works with the platform or technology you’re using today does not necessarily mean that it will work with the platform or technology you migrate to tomorrow. Find out in advance how flexible the product or service is to the inevitably changing nature of technology so that as you adjust to remain competitive, you don’t have to cease offering a product or service that may become very popular within your customer base. 4. Ensure that all the decision-makers are at the table from Day 1—the “search party” may find the right field of candidates but be sure that whoever is involved in the ultimate decision, be it on your side or theirs, that they are involved from the beginning of the process, to prevent miscommunication or potential issues that can delay an agreement from being completed in a timely fashion.  By keeping these questions and considerations in mind as you work to make your company more competitive and your customers happier, you should be able to develop effective, mutually beneficial partnerships with companies who will truly be able to deliver a product or service of value to your customers. The end result will be growth for you, growth for your partner and, ideally, growth in your customer base.

For years we’ve been conditioned to avoid thinking about “dot-coms,” due in no small part to the violent drop many retirement funds took around mid 2000 as a result of paying too much attention! The once legion numbers of “value added” Internet technology providers left a bad taste in many mouths. Yet recently there appears to be a resurgence in the number of small technology companies catering to ISPs and hosting providers, and their end-user customers. The service provider category has quietly yet inexorably built up new feature momentum that you can see in trade shows, magazines, the Web and most importantly of all, in the services offered by providers.  “What’s the buzz? Tell me what’s a happenin’!”  Could it be the return of the value-added service? Once again in seemingly unprecedented amounts, VA services seem to making a comeback from the heyday/mayday of the dot-com boom/bust. So what are we talking about and is it good news, bad news or no news?  A good working definition for a value-added service could be:  “Any complementary feature or application delivered as a service that enhances a core service such as ISP access or hosting. It can be billed incrementally or bundled.”   The point is, it adds value, by providing a function that in some way increases end-user satisfaction, diminishing churn, adding competitive differentiation or an incremental revenue opportunity.  The categories abound. Examples include:  • Internet call waiting (supposedly big in the dial explosion days) • Search Engine Optimization • Spam filtration • Virus protection • Directory services • E-commerce • Email Marketing   …and too many more to mention.  The automotive equivalent of the value-added service to hosting and access services may well be the auto performance enhancement shop, where your basic vehicle can be kicked up with after-market engine parts, rims and the like. For providers seeking to tune up their hosting services however, the question may well be, will value added features “pimp your ride?” Or, merely spend your money and frustrate your users.  The best answer as usual is a combination of know your customers and their needs, plan and execute well and sprinkle that with a generous dose of “caveat emptor.” Value added Internet services can be the IP-equivalent of snake oil to the unwary service provider and user.  Yet to the astute service provider who thinks as much about the sales, marketing, delivery and customer care facets of value added services, there are indeed diamonds to be reaped in financial returns.  How Big is the Market?  The first myth that needs dispelling in value added services is the gross revenue opportunity or subscriber count potential. In short, how well do these services sell? The answer, in general, is not very well at all. Examples abound. Long before the explosive adoption of broadband services, dial up Internet ruled. A hot new service hit the streets called “Internet Call Waiting.” IDC research reckoned that as many as 20% of all dial users would adopt this seemingly invaluable feature for incremental monthly fees to a dial plan of $5.00 or more per month. What business or home wouldn’t want to surf the net and take phone calls at the same time? Yet, it just never took off. Surprisingly it wasn’t broadband that killed the appeal. Even today there are millions of happy dial users in North America who still have not adopted ICW in numbers much more than 5% on a good day. Under 2% is more typical.  In general, many value added services fail to earn customer adoption or “take rates” above the low single digit level. Even the most compelling of applications among which I include “dial up accelerators” (meaning the ones that really work!) struggle to earn 10% of conversion on a user base. Internet providers might see two such value added applications in five years.  So, if you are a hosting service provider feeling threatened by competitors who seem to launch a new, clever value-added widget every three months… in real financial terms, you needn’t be. The bottom lime is, the vast majority of these applications simply don’t sell in compelling numbers. Factor in the low monthly fees many command, frequently approaching “free” and the revenue picture can be bleak.  So what’s the answer?  Don’t Sell Value Added Services – Bundle Them  Trying to cross-sell a new customer into extra services isn’t easy. The old “would you like fries with that?”… works up to a point. But in the hosting world, what are “fries?” Would you value offer be one of the following?  • Would you like more disk space with that? • More email with that? • Virus protection with that? • Search engine optimization? Before you check out, may I suggest some email marketing and some free Google ad words sprinkled in?  This approach sounds absurd but it’s more common than you think. The domestic auto industry of the ‘70s offered very little as a “standard feature” in a car. Your new Buick looked like an unmarked police cruiser until the dealer added numerous “options” to make it drivable.   All that changed when the hassle of managing all the combinations and permutations of “options” became too costly for Japanese auto makers who had to manage the business from around the word. So along came the accessory packages as included features. If you wanted a better stereo or power windows over a Tercel, you’d upgrade to a Corolla and get it all “included.”  Web hosting services are not entirely different. Service providers have a hard time (like the Japanese auto makers of the ‘70s) managing the order process, provisioning and support for a myriad of separate add-on features. It’s a lot easier to sell “Plan A”  or “Plan B” and simply include progressive features in each upgrade. Certainly your billing system will appreciate that approach.  It turns out, your customers may like it better also. Market research confirms that majority adopters, who are buying the most hosting services in large numbers today, want value and simplicity. A hosting plan that includes generous disk space, adequate email accounts and comes with spam filtration and virus scanning is expected as minimum desirable table stakes. Making these “features” billable extras, even if the base plan is stripped down and cheap, seems complicated to new users. Getting a car for $9,000 is no deal if the tires and AM radio are extra billable options.  In fact, whether your customers want it or not, bundling may be what your competition forces you to do. Symantec’s email anti virus service is available to ISPs at a low monthly cost per month per email box. It may seem a good idea to mark it up and resell it to your end users for a nominal profit. But look out if the big hosting guy down the street is a) getting a huge volume discount from Symantec and b) throwing into his hosting/email service as a “free” feature. You won’t look too attractive to your prospects by comparison.  Value Added Services Reduce Churn and Drive Sales  Bundling may not justify itself as an incremental revenue generator for the value-added service as a discrete service. No matter. If adding some new features free to you hosting plans makes users happy, that’s an important win. VA services are proven in many cases to reduce churn by adding “switching barriers.” The classic example is unified messaging such as “fax-to-email.” Imagine being a user who adopts this service. All your inbound faxes come to a unique 7-digit number and convert to an email document. Try switching to an alternate hosting provider now. No more faxes unless you carefully select and switch over to a competing unified messaging service. I call this “binding your customer with velvet ropes.” They are tied to you, but not unpleasantly. (Let’s not explore that metaphor to much.)  VA services will drive your core hosting sales whether your customers use them or not. Sound fishy? Thank consumer electronics. Does every stereo purchaser actually need HDTV, 7-channel sound, Dolby I, II, DTS, Neo and thirty six special effects modes? Consumer studies show that VHS machines with the clock set on blinking 12:00 is the norm for over half of all users. Yet the extra features have appeal that drives the initial purchase. People want to know they can use the extras if they want to, but not necessarily right now. (Or ever.)  In essence, the extra VA features provide you with credibility, consumer appeal and differentiation. Features sound good. As long as they don’t cost too much extra, why not buy them? Fundamentally, your hosting service requires numerous value added services simply to compete and appeal to the end user.  Value Added Services Don’t Sell Themselves  Many service providers are disappointed in the take rates and revenues for many value added services. The Search Engine Optimization vendors would have us believe that 30% of all users will rush to spend $29.99 to optimize their sites. “That’s twice as much as the hosting costs,” say we, but the hype continues. What’s real?  As mentioned earlier, the majority of VA services have a hard time exceeding low single digit take rates. However there are ways to improve on this.   The sales and marketing tactics employed by many providers are weak. We call this your “go-to-market” activity. Are you a passive marketer or an active one? Simply adding a link to your hosting sign-up pages saying “click here to order SEO and optimize your site for $29.99 per month,” won’t move many buyers.  Majority adopters require education, selling and sometime evangelism to get on board. Yet for some services costing $5.00 per month, how can you afford to spend the time and effort to actively sell the feature?  Numerous economical techniques drive enhanced take rates:  • Run flash demos of the value added application on your site; • Feature static screen shots showing the ease-of-use • Negotiate free trial periods with you VA service vendor and give the feature to all your users on a trial basis • Use permissioned email to your in-house base to promote the feature • Offer links to user cases and testimonials for your users to learn the benefits  None of these tactics require expensive selling programs or people, yet they work.   In a controlled test conducted by Hostopia in 2002 offering an email anti virus (paid) service for $5.00 per user per month, two hosting providers attained 3% and 5% take rate on their entire hosting users bases within 120 days while others languished below 1% for over a year. The difference? Email promotion of the service to the user base backed by a free 30 day trial offer.   Any combination of the above go-to-market tactics will dramatically impact your take rates and overall business success with VA services.  Easy Is the Word  “Easy-to-use” has become the ultimate cliché of the software and applications business. It has lost its value by over-use.  Yet “easy” is critical in more areas than the actual use of the application. The best value added services today are “end-to-end” easy.   • Easy to learn about;  • Easy to buy;  • Easy to get started and  • Easy to get support.   Any missing element in these “easies” will kill take rate and can generate the ultimate horror-show for a service provider: negative word of mouth that erodes the core service.  Finding out a customer dumped your hosting service along with 20 email accounts because they didn’t like the way your free-bundled search engine submittal worked out is a bad hair day. And not uncommon.   The best service providers today put some well-structured effort into their website that for an ounce of prevention delivers kilos of cure in a successful roll out of a VA service.  Kurant Storesense is a fast-growing e-commerce application www.kurant.com. Kurant markets largely via distribution partners such as Hostopia.com The secret to successful value added services selling is making the entire experience rewarding for end users before they are even a customer. Kurant’s president W. Curtis Pierce elaborates, “We’ve learned by five years experience that even the best services don’t sell themselves. Our most successful distributors rely heavily on a wealth of marketing support that we make available to them. Product collateral material, online tutorials, web-ready fact sheets and FAQs, feature matrices and live demo applications are all essential to successfully offering our service, or any other in our opinion.”  Hostopia research and experience with over 280 hosting service providers validates Curtis’s view. A study conducted on customer registration sites where your website visitors can order your value-added services can do much to help or  kill a product’s success. This author found that unintuitive forms, difficult navigation and ambiguous e-commerce terms for the service in question will drive “site abandonment” exceeding 20%. Interested prospects looking at your add-on services will simply abort if they don’t feel assisted throughout the online buying experience.  The best value added service vendors will assist their ISP customers in all these areas.              *******  Link Networks – Too Powerful to Ignore By Gord Collins  Money and partnerships have always played a part in search engine rankings, but today they are helping some websites dominate the top rankings. With the diminishment of other search engine indexing factors, link networks are the number one optimization technique going today. Some innovative Web hosting companies are using this to advantage and generating a powerful search engine presence for their clients.   Search engine optimization is a huge area of potential for Web hosting and developing companies, however you should know how to plan and implement search engine optimization techniques to be effective. It is competitive, and finding advantages is key. Search engines use ever-evolving mathematical techniques including latent semantic analysis, topic sensitive pagerank, link popularity estimates, authority site analysis, and link reputation analysis to screen in the best documents. Despite that sophistication, they can’t detect everything and it’s these cracks in the algorithms that optimizers try to exploit to sustain their presence or get an unfair advantage over competitors.  We’re about to take a look at how SEOs use link networks and how you can go about analyzing them and focusing their power.  A link network refers to the hyperlinking between websites controlled by one or more entities. They are usually referred to as affiliated sites (not to be confused with affiliate marketing). The owner can be a Web host, search engine optimization company, Web design company, Web developer, publishing company, a partnership of businesses or entrepreneurs, or a single corporation possessing numerous websites. In the ethical SEO community, linking together unrelated sites for ranking purposes may be classified as a spam tactic if the websites are on unrelated topics, and the linking is done only to manipulate search engine rankings. Admittedly, it’s a gray area since any collusion of website owners to dominate rankings could be interpreted as an unfair tactic, if not spam.  Is network linking always spam? No, not always, but the search engine must still try to filter out this artificial inflation of PageRank and link reputation by any website owner. They do their best, however search engines can only detect so much about a link network through spidering and its own index algorithms. Despite the search engines’ confidence in its algorithm’s filtering capabilities, a mathematical formula doesn’t help detect business arrangements behind the scenes and a few ingenious tacticians have found ways to beat the filters.  In the case of a corporation that owns five related businesses that are actually doing business with each other, it is reasonable that they would link those business websites. It’s up to search engines to determine whether this linking is an unfair advantage. A non -profit business may link to its supporter’s websites, as another example. So, the question of unfairness and spamming really is a gray area, yet SEOs such as those who belong to the SEO Consultants Organization must abide by ethical guidelines.     Buying into Link Networks  Paid text link advertising is another form of search engine visibility that may provide an unfair advantage even though it is an acceptable form of advertising. It’s really up to the search engine to filter paid links out.  If you have the Google toolbar installed, do a search right now in Google using a popular phrase such as DVD players.  Then check the Web pages that link to those top ranking sites. You’ll notice a lot of their outbound links are in sidebar advertising sections, or in text menu links at the bottom of the page. They’re not part of the core content, yet are very effective in boosting the rank of the advertiser’s site.  This is the current state of optimization; the use of paid or negotiated links within a network of sites for the purpose of boosting rankings. This isn’t to say that on-page optimization isn’t important. A link only has potential until it is utilized in a very strategic way. It is how these links are created that separates top search engine optimizers from the rest.     When There Were Other Ways to Optimize  Before last year, Webmasters and SEO specialists could generate high rankings using a number of other methods such as keyword density building, link exchanges, and free links from off-topic websites. They didn’t have to go out and spend hard cash to get someone to link to them.   Some of these general tactics were being implemented too aggressively, however, and the search engines had to start doing something about them.  They, particularly Google, decided to thwart SEO efforts by diminishing the effect of on-site content development and optimization, link exchanges and even paid links. This helped keep the index a little cleaner, but it also made search engine visibility harder to achieve for those without a lot of cash or a corral of partnered websites.  The Web gained its popularity and Google its pre-eminence in search, through its huge, free, and accessible database of Web pages. They weren’t all within pretty, eCommerce sites, but most had value. The Web created access through links and soon only search engines would have the ability to weed through billions of those pages to find the best. Every Web developer, SEO and content creator believed they had a chance at gaining access to online readers and customers. Every website no matter what level of funding could present its best value to anyone else that was searching for it. For many small businesses, the hope is gone and only a prayer is left.  The popularity-based system based on linking worked well for Google, but over time many learned how to beat the system and some learned they could simply pay for it. A few (black hat SEOs) practiced spamming and paid links at a pervasive and technical level, which resulted in Google being inundated with deceptive, low quality Web pages in their indexes.  They needed a way to filter these spam pages out and they have introduced a number of brilliant indexing innovations.  In cleaning up the index, they may have thrown the baby out with the bathwater.   The methods that most website promoters and SEOs arranged to get top rankings were eliminated, except for two – membership/inclusion in a link network and paid text link advertising on a single high ranking site.  Recently, big business has discovered search engine marketing and search engine optimization. Big SEO companies have positioned themselves to serve that big money market.  With an increasing amount of money available, it is much easier to enhance your current optimization project with paid link placements. If smaller SEOs are still getting high rankings for their clients, they are very adept.   Link Network Cluster  Two link networks exist: vertical and horizontal. Vertical link networks may involve one company with many subsidiaries or a group of related businesses that serve one another on a long term basis.   Some companies don’t have ten to twenty subsidiaries and won’t link to their vertical network partners, so they have to look for other websites to interlink with. This horizontal network of usually unrelated and perhaps competing businesses has much more potential than a vertical network, yet it is the kind a search filter may discount if the sites are on unrelated topics.    The number of potential link partners is almost unlimited. However, although Google does credit just about any link, it prefers to see links from topically related sites, particularly a high ranking site in a particular keyword theme is known as an authority site.  These popular sites can be the kingpin of both vertical and horizontal link networks.  A link network doesn’t have to be an equal trade off between all sites involved. Very often certain targeted or kingpin sites are selected to receive the greatest amount of Pagerank and link reputation from the others. This is where it gets really creative and keywords come into play.  Remember that SEO is about more than just linking and keyword density. It’s how you use your keywords and links that boosts your site to the top.  Some SEOs will attempt to use three-way link arrangements. That is, site A links to Site B, then B links to C, and C links back to A. In this way, there is no direct link exchange between two sites. Search engines can detect this arrangement however. It doesn’t take much processing power to discover a three-way link scheme however, so it is usually ineffective unless it is well hidden within a much more complex linking scheme. Search engines can detect if websites reside on the same IP address yet you still see companies throwing up mirrored sites and redundant content sites on the same IP. Redundant or similar content is filtered out in order to decrease the clutter in the index. Recent Google updates have focused on this particular issue.  As search engines improve link analysis techniques, three-way links will lose favor and more complex linking schemes will be sought. This will become the prime area of focus for SEOs.  Most of us will need to develop links with other independent websites. Since website owners know the value of a link and want something in return for it, you have to offer either a return link (which is now discounted by Google) or just outright buy a link on their site.  In studying link networks, I’ve discovered that some Webmasters/SEOs are involved in more than one network. This makes the total link network very complex and easier to hide a strategy within. Detection only happens when the linking becomes too intense or some mistaken links are put in, thus letting the search engine’s link filter find the missing pieces.  Paid Link Networks  A growing number of websites act as text link advertising brokers. They facilitate the connection between buyers and sellers.  Anyone who’s looked into buying links knows how expensive they are. That’s why they’d prefer to join a partnership of websites who will link in ways that a search engine like Google can’t figure out which are legitimate and which are there to manipulate rankings.  Yes, Google does try to filter out paid links yet about the best they can do right now is to put links into a waiting area some have called the “sandbox.”  This only delays the ranking benefit a website will receive.  They also analyze linking patterns to detect link exchanges and link networks, however the best they can do is to filter out the poorly planned ones. Those who use link networks strategically with much forethought can successfully boost their site’s PageRank and link reputation. Figure 1.1 shows an unsuccessful way to link related websites.  Most sites that rank highly are involved in link networks, whether as partnerships or purchased from a network of sites, or both. Type in any popular keyword phrases and check out the sites listed there. If you have the Google toolbar installed in your browser, you’ll be able to check the links leading to those high ranking sites. You’ll notice those links appear to be paid link spots, not a link from a story, new article or information page. The link is only present because someone has bought or bartered for its placement on the page.  Conclusion  Web design, Web hosting, Web development and corporations may be sitting on a gold mine of high ranking sites. Search engines are homepages of the Web so high rankings equates to visibility to vast numbers of potential customers, and huge brand awareness.  It’s important however, to understand that link networks only represent a potential, and the hundreds of links and keywords within the site still have to be used strategically. You can’t just link up the home pages according to a scheme and expect to win in today’s competitive search results. The challenge of top level search engine optimization is exciting and demanding.   If you are considering getting involved in the link networks, you should realize that at some point in time, they will be discovered by the search engines and will lose their rank boosting power. And one small strategic mistake can lead to detection of the whole network!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gord Collins is Director of SEO Bay Street SEO [http://www.bayst-search-engine-optimization.com/index.html] and has been a search engine optimization specialist since 1998.

Bids on the most popular pay-per-click search engines have topped an astounding $15 cost-per-click for Web hosting related terms. Consumers, and we are ALL consumers, are aware that just because a company is willing to pay a disproportionate amount of money to obtain a click does not make them the best provider/company/store/resource etc.   Do Web hosting companies think that little of us consumers? Most of us see beyond the marketing dollars and the fluff that is spread thick across the board time and again. There is a reason cost-per-click prices are this high for Web hosting related terms: a plethora of Web hosts will pay $10 to get a click-through because it’s the easiest form of marketing.   What hosting companies don’t appear to realize is that once you get past all the non-serious players in the hosting market, you get the same thing from them all; there’s no way to differentiate one company from another. They all offer toll-free support, PHP & MySQL, more email boxes than you’ll ever use, SSH, SSL, CGI-Bin, and so forth. Simply put, there’s no discernible difference between most companies other than those willing to pay $12 per click on Overture and those paying only $6.   Unfortunately, throwing money at your marketing, without the effort, will only win you clicks, not sales. And thus, here is a simple list of 5 things Web hosting companies should do (but don’t) in their marketing efforts:   1. Be real and provide value. This would not only include posting pictures of staff members and bios on your company website, but also sending physical mail - perhaps a welcome package to all new customers, providing helpful ‘getting started’ tips and pointers to useful resources.   One company that’s been very successful at this is CoffeeCup, which gives away several hundred dollars worth of software to all of its BlueDomino hosting customers. I know they grew extremely quickly, and at a much lower cost than most other companies out there as a result of that strategy.   Another option would be to send a free Web development book in the mail as a bonus to all new customers. Besides being a great differentiation, you’d also be helping your customers improve their Web presence by giving them information that they can apply to build better websites.   2. Provide something useful for free. Besides seeing practically the same list of features on each hosting site, the other thing you’ll quickly notice is that most companies don’t provide a reason for you to stick around or otherwise engage with the company.   Offer a free ‘up-time monitoring’ service, regardless of which hosting company the prospect is with. Each ‘your site is down’ email would include an ad for your hosting services. This gives you repeated contact with the customer and you are the first name they see when they need to look for another host.     3. Provide social proof. Most hosting sites don’t provide the names or URLs of any of its customers. If they do, they make it impossible to verify them, listing ‘J. Smith’ as the reference.  If your customers are truly happy with your service, they will talk about it.  So, go a step further and provide the full names and URLs of happy customers right on the front page next to your toll-free number for sales and support.  4. Listen to your customers. Regular surveys of your customers can provide a wealth of knowledge to measure how you’re doing, and to gain suggestions and ideas on how to improve.   5. Keep in touch. Once a sale is made, few companies bother to keep in touch with their customers unless support is needed. That is a big mistake. By keeping in touch via email and post, hosting companies stand to gain more referred customers (especially if they rewarded current clientele for sending new business). Don’t skimp on customer retention, it’s a lot cheaper than getting a new customer.   ****** Matt Mickiewicz is the VP of Ad Sales at SitePoint.com, a publisher of an online magazine, blogs, email newsletters and print books targeting Web Developers.

By David Geer  Pull quote: “Cyber crime is only going to keep growing along with the number of new Internet users and personal computers. Our parents taught us to lock our doors or be wary of strangers; ironically, the Internet breeds the opposite as users are constantly tempted to explore new places and stimuli,” says Briggs.  Lead: Whether you realize it, you and your customers are being mugged and swindled by bands of puppetted Internet computers called botnets.  Case files  According to a November 3rd New Scientist press release, June saw the humbling of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo as their web servers were nixed by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack levied by botnets, a.k.a. zombie-nets.   Botnets are the most effective means of accomplishing DDoS attacks. “With the explosion in broadband connections an individual with malicious intent can establish a very large network of compromised machines very quickly. Those machines can flood a web server and make it unresponsive,” says Clarence Briggs, chief executive officer, AIT, home to the most secure data centers in the hosting world.  Last summer’s DDoS on the three Internet titans is typical of a growing trend toward using botnets to extort Web-based enterprises. Cyber-hoodlums like those responsible will gladly refrain from bringing your site down, for a fee. But extortion isn’t the only racket these bully driven bots are into.  From November 2003 to November 2004 Internet crime rose sharply. Organized crime families have discovered that there is money to be made from spamming, scamming, fraud, phishing and other means of duping innocent netizens.  According to a November 16th VeriSign press release, while Spam continues to be the primary vector for all of these Internet crimes, networks of captured machines or “botnets” have become the most common method of spreading Spam. Botnets, therefore, are the chief tool of syndicates bent on turning Internet crime into a capitalistic venture.   Botnets can cost you whether the criminals make out or not. According to a New Scientist press release, an executive at a satellite TV firm in Massachusetts has been charged with hiring several botnets to disrupt the Web sites of three rivals, costing one of their web-hosting firms $1 million. That’s what it cost in a case where the perp was caught.   What can you do?  What CAN you do? If you’re up on your patches, anti-virus, Spam protection and other security measures then botnets are probably not infecting you. But that’s not your biggest problem. Vulnerable consumer systems are the ones being infected.  These machines become botnets, which attack you and your customers. These DDoS attacks can still bring you down. Spam and Internet swindles are still getting through to your endusers.  Here are some action points for hosts combating botnets:  1. Make generous use of security products such as smart firewalls with intrusion detection and desktop security measures like software firewalls and anti-virus products. 2. Invest in the human touch with a fully manned operation watching your network for suspicious traffic behaviors. 3. Make endusers part of your team in combating botnets.  If we could convince endusers to use discretion when clicking on e-mail attachments, if we could get them to keep their system patches up to date, if we could encourage them to make judicious use of common security measures, there would be no vulnerable systems, no zombies, no botnets.  Here are some points for your endusers:  1. Never open attachments that aren’t expected or scanned by anti-virus protection or other appropriate malware detection products. 2. Never visit unauthorized or suspect Web sites. Like Spam, some infected Web sites have been used to open backdoors and turn systems into zombies. 3. Apply security patches religiously.  4. Use quality anti-virus software and firewalls and keep them up to date. 5. Err on the side of exclusion. I recommend the desktop security measures and resources at http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/unwanted.htm.  For those who must, or prefer to use Microsoft products, the Hosts file, Restricted Zone and other measures, available at the above site, will go a long way in excluding known bad Internet destinations from your system. Some of the suggested configurations can help secure against hacks, as well. As much as we may someday improve on it, enduser behavior demands that we make ample use of every security measure available to us.  “Cyber crime is only going to keep growing along with the number of new Internet users and personal computers. Our parents taught us to lock our doors or be wary of strangers; ironically, the Internet breeds the opposite as users are constantly tempted to explore new places and stimuli,” says Briggs.  Sidebar  Beware the central server  An attacker’s central server takes control of vulnerable computers and uses them as bots. It’s easier to find and kill the central server than to locate and eliminate each bot, especially when the central server can make more bots to keep their numbers high.  According to a November 3rd New Scientist press release, once a zombie computer is found, the bot inside it can be dissected to find the address of the controlling IRC chat room so that it can be taken down and the central server can be traced. However, some attackers are now covering their tracks by making the bots corrupt their own program code when extracted.   “In order to combat botnets, it is vital that networks be tightened down from a security standpoint; however, policy and best practices are what it takes to win the war. Never download or even click on a link that you are not sure about, and train your employees and family to do the same. A simple and cute temptation can be all that is needed to setup a "botshop". Prevention means policing behavior and instilling smart habits in users,” says Clarence Briggs, chief executive officer, AIT.

A computer hardware dealer from Wisconsin. An Internet marketer from Washington state. They were among the Internet entrepreneurs who spent a November weekend in Fayetteville, North Carolina at a customer conference organized by hosting company AIT (http://www.ait.com).     The company has conducted these conferences for years, with the itinerary and attendance growing each time. From the tech-heavy material during the early-adopter days of the Internet to the increased emphasis on packaging technology as a business utility, conferences have mirrored the maturation of the industry. “Our resellers are working with customers and potential customers who want to see the value of digital services; the conferences give us the opportunity to show our resellers how to do that,” said Kirk deViere, AIT’s Chief Operating Officer.  The two-day sessions are a lively mix of hands-on product demos, strategy sessions, Q&A, technical instruction, and more. Jim Hatley has been an AIT reseller for about five years and is typical of the entrepreneurs who incorporate the company’s hosting and eCommerce services into their businesses. Hatley’s primary business is Web design, and the reseller program means additional revenue sources. “There is no substitute for the recurring revenue model,” says Hatley. “After you design a Web site, the relationship with that customer basically ends, aside from periodic touch-ups. They’re going to need the hosting and other services anyway, so it makes sense for them and for me to build on an existing relationship.”    The VAR approach comes at a time when the Internet in general, and Web hosting in particular, is approaching a third wave of customer adoption. The first wave centered on a technically knowledgeable customer who frequently needed little more than power and Internet connectivity. As the second phase – sales and marketing professionals who understood the business utility of the Internet – began to take hold, the digital shakeout hit. Data centers built in anticipation of rapid growth were suddenly shuttered; several providers went out of business, selling equipment for pennies on the dollar; and, the companies left standing discovered there are times when treading water is a good thing. “In the long run, that period provided a necessary dose of reality,” said AIT’s Chief Executive Clarence Briggs. “It forced us to re-think our strategy and anticipate the industry’s revival.”    Low-cost dedicated servers have been a part of that rebirth. So has a renewed emphasis on product development, in response to hosting customers who began demanding more from their service providers. “This has been a year of innovation because hosting itself is becoming a commodity,” according to Briggs. “Every hosting company provides disk space and bandwidth; the challenge is to also give customers value through tools that help them and their customers be successful.”  Industry-wide, companies have pushed out anti-spam software, marketing tools, Web site templates for easier and less expensive design, security features, and more. It is part of the continued push to capitalize on the small and medium business market, a segment that is much more likely to outsource IT responsibilities than big corporations are. Paul Payne of Treasure Island, Florida, sees that first hand, selling digital marketing materials like brochures, catalogs, newsletters and magazines to clients in a cross-section of industries. “This is the type of outsourcing the public doesn’t hear about, the type through which companies save money,” says Payne. “My customers all need to market their services, but they don’t need to hire a full-time staff to produce their materials.”   With small to medium business as the key market for service providers – representing the third wave of hosting customers – resellers like Payne are in an ideal position. The next adopters of digital tools are the ‘show-me’ type, the ones who are skeptical about the virtual as a viable business. As a rule, hosting companies tend to be remote providers; there is no such thing as an Internet presence and eCommerce storefront, not yet. Resellers can rely on a provider’s infrastructure and tech support personnel while adding the personal touch that comes with being where your customers are. “Mine is a small town, so when I call on a potential client, chances are they either know me personally or know some of the same people, so the initial trust barrier is easier to overcome,” says Hatley. “After the sale, customers won’t become account numbers; I can actually service a customer as opposed to simply providing that customer with a service.”    Helping to make the case for resellers like Hatley is the continued growth of eCommerce. For example, Forrester Research reports that customer eCommerce spending will lead the IT spending charge in 2004, growing by 4.8 percent. In fact, Forrester estimates that three-fourths of companies will maintain or increase their IT spending for eCommerce initiatives based on a survey of 212 eCommerce decision-makers. In-Stat/MDR estimated that small business IT spending totaled $161 billion last year and would reach $215 billion by the end of 2008.  Staying relevant was a major topic at the AIT conference, and one way that resellers are doing that is by forming alliances that bring complimentary skills together. That’s what Paul LaFlamme did during the spring conference.  LaFlamme is from Savannah, Georgia, and describes his business as having shifted from a Web design company that offered hosting to a hosting company that offers design. “I met a programming specialist from Ohio at the last conference,” said LaFlamme. “We talked just about every day after that, and so far, we’ve built a site for a travel company and have other projects in the works.”    It is a powerful combination – the industrial grade infrastructure and technical staff of a core services provider, and the personalized service offered by resellers – that has a proven track record.  That record will be tested as SMBs wade further into IT waters. Still, the opportunity for growth is there, something that is a given in this industry.    ########### *********** Successful Disaster Recovery: It’s All in the Planning by Suresh Srinivasan  In the information age, productivity miracles have become almost commonplace. But living digitally also entails risk – the kind of risk that can bring a business to the precipice:  •  According to the National Archives and Records Administration, 93 percent of companies that lost their data centers for 10 days or more due to a disaster filed for bankruptcy within a year of the disaster. Fifty percent of businesses filed for bankruptcy immediately.  •   When calculating hard and soft costs, the average company spends between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per year for desktop-oriented disasters – so reports the 7th Annual ICSA Lab’s Virus Prevalence Survey.  A new Veritas Software/Dynamic Markets survey found that three years after 9/11, 43 percent of organizations worldwide are still not ready to respond to a major disaster. The report, which surveyed 1,259 IT professionals around the world, found that only 38 percent claimed to have comprehensive, integrated disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place — even though 92 percent acknowledged that serious consequences would result if they were faced with a major disruption to their IT infrastructure.  For small and mid-size businesses, a disaster recovery plan is not just a good idea, it’s a necessity. But whatever a company’s size, the threat of disaster is real, with new virus and worm attacks launched regularly, threatening data and network security at every turn – and the pressure to protect information and business systems is not only economic but now comes with the full force of the law. Legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), along with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and stringent SEC and IRS regulations, require many industry segments to provide information safeguards in case of disaster.  For an organization whose very existence depends upon its Web-based applications, disaster can strike in any number of ways: viruses, worms, network failure, hardware crash, power outage, fire, natural disaster or cyber terrorist denial-of-service attack. But despite the growing threats, small and mid-size companies are especially vulnerable when it comes to disaster preparedness – in part because many lack both the consciousness to integrate disaster planning into the normal routine and the tools/staff to make preparedness happen.  According to a nationwide survey conducted for BroadSpire late last year, more than one-third of American workers are “quite” or “somewhat” concerned that a natural disaster or terrorist act could take out computer systems at work. Another survey, conducted by Imation, reports that about 30 percent of companies lack a formal disaster recovery strategy and 64 percent of companies say their data backup and disaster recovery plans have significant vulnerabilities.  Virtually every corporation of any appreciable size has an IT department staffed with people who are trained to analyze their company’s level of preparedness and then enhance it, as needed. But smaller companies – many of which don’t have any specialized IT knowledge in-house – must make a conscious effort to learn the vocabulary and practices of disaster preparedness.     Who’s at Risk?  Nearly every small and mid-size company is vulnerable to the effects of a disaster to a certain extent, but businesses that have the most to lose are those that rely on eCommerce, email or other Web-based communication, and online collaboration tools to sustain their critical business functions. The more connected they are, the higher the risk and the more they have to lose.  Unfortunately, many smaller companies increase their own likelihood of encountering a disaster with indiscriminate processes – like installing random applications on computers without knowing the implications, opening email attachments from unfamiliar addresses and downloading trial versions of software and leaving them on the server. Technology redundancies, while helpful in many cases to keep things running, can cause a small failure to quickly turn catastrophic as it moves unimpeded throughout an entire network.  Further, small and mid-size businesses are perennially understaffed, often leaving preventative routines like data backup and virus software updates to fall by the wayside – making companies vulnerable to disaster and not prepared to mitigate the damage once a disaster occurs.  But disasters can be anticipated and planned for, and data and systems often can be recovered. All it takes is forethought and some preventative action. Disaster recovery plans are not just for the big guys. With so much riding on data integrity, no business can afford to ignore disaster planning. There are several basic steps a company of any size can incorporate to fend off disasters and increase the chances of recovery when one occurs.   Procedures as the Secrets to Prevention  Many of the most important steps in disaster recovery are inexpensive and relatively easy to implement. The key is developing procedures that mitigate risk while protecting critical business functions and information.  Begin by developing a clear, repeatable process for backing up data and your entire network -- and then make sure to follow through and do the backups faithfully, according to that schedule. This is the basis for all disaster recovery plans – even if it’s just one person using the Windows backup software, copying data to a DVD or CD and taking that media home or to another location. It’s basic, it has zero cost implications and it works.  The next key step is to make sure backups are in fact usable. According to a recent study by Storage Magazine, only half of all businesses ever test their tape backups and of those that do, 77 percent find they are unable to fully recover data from those tapes.  Retail virus detection software solutions provide another critical layer of protection, as long as they’re kept up-to-date. In addition, install an email filtering program and keep Windows updates current.  Don’t store everything – email, accounting software, customer database, etc. -- on one server. Distribute key data and applications on to more than one machine, so all is not lost if a system crashes.  Once all these pieces are in place, establish some company-wide guidelines to help prevent a virus-related disaster. These might include shutting down computers every night, a schedule of regular updates and patches, periodic password changes, rules about opening email attachments, guidelines on how to protect data while working in public places (like airplanes or Starbuck’s), and tips on how to ensure the physical security of laptop computers and actual office buildings.   Plan, Plan, Plan  Any business that has data to lose should have a disaster recovery plan in place. It doesn’t require an IT expert – in fact, there’s software available that helps companies format their own plans. Some key elements of a good plan include:  •  Assignments – Employees need clear-cut roles once a disaster happens, and these need to be determined before disaster strikes. For example, someone should be in charge of communications (working with the phone company or email host to reestablish connection, if necessary), another person can oversee data recovery, someone else can make sure the company Web site is accessible, etc.  •   A communication plan – Provide a list of key cell phone numbers to employees to keep handy in case you lose phones and email. Have someone designated to call important contacts – clients, vendors, partners – to tell them what’s going on and how to reach you in the meantime. Make arrangements in advance with your host (if applicable) to provide a backup email system to access during or after a disaster, to keep critical business communications flowing.  •   Vendors – Have a list of vendors to contact for help. This is critical, and should be documented somewhere accessible. Keep hard copies in the office and off-site (possibly at home), and post a version in a secure area of your Web site or your host’s Web site.  •   Priorities – Examine your company’s data and business functions, and rank them in order of importance to establish a protocol of recovery – making sure your limited resources are focused on the information and applications that are most critical to your business survival. Practice this order to verify that it works and makes sense.  •   Training – Train your employees. Individual users are security’s weakest link. Having proper procedures in place is only effective if all employees know them and follow them. Conduct periodic disaster drills to reinforce the procedures set forth in your plan and the roles that have been assigned.  Outside Help – Look to Your Host  If your company works with a Web hosting company, your host can do a variety of things to protect data and Web functions in case of disaster, speeding up recovery time significantly.  For starters, ask your host to keep your contact and vendor lists in a secure, web-accessible location outside the company’s data center. This may not seem important at the moment, but after a fire the last thing you want is to realize the only surviving copy of these lists is stored at the home of your former business manager – who moved out of state two years earlier.  Also ask your host to provide an instant messaging platform to serve as the critical communications system between all employees when disaster strikes, a backup email system to capture corporate email and prevent “bounces” during an outage at the main data center, and a “hot” standby email system for communication during disasters. This system will work when company email doesn’t, and will allow all employees to communicate with one another – with all communications stored in backups.  Make sure your host can provide you with a geographically diverse DNS and a dedicated server to allow corporate Web sites to stay online even during a disaster. This service either can move corporate Web traffic to this standby server, or simply display a notice to end-users. Traffic can shift back to corporate data centers once the outage has been rectified.  While most disasters are not entirely preventable, there are measurable that steps small and mid-size companies can take to protect their critical business functions. The modest up-front investment will pay dividends down the road, perhaps even saving a business from the ultimate disaster – bankruptcy.    ----------------------- Suresh Srinivasan is president of BroadSpire (www.broadspire.com), a Web hosting firm in Los Angeles.

The Web Metrics You Can’t Afford to Ignore  By JoAnn McNeely & Grant Crowell  “Web analytics” and “web metrics” have become important terms for every serious professional involved in e-commerce marketing. Web analytics providers offer solutions to monitor and measure just about every activity on your web site.  These vendors are constantly re-evaluating their products, gathering customer feedback and building improvements into future product releases. With the use of new and more sophisticated web analytics, it may be time for e-commerce marketers to re-evaluate how and what you’re analyzing.  The developers of analytics solutions have a bird’s eye view of e-commerce metrics and trends--they’re in the enviable position of receiving feedback and seeing patterns across a customer base of thousands. For this article, we asked some of the leading web metrics vendors to pinpoint what they believe to be key metrics for e-commerce sites...what e-commerce marketers should be paying close attention to, and what they can’t afford to ignore.  Let’s take a closer look at the insights each provides:  COREMETRICS: THE FIVE CONVERSION POINTS   Coremetrics, a well known web metrics innovator, has developed an analytical framework widely known as the ‘5 conversion points’:  1. Visitor conversion: Total site traffic which can then be further broken down by traffic source, and revenues by source. 2. Browser conversion: The percentage of visitors who move past the top entry pages, going on to category and sub-category pages, using on-site search, reaching product detail pages, etc. 3. Shop action conversion: The percentage of visitors who add a product to their cart.  4. Buyer conversion: The percentage of visitors who complete the checkout process, the average order value, the number of items per order and item abandonment rate. 5. Repeat conversion: The ratio of new vs.repeat visitors and buyers with the relative value for each segment.      FULLY LEVERAGE THE DATA Coremetrics suggests the need to “fully leverage” the data to drive decisions. Don’t ignore observed trends, as they signal the need to delve deeper into areas that need improvement. Brett Hurt, Coremetrics Founder and Vice President of Client Services, observed that e-commerce sites need to use information derived from web metrics to allocate financial and human resources. First, determine the highest ROI from various marketing channels, programs and partners, and then reallocate marketing spend accordingly.  Similarly, assess the usage and value of site features (e.g. shopping tools, value-add content, etc.) to determine which need to be eliminated, improved upon or promoted.  “Multi-channel data should be used to supplement the above analyses as well as to drive more robust direct marketing strategies,” stressed Hurt.  “This includes marketing cost data to evaluate true return on marketing investment, as well as product margin data to be able to perform profitability analysis.” WEBTRENDS: REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, EVENT WebTrends, a market share leader in web analytics, suggests e-commerce sites focus on three groups of metrics:  • Revenue-based measures used to evaluate all marketing efforts.  • Profitability metrics which integrate the marketing and profit costs with the resulting purchase behavior including the Lifetime Value of the customer.  • Event-based metrics that provide checkpoints that identify when visitors are signaling some propensity to buy or fulfill some other site objective. One example: Visitors who viewed a product detail page or other products after their purchase are prime opportunities for a lucrative cross-sell.  Greg Drew, general manager of WebTrends, asserts that while e-commerce sites know the value of checkout behavior, they may be missing significant insights by analyzing the process in a linear way, rather than a dynamic way. Certainly, most of us design the checkout process to be as linear as possible, taking the buyer from point A to point B and point C, in a controlled fashion.  But inherent in the checkout process are multiple exit and entry points, depending on site architecture, shipping options, and even cross-sell and up-sell offers. Marketing campaigns, partner promotions and search engine keywords may also land visitors in the middle of your scenarios. The process of buying is innately complex—it’s not out of the ordinary for visitors to come to the site many times before finally converting. For all of these reasons, linear-based scenario analysis can provide an oversimplified and even dangerously inaccurate view of checkout behavior.    KEEPING VISITORS ON THE BUY PATH To determine where the problems lie and what you can do to keep more visitors on the path, Drew recommends examining five things in your checkout process: 1. All entry paths into checkout scenarios:  Which marketing and promotional efforts are driving shoppers and buyers? 2. The steps where unique visitors abandon the checkout scenario. 3. The exact path taken through the scenario, noticing whether visitors skipped steps or took a meandering path. 4. The abandonment paths visitors take when they drop out of at a checkout step. 5. Where visitors go after they convert. WEBSIDESTORY: METRICS THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE WebSideStory, one of the Web’s first ASPs, talks about tips for e-commerce operations by focusing on touchpoints throughout the customer lifecycle. These key areas provide the greatest impact on the top and bottom line of the business: • Targeting and reaching the right audience; monitoring acquisition, conversions and retention. • Creating the right messages for marketing campaigns; identify conversions by campaign attributes such as “message”, “links” or “offers”. • Maximizing home page effectiveness; analyzing multiple page visitors, where they visit, conversion statistics and optimizing based on data. Example: Measure home page links for conversion and revenue. Then modifying or removing underperforming links and measure again. • Designing and optimizing visitor conversion processes; define goals, develop process to the goal and measure effectiveness. • Optimizing the checkout process; analyzing each step in the process and monitoring conversion changes after adjustments. • Improving product placement; using conversion rates to develop product placement strategy. Example: Discount products that have a low conversion ratio and see if their ratio improves. • Increasing customer conversion and retention by identifying and using segmentation.  Segmentation allows you to define a group of visitors/buyers by specific demographic or behavioral criteria—like visitors from a specific country, or visitors who are repeat buyers.  You can then market to those customers based on their past performance. FOCUS ON ACTIONABLE DATA Olivier Silvestre, WebSideStory Senior E-Business Analyst, mentions, “A common mistake of many e-commerce sites is not focusing on actionable data. (Users) tend to build reports that look and sound nice, but do not contain actionable information that will help increase conversion rates, pinpoint cross-sell opportunities and improve online marketing ROI. Another common mistake is not focusing enough on A/B testing, which involves testing one element or variable against another. This can include page layout, messaging and even technology implementations. This is an excellent way of improving conversions.” CLICKTRACKS: WHY AVERAGE TIME ON SITE MATTERS ClickTracks, an award-winning web analytics solution for small- and medium-sized businesses, responded to our metrics questions through CEO, John Marshall. “I do find that both ’conversion’ and ‘ROI’ are actually rather crude metrics. ROI only measures the fact that people did buy. It doesn’t measure that they ‘should’ have bought.”  “For example...an online gourmet foods store might sell olive oil, but find the keyword ‘olive oil’ produces very poor ROI. They would tend to blame the keyword for not converting, but the keyword may not be the problem at all.  What if it’s the exorbitant shipping cost that’s the real issue?  In cases like this, the keyword doesn’t convert, and the product doesn’t convert, but they should.” John continued, “...I personally like ROI combined with Average Time on Site (ATOS). Customers spend time researching products they are considering buying. ATOS gives a very strong indicator that the product should convert.” CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WITH NO ADDITIONAL COST ClickTracks also noticed that e-commerce sites could use a bit more testing than many currently receive.  John recommends “relentlessly testing every aspect of the site”. Like the other vendors, ClickTracks are proponents of A/B testing as a powerful way to monitor and measure customer response, from layout to promotions and pricing. As John concludes, “Web analytics can provide this valuable customer feedback at no (outside) cost.”  MAKING SENSE OF THE NUMBERS: A PERSONAL TOUCH Is it time to re-evaluate how and what you’re analyzing? With ever-increasing competition and ever-growing customer expectations, one thing is clear: You’re only as good as your last round of site optimization. A good web analytics tool can measure innumerable datapoints about your web site.  It takes time, patience and a skilled web analyst to determine which of those datapoints is important—to point out the metrics that actually matter.  If you’re using the tools yourself, and need a little extra insight on site activity, consider investing in a professional web analyst...it may be just the boost your analytics software (and your bottom line) needs!

Define Goals: Do some pre-analysis planning.   • Write out your business objectives and make them as clear and specific as possible.  • List and prioritize both the Business and User goals.  • Drill down and define each marketing campaign’s goals • Subdivide your marketing objectives into micro and macro conversion points for each campaign • Map out which web metrics measure a particular conversion point—you’ll need to know how one set of numbers impacts the others.  2. Gather data: Make sure you have access to your web server log files (raw data stored on a web server) and that the files are completely intact.  In order for your log files to be truly helpful, your referrer tags MUST be turned on—consult with your web host to confirm they are. Ensure that all of your campaigns have tracking parameters built into their URLs so you can easily measure their performance against other visitor activity. 3. Consult with an analytics software rep: Familiarize yourself with the web analytics tool beforehand. Your web metrics software provider is a helpful (and not to mention, a typically free) resource to show you how to use their tool to measure what you need.  Be sure to take advantage of any free educational opportunities they provide, whether they be viewing online demos or attending a free webinar. 4. Establish a benchmark: Do an initial analysis with your web metrics software. Mark that as your start date, or “yardstick,” to measure where you currently are and to map out how much further you must go to get where you want to be. Then pick some measurable points of data along the way as ‘metrics milestones’ and create your plan.  5. Measure only what matters: Just because your web metrics software can show you every data point doesn’t mean that every data point is relevant to your business model.  Some data points may be too miniscule or not conclusive enough to be worth measuring. Weed out all unnecessary data and stick to actionable items. Don’t waste time measuring any data you know you can’t act upon. 6. Save time: The first time you perform analysis, note how long it takes.  This will help you estimate how much time it will realistically take you to measure and analyze everything available. Based on the speed and the amount of available time, determine which reporting items can be measured less frequently than others.  7. Keep a timeline: Gather data over a reasonable amount of time (and even if you’re eager to get started, 3 hours isn’t a ‘reasonable’ amount of time!) Remember important dates, including site and campaign launches, revisions, and expirations; you’ll need this information to map your metrics against. This will be especially helpful when looking for patterns, trends, and cause-and-effect relationships.  8. Be honest: A great marketing campaign can’t make up for a lousy web site. If web revenues aren’t growing at a rate similar to your increasing site traffic,   your customers may be telling you something--you need to improve your web site’s design and development, and integrate it more seamlessly with your marketing campaigns. 9. Act on your information: You should have an actionable “if/then” strategy for every data point you’re measuring...or you shouldn’t measure it. Here’s an example of an if/then strategy: “If revenue increases x percent from my e-mail marketing campaign, I will increase distribution by y percent.” 10. Measure your tool’s ROI: Don’t forget to factor in the operational, maintenance and support costs associated with the software itself. Choosing a tool that’s less powerful but more affordable could end up being a better option for your business.    SIDEBAR # 2 Dissecting Web Analytics 10 tips to choosing the best web analytics software for your business  1. Research: View demos and webinars (typically you can find these on the vendor’s web site), read client testimonials; talk directly to their tech support and customer service teams (not just the sales team!) and see if their answers all match up and if you like the level and type of service you’re receiving. 2. Relevance. Determine how well their software matches your business model and objectives.  Are you an e-commerce site? B2B site? Publisher site? How well does a certain product or service meet your specific campaign needs? Do the web analytics staffers understand things from a marketing perspective and not just a technical one? 3. Budget: Under spending may only give you part of the larger picture, but overspending may make it considerably harder to meet returns. Don’t just consider the price of the software itself – consider how much time setup and report production will take, and how much value it would add to your company to have that data. 4. Stability: Is the program powerful enough to generate and change reports on the fly? Does the data stay consistent, or do you have to make tweaks every time? Also, consider the stability of the company.  Have they themselves been around for 2-3 years minimum (and do they plan to be around even longer)? 5. Simplicity: The more time you have to spend trying to gather and make sense of data, the less time you have to act on it. Even if *you* understand how their software works, it still needs to be quick and simple enough to program and explain to others in your office, who may want to review your reports without needing to enlist the services of a techie interpreter. 6. Flexibility: Software vendors should offer a variety of options when it comes to accessing your data.  Want to analyze past data? They should be able to provide you with software that’ll let you read your own log files. Don’t want to deal with log files? A flexible vendor will be able to provide their own hosted solutions to track all activity on your site. 7. Scalability: Does the vendor offer multiple levels of their products which you can upgrade to as your business grows? How well do their products integrate with your 3rd party products (such shopping carts and databases)? 8. Proof: A reputable company will offer you a free test run of their software. Make sure they offer at least a 2-week trial period (generally regarded as a standard length of time to do a minimum data assessment) for your own “proof of concept.”  9. Support. It’s inevitable that you’ll need some form of tech support, so see what options they offer. The essentials are a physical address, e-mail address and human being answering the phone. Additional items are customer chat, forums, and a good “help” database in the web analytics software itself. Try them all out (both during peak and non-peak times) and see how responsive they are. 10. Authority. Decisions on what web analytics software to purchase are best  made by the marketing department – Not the tech team or any other group.  You’ve got our word on that. ;)  *******######333333  Top 10 Search Engine Marketing Myths By Shari Thurow Webmaster/Marketing Director Grantastic Designs, Inc. Many advertising agencies, Web hosting companies, and design firms offer search engine marketing services for their customers. However, some of the methods they use to obtain top search engine positions are considered to be spam by the major search engines. What exactly is search engine spam? Tim Mayer, VP of Web Search at Yahoo, stated that "We consider spam to be pages created deliberately to trick the search engine into offering inappropriate, redundant, or poor-quality search results." An example of inappropriate content is an adult site wants to be found on Google for the keyword phrase: Barney the Dinosaur. Affiliate Web sites often contain the same information as the parent site. It can be quite frustrating to view the same information delivered over and over and over again in search results. Many unethical search engine marketers will take your money by making false promises without a moment's hesitation. SEO sales reps may tell you exactly what you want to hear just to close the sale. Before hiring a search engine marketing firm, be alert for these search engine marketing myths before you sign. Myth #1: Search engine marketing equals search engine advertising.  One of the most widespread beliefs about search engine marketing is search engine advertising equals search marketing.  For example, if an online marketing firm runs advertising campaigns on Google and Yahoo, the firm must specialize in search engine marketing.  Search engine marketing encompasses a wide variety of skills. The primary forms of search engine marketing include: • Search engine optimization • Search engine advertising • Web directory paid inclusion • Search engine paid inclusion • Vertical/specialized search services (news, shopping, travel, etc.) The reason this myth is so widespread? Search engine marketing has recently become a hot new agency service. Unfortunately, many ad agencies have little or no search engine optimization skills. Writing keyword-rich text is a foreign concept to them. Juicy sales hype and buzzwords are the norm. Agency site designers are often more concerned with Flash sites or sites with "pizzazz" than with search friendliness.  Additionally, many new search engine advertising firms consist of former search engine employees. This group specializes in search advertising — not optimization, paid inclusion, or vertical search.  If you hire a full-service search engine marketing firm, make sure you hire one that truly has experience in all forms of search engine marketing. Don't hire a firm that specializes in advertising when the service you need is search engine optimization. Myth #2: Buying search engine advertising will improve your site's rankings in the main search results.  This myth is based on an erroneous cause-and-effect occurrence. When people launch a new Web site, they often purchase search engine advertising. After checking to see how their ad appears, they notice that their site URLs appear in the search results. "Wow," they think. "I bought ads and my Web site appears in the main search results." Correct assumption? No. Incorrect assumption. Purchasing Google AdWords will not make your site rank higher in the main search results. Purchasing Overture ads will not make your site rank higher in the Yahoo results.   The main reason ads rank is payment. The main reasons a page ranks well in the main search results are: 1. Keyword phrases: The Web page contains words and phrases that people type into search queries. 2. Site architecture: The site designer has given search engine spider easy access to the words on the page via a spider-friendly navigation scheme, URL structure, and cross-linking. 3. Link development: The number and quality of links pointing to a Web site (or page) are relevant. The quality of the link carries far more weight than the quantity of a link. Even Google states, “Advertising with Google neither helps (nor hurts!) a site’s rankings on Google” (http:www.google.com/webmasters/facts.html).  Myth #3: You only need to optimize your home page.  Many Web hosting companies offer this sales pitch. If you cannot afford full site optimization, the next best thing is to optimize your home page only. Unfortunately, many Web hosting firms have limited knowledge of search engine optimization. The function of a home page is to act as a site's Table of Contents.  All too often, a home page's content is not focused on targeted keyword phrases. In addition, a home page does not close a sale. Very few site visitors will Add to Cart, Sign Up for Newsletter, or Enroll in Class from a site's home page.   Which pages are the best pages to optimize on a Web site?  Pages that are focused on targeted keyword phrases that are likely to convert visitors into buyers — these pages deliver qualified traffic to your site. The types of pages that tend to rank well and deliver sales are: • Product pages (for a B2C site) • Service pages (for a B2B site) • Category pages  • Help pages (FAQs or frequently asked questions, customer service) • Media pages (press releases, testimonials, case studies) • Informational pages (articles, tips and tools) Product, Service, and Category pages often contain focused content and are most likely to close a sale. Help, Media, and Informational pages can also deliver focused content. However, these pages guide visitors to more focused pages. Of course, a home page should be optimized to the best of ones ability, but do not expect that a one-page optimization strategy will deliver the same results as a site with fully optimized Product, Service, Category, Help, and Media pages. Always optimize your most important Product and Service pages first. Home page optimization is a poor substitute for optimized Products and Services pages. Myth #4: We know the algorithm from (Google, Yahoo, MSN Search, Teoma, etc.)  Whenever any search engine marketing specialist makes this statement, do not believe them. No one knows exactly how search engines rank pages. Even if the SEM company hired a former search engine employee, search engine algorithms change all of the time. In addition, did the SEM company hire a search engine representative from the advertising department? An ad representative does not have the same knowledge as a software engineer.  I have heard many ridiculous sales pitches from other SEM firms. One company claims to have Google's algorithm in a black box. And, to show they are completely serious, the company makes prospects sign a non-disclosure agreement before demonstrating their black box. Sounds impressive. Sounds serious. The SEM company must have the inside scoop on Google, right? No. The SEM company has a well-orchestrated, but false, sales pitch. No search engine marketing firm knows Google's algorithm. No search engine marketing firm knows Yahoo's algorithm.  If you encounter a company that gives you this elaborate sales pitch? Applaud their performance. Nominate them for an Oscar, Emmy or Tony award. But do not fall for the sales pitch. Myth #5: Guaranteed search engine positions.   This search engine myth is partially true. Search engine advertisers can guarantee top ad positions because the client pays for it. In general, the person who pays the highest bid amount will show up highest in the advertising space. With search engine optimization, however, no one can truly guarantee top positions. Only one group has control over what ranks and what doesn't – the search engines. Only one group has final control over what ranks and what doesn't: the search engines themselves. All of the major search engines have some sort of disclaimer stating they ultimately decide which Web pages will be included in their indexes. Search engine marketers have no control over positioning. Experienced, knowledgeable search engine specialists can demonstrate results from past performance but cannot guarantee future results. In that sense, SEO specialists just like stockbrokers. No stockbroker knows how future markets will perform, and no search engine optimizer knows what future search engine algorithms will be. Unfortunately, a large number of the SEO firms that offer guaranteed search engine positions are spammers. To achieve top positions, thousands, even millions, of doorway pages are submitted to search engines. If one such doorway page gets a top position, even if only for a few days, the SEO firm fulfilled its end of the contract. Understandably, many Web site owners like the comfort of a guarantee. They believe that a guarantee demonstrates the SEM company's confidence in their skills and expertise.  However, a guarantee is merely an attractive element of a sales pitch. The same guarantee that convinces you to sign a contract may very well result in spam practices that will get your site penalized or banned in the search engines. Myth #6: Permanent search engine positions.  There is no such thing as permanent search engine positions. Positioning and traffic fluctuations are perfectly normal.  New pages with unique content are added to the Web all the time. Old pages are deleted or updated. How Web pages and sites link to each other also changes. Because of these changes, search engine databases change and constantly evolve. Therefore, positioning will always fluctuate. Prospects who require permanent search engine positions have unrealistic expectations. A more realistic expectation is to receive a regular percentage of Web site traffic from the search engines. For example, a properly optimized site will receive at least 10-20% (or more) of online traffic from the search engines.  Myth #7: Top search engine positions equal top sales. The sales process is not a one-step process. Not only should your Web site receive qualified traffic from a variety of resources (search engines, public relations, advertising, etc.), it should also  1. Deliver useful information and value to site visitors, and  2. Compel them to take a desired action.  For example, if you have an ecommerce site, the desired call-to-action might be Add to Cart. If your Web site is offers online courses, the desired call-to-action might be Register for Class.   Many sites achieve top search engine positions and no sales. Many sites do not have top 10 positioning and get millions of dollars in sales.  Instead of being overzealous about maintaining positions, online marketers should spend more time on analyzing visitor behavior and sales conversions. If designers, developers, and search marketers would focus more on delivering keyword-rich content, they might find their sites can easily generate targeted search engine traffic and convert visitors into buyers within a single site. Myth #8: We submit your site to 10,000 (or more) search engines. The majority of Web sites receive qualified traffic from 10-20 major search engines, Web directories, and industry-specific sites. Submission software claiming to submit your site to 10,000 search engines will get you listed in many FFA (free-for-all) link farms. A FFA link farm is a collection of Web pages that contains indiscriminate, often unrelated, links to other Web pages. For example, a site that sells golf balls has nothing in common with a mortgage or gambling site. FFA link farms are used to artificially boost link popularity and are considered spam by all the major search engines. "Spam penalties include demotion and removal from Google's index," said Matt Cutts, software engineer at Google. In addition, many search engine marketers will not tell you that a single search engine supplies results to other Web sites. For example, Google currently supplies search results to America Online (AOL), yet many SEO experts consider a ranking in Google to be completely different from a ranking in AOL Search. Myth #9: We can get your site instant link popularity.  Any SEO who promises link popularity right off the bat is spamming search engines. In all likelihood, SEO firms that promise instantaneous results build link farms to artificially inflate link popularity. Quite often, these firms rely on expired domains on Yahoo! and Open Directory. Many of the link farm sites aren't even in the same industry. Why would a real estate site link to a site that sells baseball bats? Results people see from link farms are generally short-lived. Search engine software engineers discover the link farms and promptly remove their all of the sites from the search engine database.  Though no one can control which web sites link to your site, site owners have complete control over which sites they link to. If a site links to another site that is considered a "bad neighborhood," such as free-for-all (FFA) link farms, the site can be penalized. Myth #10: Meta tags are the "secret ingredient" to getting top search engine positions.  This is another search engine myth that refuses to go away. A few years ago, a spam technique called "keyword stacking" or "keyword stuffing" became popular because people did not want to change their visible Web page content in order to rank well in the search engines. Keyword stacking in meta tags became so common that the search engines gradually downgraded their importance over the years.  The title tag is much more important than meta tags because all of the major search engines use title-tag content to determine relevancy.  Very few search engines use meta-tag content to determine relevancy. Even if a search engine (such as Yahoo) uses meta-tag content, the content is nowhere near as important as the HTML title tag and main content. Conclusion To determine whether or not a search engine optimization technique can be considered spam, Google software engineer Matt Cutts gave some of the following search engine optimization tips: 1. Does your Web page's content help end users? "Tricking end users to get to your useful content does not count," said Cutts. 2. Would you perform on optimization strategy if the search engines did not exist? 3. Are your pages automated? If so, Google does not want them in their indices. Web site owners should focus their efforts on creating sites with unique content and getting other quality sites to link to them instead of trying to spam the search engines.

Although originally a scientific term, the word is now frequently used to describe a form of technology that utilizes biological traits such as fingerprints, voice and the eyes to identify individuals.  But biometric technology is not something new. Government agencies have been using this equipment for years, and although it has been agreed that biometrics can be intrusive, the U.S. Government has said that the trade-off for higher levels of security is worth it. Following the 9/11 attacks, there was backlash about iris and retina scanning, the issue of which was derived from privacy issues. There are still those who believe it is overkill.  But now more web hosting companies are using this technology in their data centres (and co-location facilities) to ensure that only authorized people have access to mission-critical web servers. Many companies are also starting to use them on computers that require the utmost of security.  After all, passwords aren’t as reliable as they used to be. Over 50 per cent of calls to help desks are usually related to passwords—they have either been forgotten or lost due to the frequency in which they must be changed. According to Forrester Research, the annual cost for each password administrator per user is between $340 and $800. Fingerprint scanning was the biometric of choice for many companies in the early days of using the technology to secure hosting or data centre environments—a technology that is now about 15 years old. Then retinal and iris scanning were introduced, and many believed that iris scanning (which is considered the most hygienic of all biometrics because there is no contact with the device) would grow between 2005 and 2006.   The fingerprint comeback Fingerprinting technology—which was the preferred method of choice before it was substituted by other forms of biometric solutions—is now making a comeback. This technology is now able to identify 2,000 data points from a print—a far cry from the 40 or 50 that the original system was able to maintain.   And it only takes a second to be sure that the person who is supposed to have access to a given area is provided with the means to do so.   There are downsides to this technology, however. Those with oil on their fingers, or if the individual is pressing either too hard or soft may be denied access. However, this problem is much more easily solved than the employee who can’t remember their password, or even worse, has lost a security card that gives access to a range of areas.  Iris Scanning Iris scanning offers the highest level of security in the field (aside from DNA), which is why it is often reserved for situations where security is absolutely essential. The iris is the part of the eye where the coloured circle (usually brown, blue or green) surrounds the pupil. The iris is developed before birth and remains the same throughout an individual’s lifetime, so the chance of two people having the same data in their iris is one in 10 to the seventy-eighth power (even identical twins have unique patterns).  This part of the eye has over 260 unique spots, including rings, freckles and other exclusive markings. The left and right eyes of each individual are different, and imitation of the human iris is unattainable, thus making fraud impossible. In addition, the iris scan cannot take place without looking at the camera, so therefore is not possible without an individual’s permission. The technology works by taking a black and white photograph of the iris with a near-infrared imaging camera (similar to the beam produced from a television remote), as the subject stands anywhere from five to 24 inches away (depending on the camera being used). Within one to two seconds, the device notes the distinct patterns and characteristics, and maps out the points of the iris.  This machine can even scan the eyes of those who are blind, have glasses or wear clear contacts, without compromising the quality of the image. These systems boast a zero per cent false rejection rate, which measures the chances of the system refusing an authorized user. In February 2004, an iris scanning system was introduced at an airport in Frankfurt, Germany as part of a project that would incorporate 18 other European countries. This form of identification was used because it was believed that the uniqueness of the iris is almost impossible to fool, as compared with some other forms of security. Canada Customs also ran tests on iris scanners before deciding whether or not to implement the devices at some airports. Iris recognition outperformed facial identification, fingerprinting, vein detection, hand geometry, and voice scanning. In addition, Canada Customs found that iris recognition was 20 times faster than the other methods. The development of biometrics But as the web hosting community continues to grow, so does the use of biometrics. In order to secure an environment, identity must be firmly established.   A May 2003 study released by the Data Center Institute at AFCOM (an association for enterprise data centres) concluded that just 5.5 per cent of data centre managers are currently using biometrics for security. Of the 257 respondents, pricing was the major issue for those who did not have it, with 24 per cent of them noting that it is just “too costly” and 14 per cent saying it just isn’t in the budget.   But the asking price for this technology is dropping. In 1993, vendors charged $6,000 for a biometric device. By 1999, the cost had dropped to $500. Even the items that would have cost about $1,000 in 2003 are now likely in the neighbourhood of $100.   For example, LiveID (which is manufactured by Knowledge Partners) uses advanced algorithms to authenticate fingerprints in two seconds or less through a USB-based reader. This means a false acceptance rate of one in every 200 million scans—an individual is more likely to win the lottery three times than fool this machine, and there is a better chance of being struck by lightening then winning the lottery. Obviously, gaining access through fingerprint-controlled biometrics is virtually impossible.  The future With IT environments constantly growing, it is believed that iris scanning and fingerprinting will merge to create a larger form of security. This will allow all customers to better protect their web hosting data centres through various forms of biometric protection.  It seems that the days of biometrics replacing the password, even on common desktops, will be the solution to protecting the critical information that lies not only in data centres everywhere, but even in the every day computer systems.       SEO Tips for Web Hosting Companies  Information searches are the second most popular Internet activity next to emailing.  Given that, are you truly capitalizing on the thousands of people each day searching for a service, just like yours? As a web hosting services vendor, it is important that you provide quality, reliable hosting solutions for your customers.  However, what good is a website that’s always up—yours or anyone else’s—if no one can find it on a search engine?  That conundrum is what has lead to the emergence and momentum behind search engine optimization (SEO), a methodology for optimizing your site’s content to rank higher on search engines.  In order to reap the benefits of SEO, it is important to first know how it works and then how to make it work for you.  What is SEO? Search Engine Optimization (SEO), more specifically, is the science of search as it relates to marketing on the web. It is the art of combining several variables, including copywriting, programming and links, that improve the effectiveness and ranking of a website. While this could theoretically be done in-house, with the right expertise, it is difficult to accomplish this successfully, ongoing, without a formal proven methodology and good proprietary tools, which most SEO specialists and firms have.   The theory behind SEO is that search engines are moving targets, because they constantly adjust their algorithms to defeat sites that attempt to artificially elevate their ranking. SEO is not a one time “panacea” against the evil search engine forces out to destroy your ranking. It is an ongoing effort to continuously update your site, its content and its programming to ensure that your site ranks as high as possible among popular search engines.  Once upon a time, to rank high, all you had to do was make sure your META tags were programmed with the right phrases. Now, it is more complex, with search engines not going by META tags alone and also factoring in content and inbound links as part of their formula to rank sites.    How To Start Optimizing You will initially need to identify two key things.  First, the best phrases that you and your competition are searched on.  Second, you will need to identify ideal sites to have as link partners—sites that link back to yours.  The more sites that link back to yours, the higher you tend to rank with search engines. It is seen as a validation of your content.  There are search engine analysis tools and services that offer an analysis that quantifies the occurrence of search terms and keywords used in search engine queries to locate your site.  You can also go to sites that will provide you with a high level keyword density analyzer.  Generally, for convenience, your SEO service can provide this for you as well.  Whether you or your SEO services provider does the keyword density analysis, it is also good to check out your competition’s websites in the same way.  How are people finding them?  What words are they using in their site?    It should go without saying, but nevertheless it is important that you do not take the HTML source from a competitor's page. You could be in violation of stealing intellectual property and be subjected to the negative consequences of that violation.  All that you need is sample keywords used for search engine ranking to compare to a list you’ve already made.   You will, ultimately, end up with a list of many words and phrases.  At this point, try and sort them by how likely it is you will be searched on them.  As you, or your SEO programmer, programs your META tags, take into consideration any common misspellings and make sure that keywords in your META tags appear in your content to avoid spamming penalties.  Again, this is something a competent SEO provider or expert would be aware of and ensure is handled.  Once you have your list developed, you can validate phrases for general popularity as a search term.  There are free keyword suggestion tools that you can find on the Internet that can help you with this as well. Keep in mind, the more popular the term, the more competition you will tend to have for rankings.  While getting the right search phrases nailed down is critical, so too is identifying “link partners”.  Search engines use the number of inbound links and the anchor text of those links to quantify how relevant your site is for a given term.  Therefore sites with very little on the page optimization can pull high in the results because of their off the page factors.    For instance, if you type in the key phrase “miserable failure” in Google, the top two web pages that appear are two White House biographies.  However, there is no instance of this term in the actual page content of either.  This was all done with manipulation of off the page factors -- by creating inbound links that contained the anchor text "miserable failure" pointing to a particular web page.  If you want to find out what sites already link to your site, there is a simple formula that works on most search engines.  Go to the search engine and type in the following, replacing “VIAnetworks.net”, with your own domain name: .VIAnetworks.net –site:VIAnetworks.net   What should come up are all of the sites that carry a link back to your site.  You should also look at what other link partners you can include to increase the validity of your site and assist with your ranking.  SEO Versus Paid Search There is an ongoing debate about SEO (organic serarch) versus pay-per-click (paid search).  Some feel that pay-per-click is a simple and fast way to ensure you will be at the top of whatever search you choose—for a sometimes substantial fee.  SEO, on the other hand, is an ongoing effort, requiring continuous vigilance to stay ahead of the ever-changing search engine ranking methodology.  Simply put, both methods have their advantages and drawbacks.  Perhaps the biggest thing a naturally ranked website has going for it is credibility.  Your site is high because the content registered high, not because you had the budget to sit atop the list.  As computer users become savvier, they realize the requirements to be at the top of what they are searching for in a paid situation are less stringent than naturally ranked sites.  There is no guarantee of the relevance of the paid site, versus the promise that top sites do, from a content standpoint, likely contain the information the searcher is after.  A key disadvantage for pay per click, as we mentioned, is the cost. Depending on the market demand for your keywords and clicks, your pay per click campaign can generate a lot of traffic, but can cost hundreds, even thousands per day. The good news is that typically search engines allow you to set a ceiling for the total amount you want to spend per keyword.  So, there is a way to control your costs on PPC, while reaching a highly targeted audience.  So, essentially, SEO may be the best way to get the best of both “search engine” worlds—qualified traffic by ranking high in a specific keyword or phrase your most likely customer will search under, while keeping overall costs lower versus pay-per-click, especially when it comes to more widely searched terms.  SEO and You SEO can help the web hosting industry, like other businesses, to utilize the web and its website as effectively as possible to attract the most customers.  SEO, or partnerships with SEO firms, also provides a good value added service to your existing customers.  There are several capable, qualified SEO service providers out there who can assist you in achieving the search engine ranking nirvana you seek.  As you search for the perfect SEO provider, keep in mind some of the warning signs you should acknowledge to avoid potential disaster.  Primarily, anyone that makes what appears to be a “too good to be true” proposition should be avoided—i.e.  “double your traffic in a week”.  Liken this to the credibility of that midnight infomercial with people sipping champagne and talking about making $50,000 a month working from their new home-based business--which you too can get in on for a “minimal investment”.  You want to work with a reputable company that touts its abilities and their approach to helping you build the qualified traffic you want, not one that employs puffery and “pie in the sky” promises that are sure to disappoint you, let alone your customers.  Also, look for a vendor who can provide references.  In short, anyone who hedges on that request should not be considered.  If you trust them with your site and your customers’ sites, they should have people lined up to sing their praises. If not, you may not want to stick around to find out why.  Since the information search is the second most popular Internet activity, next to email, make sure you take advantage of those savvy prospects our there looking for their first (or next) web hosting company by ensuring that you will appear at the top of all the right keyword searches.  SEO can not only help you to drive more business to your company, but also enable you to help your customers achieve greater success online.

Just a few short years ago consumers still faced a bit of a challenge to find the right company to host their Web site. And, once they did, their platform options were just as limited—particularly for those on a limited budget. There was Linux/Unix and, well, Linux/Unix. And the choices were even less in the shared Web Hosting market (where more than one customer share the resources of one particular server).   This all changed with the advent of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the enclosed Internet Information Server 6.0 (IIS 6.0) which made it financially viable for Web Hosting companies to actually start offering Microsoft-based packages at an attractive price.   While the emergence of the Microsoft technology obviously gave end users an additional choice, it has also created a dilemma. One of the most common questions new registrants ask customer service representatives at Web Hosting companies is whether to choose a Linux or Microsoft hosting plan.    There’s no easy answer, but probably the one most commonly given is: it depends!  Even the most uninitiated of new users seems to buy into the prevailing theory that Microsoft products are mostly touted for their ease of use, while Linux has traditionally been considered a technology for computer geeks. The challenge is to ward off these preconceived notions and educate customers that both hosting plans have their merits. Many feel compelled to go with a Microsoft package simply because they’re using a Microsoft operating system on their computer, even though Linux is still a viable option. At the same time, MS Web services are generally more expensive than Linux (although the gap has closed considerably over the last two years).    Perhaps the best way to answer the Linux vs. MS question is too look closely at the people asking it. End users can generally be divided into three groups: those wanting very basic sites with static pages, possibly incorporating a feedback form; advanced users with sites that utilize databases and dynamic pages; and professional/corporate users with sites incorporating complex back office applications.   Generally speaking, the basic user group consists of Web newbies who want to be online but don’t necessarily want to spend the time and money for a sophisticated site. Ease-of-use and pricing are the primary concerns here because server performance or features are somewhat foreign concepts and thus of little concern. If a customer already owns Microsoft Frontpage — which is quite common among this group -- then it is highly advisable to go with a Microsoft based hosting plan. Frontpage is the software of choice for basic users because it’s fairly straightforward and doesn’t require any HTML experience.   Although Linux-based servers usually support Frontpage, they are somewhat limited and can lead to disappointment when a specific feature is required but won’t work on that particular server. A prime example is the Frontpage-based user administration feature, which requires a Microsoft server to run. At the same time, basic, static Web sites on Linux-based hosts are hard to beat in reliability and value. Frankly, going with a Windows system in this scenario may in fact not be the best choice since the user would essentially be paying the premium price for hosting on a Windows system, but not using a single feature it offers that Linux doesn’t. And to help lure this group, some hosting companies have even started providing Web design software for free, or they may offer a Web-based design interface with Linux packages that provides a comprehensive selection of accessories and options, essentially serving as a one-stop-shop where users can get everything they need for an optimal online presence all in one place.    Bottom line: basic users have equal reason to go with MS and Linux. It’s a matter of situation and needs so, the answer to the MS vs. Linux question here is indeed “It depends.”   The advanced Web site group is probably the most interesting one. A typical user might run a content management system, forum or a blog on their site — each of which requires a database, which in turn necessitates some kind of scripting language to connect to the database. Here again, the decision of which platform to use might be heavily influenced by software. If the user’s software requires ASP or ASP.NET, an MS based plan is probably best. However, if one of the user’s applications is written in Perl or PHP, a Linux server is essential. There are implementations of PHP and Perl on Windows servers and ASP on Linux servers though they seldom run as they will on the server they were designed for.   Since most free Web software is still being developed on Perl and PHP, a lot of customers would rather go with a Linux-based package than switch to the product from Washington State. 1&1 Internet customers in the US confirm this by buying approximately 75 percent Linux hosting packages and 25 percent Windows. Essentially the differences can be described as follows: MS facilitates varying degrees of design and management through essentially a ‘drag and drop’ philosophy, via FrontPage, .Net framework and Share Point. Linux hosting provides more scope for fiddling and experimentation. As a result, Linux will be more suited to those who appreciate a greater degree of freedom to build and adjust through scripting and automation. If users want a high level of control over mechanisms, then Linux will perhaps better suit them.   Further confusing the MS vs. Linux issue is the fact that it is not just the operating system that influences whether a site will run on a particular server, it is also the power of a hosting company’s system administrators. Windows systems maintain a certain susceptibility to hacking attempts and will often enough be severely restricted as to what one may or may not do. For example, Microsoft recommends that “relative addressing” be turned off on Web servers to make them more secure. However, Microsoft’s own product — Frontpage — requires that this feature be turned on when utilizing the database connection extension from anywhere else than the root web directory. Smart buyers — commonly found in this advanced group — will probably want to chat with a support person before actually signing up.  The third group is the professional or corporate user, for whom it is absolutely futile to even attempt making a recommendation since all these sites are usually run from dedicated servers by developers who have full control.  While the emotional answer to the MS vs. Linux question truly is a resounding, conclusive “It depends,” statistics claim otherwise. Netcraft.co.uk currently puts Microsoft’s market share for Web servers at 21.19 percent, which is actually down from a high of roughly 35 percent in March 2002. Apache – the predominant Web server on Linux systems – saw its share climb to 67.84 percent and rising, with no end in sight. So, do we take the word of experienced Web Hosts who sell servers on a daily basis, or do we believe the statistics? Apparently, it depends…  *****3333@@@@@@222222 The Case for Adware By Derek Vaughan  Sub Head/Deck: Navigating the Pros and Cons of Contextually and Behaviorally Targeted Marketing Systems in Web Hosting and Internet Services   A few years ago I was surfing the Web like I always did. Then, inexplicably, from nowhere popped up an advertisement for a miniature spy camera. The ad really caught my attention – mostly because my browsing experience had been interrupted.  That was my first experience with a ‘pop-up’ window ad. As you can guess, it wasn’t my last experience with this now ubiquitous type of online selling platform. The site publisher served the particular ad that I saw. A few months later after I had downloaded a popular peer-to-peer file sharing software program, I became a part of the unwitting first wave in third party ‘adware’ served pop-ups and pop-unders. These first wave pop-ups were generally untargeted – with the miniature spy camera ads dominating the landscape. Gradually, however, I became aware of the fact that as I moved around the Internet, the ads that were being served through the adware program were targeted relative to the content of the site I was visiting. For example, if I was visiting a domain registrar, the ads had offers for discount domain names. If my browser was pointed at a computer hardware site, I received an ad for discount computers.  Fast forward to today. The massive onslaught of pop-ups and pop-unders has spawned a cottage industry around programs to block unsolicited ad activity. There are also a myriad of programs, both free and paid, that promise to remove stealth programs (advertising programs included) from one’s computer hard drive. Into this melee steps the modern Web hosting and Internet services marketer who is facing ever increasing acquisition costs, stiffer competition, and a shrinking pool of available online advertising options. Therein lies our dilemma: adware companies offer the promise of highly targeted prospects, who may convert at higher rates, and at a lower acquisition cost than other types of advertising. However, the stealth nature of certain of these software programs may have poisoned the well for all adware providers. At the very least where big brands and brand equity are involved.  Scott Eagle, Chief Marketing Officer for Claria (formerly Gator), a pioneering firm in the adware space, describes the value proposition of his adware offering as follows: “Claria creates a much more efficient, ‘zero-waste’ environment where you know that the person who is seeing your ad is interested. If you have scale and you have the right qualified prospects, you are always going to outperform any other kind of advertising. Our original vision has not changed; there is a great deal of power in the concept of one to one marketing. If you can ask consumers to give you permission to anonymously profile them, it would create an advantaged targeting platform enabling companies like Claria to give consumers a relevant ad, and enable dynamic creation of content on the fly.”  One area that has been a hotbed of discussion regarding Adware has been: Who “owns” the customer browser experience? Does the site publisher ultimately decide what content is shown on an individual’s computer when their browser is pointed to a particular site? Or is the individual free to “opt-in” to any software or services, which reside on the local machine and potentially trigger actions, content, or advertising when the browser points to a certain URL? The recent popularity of various toolbars suggests that individuals want to reserve the right to “layer” applications over the browser experience. Additionally, pop-up blocking software has not been challenged in this regard, but it clearly lies resident on a computer, waiting to “over-write” content on a publisher’s site.    On the issue of legality, Eagle stresses four key considerations: disclosure, permission, attribution, and control. “You need to get permission,” he says. “The consumer then needs to understand what that means, and should be able to change their mind. A consumer says, ‘I know I’m getting this software for free – instead of paying $30 for it – in exchange for viewing ads. I get it and I give my permission.’ Unfortunately, there are lots of companies out there that don’t brand their ads, and there are no checks and balances.”  Eagle added: “There is a bill pending entitled HR29. The government is trying to step in at the federal level to create ‘rules of the road’. The government is saying in effect: ‘the data is not bad, information collection is not bad – it’s all about disclosure and permission.’ In six years we have had 12 companies challenge our model. Only one of those instances involved an advertiser – and that went away quickly. That’s a pretty good track record.”   In mid December of last year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema rejected a claim by auto insurance giant Geico Corp for trademark infringement. The case centered on the fact that Google was permitting rival insurance companies to display an AdWords advertisement in the search results for search terms including ‘Geico’. Geico claimed that the ads lead to consumer confusion regarding Geico’s product and services. Judge Brinkema disagreed stating, “There is no evidence that that activity alone causes confusion.”  The Google ruling seems to lend credence to the argument that simply displaying ads for competitors in the same browser or computer session is not viewed as legally taboo. As Eagle points out, the only resolved legal cases seem to be leaning towards ‘pro-separate window’ and ‘pro-consumer control’. He sums it up this way: “We think that the legislative side is evolving nicely.”   One final reason often cited by companies avoiding adware as an advertising medium is the negative effect on the brand. That is, the presumption that brand equity will be diminished through association with this type of online advertising. Eagle responds, “We’ve also seen certain of our advertisers conducting branding studies that have shown no negative impact to using Claria’s pop-ups or pop-unders. They all measured a positive ROI – and they haven’t seen in a decline in ‘intent to purchase’ metrics.”   While most popular press is focused on the negative aspects of adware specifically on those less reputable firms that insert their software in stealth mode, and give few indications of their origins – there are potential benefits to the modern marketer in testing this advertising platform. One ought to look for the four earmarks of a ‘white hat’ provider prior to signing agreements: disclosure, permission, attribution, and control. The legal issues, while not completely and finally resolved, have certainly pointed in favor of advertisers to date. The potential roadblock of negative brand equity has also been dispelled by those pioneering brands that have tested this assumption through empiricism.   Other Contextual Options  Advertising Web hosting services can be as simple as getting into a great Web hosting directory site such as: TopHosts.Com (big site, wide reach and great branding too) or CheapHostingDirectory.com (more modest ad budgets) – but one ought to consider some additional contextual opportunities as well.   The biggie is definitely Google.com and their AdWords and AdSense programs. Selecting the ‘Campaigns’ tab in the Google interface offers the choice between the Google search network and the content network. By checking the content network box, your ad will be shown on some of the thousands of websites that have joined the Google AdSense program. When the content of a participating Web page suits your ad message, your Google ad will be shown.  Similarly, Overture.com offers its Content MatchTM system which promotes your products contextually through Overture’s Content Match Distribution Network which includes major portals such as: Alta Vista, Excite, InfoSpace, MSN and Yahoo! (among many others).  You should be aware, however, that these fiercely competitive media outlets are driving the market cost of each qualified click up into the $6-$10 range. On popular search terms and keywords, your advertising costs can easily run into the thousands of dollars per day.  Two other contextual networks that offer ads which are triggered by the content or by the specific area of a  website are: WhenU.com and The Cydoor Network.  From the WhenU web site: “WhenU is client-side, privacy protecting, desktop advertising software that is designed to provide informed consumers with relevant choice and value in their Web experience. As a WhenU consumer, you are privileged to receive special offers, coupons and deals that consistently exceed your expectations and deliver money-saving offers from brand-name retailers right to your desktop.” Advertisers can reach relevant prospects as WhenU’s technology examines certain  keywords, URLs, HTML code and search terms currently in use on the consumer’s browser to select relevant and useful advertisements to display.  The Cydoor Network – Cydoor promotes your brand through its vast network of sites which include: washingtonpost.com, iVillage.com, Parenthood.com, Fool.com (The Motley Fool), USNnews.com, and SkiReport.com. Advertisements are purchased on a CPM (cost per thousand impressions), CPC (cost per click) or even a CPA (cost per action) basis. A proprietary pixel tracking technology is used to optimize your campaigns. Cydoor also claims that its online audience is one of the world’s largest, reaching more than 80 million people with more than 10 billion advertising impressions monthly.  The modern Web hosting marketer should investigate the latest technology and contextual advertising advances to gain additional accounts and lower acquisition costs.    +++++**********###########555555555%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

25 Jan 2006
The reversal of Microsoft’s closed-source policy is likely to open the floodgates for malware.
Please read this first: Following is an independent investment commentary and analysis from the Reuters.com investment channel expressing views that are not connected with Reuters News.
Microsoft (MSFT) Wednesday said it would reveal the source code for Windows Server software, in order to comply with the European Commission’s 2004 anti-trust decision. Brussels has hoped that the requirement would herald a new openness in Redmond, but it’s more likely to open the floodgates for malware.
When a programmer codes, they are actually creating text files with instructions that are later translated into machine code by a program called a compiler. That machine code is what is usually packaged up and licensed to software clients.
The open-source community has investigated things like proprietary file formats, but the actual details of things like how the operating system writes to hard drives is difficult to determine. For the techies, that’s why NTFS format partitions still aren’t usually mounted read-write in Linux. For the suits, that’s why going from Microsoft to Linux has had huge switching costs.
Now Microsoft will be letting system administrators look into its Windows Server code. This is the code for the back-end server system that manages net-traffic, email, and Web-site serving duties. There is likely to be some overlap in the code, of course – harkening back to the earlier example, I suspect that Microsoft uses NTFS for server-side hard drive formats.
In the short-run, this could be a negative for Microsoft’s server sales. It’s possible that the open-source community will find a way to tear up the code for better integration of Windows systems into pre-existing Linux-based networks. (To clarify, Microsoft is not releasing free use of its code for other’s programs. Microsoft maintains its copyright and exclusive use of its source code.)
Another near-term concern is the potential for a wave of malware. There were more software updates and patches for Linux in the last year than there were for Windows. One argument that Microsoft supporters have pointed to as a negative for Linux is that the authors of viruses, Trojans, spyware and such have access to the code that shows the bugs right there. Linux fans, though, note that the patches indicate that errors are being fixed.
In either case, Microsoft’s massive installed base (the exact installed user base for Windows vs. Linux is difficult to determine due to the different distribution methods) has attracted the attention of “black hat”-virus authors. The release of source code probably has them salivating, and thus we can expect to see attacks concentrating on the server-side Microsoft applications in the near future. We can also expect that the “white hats” will help Microsoft patch the problems, though. My big question with regard to this is whether Microsoft will be open to the community’s help. The recent WMF vulnerability had a third-party patch available before Microsoft’s, but the official patch went through Microsoft’s quality assurance process. It will be interesting to see what develops.
In the longer term, though, this is probably a positive for Microsoft. First, it has blunted the European Commission’s monopoly argument, likely lowering its legal costs and risks going forward. Second, the idea that switching costs have been lowered is double-edged, and Microsoft’s superior support services could be a determining factor in future decisions between MSFT servers and open-source solutions. Third, the nature of open-source is that customization takes hold as programmers change the software to meet current demands. Thus, while barriers to switching will lower in the near term, they may be stronger than ever going forward. This has the potential to blunt the growth rate of Linux servers even more.
But from an investment standpoint, this will probably have little effect on Microsoft’s prospects in the third quarter, which ends in March: I still think that the Xbox 360’s sales will be the primary determinant of Microsoft’s quarter. The source code release will probably negatively affect the fourth quarter as the malware wave makes news. The positive effects of this announcement will likely hit in 2007.
