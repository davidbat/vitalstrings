Here are some  common uses    for each of the Bluetooth profiles listed above.
Hands-Free Profile (HFP   1.5)
Hands-Free Profile allows Bluetooth headsets and car hands-free kits to communicate with mobile phones.
Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP)
Phone Book Access Profile allows the exchange of Phone Book Objects between iPhone and other Bluetooth devices.
It is often used between a car kit and a mobile phone to:
Allow the car kit to display the name of the incoming caller
Allow the car kit to download the phone book so the user can initiate a call from the car display
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile allows high quality audio (stereo or mono)   to be streamed from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection. This is commonly used to play music wirelessly from iOS   to a wireless headset or a compatible car audio system.
Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP)
Audio/Video Remote Control Profile allows remote control of playback functions on the iOS   device from compatible devices (commonly Bluetooth devices that use the A2DP   profile). iOS supports the following commands: pause, play, stop, next track, and previous track.
Personal Area Network Profile (PAN)
Personal Area Network Profile provides network connectivity over Bluetooth. With iOS this is  common with multiplayer games and Personal Hotspot on iPhone. See this article for additional information.
iPod touch and iPad with iOS 4.3 or later support Internet tethering from an iPhone with iOS 4.2.6 or later, through PAN.
Human Interface Device Profile (HID)
Human Interface Device Profile allows communication between iOS   and Bluetooth keyboards.
 
Note: iOS requires that the remote Bluetooth device support an encrypted connection. When establishing a pairing record between your iOS device and a Bluetooth device, you are also setting up encryption between the two devices.
