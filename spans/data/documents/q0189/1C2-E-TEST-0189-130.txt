Have you ever ridden a horse? Have you ever seen a chinchilla? Have you ever eaten caviar?
And, most importantly: Have you ever been confused about the Present Perfect Tense? If you have, now is the perfect moment to clear things up!

He is making things easier for you, mixing two ingredients – the present tense and the past tense, forming a completely new blend – the PRESENT PERFECT TENSE! Try to memorize the picture, since it is actually the basis of the Present Perfect, which represents a mixture of the past and the present… And not only that.
