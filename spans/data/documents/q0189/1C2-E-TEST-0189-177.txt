Photo sharing website Flickr is showing off some nice-looking new maps with considerably more detail than previous versions.
The new look and additional map data for Flickr’s maps come from Nokia Maps , which, as part of a new partnership, is providing map styles and satellite images to Flickr.
If you’ve ever tried to geotag your Flickr photos anywhere even remotely off the beaten path, the updated maps are welcome news.
The new map data, combined with what Flickr already pulls from OpenStreetMap — which Flickr uses in areas where commercial maps lack coverage — means no more dropping your images into a vast sea of beige, guessing that somewhere in there is probably about where you took the photo. Now you’ll see road details, landmarks and even public transportation info like bus stops to help you figure out where you were when you tripped the shutter on that masterpiece.
