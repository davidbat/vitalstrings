Vocabulary Graphic Organizers
Graphic organizers help students to visualize the relationships between words and their possible meanings.  Teachers can use these graphic organizers with their explicit vocabulary instruction.  These tools may also be used as classroom assessment for learning because they give teachers a quick look at students' vocabulary knowledge.  A variety of samples have been provided.
