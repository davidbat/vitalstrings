An icy cool drink

There are certain features of sites that almost anyone can recognize as “cool,” such as lots of white space, gorgeous graphics, and interesting navigation. Yes, I freely admit that I have been sucked into these sites as much as the next person. They can look really appealing or do something in a new and innovative way. But cool sites are often not very usable. And sites that aren't usable don't get used for long. If you are striving to get and keep an audience for your site, then you should learn why you need your design to be more than cool.
