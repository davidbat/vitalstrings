AND BESIDES ALL THAT IPHONE HAS BEEN  DESIGNED IN A VERY DEFECTIVE WAY WHAT I MEAN IS AFTER UR WARRENTY IS OVER REPARING COST OF EVEN A MAJOR THING AS IF ONE WANTS TO REPAIR A BROKEN MIC OPENING THE ASSEMBLY MY LEAD TO A BROKEN SCREEN OR A TORN DOCK CABLE (AND THE BEST PART U WONT EVEN KNOW ITS BROKEN UNTIL U USE THE PHONE )WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT THE QUALITY OF SOME SPARES USED IS REALLY BAD. U SEARCH THE NET AND NOT SO MANY PEOPE ARE FACING GENERAL BASIC DEFECTS.
I AM PISSED OFF AT APPLE…

This article is a bit dated at this point, but I have to say that not only does the iPhone suck for most of the reasons listed above, but I have first hand experience with AT&T sucking pretty hard too and refusing to give discounts on the 1st gen. iPhones period, of course they say that Apple forced them to do this, and Apple says that they “needed” to. Then in the same breath they tell you to just buy another phone and sign another 2 year contract and you can get your 10% discount. Whatever, I am no longer an AT&T customer for some specific reasons, but in general all US cell phones suck, because the companies are rotten. Now that hardware manufactures like Motorola and Apple are helping already corrupt companies along I would urge all of you to really reevaluate what you need a phone to do. Buy a map of your town, for example, instead of paying some obscene data rate so your company can charge you to use the services you want across air waves that you already pay for in your taxes. That’s right, we own the airwaves that the government sold to these corrupt companies, especially after the digital TV switch, did we see any financial gain for this? No, we got some faster connections, but the data plans did not become more affordable on the whole. The point is the government is too in bed with cell phone companies right now to regulate them, but that doesn’t mean that we have to really put up with this. For those of us that absolutely have to have a cell phone we can get pay by minute phones without contracts and use them as conservatively as possible. The key is to break the cycle of getting screwed by contracts. Once companies no longer have the motivation to screw us by contract, or start to really offer phones with no contracts at all, we’ll finally start to get what we’re paying for because we can switch whenever a company treats us poorly. Remember having choice when you did a company the favor of doing business with them? I know, I know, that was before we started signing cell phone contracts….
