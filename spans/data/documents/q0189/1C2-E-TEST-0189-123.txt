Apple just announced in a press release this evening that its Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering Bob Mansfield would retire. Apple’s current vice president of iPad hardware engineering, Dan Riccio, will take over the position during the next several months. Apple CEO Tim Cook had some kind words to say about Mansfield, who has been with the company since 1999.
“Bob has been an instrumental part of our executive team, leading the hardware engineering organization and overseeing the team that has delivered dozens of breakthrough products over the years. We are very sad to have him leave and hope he enjoys every day of his retirement.”
Mansfield has played a huge role in recent hardware releases for the company: since 2008, the SVP has led Mac hardware, and he led hardware for the iPod and iPhone since 201o. He has also led hardware for the iPad since its conception in 2010. It looks like Mansfield will enjoy his retirement, because he sold almost all of his stock just over a year ago and likely plans to retire in Bonny Doon.
Meanwhile, Riccio currently serves as vice president of iPad hardware engineering, and he has been instrumental in all of Apple’s iPad products since the first-generation iPad. Riccio joined Apple in 1998 as vice president of product design, and he has been a key contributor to most of Apple’s hardware over his career. Riccio earned a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1986.
