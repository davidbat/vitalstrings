Forest Inventory & Analysis
Forest Inventory and Analysis reports on status and trends in forest               area and location; in the species, size, and health of trees; in               total tree growth, mortality, and removals by harvest; in wood production               and utilization rates by various products; and in forest land ownership.               The enhanced FIA program will include information relating to tree               crown condition, lichen community composition, soils, ozone indicator               plants, complete vegetative diversity, and coarse woody debris.
The program is managed by the Research & Development organization               within the USDA Forest Service in cooperation with State and Private               Forestry and National Forest System. FIA has been in operation under               various names (Forest Survey and Forest Inventory and Analysis)            for some 70 years. The program covers forests on all forest lands               within the U.S. The program is implemented in cooperation with a               variety of partners including State Forestry Agencies and private               landowners who grant access to their lands for data collection purposes.
