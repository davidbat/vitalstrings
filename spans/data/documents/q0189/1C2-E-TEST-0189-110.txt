Hmm. iTunes 6 has been fine but 7 keeps skipping really badly during playback. Can't be my system as it has happened on two seperate computers both of a very high spec. Back to 6 for now I guess. It is a shame as the album art thing is very nice.
update: to sophist_dreams - actually it is skipping on MP3s I made myself with iTunes as well as MP4 tracks bought from ITMS. These tracks play fine in Itunes 6, WinAmp and Windows Media Player so it appears to be a iTunes 7 problem.
update 2: looks like it is a known bug ... http://discussions.apple...ad.jspa?threadID=637696

First: It uses tons of RAM (not that important nowadays but seems that it doesnt matter to developer to improve it)
Second: The features itself are just basic compare with other players.
Third: The need to install Quicktime (wich really sucks) is a very negative thing.
Fourth: The best media player/manager is J. River Media Center, Although many reviewers of other players calls them iTunes clone or iTunes alternative, the real thruth is that Media Center or  other Players have been around for several years with that feautures. So the thruth is that iTunes is a Media Center clone, not the other way around.
Fifth: The lack of basic things such as remove files from databse that no longer exists in your hard drive is really annoying.
For the best experience of music management/playing use Media Center from J. River its not expensive and it has tons of feautures and flexibility to siut your needs.

cricri_pingouin, you know that you can drag/drop files into the library? So, you don't NEED to click on File -> Add to Library.
This version (7.0) is a leap-and-bound improvement over the others.. it even does gapless playback.

"Why can't I just browse my PC folders to where I have my music? Why do I have to right click and do "Add to playlist" to actually copy files on the thingy?"
Because that's counter-intuitive. A more efficient method is, you know, dragging and dropping your music folder into the iTunes window. Which it then automatically catalogs and lists under Library. You expected complexity where none exists (loading music via My Computer?!), therefore created problems for yourself.
iTunes works wonderfully, the integrated music store is well-built, and the interface is streamlined and simple. I installed iTunes 7 a little while ago (upgrading from 6), and it's still great. I'd rank it a 5, but the Library view gets a little sluggish at times.
Reviewing 6.0.5 (Sep  8, 2006)
Right, so the missus got an iPod Shuffle. Thanks God she got it for free.
I have an iRiver myself. How do you put music on it? Easy, you plug it on ANY computer, it's detected as a drive, you simply copy/paste songs on it (MP3, OGG, whatever), you unplug it and presto: you can play your music. You can also use it as a pen drive to carry documents.
So the Shuffle: I plug it on USB, it detects it, I copy songs on it. Happy until there.
I try to read the song: error. Right, maybe the MP3 is faulty? So I transfer another one. Error. Right, so it looks like I definitely need to install iTunes, as I originally feared.
I really really didn't want, but hey, no option heh? On a second thought, I can't recall seeing any Apple product giving you an option.
So anyway, I come here to get iTunes. WHAT? 35MB? Just to allow me to copy music on the thing? Not happy, but again, do I have a choice.
So I install it. WHAT? Why the heck does it want to install Quicktime? Is that a darn video player? No! Is there an option NOT to install Quicktime that I do not need nor I want? Of course not!
So I install it, say "No" to 20 questions asking me if I want to do lots of things that I sure as hell didn't want to do. Thanks God it asks for that (well, it didn't ask about connecting to the internet, but the firewall blocked it).
Now I'm in. The interface is rubbish, confusing and counter intuitive. Why can't I just browse my PC folders to where I have my music? Why do I have to right click and do "Add to playlist" to actually copy files on the thingy?
Next, I was curious. What format are the files on the thingy now? Are they smaller? So I open the file explorer... and the iPod which was there as a drive before I installed iTunes isn't showing anymore!
I close iTunes, unplug and plug back the shuffle thingy hoping to see it back in the file explorer... oh, iTunes fires up! I can't recall it asking "do you you to launch on connecting the shuffle". Of course, it didn't ask. And of course, no way to see the thing in explorer anymore. Oh wait, so I can't put other files anymore? Documents and stuff?
I'm off to try Yamipod now.

This is a great program, but, I've only given ita 3 because: not every one want's or can afford an Apple iPod.  They are very expensive compared to other MP3 players, and so iTunes needs to expand it's support on the Windows OS to include othe makes and standards.  I, and most other peaople, are not going to buy an expensive MP3 player just because the software is cool.  Secondly it pushes it's iTunes store, etc. just a little to much.  I never buy music or video over the net and never will.  I would like to be able to install it without those features, as they are never going to convert me...

I can't understand why so many low ratings. It is slow? Sure! Waste memory? Absolutely!! It does what it should do? Yes, it does.
Great application to get your library organized.
You bet it has it's flaws but don't use it as a "one-file-player". For that, use Media Player Classic. If you want to see your library, create playlists, podcasting and so, use iTunes.

I love ITunes for my Ipod but the version update 6.0.5 broke my 6.0.3 version. I got several errorcodes from quicktime and Itunes after the update.
I got runtime code 0X80040707 for QT:s .CPL file, I got Application Error code -3 for QT.EXE and some ITunes.exe Application Error code that I didn't even bouther debug.
A lot of people suggested installing/uninstalling/removing codecs/removing Windows KB KB908531 etc for solutions, but nothing helped me.
Then I tried to (1) Install Itunes (with QT), (2) Ignored the Error codes, (3) installed QuickTime Alternative 1.71 (without removing original QT)
And Now It Works! hope this helps someone.
Still I Give Itunes 3/5 instead of 5/5 cause the crappy boundled QuickTime crash.

The ONLY thing good about iTunes is that it lets you access the iTunes Store. Although it's not the perfect online music store, it's mature, popular, and pretty decent overall. As of iTunes, the GUI bites and the installer bites more. Sure, you can uninstall QuickTime afterwards and replace it with QuickTime Alternative, but you can't disable the iPod Helper Service even if you don't have an iPod because every time you launch iTunes, it re-enables and starts it. Think you're clever by deleting the cached MSI? Sorry, at every launch, iTunes directly (not via MSI-based shortcut) invokes repair on itself, in order to enforce its association with the context menu of audio CDs (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AudioCD\shell) and you can't turn this off. Then there's the Gear ASPI driver it installs to support its CD burning. Don't want to use iTunes for burning? Apple doesn't care. You get what Apple decides you should get, and your computer should work the way Apple decides it should.

The very first version was pretty good.  Did the basics, sync, play and was really good for mass ID3 editing.  The new versions trys to do too much.  Hangs while try to drag and drop filenames and mandatory use of quicktime is rediculous.  Overdone on integration with the store and you're just out of luck if you forget to deauthorize your PCs before formatting.  Too bad, it used to be a good program.  I'm running out of choices for players, they're all getting bloated, even winamp is going way downhill.

thousands of users say that many other programs are "iTune clones" but no matter the ignorance, it sucks big time. it doesnt even have a "remove" missing files from library wich is a pretty standard feature nowadays. the mother (or father) of all library enabled programs out there is J. River Media Center. you just have to try it to see what you have been missing if you use iTunes (wich is a Media Center clone in all the extension of the word). the ram usage of itunes is an insult for users since many programs with the same (or more) features only need 10-20 mb of ram.

I'm middle of the road on iTunes.  I use it with my ipod and it works great.  The Visualizer has stunning grafix, not that I use it much.  I don't, however, use it as my default music player.  People are right when they say that it is a memory resource hog.   I also hate Quicktime.  I disable it from startup everytime I upgrade iTunes (to do that go to Start->Run (type in regedit).  Drill down to the following path "My Computer\HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" then delete qttask (or quicktimetask, something like that, can't quite remember).  At least it doesn't startup any more when the computer boots.
I do love the way it organizes music, just don't use it as your default player.

I have been using iTunes since it came out for the Mac (I used it for windows too) It is a great piece of software. Helps me keep music organized, and have never had any problems syncing with the iPod. Other software like Musicmatch, windows media player or real player don't even come close to the way iTunes handles your music. It is very simple to use and you can create different formats from CD's. You don't have to use the apple codec, but you have the choice of using mp3 format at very different rates. The best feature is the ability to search your hard drive for music and organized all into one big folder. If you don't have the name of the artist you can just click and change it or select multiple files and change the name of the artist at the same time., which helps keep the files organized on your pc. This is a great addition to your computer even if you don't have an iPod.

Reviewing 6.0.4 (Mar  2, 2006)
I'm not sure why people are reporting this as using much cpu cycles.
I imagine that onboard sound is a lot less efficient than a sound card.
When I use Itunes with my Athlon 3000+ (1.8GHz) CPU and Creative Audigy sound card my CPU usage was approximately 1%(as seen in the Task Manager) and that's when my CPU is only running at 1000MHz. So iTunes was only using 10MHz to play my mp3 files!! I don't think that is very resource intensive, do you?
Reviewing 6.0.4 (Mar  2, 2006)
A terrible resource hog and a brilliant media player wrapped into one!
I would truly love to see Apple focus on fine tuning their Windows-Version of iTunes to be as fast as the native Apple-version.
I love iTunes and use both iTunes and WinAMP because both applications are creatively designed to enhance the experience of using your computer as a multimedia system.  iTunes's built in music store doubles (as Amazon does) as being a beautiful catalog of music to browse through from time to time and listen to samples.
All in all, Apple have a great product.  Better when run on a Mac though =).  It's still worth a 4 as the performance issues are only an issue to users with a slower CPU.

I don't want to install Quick Time I already got the codecs, well to bad cuz they want to force feed me this resource pig and its friend. No other software I have used is a bigger pain to deal with when it comes to forcing itself to load on start up.

One problem I have with itunes is that it takes a while to actually shut itself down and if you close it and then try to open it up too quickly you have to open it again because nothing will happen...but I can live with that since its not too often I close it out just to open it right back up, its usually an accident.

And finally there is no reason to have to have all the 'helpers' install themselves to run all the time when they infact are not needed for the program to function.

Interface is very pretty, well laid out, and easy to use for casual and iPod users. It IS a big download for dial-up users, but REALLY! There is hardly any place left - even out in the sticks here in the Corn Belt - where one can't get a basic DSL or cable package that is nearly as cheap as dial-up! So quit pissing and moaning and join the Twenty-First Century! And yes, the memory and hard drive footprints are quite large, but with 512 MB of RAM or more on even modest machines, and storage at 50 cents a gigabyte and falling, is this really a deal breaker?
I DON'T like this software, though, for the following reasons:
It is a resource hog in terms of the CPU cycles it demands to do its job. If you have the latest dual-core Intel or AMD CPUs, the strain is not bad, but on a typical small home/office box like most of us have, iTunes can slow your machine significantly if you are, for example, listening while working on a Word document and also have copies of Firefox and Thunderbird up too. iTunes is also vulnerable to skipping under heavy multitasking loads. By contrast, Foobar2k NEVER skips. Nor even does the oft-derided RealPlayer 10 (which can also sync with iPod, BTW).
I also REALLY don't like how Apple shoves QuickTime down our throats with every iTunes download. What's more, I don't like the heavy-handed way iTunes wants to take my music files and recopy them into the iTunes folder, imposing its own order on files I have already taken great pains to organize MY WAY in the "My Music" folder. As always and ever, Apple software and Apple computers in general seem to always be telling me - the user - that they know best! Windows may be messier and less elegant to the eye, but it is nothing if not customizable.
Like others, I would really like it if iTunes supported more formats, especially the open-source formats like Ogg-Vorbis and FLAC. But if this is even possible, Apple is MORE hostile to anything open-source than Microsoft. Instead of letting us have FLAC or some other established lossless codecs like Monkey's Audio or Shorten, they saddle us with a thing called "Apple Lossless," a totally closed and proprietary format, ensuring that if you want a lossless compression codec playable through iTunes, you take theirs or nothing. Windows Media Audio is also often slammed for being proprietary (so, by the way, is MP3 - licensed by the Fraunhoffer Institute), but at least Microsoft will license it out. Apple refuses to do so, making sure that any lossless music files one makes through iTunes for playback either on computer or an iPod, can NEVER be played on a non-Apple device or piece of software. Greedy as always, God forbid anyone else make a buck on software or players that play files originally made in iTunes.
I listen primarily to classical music and opera. The iTunes way of organization is neither flexible enough nor comprehensive enough for this purpose. It allows more flexibility than it at first seems, though, but in the interest of interface cleanliness, Apple does a great job of hiding some of iTunes's cataloguing features. Insofar as cleanliness and elegance detract from functionality, Apple makes a bad trade-off.
One complaint I haven't read from anyone else on this forum is the lack of support for gapless playback of MP3 and AAC. For listeners of classical music, opera, as well as any type of live venue recordings, this is a real problem. Tracks will often go from one to the next without any period of silence in between. So there is an audible and annoying discontinuity as tracks change. One workaround people like me use is to rip the CD to a single image file with a cue sheet. There is only one file, so no discontinuities, and the cue sheet marks off the times of the track changes. This way, players that support cue sheets can play a continuous file with no clicks or hiccups, but still display the track numbers and allow for cueing of individual sections. Foobar2k supports BOTH gapless playback and playback from cue sheets. iTunes supports NEITHER.
Foobar2k has a notoriously simple and rustic - even ugly - interface, but nothing else crams so much useful function into so little space, demanding so little memory and CPU cycles in return. In my view, THAT is what true elegance in software design is about! With iTunes, beauty is truly only skin-deep. iTunes is like the stereotypical CEO trophy wife who expects a Park Avenue apartment, a nice convertible, and a bottomless VISA card, but who can't make a cup of tea and won't even bring you a pill when you have a headache. iTunes sucks up your computer's oxygen, doing too little in return, expecting to get by on charm and good looks.

rickya100: quicktime is needed to decode/encode aac files :)
but maybe they should offer an alternative download excluding quicktime.

excellent program but needs added support for a few more formats so i can easily convert from them to m4a like flac and monkey audio lossless file format

I only have one major complaint. I want the library to reflect the files that I actually have on my hard drive and it doesn't. If I remove any files then iTunes doesn't know this.
I have a free program called WxMusik that has the option to rescan your music directory every time. This option should be there for sure.
