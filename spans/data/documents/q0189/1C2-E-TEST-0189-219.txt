One of my favorite things to do when I'm on a camping trip is star gaze.  I don't use a telescope or any of those star gazing apps; rather I take  in all of those glistening dots and enjoy the rare moments I get to  actually experience the night sky. After I've had my moment, that's when  I'll try my hand at naming the constellations. And I'll usually get  them wrong.
