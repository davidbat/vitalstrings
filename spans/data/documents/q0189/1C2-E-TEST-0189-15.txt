Yahoo! Maps APIs let you easily embed rich and interactive maps into your web and desktop applications using your choice of platform: we provide Flash , Ajax and Map Image APIs.
Yahoo! also provides other APIs you can use to add geographically relevant content to your maps, including Yahoo! Local listings , Traffic and Weather reports, Upcoming events and Flickr Photos . Our APIs support the GeoRSS standard and you can further extend the Maps API functionality to consume any other API.
Make your web site or application come alive with rich contextual maps, location-relevant content, and dynamic user interaction. Integrate a store locator with a few lines of code, view highway traffic patterns, or create custom routes - whatever you can imagine, Yahoo! Maps web services make it easy to build into your app. Yahoo! Maps' built-in Geocoder lets you specify an address or latitude/longitude coordinates: no need to call an additional service or write special code.
