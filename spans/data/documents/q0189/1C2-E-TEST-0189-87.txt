I personally                 buy from Adorama , Amazon , Ritz , B&H , Calumet and J&R .                   I can't vouch for ads below.

Why         do we use Mac? Simple: It just works.
We get more done in less time           without any aggravation.
It's not just             how fast it runs benchmarks. It's mostly because it just runs without             the viruses ,             spam, crashes and constant need for support, reboots, upgrades, defrags             and maintenance without which Windows simply stops working after             a few weeks. I only have to reboot my desktop Mac when I return from             a trip during which I turned it off! It runs smoothly for months             at a time.
Since I've written  this article, all new Macs also run Windows , making the choice of Mac a no-brainer.
Your office           and big business use Windows because many IT departments who choose           the computers protect their jobs by selecting  Windows           precisely because Windows requires so much upkeep. This keeps them           employed.
I was a senior manager at a  multi-billion dollar corporation           for many years and had to deal with Windows. When I'd ask our tech           support people why they wasted our time with Windows systems,            they'd freely admit that most of them would no longer have jobs if           they upgraded to Mac.
Independent           users are far smarter than that. Mac has always been the overwhelming           choice of full-time, long term career photographers, and no, Windows           if anything has fallen further behind as the years roll on. If you             haven't used Mac lately, you're missing out.
This isn't             just my opinion. Read Consumer Reports or these articles here and here .           Listen to this typical Windows PC customer service call (we Mac users can laugh at this since this crappy service doesn't happen to us, and even if we had to endure this, Macs all come free with re-installation CDs anyway.)
See Dell's store           rating here and the Apple store's rating here .           Dell outsourced their customer service to India and it's been their           death knell. Astoundingly Dell is outsourcing even more to India as           you can read here from           March 20th, 2006. Bye-bye to Dell PCs, unless you yourself can service           them. Feel free to research other brands of Windows computers,           but  Dell is the best of           the Windows PC makers (Consumer Reports, June 2005, cp. 40.).
That's               it all in a nutshell.             Just try a Mac and you'll feel this all for yourself exactly as I             did when I upgraded  in 2000. If you insist, the newest Apple             computers run Windows, too !
Mac is            built from the ground up for sound and pictures. Apple won           an Emmy             Award for inventing FireWire which is used today for most           video and movie editing and won a Grammy             Award for outstanding contributions to the music recording industry . I           was at that  Grammy Award ceremony and had no idea Apple was going             to get this. No             PC company had ever been awarded a Grammy!
I've resisted             writing this for years because some people will take this personally,             like a discussion of religion or politics. I started getting             enough hate mail with my Aperture review             that I figured it was time to share my  personal experience.
I started this             site back when computers had nothing to do with photography. Today             they have everything to do with photography. I love helping people             with photography, and realized that there's a lot to be shared by             letting you know what I've learned working with various computers             all these years.
If you're happy             with what you have don't worry. I offer this page sharing my personal             experience since more and more people are asking me for computer             recommendations. I also offer a page about which             Mac to get .
I,             as well as every full-time career professional photographer I've         ever met, just happen to use Mac. It's         a given, just as Windows is for  engineers and cubicle workers. By "full-time" I         mean full-time, not the guy in your office who shoots weddings,         portraits, stock or sells photos at fairs on the side. By "career" I         mean someone who's been doing photography  all along,         not  someone who dropped out of another job. I don't mean to offend         anyone with these definitions and  I'll hope to  find a more         delicate way to explain that people coming from other careers often bring         baggage. People starting from scratch, as I did when I bought my Mac,         have an easy choice.
When I was             shopping between Mac and Windows it             was tough for me to find anyone who used both systems everyday and could give me a fair opinion. That's  what I'm  giving             you now, since I've   used Mac and Windows side by side for years.
Either machine             can be used for anything. Mac  lets you get a lot more done in             less time without the aggravation. A             Mac is the right tool for for photography just as a remote control             does a better job of tuning your TV than a 10 foot wooden pole. I             speak from personal experience of loving working on Mac for years,             and having days of my life wasted by Windows problems. Your experience             may vary.
I'm just one guy doing             all this photography and this website, on nothing more than a 12" Apple laptop built for kids !
When people speak             of computer problems like viruses ,             reloading operating systems, crashes, DLL errors, spy ware etc., they             are referring to Windows-specific problems, not computer problems.             Mac users hear about these things, but rarely if ever have to deal             with them. I'm speaking from experience, not trying to incite hate             mail. I'm sure a Windows Jihad member could send me some sort of             virus, just that I don't get a dozen a day as I did on Windows. Viruses             are the "59,940 reasons             to reconsider Macs" (front cover of Consumer Report's             December, 2004 issue).
Would you drive a car that             died on you while driving and needed to be reset and tweaked every             other trip? Not me. There's no excuse for balky computers, either.             Remember cars from the 1950s, which needed complex tune-ups every             2,500 miles and even starting and running when cold was never a sure             thing? Today cars all start and run perfectly, have twice the power             and better gas mileage, too. This is because they are all computer             controlled and self-adjusting.  They run great because             auto makers use their own proprietary operating systems, NOT Windows.              Windows has no excuse for not running flawlessly after 20 years             of development. Complexity is not an excuse: even the crappiest             car today has dozens of networked computers controlling everything             and runs great, compared to 20 years ago when cars still used              mechanical carburetors. I suspect Windows, in my experience anyway,             runs like crud deliberately.
It's not so much the hardware             as the software. The chips and hard drives and screens all come from             the same places. The problem is that Windows has always been a buggy             science experiment that left a lot of problems for users to figure             out on their own. Apple has always done their homework to ensure             that the computer knows how to do its own internal work so you don't             have to. Microsoft always expected people to  learn how computers             think. Apple  teaches its computers              how people think. Steve Jobs gave away Apple's secret in a Forbes             interview a short while back: it's all about the user experience,             which is all about the software which is the Mac operating system,             iPod, and everything they do. The people I've met at Apple reinforce             how Steve drives it into everyone's heads that it's their job to             ensure that you and I have a great time using our Macs and that everything needs to be obvious, simple to use and just work. They're not allowed             to stop their design 90% of the way through and hope  the users             figure it out. It's Windows software that makes PCs so aggravating,             not the computers themselves.
Unlike Nikon vs.             Canon, Coke vs. Pepsi, Rock vs. Disco or BMW vs. Mercedes dickering,             there is a real difference between Mac and Windows when you work             on your computer all day. (Apple has a larger share of the computer         market than BMW and Mercedes  have combined in  the auto market.)
You           don't need a dedicated support department to keep a Mac running. Computer           support departments HATE Mac because Macs don't need computer             support departments. You'll never get your           company's help desk to suggest Mac because they know they'd be unemployed.           Fast. Macs aren't perfect, but  close.
WHY         I USE MAC
Do More Faster
I               get more done in less time with no aggravation. My             brain doesn't hurt after working on it for hours. It just works.             No backtalk, no stupid popup boxes in meaningless technical gibberish,             no viruses, no slow operation, no spy ware, no crashes, no complex             installations, no reloading operating systems, no taking 5 minutes             just to turn off, no nothing except getting stuff done.
I             do my entire website, read hundreds of emails, do all my Photoshop             CS2 work and catalog hundreds of images every day, all on a two-year-old             12" Apple iBook, the lowest performance           computer and cheapest laptop they make! This  little 12" laptop             is the computer I use all day, every day, for everything! I used             to use a desktop (which will be for             sale ), but the laptop worked so well I never bothered           to use the desktop. While I'm working away I pity           my wife struggling with her large company's Windows machine and all           its problems.
Before             I got my first Mac in 2000 I was afraid that Mac users might just             be a bunch of nerds who sat around telling themselves how great their             computers were. Just like with switching between Nikon and Canon,             I feared Macs might have their own set of unique problems that the             Mac whim ps chose to ignore. Nope, Macs really just work         great without all the problems.
Talk             to we Mac users and we talk about what we've made, like this website,             with our machines. We don't talk about the machines. Talk to Windows             users and you'll just hear about their ratty hardware. Listen to             any computer talk show and it's pitiful: all the callers have issues             with Windows and can't even get their computers running.             When Mac people talk shop it's  about neat tricks             discovered in Photoshop or whatever that lets us get even more work             done. Making an automotive analogy, Windows users have enough trouble             just getting their cars  started, much less getting them out of the              garage, while Mac users are out winning races.
I beat on my little iBook  10 hours a day, every day. It turns             on instantly as soon as I open the cover. There is no waiting a few         seconds to wake up as Windows laptops.
Windows             users have a heck of a time just trying to keep their machines running             long enough to check email and surf the internet. These              are trivial on Mac and allow us the time to do photography, edit             movies and make website's. Movies? Not just home video and prime-time             network TV shows; did I mention many Hollywood theatrical releases             are edited on Mac, too? Many people use Apple's Final Cut             Pro, while more advanced folks use Avid or other nonlinear tools             controlled by a Mac.
Instant Wake-Up
My             iBook is awake the instant I open the cover. That alone is enough             to amaze Windows users. It bugged the **** out of me having             Windows laptops that took time to wake up.
My             iBook goes to sleep as soon as I close the cover, and has enough         power on a full charge to stay ready to work instantly for over a week!
Easy Color Calibration
Every Mac has had built-in software monitor color calibration for years.
Of course I've always set my Macs to 2.2 gamma, which oddly isn't the default. If you leave your Mac at its default of 1.8 things may look too light. Set it to 2.2, which is only a few clicks away (top left blue apple > System Refs > Displays > Color > Calibrate (choose 2.2 gamma when asked)), and everything looks great and matches the rest of the consumer world of sRGB, photo lab  printers and the Internet.
I use a hardware calibrator, the Color vision Spryer. Unlike CRTs of old, every LCD ought to be calibrated.
Macs default to 1.8 from their historical use in publishing,  long before the Internet and Photoshop went consumer. It's kind of the same reason why railroad tracks are still at the same spacing as the wheels of Roman chariots and the sharpening filter in Photoshop is still called un sharp mask.
Today Macs ought to default to 2.2, but oh well. Pros know better.
Easy Wireless
Wireless? Open         an  iBook and go, no configuration required.
It will              already be ON unless someone deliberately turned it OFF. If so, click             the antenna icon on the top right and select ON. It will select the             best network automatically. If you want to choose, the list              is right there. If you need a password, it asks. It             just connects. Easy. I             can get a wireless internet signal for free just about anyplace there             are people.
For comparison, last night             my wife tried to get her company's laptop connected to our wireless.             She was given  two pages of instructions with over seventeen             complex steps! It didn't work. She then wasted over an hour of              dinner time on the phone with tech support. It still             doesn't work. Her Windows laptop asked us to             figure out how to activate and configure its own wireless card!              The ON button was hidden six menus deep. Macs are             smart enough to activate their wireless cards  automatically without             giving us the Molvanian mind-fu ck             looking for the  ON button. Mac is well enough designed to figure             out the obvious. Windows and its related programs are so incompletely             designed that not even tech support could find where to enter a password             to access our network! That was too well hidden. Her laptop remains             connected by wire.
Great Battery Life
My three-year-old 12" Apple iBook laptop still runs about 4 hours on a charge in 2007.
I can go away shooting for a weekend and not need a spare battery, much less bother bringing an AC adapter.
I got home from a Death Valley trip in February 2007 and still had over 50% left - I only used my laptop for storage and cataloging; not much sorting.
When I say I got back from a weekend with 50% of my charge left, I mean that my iBook was ON the whole time! I never shut it off. I close the cover and it goes to sleep. The instant I open the cover, it wakes up.
It's not like the crappy $4,000 Windows laptops I used to use that took 15 seconds to awake from sleep or only lasted several  hours in standby mode. My iBook stays on for over a week in sleep mode, always ready to awake in an instant!
This is what mobile computers are all about. Accept nothing less; and I'm using Apple's cheapest laptop that was introduced in 2003!
I pity my Windows pals whom I see needing always to haul and plug in their power adapters, even when giving business presentations or working in airports. Don't Windows laptops run on batteries, too?
I can get over 5 hours on a charge if I  turn down the brightness  and only do  one thing (email, internet, etc.) at a time. I may only get three hours if I'm beating on my laptop doing a zillion things at a time.
My Mac's battery gauge is always accurate. When it says I have 4:25 or 0:06 left, that's how much I have left.
FireWire 800
This is twice as fast as traditional Firewire, which is a tad bit faster than USB 2.0.
It lets me transfer files, backup and copy my drives, and download images faster.
FireWire 800 has been standard on most  Macs for years.
Target Disc Mode
Any Mac can be turned into             a firewire drive for easy file transfers. It's trivial to copy anything             from one machine to another, like photos downloaded to my laptop           in the field back to my main desktop Mac at home.
Plug             a firewire cable into both computers. The computer in Target Disc             Mode appears as a hard drive on the other computer. Drag and drop             your  files. Transfer time is fast via firewire.
You get to             Target Disc Mode by holding the "T" key (as in Target)             while starting. If the laptop is on, I prefer to go to Apple Menu             (top left) > System Preferences > Startup Disc > Target Disc Mode instead           of trying to hold the T key while restarting.

Free Walk-in           Expert Help
Have you been to an Apple Store ?             You can carry in your Mac and a very competent expert (OK, Apple           calls them Geniuses) will help you with your machine. Free.
Want to learn             how to edit video and make DVDs? Want to set up a wireless network?             Want to play your home videos on your iPod ? Want to record your next             multi track record album? Want to do just about anything, and I mean             anything? Just ask at the Apple Store. Everybody there knows anything             I've every been able to throw at them.
If your machine             does have a problem they'll look at it and usually fix it right             there. I once asked why my iBook was running a little slow. The Genius             took a look and pointed out that I had installed 1,000 fonts in the             wrong place. My little laptop has had a rubber foot fall off the             bottom and they just replaced it. Free. I've worn out             two keyboards and they've just replaced them, too, free. Of course             if you're out of warranty or drop it out a  window it will cost             you. But wait! I had a friend who dropped her brand new Titanium             Powerbook and cracked the case. She asked very nicely and honestly             about what happened, and Apple pointed out that as a laptop it ought             to handle being handled, and they fixed it. Free. I can't vouch for             what Apple will do for you if you're as stupid as myself or the the             people I know, but I can vouch that the good will and help I've received             is priceless.
Consumer Reports also constantly rates them the very best in service.           Actually, they rate Apple quite good and everyone else quite poorly.
Contrast this             to my poor wife who had a Dell. It died. She had to call India for             help. They couldn't speak English, and they didn't know anything             about her computer, either. After about three tries and three             months they finally mailed her the CDs she needed to restart her             Dell. THREE MONTHS? She was without her computer for three months.             Every Apple comes with  the disks  Dell deleted,              so if she had a Mac she would have been back up in two minutes. You             even can run a Mac from the CD with no hard drive!
While I was writing this             article I finally killed the hard drive in my cute little iBook.             I've been amazed that it simply hasn't melted down completely since              I beat on it 80 hours a week. It wasn't a problem: back ups are             so easy I do them all the time as well as before I took it in for             service. I simply moved all my work to my other idle Mac and never             missed a beat. I brought my iBook to the Apple Store Saturday morning.             They sent it out for repair, promising a week to ten days. Wednesday             morning the DHL guy pulls up and my iBook's already back. They overnight ed             it each way and fixed it  the same day they got it. WOW, and this             all happened before I even published this  article. I'm not getting             any special service; they have no idea who I am. This was totally             free, including all the overnight shipping for which I didn't even             ask, covered under the extended Apple Care warranty I bought. Everything             mechanical like hard drives break, which is why I back up and had             no inconvenience. What sets companies apart is what they do when             something does break.
Connections,               Expansion and Interfaces
Macs             always have all the newest connections. Apples all had USB back in             the mid 1990s while Windows struggled with parallel ports. Every             Mac has had Firewire (also called IEEE 1394 and iL ink) since probably             the late 1990s.
You'll             never have to go out and buy adaptors to use whatever peripherals             you might buy in the reasonably foreseeable future.
Did             I mention Apple invented Firewire? It was such an innovation for             television they  won an Emmy award for it!
I'm             amazed at how I run so many things with my laptop. It has its own           built-in hard drive, keyboard, track pad and DVD/CD recorder. On           my desk I connect a CF card reader, two Casio             digital camera stands , three scanners ,             a printer, an external keyboard, monitor and mouse, another external             CD recorder and an external DVD/CD recorder as well as a couple             of Firewire hard drives , all         at the same time, in addition to the drives inside the iBook! All         this stuff just works as soon as you plug it in. I use a 7-port             USB hub and daisy-chain the           Firewire items. When I come home I just plug in the power, one USB           and maybe one Firewire plug and I'm done. Someone on Windows         would still be trying to set jumpers on just one  new hard drive.
Trivial to Upgrade
I Upgraded the Hard Drive on my Quad G5 , and I had everything installed and transferred over in just a few minutes. Easy!
No               Viruses: It         Just Runs
We             all know people whose Windows PC or data has been fried by a virus.             Just as a virus  may have led to the extinction of the  dinosaurs,             so may viii lead to the end of Windows. Windows             is wide open for viii by what many point out is its sloppy design:              it defaults with open ports. Mac requires a password to install             software, which means that viii can't become active unless you click             OK. Mac is based on UNIX, the professional operating system that             runs most of the world behind the scenes. Macs also default to keep             doors closed to prying outsiders. It's not just that Mac's a smaller             target; it's designed to be resistant instead of having been designed             as part of what I suspect is a silent collusion among virus writers,             the software companies that employ them and Microsoft. As a comment             in one of the really bad viruses that swept most of the world a few             years ago said: "Bill             (Gates), why do you make this so easy for us?"
I'm             sure a Windows Jihad member could send me something bad, just that             I used to get dozens a day when I gave up on Windows years ago.              I'm not asking you to change or guaranteeing Macs will never have             problems. They will, just a lot less in my experience.
Does it strike             you as strange that virus and security patches seem to be updated             on Microsoft's website for current products, but not past ones? I             suppose Microsoft intends older products to be shut down by viruses,           requiring you to buy  new ones.
Of course updates             for Mac are free and automatic; you never have to go looking for         them.

No               Viruses Caught from Sony Music CDs
Viruses are             everywhere - even on Sony music CDs! Sony is recalling about 5 million             CDs because Sony deliberately hid spy ware that installs itself secretly             on your Windows computer, hides itself and then transmits information             without your knowledge or permission from your computer back to Sony.             Sony did this to you to try to prevent criminals from copying Sony's              CDs, but all it really did was give hackers yet another way             into your Windows PC and hijack it for illegal purposes without your             knowledge. Who gave Sony the right to damage your computer based             on their fear of what others might do? No one. See more articles             about this fiasco here , here , here , here and here .
The best article             is from the NY Times on November 16, 2005 which you may be able to             read here .           The NY Times article said "Several security and anti virus companies,           including Computer Associates, F-Secure and Semantic, quickly classified           the software on the CD's, as malicious because, among other things,           it tried to hide itself and communicated remotely with Sony servers           once installed. The problems were known to affect only users of the           Windows operating system." and "...the copy-protection feature           was particularly pernicious because it was nearly impossible for typical           computer users to remove on their own."
Even           worse, Sony's first botched attempt at fixing the problem they caused           on your Windows computer made things even worse! Do you want strangers           messing inside your computer without your permission? Did you know           that when a hacker "hijacks" your computer  that your           computer might be used to send illegal span and child pornography,           and that you might go to prison if it's tracked to your hijacked computer?
I would suppose             Sony  has committed a felony  under a 1980's era federal         law which makes unauthorized access to a computer network a crime, although             they probably gave themselves permission in a click license somewhere.
On November             22nd the NY Times also reports here that             Sony is now being sued by the EFF and             additionally the Texas Attorney General. The State of Texas is seeking             $100,000 per violation of Texas' new Consumer Protection Against         Computer Spy ware Act, which became effective in September.
Of course this              Sony fiasco doesn't apply to Mac.
No Need for Performance-Robbing Virus Protection Software
Mac just runs.
On Windows             you always have to run something like McA fee or Norton anti virus           software, otherwise you quickly catch all sorts of things. The            problem with virus software is it's just like cancer treatment: they           all nearly kill the patient in their attempts to kill the viruses first.           Windows PCs slow to a crawl with anti virus software because the software           keeps its fingers in everything the computer does, even disc reading           and writing. Because it's playing traffic cop it also gets in the way.           It also gets in the way of your own legitimate software installations           and you need to know to turn it off if you're wrenching on your computer.
Thankfully             the only reason I can fathom for buying  Mac anti virus software             is if you're running Virtual           PC to run Windows on your Mac, or if you're silly enough to forward            emails containing viruses to your friends on Windows.
Viruses are             fun: the latest have been arriving in my in box marked from both the FBI and CIA with             a file of my supposed visits to banned porno sites. If you open the             attached zip file it opens on your computer and you're infected,             unless you have Mac. If you actually believe this stuff and you're             on Mac  you just feel stupid for believing the FBI             is sending you email.
Brilliant         Simplicity
Everything           just makes sense on Mac. This becomes even more obvious after learning             the Mac properly and forgetting the             six-finger Windows work-around's  you used when you first upgraded.
When             I first tried a friend's Mac in 1999 it hurt my brain a lot less             after working on it, and I didn't know even how to use it properly.             Like most new Mac users I was still trying to do all the silly things             needed to jerk around Windows computers. For instance, to              copy an image illegally from a website in Windows you right click             on the image, drop down to the "save" option and tell it             where to put the image. Mac had no right mouse button so I had to             learn to opt+click to get the same menu. Then I learned on Mac all             you do is drag the image wherever you want! It saves in one click             without any menus!
As             another example, Apple's remote control for their Mac          needs             just five buttons. Their iPod has             just five buttons and even plays video. Look at anything designed             for Windows or other consumer products and you see remote controls             with a hundred or more illegible buttons no one can figure out.
Microsoft does             exactly what a bad photograph does: adds junk for no reason which             hides any true message or meaning. See this funny           video . It gets much better after it starts. The video           is funniest to people who understand good design. It might not be           funny to engineers who don't realize that too much information winds           up saying less.
Does More
Others             explain all this better than I will. Using the Mac I'm always astounded             at how it just does things that never happened on Windows. My latest             epiphany was on OS 10.4, where simply tapping the scroll button on             my Apple             Mighty Mouse brings up a new screen (called           the Dashboard) which I've easily set to give me current weather           and  forecasts for the coming week for eight cities around the world,           time in nine cities, stock quotes and a dictionary and thesaurus, all           on the same screen!. Just wait till I get a bigger screen!
The clock sets             itself automatically. To             get your Windows clock to set itself requires some sort of Ph.D.,             unless you have certain version of Windows. My version doesn't. On             Macs the clocks automatically and continuously set themselves over             the Internet to atomic references. I did this on Windows, but I had             to pay for special software. On Mac it's just another free part of             the computer.
There are a Brazilian other things it does and I'll leave           those to someone else to describe. You have to use it to understand           just how powerful all this is to helping you get more done.
Trivial Photos, Video and Sound
You already             know this. Mac has done all this since about 1986, while Windows             today still has to take out ads implying you can do it on widows.             Good luck.
Even in 1999             when a friend bought the cheapest computer Apple made (a cute little             blueberry mAc) it came with iMovie video editing software already           installed, free.
Everything             about Mac just makes it trivial to do anything in media. This frees             you to create something worthwhile, instead of trying to get a balky             Windows machine to work at all.
Free Real Software
Windows PCs often come with trial software that dies           in 30 days, or pesters you to buy upgrades to make it work.
Macs come free             with real video and movie editing software (iMovie), photo editing             software (Photo), sound editing software (sound studio and Garage             Band) and disc burning software. I forget about all the other cool             stuff that's inside as well.
You've got real software with free updates, all ready to go.
Fast, Free Upgrades
Every             Mac automatically searches Apple's website and asks you if it's OK             each time it finds upgrades. Just say yes and it automatically updates             every piece of Apple software, including the operating system! It's             all free, although every couple of years when Apple comes up with             a major operating system upgrade it'll cost you $100 if you want             it. Even then all you do is pop in the upgrade DVD and hit GO, unlike             Windows which requires some geek to hover over your computer for             hours after which, on Windows, nothing works anymore.
This             way you always have the latest versions of Tunes, wireless software,             web browser, Quicktime, etc. etc. There are no mental gymnastics              having to go sort out if you need any upgrades and then trying           to do them. With Apple, just click OK.
Beautiful         Menus and Lovely Screens
Everything             looks great on the Mac. Its user interface is designed by             artists to look great and work well. Windows tries to copy the             feel two years later, but never quite gets it right.
The Apple user           interface is animated and three-dimensional while Windows is           flat.
Far               More Legible Text with                Natural,  Anti-Aliased Fonts
Type is              smooth and natural (anti-aliased) and not rough and jagged as Windows             users are accustomed to seeing.
New Mac users             often confuse the natural, smooth type with being fuzzy. Quite the             opposite; they are just not used to seeing type without all the jaggy             diagonals of Windows. This  reduces brain fatigue.
Skip this paragraph             if it's too technical. Windows text seems sharper at first because             of its primitive aliasing artifacts. In Windows all the text has             jaggy diagonals and every pixel is either completely white or black,             never gray. Mac text appears softer because the fonts are anti-alias ed,             which means they go through a lot more processing to look perfectly             smooth, beautiful and natural. Text on  Mac  has round              curves while Windows can only approximate curves with pix ely             zing sags."O" on a Mac is round. On Windows an "O" is             boxy and pix ely Windows lacks the graphics potency to render type             correctly: pixels are either on or off. On Mac the fonts are first             rendered as vectors, sp lines and curves. These are then mapped to             the bit plane and rendered accordingly. A real letter needs to slide             in between the boxy screen pixels to look smooth. Screen pixels only             occur in jumps while letters all have little curves. Shades             of gray are used to make the letter look perfect and show all its             parts in the exact locations between pixels.             This is anti-aliasing, not blurring. This renders the exact look             of letter shapes with sub-pixel precision and accuracy while Windows             gropes along on whole pixel chunks.
