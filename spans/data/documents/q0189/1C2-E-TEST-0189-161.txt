The apps targeted for the iPad will only materialize if there's enough demand out there. I can see how this device is "nice". But is it 6-7-8 hundred dollars (and another AT&T bill) nice? Definitely not for me. And not for great many people, I suspect.

Mac's iPad - slimmer, lighter, and now with wings.

Not a real fan of Apple although I have to say that I was pretty impressed with the iPhone. Can't wait to get my hands on one of these just to play around with. Who knows, I might be surprised.

According to Apple maximum operating altitude for the iPad is only 10,000 feet...

Does anyone know if the thing is WAAS enabled? ...for possible glass-cockpit use eventually...

I'll get one for my cockpit.  I'm thinking in particular of using this http://www.skycharts.net/   If the GPS works well enough to show my position, great.  But even if not, it should be a much easier and smoother way to flip between charts on the fly (literally).  No good on the iphone, because it's too small, but if you can get reasonably hi-res charts on the iPad -- wow!  Obviously, you'd still want paper charts as backup, but combining this with the other apps you mentioned would turn it into a heck of a tool for VFR flight.

@Mark Johnson - Check our Foreflight Mobile. I used skycharts for a while, but Foreflight now has VFR (and IFR) (and other) charts/maps built in with GPS tracking. Pretty awesome stuff for secondary/backup charting.
@rw speer - I seriously doubt it's WAAS enabled. If anything, it's cell phone tower data assisted. I could be wrong, but I doubt they'd add WAAS for cost and practical use reasons (probably not much demand).
@Boleslaw Ciesielski - Hmm, not sure if you're serious or not. :) Something tells me it would work higher than 10,000 feet even if Apple said it's out of spec. My iPhone works well above 10,000 feet (as a computer, of course - not as a phone).

The 10,000 foot limit was for tablet PC's used as EFBs (electronic flight bags).  The limiting factor in the tablet PCs was the hard drive itself -- without the cushioning effect of nice thick sub 10K air molecules, drives would tend to crash.  Which isn't a factor in a pressurized aircraft, unless you lose pressure.
Since the iPad is solid state -- no spinning hard drives reliant on thick air to function properly, I suspect they will have no problem at altitude, unless there is some other altitude related problem I don't know about.....

New kneeboards for the iPad are now available. Here's an image. More pictures at www.ForPilotsOnly.com.

I was hoping that I could get a stand alone GPS with the blue tooth and hook it up with the non 3D ipad and get the HITS program for 3D SVS, as well as standard moving map. Now how much will apple want to allow this to happen. I am waiting right now for Flight Guild to be able to sell for the ipad, its programs, and they said May 2010. So I hope everyone is on the same page with the ipad and make it the one that is, yes we can.

I just bought an iPad with hope of using it in the cockpit. I feel when the aviation world learns what this is capable of they will fly off the shelves (no pun intended). The ForeFlight app looks interesting although I have not had much chance to use it yet. I'm excited at the possibilities this holds and I hope that aviation app writers take full advantage.

I have not gotten an IPad as yet. Wanting to make SURE that the aviation apps will be useful. Past purchases have been meaningless, for what I needed. But in the aviation community, for VFR flight and below 10,000 feet, make a lot of sense to me. My aircraft will be low & slow, so most of the flights will be well below 10,000 feet. I need to know more about the apps concerning the aviation scene, and uses for the novice pilot to help me along my journey into flight. Peace

I'm hoping to pick up one of the AvPad kneeboards when they are ready over at picsupplies.com
