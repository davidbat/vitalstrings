Our History With Apple Vacations
In 1969 Apple Vacations began with an idea to bring exceptional vacations to travelers at a fraction of the cost that the large airliners were charging. Along the way it became more than that. For 40 years Apple Vacations has made it their goal to provide unique travel experiences to the highest rated exotic resorts for millions of people who want and need the vacation of a lifetime. They have learned a lot about what you want and expect on a vacation...affordable prices, non-stop flights, all-inclusive resorts, transfers to and from the airport and Apple Representatives in the resorts and at your service to name a few. Basically, your vacation experience is their top priority and they are in a league of their own.
To accomplish this, Apple Vacations has partnered with only the best...Dream Vacations. We have offered world class service and quality travel arrangements to our clients since 1997.
