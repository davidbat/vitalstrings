 
Outlining
An outline is a preliminary summary of written work, typically organized in headings and subheadings. Used to organize one’s thoughts and information related to a project or paper, outlining helps students clarify their ideas and demonstrate their thinking process behind an essay or report. Structuring and organizing large amounts of information in an outline is the first step in the writing process.
 
 
Plots & Graphs
Plots and graphs are a type of visual learning diagram that visually represents a relationship between sets of numbers as a set of points having coordinates determined by that relationship. Venn diagrams, bar graphs, stack plots, pie charts and axis plots are some examples that help students develop data literacy by interpreting information and drawing conclusions. Plots and graphs also help students acquire the skills of reasoning, inquiry and communication.
