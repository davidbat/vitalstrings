If I jailbreak my Iphone
Is there an application and cat 5 cable that would allow me to connect my Iphone to an ethernet port on a ethernet switch.
I’m a tech and would like to check out my customers network with my Iphone instead of a laptop.

It’s my impression that the people making the aps are hoping to make money in return for their efforts.  But I suppose it’s OK if some continue to pay for the aps and support the ones who want to rip them off.  After all, there are so many people doing it, stealing is OK. But if you do steal, don’t hide behind the internet.  Tell people in your social circles, your boss, your family, that you are a thief.  Come out of the closet.

Phil, what exactly do you think people are steeling? I’ve been jailbroken for years and have never stolen anything from a developer or otherwise. I think you are very misinformed.
Reply
phil September 28, 2009 at 12:39 pm #
Very sorry, about the misunderstanding.  I thought the jailbreak allowed you to get aps from the ap store without paying, and so I then assumed that meant that the ap developers were losing out on those sales.  Is that not the way it works?  Or is the jailbreak simply a way to install otherwise banned aps, which may or may not be paid for.  Thanks.

AT&T Lies September 28, 2009 at 12:41 pm #
jailbreak doesnt allow you to get free aps. It only allows you to go outside the boundries of Apple’s iphone OS and use the device to it’s maximum potential.

HELP! I have a jailbroken/unlocked iPhone 3G, and I have a serious problem. I downloaded the NES app from Cydia yesterday. The app wasn’t working, so I went into Cydia to remove the app, and now ALL of my original iPhone “apps” are gone – Phone, Calendar, Safari, Settings, iPod, App Store, Contacts, Weather, Camera, You Tube, Photos…EVERYTHING! I tried syncing the phone again, hoping this would work, but the original features did not come back. When you call my phone it still rings, and when you perform searches in Spotlight, all the emails, address contacts still come up. Can anyone tell me how to fix this??

@nxb807, I suggest you to restore your iPhone and jailbreak/unlock your iPhone again. But remember to restore to firmware 3.0 only. Presently, iPhone firmware 3.1 cannot be unlocked

Just letting you know, once you jailbreak your phone and the phone does an auto update of programming through ITUNES or on its own, it will render your IPHONE non working permanately and will ruin your phone…why risk spending $700 to replace one?

It will render your phone non-working at some point when the updates for new features are applied. Why risk having to replace a $700 phone? This program voids any and ALL warranties, then you will call AT&T and blame us for your mistake and expect us to replace or fix the issue.

Hi, I picked up a jailbroken 3GS in Riyadh. Its working fine, but iTunes tells me that the phone cannot be connected because there is a problem with the provider. While I figured there would be that problem, I would like to sync my Exchange data via iTunes to the iPhone.
Is there a trick to get iTunes to work with the device, or do I need to pick up some other software to sync?
Thank you!

I want to jailbreak my phone but NOT unlock. I am afraid to unlock and I dont need to use any other carrier (for now) but my AT&T.  i am so confused as to what steps i need to follow to do the JB.
My phone is a 3GS
My modem firmware on the phone is 5.11.07.
my Iphone Firmware is 3.1.2
I have the latest version of ITunes
Please direct me to the steps needed to JB my phone. I am technical savvy but for some reason every time i google on JB there are so many different ways to do this.
Can I JB WITHOUT doing an unlock?

I can do all of those things (with the exception of changing the skin and installing a new browser i dont need) without jailbreaking it.
iPhone 3Gs – you can record video, use it as a modem, connect remotely and save files to it.
Give me 5 reasons I can’t already do.

AT&T Representative: The phone will not be rendered useless. You can restore to factory settings via iTunes. Stop spreading lies. No wonder ppl want to unlock iPhones with ppl like you around.
Although, blackra1n does not work a 100% on all carriers. When jailbreaking the new software certain features on the 3Gs stop working. MMS, GPS, wifi and some other minor functions will stop working. As there are workarounds to this through Cydia some features will still not work with the new iPhone firmware jailbreaked. If you got a new iPhone i recommend you not to jailbreak untill blackra1n release a proper working unlock or another jailbreak software turn up. However. If you can live without some minor features i recommend unlocking the device if not only fot the themes part. Never figured out why iPhone dont have theme support.
When i jailbroke my iPhone 3Gs this stopped working:
MMS
wifi worked untill i gott MMS to work so i couldnt use both.
The positioning device stopped working so gps and maps app couldnt find my location.
Good luck out there. Im currently running a non jailbroken Iphone 3Gs but are waiting for a proper jailbreak app to release. To much restrictinos on a non jailbroken device.

For all 3GS users out there: with moral support from a guy I met at a training session who had done it before, I was able to successfully jailbreak my 3GS (sourced from AT&T in the US) without any issues whatsoever, using blackra1n. Just follow the instructions. Let iTunes update the phone to 3.12 and the most current baseband and you’ll be fine after running the blackra1n unlock.
You’ll have to run the fix for Wifi, MMS + Youtube from Cydia (a matter of seconds), and if your phone does a reset (for example after installing SW from ROCK), you’ll have to reset your networking setup to get Wifi to work again, but it’s not really an issue.

My Dad gave me his old 3G iphone when he upgraded to the 3GS. He lives in the USA. I live in Australia. He used his phone in the US with AT&T. He never JB or unlocked his iphone. In order for me to use it here in Australia, it has to be unlocked. I’ve already updated to 3.1.2 and the modem firmware is 05.11.07. Everything I’ve read so far says that I can JB, but I can’t unlock if I’ve already updated the firmware to 05.11.07. I tried calling Optus here to see if they could unlock the phone, and they referred me on to AT&T, and we all know what AT&T will say. I tried calling an apple store, they were the ones who referred me to Optus. I looked online on how to unlock and every single site that said they could do it turned out to be a scam. Even the scam finding sites were scams! i.e. http://scamadvisorygroup.com/unlock-iphone-scam/
This site is a big scam. I emailed them and never heard back from them. They rate the following site as the best #1 jailbreak software site:
http://www.unlock-iphone-easy.com
I emailed these people and I never heard back from them. So much for their quick email response.
So I’d like to know is it possible for me to UNLOCK my 3G iPhone? Will the unlock make the iPhone run slower? I’ve read that JB will not make it run slower, but that unlocking will. Will I be able to update my iPhone when iTunes tells me to? Can I still sync through iTunes? I’d like to have Wifi working. Should I just use this iPhone as an iTouch and wait until I can afford to buy an unlocked iPhone here in Australia?

Btw. Scam sites sell free jailbreak software. Never pay to jailbreak your iPhone.
Mike January 13, 2010 at 2:38 am #
@Batia Beth Aronson Slater
Go http://blackra1n.com/ and download the jailbreak app. Run the app with your iPhone in USB connection. After jailbreaking there should be a new app on your iPhone called blackra1n, run it and choose to install cydia and sn0w (sn0w unlocks you iphone). After installation is done go to settings/general/reset and choose reset network, this should make your wifi run again if it doesnt work after jailbreak.
I did this with brand new iPhone and everything worked after jailbreak. I had some trouble the first times as written some comments above. But when i tried again a few days ago everything worked without installing fixes.
You can sync fine with iTunes and your iPhone will not be slow. If you have problem with connection turn off 3G, that take cares of it.
Good luck.

can you tell me if you are having any issues with black rain in os3? My iphone was jailbroken and worked flawlessly until os3 came out, after that my jailbroken phone had 2 huge issues. First, the status bar would simply disappear and reappear randomly, regardless of what theme or theme tweak I tried (or even NO tweaks!), and secondly every time I exited an app it would take 3-4 seconds to return to the springboard. I can’t believe I’m the only person with this issue. Have these issues been resolved in newer versions?

I have had no problem what so ever with the new OS. I’d suggest you do a full restore/update from iTunes and the re Jailbreak your iPhone. Older jailbreak programs dont support the new 3.0 OS.

Hi, I got new iphone 3gs 32gb for my Christmas software 3.1.2 as I am on vodafone I had to run the blackrain software etc and now everytime my battery runs out or phone goes to no signal for a period of time I have tolet it rain again. I was wondering that as vodafone now do the iphone does that mean I dont have to blackrain anymore if so what do I do? Thanks
Mike January 16, 2010 at 2:17 am #
Hi.
This is not a software bug in the blackra1n. This is due to apples newest “bootlaoder” within the iPhone. Jailbreaking iPhones with the newest out of the box software will result in that you have to run blackra1n everytime you iPhone reboots. We will just have to wait for a new jailbreak app that can get around this problem and “hack” the boot of our iPhones.
Reply
Mike January 16, 2010 at 2:20 am #
And if you do not plan to use your iPhone with any other operator maybe you should think twice before jailbreaking. Although jailbreak has severak advantages. But as i said, due to new newest firmware in iPhone you will have to “rain” it everytime it dies.
Luc January 16, 2010 at 2:53 am #

I bought the phone factory sealed so its not in a contract and I am wanting to use it on vodafone so thought there might have been a way round it I thought it would of worked on vodafone to begin with but I had to use an o2 sim card to activate the phone through itunes.
Reply
Mike January 16, 2010 at 10:31 am #
That’s true. You have to activate the phone. If you do not buy the phone at a phoneseller with contract you have to unlock the phone with another card that should follow. Then it should be no problem using any operator. If you bought it contract free and you cant use vodafone i would speak to someone at where you bought it. With no contract the phone should not be locked to any operator.

Do you think a fix will be coming out anytime soon?  Spoke to o2 today and they said will cost £15 to unlock but I cant get it done as you need the payg sim card that matches the imei number on there system but I didnt get it with a sim card just the phone so I am snookered!!!
Mike January 17, 2010 at 7:15 am #
I dont know when an update will come, sorry.
If you didnt get a simcard to activate you phone i would seriusly go talk to the retailer where you got the phone. They should have shipped one with it. Or you could try contacting apple.

please answer as fast as you can

@Lucas,
Before jailbreak, what you need to do is to sync your iPhone data (including contacts, sms, etc) with iTunes. Then you can sync back the data from iTunes to iPhone after jailbreak. If you make up your mind, you can check out this jailbreak guide for details.

Thanks for you post and it was very helpful for me to understand what it is.
But all reason you provided to me didn’t make me feel “I really want it”.
That’s probably because all 5 reasons don’t take me any better than how I use my iPhone.
I am sure lots of people love the features, but I guess nothing seems to be useful for me.

Jailbreak is unsafe and I don’t trust it. Also to I lost phone and mail settings not to mention no MobileMe access. And too battrey life is cut by 30% by what I count. I like the custom settings but if my battrey is going to be cut by at least 30% then it’s not worth it. Plus I notice that some apps did not work well under JailBreak and did I mention memory? No. Crash’s was a commen thing or poor performance because JailBreak took too much memory. Some may disagree with me but I could not see the point of JailBreaking cause too many cons for me.
Reply
Mike February 18, 2010 at 12:36 am #
Allen: Clearly you work in some kind of store somewhere or for apple themselves. All the things you mention will NOT happen on a properly jailbroken iPhone. I have never, i repeat, NEVER had any problems with apps, batterylife or crashes. Neither with email settings or any of that kinds. My iPhone works better after jailbroken and i can use lot’s of apps that otherwise are not approved in the appstore or that are overprized.
Stop spreading lies. You do have right about one thing though. MANY people disagree with you. My guess… 99% of all jailbreakers!
