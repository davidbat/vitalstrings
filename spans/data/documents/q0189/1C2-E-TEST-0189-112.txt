Syncing (synchronizing):
Android devices can sync wirelessly, continuously, and to multiple services. It could             also sync by plugging in should you choose to do so.
Example, Apps are available to allow user to sync their Android phone to an older             Palm Desktop software or Microsoft Exchange server.

NYbreakingnews.com article comparing GPS navigation between Motorola DROID and the             iPhone:
“The Droid gives smooth navigation experience which the iPhone doesn’t manage to             do. TomTom's 3D map images are simple but Droid has higher resolution display. The             Droid defeats the iPhone in giving the right refreshing directions and also compensates             for wrong turns. In the end, Android’s navigation tool was simply superior giving             better count on the price range too. While both devices offer voice directions, Droid's             directions to the iPhone's, had much more clarity. Droid was also miles ahead in             pronouncing street names than the iPhone”.
