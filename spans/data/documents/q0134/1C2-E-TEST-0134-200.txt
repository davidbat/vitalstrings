Thank-Yous
Many people helped me research this project. I am grateful for their assistance. The following provided information about the Nashua clergy in WWII. Phyllis Cline of the Hudson Community Church; Emilie Picard, administrative assistant of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate of the Northeast Area; Mariette Borowski; Sister Claudette; Brother Leon Cyr, SJ, for his help with the ZamZam story. Elaine McConnell, Rare Book curator, answered my many requests for background information about West Point graduates from the Nashua area. Donna Hurley and Tammie Kahnhauser, the library technician, provided the same kind of information about the US Naval Academy graduates. Commander Steve Venckus, Ret., for his input on the Coast Guard in WWII. Chris Nims of Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary researched information about several Nashua area doctors. Bob Aquilina, Reference Branch Historian, printed and sent many casualty reports from the US Marine Corps Archives in Quantico, Virginia. Robert Passanisi, the historian with the Merrill’s Marauders Association, sent information about the Nashua men who served in Burma. I kept the Mason and Jaffrey librarians busy ordering reference books from the intrastate library loan service. Susan Wolpert, Denise Ginsler, Anita Crehan, and Judy Forty were always cheerful when I asked them to try to get me “just one more book.” Joan Knight of the Jaffrey Public Library sent me Admiral Samuel Eliot Morrison, multivolume set of his History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, several times. Paul Friday of the Nashua Historical Society researched several individuals and the major employers in the city. The ladies in the reference area of the Nashua Public Library were very helpful, showing

me how to run and print from the microfiche machine. They were also very patient in allowing my access to the Hunt Room historical room. The following talked to me about their relatives: Joan Horner, Diana Sanford, Christine Warren, Rich Beausoleil, James Makris, the Pitarys family, Cynthia Keary, James and Charles McGettigan, David, Richard, and Jeffrey Pastor, Shirley Cohen, David Cook, James Rasmussen, Herb Merrill, Tom Michaud, Joe Adamonis, his sister Alice and her husband (Forrest Thornton), Don Hogan and James Hogan, John Koutsos, Tom Borowski, Jill L’Eplattienere, Kal, Ken, and Amie Ngoon, Robert Pelkey, and his sister Lynda Pygon, Kathy Tafe, her cousin, Guy Nadeau, and Aunt Peggy Nadeau, Aimee Fogg, and her cousin Ron Lavoie. Joe McGuire, an Eagle Scout and fellow scouter, proofread the stories and corrected typos and syntax and suggested a few changes. Dean Shalhoup, who used to develop my photos when I worked part-time at the Telegraph, researched a number of obituaries to help bring closure to the veterans’ stories. My sons Ben and Luke taught me how to use the computer, and my neighbor John Ouellette kept the damn thing working. My son John allowed me to use his research on Mason’s WWII veterans. My wife, Roseanna Dougherty Dube, was patient most of the time, showing me how to recover stuff lost by the computer. I also want to thank my 1960 NHS classmate Dr. Gretchen Gidge Helm for her support and suggestions. I hope I did not forget someone. If I did, I apologize.
Introduction
This project began twenty-five years ago when I worked as a stringer for the Nashua Telegraph. The paper hired a number of correspondents at the time to cover local news and events in the small towns around Nashua. I reported on the selectmen’s meetings and the planning board meetings in Mason and Greenville and the Mascenic School Board. The editors encouraged us to write special features about people, places, and events. In May 1984, Tom Brokaw of the NBC Nightly News kept reminding his viewers that the fortieth anniversary of the D-Day invasion was only a few weeks away. President Ronald Reagan was giving a major speech at the Pointe du Hoc cliffs, commemorating and honoring the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who fought there. Brokaw planned a broadcast from the Normandy beaches on June 6 to report the president’s speech and to also honor the veterans who began pushing the Nazis back to Germany from France on that day. I approached Jon Breen, the Nashua Telegraph’s managing editor at the time, suggesting that the paper do a D-Day story with a local connection. He thought about it for a short time and told me to see what I could do. I already had Norman Bleau, the head custodian at Nashua High School (then on Elm Street), in mind. I remembered him telling me back in the 1970s when I taught there that he participated in the D-Day invasion. He had a tendency to be taciturn and grumpy, but I learned early in my teaching career to befriend custodians and secretaries. Along with the administrators, they can make your life in a school miserable, if you cross them. I always said hello to Norman Bleau and just about everyone else for that matter.

I asked him what he did on D-Day. He told me he operated the landing barges from the ships to the beaches on that memorable day. The curmudgeonly custodian was pleased to tell me about that day. He was my first World War II veteran interview. Don Dillaby, a Nashua Telegraph staff writer at the same time, wrote a companion piece about a Nashua glider pilot who landed behind the lines on D-Day. Both stories were well received. A few weeks later in July, I approached Jon Breen again, reminding him that WW II did not end with the Normandy invasion, but that it continued for more than another year. I suggested future articles chronicling events from June 6 to the end of the war. Breen thought about a bit and said, “Go ahead.” In three years’ time, between 1984 and 1987, I interviewed nearly forty WWII veterans. The paper printed them to coincide with the forty-year anniversaries of the events they were in. After a forty-year career, I retired from teaching science in Pepperell, Massachusetts, in 2004. I returned to Nashua High School (south) and retired from there in 2007. A few of my fellow teachers, who remembered the WWII series, suggested I resurrect the stories and try to get them published. I thought it would be a good tribute to what Tom Brokaw called “The Greatest Generation.” There were over four thousand men and women from Nashua who served in WWII. The Nashua Telegraph published their names in alphabetical order, a few hundred at a time over a two-week period. There were over 550 from Milford and close to two hundred from Wilton. So how do you choose whom you write about? I wrote about people I knew. I remembered some of my students mentioning that their fathers and grandfathers were servicemen in WWII. Some of those veterans were still around and living in the Nashua area. I interviewed a number of them. Some people called and suggested veterans they knew. I interviewed some of them too. Some of the veterans were native-born Nashuans or were born in the area towns. I interviewed some who moved to the area after the war. I interviewed a few who “married” into the area and a few who only lived here for a short time. I also included a few who were not connected with Nashua but had compelling stories. One is a friend from Pennsylvania. Another lived in Manchester while another attended Dartmouth College and married a girl from Claremont.

A few of the children had compelling stories, so I included them. Jimmy Makris told me about his experiences on the USS Papago during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Carl Weber told me about his father’s involvement in German East Africa during World War I. I am interested in that time also, and I traveled extensively in Kenya and Tanzania in 1966, so I have an interest in that part of the world. I included Karl Weber’s WWI service as well. I tried calling those whom I originally interviewed or their children for updates and was successful with many. I called many whose names I saw in the old Nashua Telegraph articles on microfiche. Reactions to my calls and inquiries ranged from rejection to appreciation. One veteran, although seriously wounded in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), said that it had happened so long ago he could not remember anything. I could hear another tell his wife to tell me he was out for the evening. The widow of one KIA said that the war was so long ago that she did not want to be reminded of the past, and that I should leave it behind. One son of a veteran slammed the phone down when I asked about his father. Some never bothered to return my calls. Quite a few, on the other hand, were very receptive and expressed appreciation that I was interested in their relatives. They lent me letters written during the war and citations for awards. They told me stories about their relatives and growing up in Nashua during the 1930s. I also perused every issue of the Nashua Telegraph from 1941 through October 1947 for stories, leads, and connections. Those issues are stored on microfiche at the Nashua Public Library. It soon became evident that Nashua area men and women were involved in just about every major and/or minor engagements. The only notable exceptions were Wake Island, the Doolittle Raid on Japan, and the Nuremberg Trials. There were not many Americans involved in those events to begin with. What also became obvious were the personal connections I had with some of them, either directly growing up or indirectly through their children. I added some personal stories with those I knew. I hope those digressions add to the stories and not detract from them. I was also interested in learning something about their background and who they were. I avoided the typical physical descriptions. I find it most annoying that many writers list a person’s height as the first adjective in describing him. This is usually followed by body shape (i.e.,
14
RON DUBE
he was thin or heavyset/fat), followed by eye color. Who really cares? A February 15, 2010, Time magazine article describes Defense Secretary Robert Gates as “just 5’8” tall.” So what? The author reveals near the end of the article that Secretary Gates likes to hike, enjoys B movies, and plays hardball and buying cars. He could have added that he is an Eagle Scout. These descriptions are much more interesting and informative than stating he is “just 5’8” tall.” Audie Murphy and Douglas MacArthur both received the Medal of Honor. One was short and the other tall. One deserved the award; the other, possibly awarded for political reasons. I included their street addresses. This gives us a sense of place. Some of the people I interviewed told me something about themselves. The children of others mentioned personal details. But many of the Nashua area veterans are no longer with us, so I thought the high school yearbook might reveal some personal details that could give us insight into their personalities and interests. The Hunt Room of the Nashua Public Library has copies of all the yearbooks starting from 1923 to the present, although a few are missing. I started looking through them for the details I hoped to find. Yearbook paragraphers wrote interesting and insightful information about each graduate. The paragraphs included academic and school activities of each. I looked at all the yearbooks from 1923 through 1945 and 1947. The 1923 yearbook was called the Swastika. The editor wrote, “As we stand on the threshold of our future, which marks the end of our high school days and the beginning of a new epoch in our lives, it would be well to recall to mind the inspiring story of the ‘Great Stone Face’ that we may, too, may some day be an honor and a source of pride to Nashua High School, to the city, and to the Granite State. Bearing this in mind, with the ambition and determination to succeed at whatever task we undertake, we cannot fail to be attended by the good luck and happiness symbolized in the Swastika. “Schoolmates of ’23! Good-bye and ‘Swastika’ to you!” The yearbook cover displayed a swastika, but it did not have the quarter clockwise tilt to it, like the one used by the Nazis. Hitler and his Nationalist Socialist Party were gaining prominence and notoriety at this time. He adopted the swastika, once used by the Templar knights, as the Nazi symbol. The 1924 yearbook editor made no reference to the change from Swastika to Tusitala. The editor wrote in the Foreward: “With this issue
Nashua Area Men and Women in World War II

of the Class Book we have attempted to establish a precedent for future classes by standardizing Tusitala as the name of the Class Book. Like Stevenson, who was called the Teller of Tales by the natives of Samoa, so may we, as we grow older in life, live not only as Tellers of Tales, but as doers of deeds, and when look back on our happy days in Nashua High as depicted in Tusitala, let us still feel affection for our Alma Mater.” I also noted a sad note with the 1966 yearbook. Unlike the previous issues, it had no descriptive paragraph about the graduates. The Tusitala featured only the photos and the names. The yearbook collections in the Milford and Wilton libraries begin with the late 1940s editions, so that limited information about the veterans from those towns. My interviews started with open-ended questions, after doing some research at home. I asked, “Tell me about your experiences in a B-24.” Or “What was Nashua like growing up in the 1920s and 1930s?” I usually asked follow-up questions based on some research I had done before the interview. I sent each person a first draft for corrections, clarifications, additions, or deletions. About half said that what I had written was OK. The others offered objective criticisms. The stories reminded a few of other incidents that they had not mentioned, so I added those as well. I organized the book in three major sections. There are forty-eight stories or references in the North Africa section, thirty-eight in the Pacific section, thirteen in the Home Front section, and three that are in both areas of conflict or in other places. I wish I could have talked to more, but there is a limit to the scope of this kind of project. I hope every veteran had the opportunity to tell his or her stories to his families and that his children have them written and kept for posterity.
Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941)
William Lefabvre at Pearl Harbor
December 7, 1941, is etched in the American psyche, like 9/11 of more recent times and July 4 of a more distant time. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called December 6, 1941, “a day that will live in infamy.” On that day, the Japanese Navy bombed the large American naval base at Pearl Harbor. The raid was part of a larger plan to dominate and control vast areas of the Pacific. The Japanese also attacked the Philippines, Wake Island, Guam, the Dutch East Indies, and the British base at Singapore. The attack on Pearl Harbor was not totally unexpected. The American Navy cryptanalysts had deciphered Japanese military and diplomatic codes that alluded to an attack of some sort somewhere, sometime. The US Navy mentioned “the approaching crisis in the United States-Japanese relations” in mid-November 1941. Pearl Harbor was duly notified. A report indicated that a large Japanese fleet had assembled in that country’s inland sea. Japan and the United States had been at odds for almost a decade. The United States cut the flow of oil and iron to Japan following its invasion and occupation of the Chinese province of Manchuria. Japan conquered that province fairly easily. The Japanese took advantage of the ongoing Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong. Like Great Britain, Japan is an island nation dependent on its merchant fleet to bring in raw materials for its economy. Controlling the sea-lanes would ensure a continual flow of raw materials. The Japanese carefully planned the Pearl Harbor attack. Six aircraft carriers, with more than 330 planes and various escort ships, maintained radio silence across the Pacific.

Eight American battleships were moored around Ford Island. Seven were anchored on the southeast side of the island and the Utah on the northwest. Ninety-six other warships were at the subbase or the naval yard off Pearl City. The stationary ships, to use an old but appropriate cliché, were like sitting ducks at a shooting gallery. The American aircraft carriers were not there. They were at sea. Manchester native and longtime Merrimack resident William Lefabvre was on the USS West Virginia. She was moored at Battleship Row next to the USS Tennessee and diagonally from the USS Arizona. He had left his printing job at the Deerfield Press to join the navy in 1941. The United States was not at war at the time, but Lefabvre paid attention to the developments in Europe and Japan in the late 1930s. He expected United States involvement at any time. He said, “If you joined the military at that time, you could pick which branch you wanted. I joined the navy, before they told me where to go.” On Sunday, December 7, 1941, Lefabvre put on his dress uniform and waited topside for a launch that would take him to a base where he could attend mass. Catholic services were not scheduled for the West Virginia that Sunday. While waiting, he took pause to enjoy the sunshine and the very pleasant weather. He looked off to the hills in the distance and noticed many planes headed in his direction. He thought it strange that the army and the navy were conducting a major drill this early on a Sunday morning. As the planes approached, he noticed each wing and fuselage had big red circles. He said to himself, “What are they doing here? It was a shock to see them. I was never so mad in all my life. They must have done some good planning.” The planes were part of the first wave of bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters to attack Pearl Harbor. The torpedo bombers released torpedoes equipped with wooden fins to make sure they “swam” at a correct depth in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. William Lefabvre saw two torpedoes heading for the Arizona. They hit a magazine that exploded and caused a major concussion wave that blew Lefabvre into the water. A bomb soon finished off the Arizona. Six torpedoes from torpedo bombers and two bombs from other planes hit the West Virginia, igniting massive gas and oil fires that burned for thirty hours. The West Virginia settled in forty feet of water.

Lefabvre found himself and many other sailors struggling in the oil-covered water. He managed to reach a launch, one of many used to ferry sailors from the ships to shore. He clambered aboard, found a mop, and began using it like a safety pole at a swimming pool to help sailors get into the launch. He said “We all looked black. We were all covered with oil.” The launch headed to the subbase so that the men could get some fresh clothing. Lefabvre noticed sly mouth covered whispers and giggles as he walked to the subbase. The woman behind the desk giggled too and tried not to look. It was then that Levabvre first noticed he had no clothes on except for his shirt cuffs. The concussion wave from the exploding Arizona shredded and whisked his Sunday best right off from him. He said “I was bare-assed, but I didn’t care. She couldn’t tell who I was. She couldn’t tell if I was an African or a Frenchman. People started laughing at me when we walked on the road to the subbase. I got teased.” The navy had a strong solvent to dissolve oil. Lefabvre said “That stuff was good. It took the oil right off our skins, but instead of looking black, we looked red for a while. We got dungarees at the subbase. After resting for three days, we lined up on the beach for assignment to our next ship.” The Japanese did not attack the cruiser, San Francisco at Pearl Harbor. Her time was yet to come. The Pearl Harbor attack crippled the American Pacific fleet. The navy lost eighteen major ships, either sank or badly damaged. The Japanese airmen destroyed 188 American planes and damaged another 159. Almost three thousand service personnel were killed in the attack. The Japanese lost fifteen dive-bombers, nine fighters, and five torpedo planes. The Japanese Navy lost all six of the midget submarines sent to penetrate the harbor defenses and sink ships. The Japanese also lost a conventional sub. Fifty-five airmen died and all nine from the midget subs. It is not known how many were lost on the large sub. The Pearl Harbor attack is considered a major Japanese victory by all accounts. The American aircraft carriers, out at sea at the time, would exact sweet vengeance and irreparably damage the Japanese Navy six months later at a small volcanic island (one thousand miles away from Pearl Harbor) called Midway.

The navy refloated, repaired, and modernized the West Virginia. She served with distinction at the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Okinawa. William Lefabvre never returned to the West Virginia. The navy assigned him to the USS San Francisco, a heavy cruiser for the rest of the war. The San Francisco was at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, undergoing repairs. The Japanese planes did not attack her. William Lefabvre was a gunner’s mate on both the West Virginia and the San Francisco. He was in charge of one of the six-gun mounts on the San Francisco. Lefabvre said that those guns fired two types of shells. The conventional shell was the one fired most often. The other was a special projectile used when, as he says, “we saw Japanese planes that could cause real damage approaching. That shell had a short fuse that was set when it came close to an enemy plane. The different pressures between the surrounding air and the air around a plane caused by the spinning propeller set the fuse off. The exploding shell disintegrated the plane.” He added, “We were knocking them off left and right.” Those special shells were kept in boxes labeled bread. Lefabvre eventually became a mount captain, responsible for training new gunners. Sailors on the San Francisco ate together in a big dining area. Cooks served toast, eggs, ham, mashed potatoes, and/or French fries for breakfast. Potatoes and French fries were served again for lunch along with hot dogs or other sliced meat. Lefabvre saidthat the meat tasted and felt as if it were prepared two days in advance. Supper offered a more varied menu, except if the ship was in action. Lefabvre said “Colored boys brought us our food, if we were on duty at our mounts.” The armed forces relegated most African American servicemen to menial, mundane jobs such as food preparation, cleaning, and waiting tables. Lefabvre said “We had a great skipper on the San Francisco. He let the African Americans come to our mounts to learn our jobs. The skipper considered them no different from anyone else.” When allowed or if an unexpected situation arose, the African Americans proved their mettle like any other American. Doris “Dorie” Miller is a great example. The Texas-born sailor was a mess attendant/cook on the West Virginia on December 7, 1941. He ran
Nashua Area Men and Women in World War II
21
to his battle station when the attack started, only to find that a torpedo had destroyed it. He began helping others, including the mortally wounded Captain Mervyn Bennion. Miller did what he could for the dying captain. He then ran to a nearby antiaircraft machine gun and, with no training on the weapon, began firing at attacking planes. Witnesses claim he splashed at least one plane. Admiral Nimitz awarded him the Navy Cross, the first African American to receive it. Miller was lost at sea when a Japanese submarine torpedoed his new ship (the USS Liscome Bay) at the Battle of Tarawa. The gun crews on the San Francisco slept in quarters near their mounts so that “they could get out real quick.” Sailors on the San Francisco spent downtime exercising; playing poker, checkers, and other games; reading; and getting caught up on mail from home. Lefabvre saidthat some of the mail was so old it seemed as if the boats bringing the letters had a hard time catching up to them. William Lefabvre boxed on the ship’s team. Sailors called him Lefty. All the sailors enjoyed shore leave. He said that they liked pickup basketball games and playing on solid ground. They also liked looking for girls. The San Francisco fought in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Aleutian Islands, Wake Island, Kwajalein, Peleliu, Saipan, Tinian, the Philippine Sea, Luzon, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. She fought off kamikaze attacks and survived Halsey’s Typhoon. She returned to some of these places a few times. The San Francisco earned seventeen battle stars during World War II. She received the Presidential Unit Citation for her role in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. William Lefabvre considers himself lucky that he was not seriously wounded. During one attack, however, minute bits of metal shrapnel hit his face. He did not realize what happened until he noticed the small pieces of metal showing up on his razor when he shaved. Apparently, the skin, as it repaired itself, pushed the bits to the surface. The navy called Lefabvre back to duty during the Korean War. He served on the USS Roam, again as a gunner’s mate in charge of a five-inch battery. William Lefabvre married Zonia Petriw, his high school sweetheart, while they attended Manchester Central High School. The couple moved

to Merrimack, New Hampshire, shortly after their marriage. They had two children—William Jr. who lives in Merrimack and Donna who lives in Phoenix, Arizona. William Lefabvre enjoys visiting local schools to talk to students and teachers about this significant time in America’s history. He praises the Merrimack for inviting him and other veterans for presentations and discussions. He said “I was not alone. I keep thinking about all those wonderful friends we lost at Pearl Harbor.” I interviewed William Lefabvre on June 16, 2009. He mentioned his French Canadian heritage several times. I asked him about the different way he spelled his last name. That French name is usually spelled Lefebvre. He smiled and said, “It was my mother. She could be troublesome at times, when she wanted to be. She got in an argument with another Lefebvre relative, so to spite him, she went down and changed the spelling. Our side of the family has kept ever since.”
Leonide Soucy and the USS Utah
The USS Utah was anchored on the northwest side of Ford’s Island, across the island from Battleship Row. She was a once proud ship in the US Navy, but now obsolete, she was being used as a target ship by both the army and the navy. Engineers reinforced her deck with large six-inch-by-twelve-inch beams to absorb the force of the dummy bombs dropped by both navy and army pilots during practice runs.
