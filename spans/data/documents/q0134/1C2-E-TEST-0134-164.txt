On This Date in New England Fire Rescue History and beyond
The Top 1000+ (1391)
Criteria:  
Generally 3rd Alarm or higher, if alarm level is known, or incidents that have headline in newspaper, or incidents that get mentioned in  town history, or unusual incidents. Last update   June  2005  
Please note that in colonial times (until 1752) the calendar year did not change until March 25 (Feast of the Annunciation), therefore a date such as March, 11 1683 (in its day) would be considered March 11, 1684 by standards used today (new years day = Jan 1) - You may see some dates listed as March 11, 1683/4. This shows both old and new style. Only dates between Jan 1 and Mar 25 and before 1752 are affected. Also in 1752, the date after Sept 2, 1752 became Sept 14, 1752.

Sep 19, 1874 - Fall River - MA - The holocaust known as the Granite Mill fire occurred in the early morning of Saturday. It is the most appalling disaster in the history of our cotton manufacture. The barn shaped roof was the sixth story of the mill; the only exit was the staircase in the tower of the mill. When the fire occurred it quickly cut off access to the tower and operatives in the sixth floor were obligated to jump from the windows to save their lives. In attempting this method of escape thirty operatives were killed and many more suffered serious and life long injuries. The fire is supposed to have been caused by a friction spark which kindled some cotton; the fire department ladders were not long enough to reach the sixth floor and fire nets were not available.

Sep 28, 1909 - Corinna - ME - et al - rained for several days during the last days of September 1909 caused by a "disturbance" off the coast of New England. The story from Sept. 30, 1909 called it one of the worst floods in the history of Northern Maine. It affected the counties of Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, and Washington. It washed out many railroad lines, roads and bridges. Some of the more interesting stories in the paper were about the possibility of the dam bursting at Katahdin Iron Works and with so many logs clogging the rising rivers that in Brownville, 100 men spent two days dynamiting the logs that had backed up at the bridge. The log jams also made the flooding worse by causing the water to backup in flatlands, other streams, lakes and ponds. The thing noted by the paper that this rain affected the potato harvesting, but at the same time, it had been a very dry season and the rain was badly needed to restore the normal levels of water.
