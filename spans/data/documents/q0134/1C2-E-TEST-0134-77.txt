Serving the seacoast for 18+ years, we specialize in all aspects of finish work, and also perform all the necessary carpentry for home remodeling & restoration. We can construct sunrooms, staircases, mantles, built-ins, decks, kitchens, and bathrooms. We also do all types of custom woodworking.  We will design your project with professional cad software which produces not only a floor plan, but many three dimensional views & renderings. This process will make visualization easier, so that you really know what you are getting, before the work commences. We are fully insured with an insurance certificate provided on request.
