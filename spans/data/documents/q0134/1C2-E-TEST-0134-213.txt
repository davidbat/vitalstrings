the livestock that was left wandered at will along the side Debris from the place was tered far and wide Some of the milk cans bearing Mr Hicks initials were found miles away all were missing after

most profitable Mark Smith The Local Paper Leads The following editorial is quoted from the Minneapolis financial magazine circulated throughout the northwest In the comparatively recent past the local newspaper was about the only place where merchants could advertise their wares Since then other important media have come into existence notably radio and television But despite the inroads these have made on retailers advertising budgets the newspaper is still the dominant factor in the field by a wide margain This statement is substantiated by a recent survey of the advertising practices of department stores in all tions of the country It found that the cal store allocated SO per cent of the ad- dollar to newspapers nine per cent to television four per cent to radio three per cent to direct mail and four per cent to other media The local newspaper offers the surest means of reaching the masses of the people whether a news story or an editorial opinion or an advertising message And that's why merchants place it first when dividing up their advertising appropriations Incidentally one wonders if there are still people who regard advertising as a waste which adds unnecessarily to the cost of goods Actually advertising acts as a possible factor in holding prices down by creating the widest possible demand for merchants and thus ing mass distribution possible
