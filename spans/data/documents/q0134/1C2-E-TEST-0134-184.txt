Find Land
1. Search the Northern New England Real Estate Network (NNEREN) site. This site enables you to search every listing in the state.
2. Sign-up with area newspapers to be notified by email when land listings meeting your requirements run in the paper.
3. Drive around the area where you'd like to build. Look for "For Sale By Owner" signs (this method really works!).
4. Visit the town hall in the town where you'd like to live. Ask to see the tax maps. Look for vacant lots and note owner's name and address. Contact owner to see if they would be interested in selling. This method takes some time but can uncover land no one else knows about.
5. Contact a Realtor who specializes in land.
