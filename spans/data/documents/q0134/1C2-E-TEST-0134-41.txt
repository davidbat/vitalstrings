Common Crushed Stone Terms
Crushed stone is an important material for construction and home improvement projects. It is available in a variety of colors and machined crushed into different sizes for any purpose. Below are seven terms to be familiar with when shopping for crushed stone.
Aggregate - Materials like crushed stone, gravel, slag, or sand used in construction. Aggregate materials are commonly used to strengthen composites, to encourage drainage, or as decorative landscaping mulch.
Asphalt - A black liquid substance that is mixed with an aggregate and acts like a glue, binding together loose materials. Asphalt is used to make roads.
Gravel - Small pieces of rock, commonly used to construct roads or paths. Gravel is also used for residential landscaping projects. It often forms naturally as rocks erode due to weathering.
Limestone - A type of rock made of calcium and carbon. It is usually white to gray in color. Limestone is used for a variety of purposes, including in gardens, household products, food, and the construction of buildings.
Dolomite - A hard mineral that is white, gray, or pink in color. Often, dolomite is machine-ground into small or medium sized stones and used in residential gardens to prevent weed growth, keep soil moist, and improve aesthetics.
Slag - A by-product of purifying metals. Slag is crushed and used in concrete or to fertilize gardens.
Shale - A type of rock made of compressed clay, sand, and minerals. Shale can be black, red, or brown but is usually gray. Shale is used in the making of bricks and cement.
