A Message From Our Local Decision-makers
When you walk into our rental stores, we see a customer, not a dollar sign. At Volvo Rents, it’s not just about renting you equipment, it’s about our working together to get the job done. That’s why we’ll open the store late if you need us to. Why we only rent you the highest quality construction equipment. And why we aim to be the friendliest store in town. Because at Volvo Rents, "OPEN" is an attitude. Not just a word on the door.
