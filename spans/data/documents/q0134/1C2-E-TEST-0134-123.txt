Cakewalk ProChannel Concrete Limiter
Well, it's the first time I'd like to see a VST version of a Cakewalk-made effect !
Great sounding mastering limiter for sure. The feature-set and technology used seems on top of the game too !
If they got it right with Sonar X2 in a not so far future, it may have nice arguments...
