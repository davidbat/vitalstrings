Frame Tents
Â 
Frame tents are the most functional style of tent. They have no center poles, which allows for an obstacle free layout. Instead of center poles, they have aluminum piping throughout the roof of the tent like rafters.
Frame tents can be staked into the ground directly next to the side pole, which allows multiple tents to connect together or allows the tent to abut a building, fence or landscaping. These tents are the only style of tent that can be tied to concrete weights instead of staking into the ground allowing them to be used on asphalt, concrete, decks or to cover a stage. Frame tents can accommodate any style of sidewall, flooring, or lighting. We recommend lighting for both day & night functions as the fabric of these tents is light blocking. These are great for high-end events like weddings, bar mitzvahs, commercial events, and are the best solution for maximizing your outdoor space.
