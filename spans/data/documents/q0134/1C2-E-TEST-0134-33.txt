Merrimack Landscaping Company
In 1984, Dave Raisanen founded Raisanen Landscaping and began to serve clients in Nashua New Hampshire. With a passion for the creativity and satisfaction that comes from working with his hands, his reputation for excellent workmanship quickly grew.
It's no wonder that now, 25 years later, Raisanen Landscaping still receives most of its projects through word-of-mouth. As the Nashua area boomed through the late 1980s, Raisanen Landscaping grew right along with it. Contracted by Audley Corp. to build retaining walls and stairs along the retail strip of Daniel Webster Highway and by PSNH to assist in expanding infrastructure, this company demonstrated its ability to keep up with the growing economy.
Big projects are impressive, but Dave's real accomplishments are a result of meeting with people and designing their landscape. Raisanen's specialty is working with the land to create a usable and attractive environment that fits their individual customer's style. Sturdy retaining walls, elegant paver patios, water gardens and fire pits are some of the elements Dave uses to create a backyard paradise.
His seasoned crews provide meticulous, efficient, and courteous service while doing construction projects or weekly maintenance. Since relocating from Nashua to Merrimack, New Hampshire, Raisanen Landscaping performs commercial and residential landscaping services in Bedford as well.
And when he can, Dave works right alongside his award-winning construction team, continuing to do the creative projects that he has enjoyed doing for so many years.
