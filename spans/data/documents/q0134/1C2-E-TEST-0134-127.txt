MLS# 4153222
Less than half a mile to exit 4 on route 3, this home is close to everything! A fully-fenced in yard and large pine trees to lend even more privacy and make this house an oasis in the city. With two HUGE bedrooms to choose from, you'll have a hard time deciding which one is the master bedroom (though the room with the walk-in closet and reading nook does fit the bill nicely)! The third bedroom works well as a guest room or an office since it has no closet. Two large sheds for storage and working space more than cover all storage needs, but just in case there's plenty of room on the porch and in the separate furnace room as well. The spacious yard lends itself well to gardening, barbecuing, partying, and playing. The garden space is ready for you to grow your own veggies, with plenty of potential for expansion if you get ambitious! There's a fire pit to enjoy on those cool late-summer evenings and a 2.5 season porch for when the rain comes and you want to enjoy it without getting wet!
