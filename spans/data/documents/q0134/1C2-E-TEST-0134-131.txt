Rain - New Concrete
It sounds like a poor job of protecting and treating the concrete while it cured. If you had not been planning on the staining and architectural effect, it might have been adequate for a normal driveway or slab. Concrete reacts to the conditions as it cures over time. Once you get into architectural effects, it requires experience to maintain the expected appearance.
Did the contractor that did the work have experience and references? Was it was done with different people (pouring, finishing, stamping, curing and staining)? All too often, people place a high expectation on the appearance of anything relating to design or architectural appearance and do not get the right people to do everything and accept the responsibility according to mutally agreed expectations. Getting several people involved really complicates the responsibility. Even Architects have learned long ago to get 2 sample panels to provide an allowable range or pre-qualify contractors.
Without knowing the details, it seems like you had a poor or unqualified contractor for you expectations or others got in the middle of the proven process.
