American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA)
A. Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCB) Awards
Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCB) are zero interest bonds awarded to school districts for the construction or renovation of school facilities or for the acquisition of land upon which a school is to be built. Under this program, the IRS gives tax credits to the lending institution to offset the interest that would normally be charged to the school district. New   Hampshire's allocation for 2009 is $29,784,000. The QSCB Program was authorized under Title I of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
The School Building Authority met on May 21, 2009 to review and prioritize   applications for the 2009 allocation of QSCB. The Building Authority recommended that the following allocations be awarded: Somersworth $19,930,790; Winnisquam $ 3,550,000; Concord $3,680,000; and Pembroke $2,623,210 (Pembroke's request was for $3,600,000). The   Commissioner of Education approved the Building Authority's recommendations on May 22, 2009. More information can be found on the Department's Web site at www.education.nh.gov .

Data Issues

The DOE introduced the new USED collection and reporting requirements for racial and ethnic data for students at the i4see end of year training held this past month at the DOE. Documents from the training session have been posted to the DOE i4see Web site ( www.education.nh.gov ) under Tip #22.

Contact: Irene Koffink, (603) 271-3865, Irene.koffink@ed.state.nh.us
B. Performance Pathways (P+) and Assessment Data
For the past year, the NH DOE has been sending data to P+ for several assessments: NECAP, NWEA, DIBELS, AimsWeb, Access for ELL's, and Stanford Reading First. If your district conducts any of these assessments and you are not seeing them in P+ but would like to, please contact us.
The state is also paying for P+ to load two additional third party assessments for districts with student level assessment results (e.g. if you are conducting the CAT tests, IOWA, etc.).
Please note: Your students' results can be included in P+ at no additional charge. They will do the work for you to include these results.
Finally, districts may load as many additional assessments (local or national) as desired if the district loads the data directly in P+ themselves.

Funding Issues
A. School Building Aid
a. Please submit Form A24F and any other missing documentation as soon as construction projects are complete. We cannot make the final payment on any project with missing documentation.
b. Project Status Reports were mailed in April to verify the entitled amounts of School Building Aid for each district in FY 10. Please sign and return the form as soon as possible if you have not already done so.
c. Summer Tips - Schools which are closed for the summer need to be checked for leaks following heavy rain storms. Wet areas must be dried completely within 48 hours to avoid the growth of mold. When cleaning carpets using wet methods, try to avoid very humid days and Fridays. Provide as much ventilation as possible to dry the carpet quickly. Do not close up a school with wet carpet longer than overnight.
d. Reminder: Monthly fire drills are required during summer sessions. Schools may need to consider a different evacuation plan for the summer due to different patterns of   building usage.

Initiatives
A. Common Core State Standards Initiative
New Hampshire has joined the Common Core State Standards Initiative along with 45 other States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands. The initiative is led by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the National Governors Association, and the states. Commissioner Tracy recommended to Governor Lynch that as participants NH could share the lessons learned from its partnership with the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP) and the benefits of states working together collaboratively. This effort anticipates development of common core standards that are based on research and evidence, are aligned with college and   work expectations, include rigorous content and skills, and are internationally benchmarked. Once developed the adoption of these common core standards is voluntary for states, and it is fully intended that states adopting the common core may choose to include additional state standards which go beyond the common core.

B. Summer 2009 Response to Intervention (RTI) Conference
The "Doing RTI: What Does it Really Mean" Conference will be held July 7-9, 2009 at the Radisson Hotel, Nashua, NH.

With many years of first-hand experience in   introducing and sustaining RTI in Iowa schools, Shannon Harken will present on "lessons learned" from her experience with RTI, from the early stages of building consensus and   developing collaborative teams through the use of data to modify and differentiate instruction to reach all students. She will introduce RTI tools and facilitate workshops and action planning for teams of educators on this essential new school improvement approach. Teams from schools and districts at all stages of the RTI process are invited to learn more and network for two and a half days of professional learning. District or school teams will receive preference; individuals are welcome based on available space. Funding possibilities include Title II redistribution funds (use DOE Form 1), IDEA Part B funds, IDEA ARRA funds, and district PD funds. Conference registration closes on June 12th and the deadline for room reservations is June   20th. An RTI brochure can be found at www.education.nh.gov .
