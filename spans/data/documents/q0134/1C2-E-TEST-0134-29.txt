Concrete is a crucial component of the building process and masonry contractors use it in its various forms for a variety of applications including residential foundations and sidewalks. Concrete products manufacturers sell to masons, contractors, and builders in bulk at a discount. Ready mix concrete is one type of concrete, manufactured according to a set recipe. This concrete is delivered right to a construction site for immediate use. Poured into molds, it then sets to form hard sidewalks, roadways, walls, or foundations. Concrete can also come precast in slabs and blocks for countertops, flooring, tile, and decorative patios. There are many ways to pour concrete, such as from a pump or via a concrete mixer truck. Specialty mixes are available as well with certain aggregates included to help with binding. Distributors in this industry may also sell the commercial and industrial tools necessary to apply or smooth the concrete or cement mixtures such as trowels, paver equipment, and rolling machines. Many dealers make themselves available to contractors on a regular basis, providing shipments and delivery of blocks on a set schedule. Customers can find them online or through business referrals. Concrete has a long history. Concrete has been used for centuries, dating back to the ancient Egyptians who used a mixture of lime and gypsum cement. The first emergence of modern concrete, comprised of cement and small pebbles, now called aggregates, was invented in the mid-1700s. Today, concrete is used for all sorts of things including pipes, walls, foundations, and flooring. Whether precast or ready mix, concrete product manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors can deliver on customer requests.
