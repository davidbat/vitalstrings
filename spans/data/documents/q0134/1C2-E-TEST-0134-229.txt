Industry Professionals Say
“Entering a parking lot should be the beginning of a pleasant experience when you arrive at a site and/or building. Parking lots should be ‘parking gardens’ with trees, other vegetation, color, texture and variety. Besides creating a sustainable drainage system that supports plants, permeable interlocking concrete pavement improves the character of parking area, thereby supporting the parking garden idea.”
- Jay Womack, ASLA, LEED® AP,
Director of Sustainable Design with Wight & Company-Darien, Illinois
"Permeable interlocking concrete pavements are a logical choice for effective stormwater management.  High quality interlocking concrete pavers provide a hard and durable surface not subject to surface abrasion and raveling while effectively transferring surface water to the underlying open graded aggregate which provides storage and filtering capabilities."
