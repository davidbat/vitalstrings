Courses / Programs
The Forman School in Litchfield, CT is a coeducational college-preparatory boarding and day school offering grades 9-12 to students with identified learning differences including dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, and ADD/ADHD. We are located in the scenic Northwest Hills of Connecticut, just 2.5 hours from New York City by car. Our community is comprised of 175 students from 22 states and 12 international countries.
A Forman education is based on the knowledge that students learn differently. An average class size of six and student-faculty ratio of 3:1 makes it possible to prepare each student for college and beyond. A strong close-knit community provides a secure place to live and learn. At Forman, our students feel safe and the school becomes a second home. We are a community where relationships matter and where we watch out for and support each other. The sense of community and independence is evident every day, in all that we do.
Our program does not support students with a diagnosis of Autism or Aspergers, nor does it support students with behavioral or emotional difficulties.
