One of Connecticut's nicknames is The Nutmeg State, named for this versatile, pungent spice (though, as is usual, no one really knows why).  It is the third-smallest state, but its citizens are known as fiercely independent yet warm and welcoming.  Despite its small size, Connecticut offers several dozen colleges and universities, many with culinary arts programs.
Tourism is an important part of Connecticut's economy.  There are tours of all kinds; wineries, architecture, early American history, impressionist art, etc.  Along the way, people stay at hotels and historical bed-and-breakfasts - and sample the local fare.
