Magnet Schools
Interdistrict magnet schools are designed to voluntarily reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation. They seek to attract students by offering a special, high-quality curriculum. These exciting and innovative schools provide educational opportunities for students who benefit from a range of themes or teaching philosophies that include performing arts, math, science and technology, international studies, early childhood and multicultural education. Admission to these schools is open to all students in participating school districts.
