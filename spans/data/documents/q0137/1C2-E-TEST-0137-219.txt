UPDATE: Kiplinger's has learned that Claremont McKenna College unfairly earned its place as 18th-ranked private liberal arts college in our college rankings by reporting inflated SAT scores.     We have dropped the college from our 2011-12 rankings of best values in liberal arts colleges and moved schools 19-100 up one slot.     Bennington College has been added to the top 100.
