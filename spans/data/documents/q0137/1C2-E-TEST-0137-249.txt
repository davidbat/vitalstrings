Short Definition
The process of joining together two pieces of metal so that bonding accompanied by appreciable inter atomic penetration takes place at their original boundary surfaces. The boundaries more or less disappear at the weld, and integrating crystals develop across them.
Expanded Information
Welders work in a variety of work environments. They may work outdoors on construction sites, or indoors in production and repair shops. On jobs such as oilfield related welding, travel may be required. Welding is carried out by the use of heat or pressure or both and with or without added metal.
There are many types of welding including Metal Arc, Atomic Hydrogen, Submerged Arc, Resistance Butt, Flash, Spot, Stitch, Stud and Projection. Welders may be routinely required to lift tools, supplies, materials or equipment weighing up to 25 kilograms.
There is some risk of injury involved in working with torches and hot metals, and working near the resulting sparks and toxic gases. Apprentices earn at least 55% of the prevailing journeyperson wage in the first period, 75% in the second and 80% in the third.
The average wage for a qualified Welder is $25-$28 per hour. Welders are employed in a variety of industries, including vessel or structural steel assembly, pipeline construction, commercial construction, industrial construction, steel fabrication and heavy equipment repair.
