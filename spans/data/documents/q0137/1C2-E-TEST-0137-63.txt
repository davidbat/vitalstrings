Reggio Magnet School of the Arts (Pre K-2)
This program for preschool to first grade students focuses on giving children some control over the direction of their learning, teaching children through experiences - touching, moving, listening, seeing, and hearing, working with other children and material items, and providing opportunities for them to express themselves.
