Connecticut Career Opportunities
Connecticut boasts the highest per capita income of any state, mostly thanks to the flourishing financial organizations and the development of hedge fudges in Fairfield County. And while the state has a range of reputable business schools including the University of Connecticut and Fairfield University with degree programs in Finance and Accounting & Related Services, there are other careers worth pursuing here, too. Students interested in law will benefit from pursuing degrees in Criminal Justice & Law Enforcement and Legal Assistant/Paralegal. Because of the proximity to New York City, many marketing and advertising firms set up shop here so Commercial & Advertising Art degrees from colleges in Connecticut will prepare you for these careers.  Service careers in the spa and beauty industry are big, too, so Hair Styling & Hair Design and Massage Therapy degrees are popular at Connecticut colleges.
