We represent eight nationally recognized liberal arts colleges throughout the country.
 
Each of these highly selective residential colleges has something distinctive to offer.  As a group, we place great value on student-faculty interaction, small classes, and challenging curricula. 
 
These colleges send a high percentage of graduates on to graduate and professional schools, and count their alumnae/i leaders in virtually every field.
 
In the fall and spring, the Deans of Admission of these eight colleges hold receptions.  They invite you and your parents to attend one in your area.  The program will include presentations on admission, financial aid, and each of the colleges.  There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about each college individually.
