Colleges in Connecticut: Universities, Trade and Technical Schools
Connecticut Colleges Summary
Connecticut may be a small state, but it has a healthy number of colleges and adult education schools within its borders -- more than 80 schools. However, Connecticut has the 10th lowest percentage of its population enrolled in these schools (about 5.4%) with just over 180,000 students enrolled.
Dorm room occupancy in Connecticut colleges is quite high with a full third of all students in Connecticut residing in dorms, the 7th highest in the country. What makes this more interesting is that in contrast only about 60% of students attend public schools, the 10th lowest percentage across all US states. Connecticut Colleges also tend to be selective with 25% of their students having an average SAT score just over 1060.
The most well known college in Connecticut is Yale University, but the largest school is the University of Connecticut with about 24,000 student enrolled and locations in Storrs (the main campus), Hartford, Stamford, Avery Point, Torrington, and Waterbury. Southern Connecticut State University also has more than 10,000 students enrolled.
The Connecticut Department of Education can be found inside the State Office Building on Capitol Avenue in downtown Hartford. The web address for the Connecticut DOE is http://www.sde.ct.gov/ .
