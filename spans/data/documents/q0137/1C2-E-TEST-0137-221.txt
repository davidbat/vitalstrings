K-12 Schools for Learning Disabilities
Please note: Autism and related disabilities, such as PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified), and Asperger's Syndrome are not just one disorder with a well defined set of symptoms; autism is a broad spectrum of disorders that ranges from  mild to severe. The schools on our list are schools for Learning Disabilities, they may not be an appropriate placement for all the children with autism.
If you have corrections for information already on the list, or a new listing,  we'd appreciate hearing from you.
