Posted 06/25/2012 12:46PM
During the week of July 9th-14th, Mrs. Carrie Hill, 4th grade teacher at Highcrest Elementary School, will return as an instructor at the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy is attended by teachers throughout the country who teach grades 3-5. The mission of the Academy is to increase students' learning and appreciation of Mathematics and Science. The instructors accomplish this by enhancing teachers' mathematical and science content knowledge, demonstrating interrelationships between scientific inquiry and mathematical problem solving, and modeling "best practices" in teaching and learning so that teachers can use the knowledge they attain at the conference in their own classrooms come September. Mrs. Hill will teach the science portion of the Academy, focusing on forces and motion. It is the academy's curriculum goal to deepen the teachers' understanding of these concepts through the use of hands-on experiments that can be used with their own students.

Silas Deane Middle School Students Write Outstanding Research Papers
Posted 06/10/2012 12:55PM
This spring, eighth grade students completed a challenging interdisciplinary research project on any topic related to space.  Students researched their topic using books, magazines, videos, and websites to compile facts that would then be used in a formal outline.  This outline became the foundation for the 3-5 page paper that included in-text citations, a graphic, caption, and a works cited page.  Although the process was rigorous, our students should be very proud of their achievements in researching and writing, as this was one of their first experiences learning and implementing many new skills.  Please click the title to see the research papers written by 8 students.
