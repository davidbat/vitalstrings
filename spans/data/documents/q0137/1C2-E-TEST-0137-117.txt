Top Party Schools for 2011 and 2012
Based on surveys taken from 122,000 students, the Princeton Review has released their 2012 annual rankings of colleges. By far the list that gets the most attention is the ranking of the top party schools in the nation. The ranking is generated based on survey questions relating to student use of alcohol and drugs, hours of study done each day, and the popularity of the Greek system at the school.
This year Ohio University ousted University of Georgia for the top spot in Princton's rankings of top party schools, but University of Georgia came in a close second. It's not surprise that Ohio University is at the top of the list. Most of us know if you're looking for a great time and like to drink Ohio University is where it's happening. And topping this years list of "Stone Cold Sober" schools, which is no surprise, is BYU as well as several other military academies.
