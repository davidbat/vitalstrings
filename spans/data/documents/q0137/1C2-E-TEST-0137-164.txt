National Top Picks: Universities | Public Universities | Liberal Arts Colleges | Engineering | Business | Women's | Most Selective | More Top Picks
New England has some of the most selective and prestigious colleges and universities in the country. Harvard frequently ranks first or second among universities, and Williams and Amherst often vie for the top spot for liberal arts colleges.  On the engineering front, MIT frequently sits at the top of the rankings. The 25 colleges and universities below were chosen based on retention rates, graduation rates, student engagement, selectivity, and financial aid. I have listed the schools alphabetically to avoid the often arbitrary distinctions that separate #1 from #2, and because of the futility of comparing a large research university to a liberal arts college or a business school.
