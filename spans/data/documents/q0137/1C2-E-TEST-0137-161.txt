Lists of top colleges are always problematic. It's unreasonable to compare comprehensive universities like Harvard to small four-year colleges. The schools here offer BA degrees (some also offer BS degrees) and have primarily an undergraduate focus and liberal arts curriculum. Differentiating between #1 and #2 on lists of top colleges is so subjective that here I've simply listed the schools alphabetically.
