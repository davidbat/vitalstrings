The culinary field is not for the weak-hearted, it is for those who believe they have what it takes to become a master chef.

The culinary industry does not adhere to a 9 to 5 schedule, five days a week. The weekend evening hours are the boom time in the culinary industry. In order to become a successful master chef, you must be available and at your best during the culinary industry's peak hours. Serving a fine meal for dinner is one of the main goals, and this often makes life difficult for those with families or loved ones. In order to become a successful chef, you must be able to work around such obstacles and resign yourself to living outside of the weekend.
