School Notes:
The Hotchkiss School was founded 1891, establishing a tradition of academic excellence in a small-school community with a large-school diversity.  Hotchkiss strives to develop in students a lifelong love of learning, responsible citizenship, and personal integrity.  The School is a community based on trust, mutual respect, and compassion, and it holds all members of the community accountable for upholding these values.  The School is committed to mastery of learning skills, development of intellectual curiosity, excellence, and creativity in all disciplines, and enthusiastic participation in athletics and other school activities.  The School encourages students to develop clarity of thought, confidence and facility in expressing ideas, and artistic and aesthetic sensitivity.  In and out of the classroom, all members of the community are expected to subject their views and actions to critical examination and to accept responsibility for them.  The School hopes that graduates will leave Hotchkiss with a commitment to environmental stewardship and service to others and with a greater understanding of themselves and of their roles in a global society.
