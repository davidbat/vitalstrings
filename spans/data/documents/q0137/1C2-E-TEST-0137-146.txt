Living in Texas
There is very little to dislike about living in Texas.  It might get a little hot from time to time, but that is a small price to pay for the lifestyle, people, culture, and diversity that come with the package.  Centrally located as it is, you easy access to either coast, Mexico, and America's heartland.  But chances are, you will want to spend most of your time within Texas itself; it has so much to offer.
Distance Learning Programs
One of Texas' greatest offerings comes through the online schools that proliferate throughout the state.  Through distance learning programs, you can earn degrees in just about every subject under the sun.  And, given the climate, you can pursue degrees that are quite difficult to find in regions such as New England (example: cattle raising).  Online schools will help you broaden your horizons and take control of your career.  The very first step of your journey is just a mouse click away.
