Pretty Connecticut has so much to offer college students, including close proximity to cities such as New York and Boston, university towns like New Haven, and small waterfront villages that are peacefully reminiscent of by gone eras. In addition to its picturesque scenery and fabulous location, Connecticut is home to some of the finest colleges in the country, including an Ivy League university and some very prestigious smaller schools as well.

Its main campus is in Storrs-Mansfield, but UConn also has a School of Law in Hartford and regional campuses in Avery Point, Stamford, Greater Hartford, Torrington and Waterbury.
