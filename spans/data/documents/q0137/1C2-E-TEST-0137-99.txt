This list of high schools in the state of Connecticut is a sortable table. To sort alphabetically by the subject of each column, click on the triangles in each column heading. A second click reorders the list in reverse alphabetical order by that column. The default order for the list is alphabetically by community name.
School names are listed with the full, official name of the school (although "The" has been dropped from names to let them be put into alphabetical order). Some schools named after people are sometimes known by the last name of the person (such as "O'Brien Tech", for Emmett O'Brien Technical High School instance).
