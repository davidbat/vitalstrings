Two Rivers Magnet Middle School (6-8)
embolden every learner
CREC Schools believe that every child can learn at the highest level. Our learning environments are uniquely conceived and designed to encourage innovation, exploration and the  excitement of new knowledge. Challenged and supported by educators who invest in each individual, CREC students are emboldened to push themselves intellectually and artistically  to achieve more than they ever imagined.
