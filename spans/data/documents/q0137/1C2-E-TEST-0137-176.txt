Welcome
Founded in 1890, The Taft School is a coeducational boarding school for 577              students in grades nine through post graduate. Living where they learn,              academically talented students from all over the world are guided by an              extraordinary faculty on a 220-acre campus in Western Connecticut. With the              motto “Not to be served but to serve” as a moral foundation, Taft graduates              matriculate at our nation’s leading colleges and universities.
