About University rankings
Many national and international websites and newspapers provide annual rankings of Universities and Colleges based on several criteria. For many years, they have undertaken both statistical and reputational ratings / rankings of Colleges and attempted to provide relevant information to prospective students. Increasingly, the importance and validity of University and College rankings is a highly debated issue. Many Universities, including highly ranked ones, are beginning to question both the data and methods used by some ranking services. Of special concern are the aspects of the rankings / ratings which deal with the difficult to measure concept of institutional reputation.The aim of this website is to provide an approximate ranking of world-wide Universities and Colleges based on the popularity of their website only. We do not claim to rank Universities by their reputation, quality of education or level of services provided.
