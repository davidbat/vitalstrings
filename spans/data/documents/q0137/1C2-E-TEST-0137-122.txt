Best Colleges in New York, Best New York Universities, Best Online Colleges
In the minds of some, New York colleges represent the ultimate in learning.  This assumption is not terribly surprising when you consider how incredibly diverse the "Empire State" really is.  New York City is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, and the rest of the state is not far behind.  Diversity will prove crucial to your studies since multicultural exposure and the healthy exchange of ideas is as important to the learning process as state of the art facilities or world renowned professors are.
Professor and Facilities to Boot
However, it just so happens that, New York colleges do have excellent professors and facilities.  When it comes to faculty and resources, few states are able to contend with New England and California for supremacy.  This is in large part due to New York's relative affluence.  They have money to spend on education, and so they do.  The results are extraordinary
Distance Learning through Online Schools
The problem with vying for the top spot is that you must work constantly so as not to be outdone by rivals.  This is why New York has invested so much time and energy into its many distance learning universities.  Through these online schools, you can earn degrees such as chemistry or forestry, entirely from home.  You need not suffer through cold winter commutes (in some parts, it is many degrees below zero), or blistering summer days (it gets quite hot as well), in order to complete your education.  So whether you want to study in the classroom or at home, New York universities have something to offer.
