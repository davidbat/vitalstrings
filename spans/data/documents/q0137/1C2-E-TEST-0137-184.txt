Art School Rankings
Read These Reviews Before You Apply to Art School
Remember most of us only get one chance to blow fourty thousand dollars on a college education. It is important to get as good an artistic education as you can afford. You will be paying for the classes for a very long time. Too many art students run off to the nearest art institute without evening researching the reputation or accreditation of the school they are attending.
Many trade schools are all to quick to load students up with loans while promising jobs that never materialize after graduation. If the school does not ask to see a portfolio of your work then you can be guaranteed that you are not at one of the top schools. If you spend a few hours going these ranking you can get a much better idea of the art school that is right for you.
Not everyone needs to attend a top school like Cal Arts, Yale or the Chicago Art Institute. Every art school has a number of talented students. A trade school may be the best option for students that need to stay close to home. In any case, it is better to understand all the options so that you can make an informed decison.
