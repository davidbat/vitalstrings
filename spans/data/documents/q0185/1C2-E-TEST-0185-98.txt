Real Haunted House
Columbia , South Carolina
The original part of this high school is said to be haunted by the ghost of George Pair, the school’s first principal. It is said that Mr. Pair frequently appears in the hall wearing a dark suit with a red tie. His wife who still teaches at the school says that George has told her he just wishes to protect the students. He closes the doors of teachers that work late. He follows students and teachers to their cars after late night activities. It is said that one may hear Mr. Pair’s footsteps walking through the hall though the halls were carpeted many years ago. It is said that this activity was caught on video by a group of adventurous teachers and students in 1994.
