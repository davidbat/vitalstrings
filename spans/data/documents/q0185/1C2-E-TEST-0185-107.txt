Manufacturer Information
100% Juice, Non-alcoholic. With grated horseradish. No one is quite sure when horseradish was first added to the Bloody Mary. But ever since, this extra spicy combination has been a big hit with serious Bloody Mary lovers. What makes Tabasco Extra Spicy Bloody Mary Mix special is the grated horseradish we add. Unlike reconstituted horseradish, which loses its pungency over time, the grated horseradish in Tabasco Bloody Mary Mix keeps all of the kick and flavor to the very last drop. No preservatives or stabilizers added. Made in U.S.A.
