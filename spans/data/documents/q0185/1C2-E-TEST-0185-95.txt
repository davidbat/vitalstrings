Bloody Mary’s house is the private residence of the mystic and medium Bloody Mary in the middle of New Orleans. New Orleans is home to the highest mortality rate in North America for the last two centuries, with ghosts all over the town. According to Bloody Mary, most of us have spirits travel with us all the time, whether they are spiritual guides, ancestors, or guardian angels. The old lady that lived in the house before her watches over the house and doesn’t cause any harm or trouble. She sees her as a small woman who walks in the hallways.
Her husband and child have also seen the former owner. Another ghost is named Thomas, a 35 year-old man who seems to be both jealous and protective of Bloody Mary. For instance, he didn’t like her ex-boyfriend, so whenever he came over the electricity would go out in the bedroom and parlor. Once he left, everything went back to normal. By the time the electrician would go there to check it out, it would be completely fine. There are ghosts in the attic that are heard on many occasions but are now sealed in with holy oil.
In her sons room, the attic creaked open on its own. In five years, the door had been incredibly hard to open, and never did its own. Ever since then, she sealed the door with holy oil and forbade anything but protective spirits to go in there again. She sees orbs every night in which she describes as green balls measuring in about 7 to 12 inches in diameter that float around the bedroom and living room. Bloody Mary believes that she can control the amount of spirit activity in her house, battling away negative spirits, and keeping those that are protective.
