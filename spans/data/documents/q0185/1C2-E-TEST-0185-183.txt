Murderer in the Backseat
One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few miles, she noticed she was low on gas and pulled into a gas station. She was frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who kept trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. She refused and drove off as fast as she could. As she drove, she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching fast. As the car pulled up behind her, dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.  Now she was getting nervous. The car behind her kept flashing the lights off and on and the driver seemed to be shouting and making signs with his hands.  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she reached home and pulled into her driveway. Terrified, she made a mad dash into her house and called the police. As she ran from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, “Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!”
When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with an axe rising up from the back seat behind her, so he flashed his brights to warn her.
The police arrested the crazed killer in the backseat who turned out to be an escaped mental patient. It was an extremely scary night and the woman had a lucky escape.
