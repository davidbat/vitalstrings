I was watching ghost whispers and this is the story apperantly-
Mary had a disease as a kid.She sliped into a coma one day and after a while they buried her.
Her family tied a rope that was connected to a bell witch was hung on some stick thing.
If she came back the bell would ring.Later that night she awoken.She went mad trying to claw
her way out.The next morning the bell and the stick was found on the ground.the un-dug the ground and here nails were in the roof of her coffin.Her blood was everywhere he coffin,her hands,and her dress,That is how she died.When you call her name you awaken her and you make her angry.She then will kill you or the will go mad,that is what happens.

Lyonese that is one of my stories for that thanks for putting that so didnt have to put a lot of words. Here is another story i have here.Mary was picked on as a kid.she had this spell book that she alwasy kept with her and practiced spells.so bullys decided to put gas on her houses flower bed.they only put a little when they ran one girl didnt like here so she put the whole thing on it and lit the match.mary's parents were eating dinner and sadly there died.But Mary was in her room doing a spell but she didn't notice the fire.Soon as she said her spell she realized the fire.The spell she used put her into the mirror she was practicing on.She could only come out if someone chanted "bloody mary" then she would return to the mirror.The reason why she was killing the teenagers because she thought they were the ones who killed her parents...the end...hope you enjoyed it i dont know if this is the real story!
