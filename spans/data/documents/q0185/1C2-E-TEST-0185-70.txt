Boston’s pedigree was forged back in England in the          midst of religious dissension, where Puritans and Pilgrims sought religious          reform, and Cavaliers and Roundheads vied for political power. The question          isn't where did Boston get its name – but how.
The        Short Answer
Like a great many towns in New England, Boston has its naming roots in old        England. Boston, Massachusetts is named after Boston, Lincolnshire, and        is situated about 100 miles north of London on the North Atlantic Sea. Massachusetts began life as the Massachusetts Bay Colony (Company) in 1629.        Its first Governor was John Winthrop ,        and its first deputy-Governor was Thomas Dudley, who shortly after their        arrival in America in 1630 suggested that the capital of the colony be named        after their hometown back in England. Both men were part of a fleet of Puritans        - about 1000 - that came over to escape religious and political persecution        for their desires to reform the Church and State. Though how and why this        all occurred is far more interesting and ironic once you know the historical        context of the times. So, all aboard the Puritan Express...
The First Boston
St. Botolph's                 Church
A Gothic                 stump from 1309
Five          years after the Battle of Hastings (1066) where William the Conqueror          subjugated much of England, a parcel of land in Lincolnshire was gifted          to one of his noble supporters from Brittany. A church was built – often          the precursor to what we would call “development” today. It was named          after an orthodox saint with the unorthodox name “Botolph” that preached          throughout England in the 7th century. Saint Botolph (ca 610          - 680) began his religious training as a monk in Gaul (modern day France).          In 654, he returned to England and founded the monastery of Ikanhoe in          East Anglia. No, not Ivanhoe - that's a novel by Sir Walter Scott.          Coincidence? I think so.
Tradition has it that          the place came to be called "Botolphston" – either from "Botolph's          stone" or "Botolph's town" – which was later contracted          to "Boston." Remember, these were the same wily bunch of seafaring          people who gave us the terms fo'c'sle (foke-sol) for "forward          castle" and bo's'n (bo-sun) for "boatswain." With          that in mind, I can believe "Boston." Or is it B'st'n?
Unlike          tradition, however, evidence suggests that Boston was not the site of          St.Botolph's monastery. It is more likely that Boston started in the 10th          century as a small Saxon village around a wooden church. The existence          of this church was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086. As seen in the          photo, the church, known as "the stump," has improved considerably          from its humble wooden beginnings, though now suffers from a really bad          nickname.

During the Middle         Ages, the village grew to become the second most important port in England,         enjoying great traffic from Hanseatic traders of northern Europe. In 1545,         the town was granted it's charter, which allowed the Lord-Mayor to dress-up         in elaborate robes, wear a large black velvet three-corner hat, and sport         the town seal suspended from a large gold chain. By the 17th century,         Boston had become a hotbed of religious nonconformism, inspired by figures         such as John Foxe and John Cotton .         Many Bostonians, including Cotton, relocated to Massachusetts. In fact,         about 250 people left Boston, which was about a tenth of the town’s population,         to find new homes in Massachusetts over the next few years. Furthermore,         throughout the emigration period of 1620-1640, England lost over 20,000         people to Massachusetts.
But why? Why did so         many people want to leave England? Didn't they know about Massachusetts'         winters?
Nonconformists: Reforming       the Church and State
John               Foxe
In          October of 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 theological theses (declarations)          to the castle door in Wittenberg, Germany. Hoping to spark a little earnest          discussion, Luther got a revolution instead, or more accurately, a Reformation.          That same year, John          Foxe was born. Who, you say? Well if you were an ardent reader back          in 1563, or knew someone who was, you would know that John Foxe published          his work called “The Book of Martyrs.” It was a smash hit among those          in England dissatisfied with the Church, known as nonconformists,          of which there were a considerable amount. Many had been waiting since          Henry VIII for a real opportunity to reform the Church. Ah, that “great          reformer” of the Church, Henry VIII. Well, he wasn't really a reformer;          more of a hijacker.
King               Henry VIII
You          may remember that Henry VIII, a Tudor, was experiencing problems with          his marriage, as well as political difficulties, such that in 1533, he          convinced the Bishopric of Canterbury to annul his marriage to
Catherine          of Aragon. Not satisfied with his quick, Las Vegas-like annulment, Henry          saw this as an opportunity to get rid of his biggest competitor to wealth          and land – the Church. A year later, Henry had Parliament make him the          “Supreme Head of the Church in England.” This immediately severed all          ties with the Roman Catholic Church, and made him the ultimate power in          England. Think of it as a hostile take-over with Henry as the new CEO.          The Church and the State were now one. This was very good news to the          reformers, for they wanted to overhaul both institutions to make them          more biblically-based. This just made their task that much easier. The          reformers wanted all the folderol removed from the Church that they believed          was unnecessary, like ornate ceremonies, opulent vestments, and the ever-popular Indulgence of the Month Club. Similarly, the State could work best          if it used the Bible as a template for such things as justice, so the          reasoning went.
During all this “reformation,”          regular and somewhat subversive theological meetings were being held in          the White Horse Tavern in Cambridge, England. All good revolutions          seem to begin in bars. Among those present over the years were Thomas          Bilney, Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley, and Thomas Cranmer – all of which          were later martyred for their beliefs. A rather sobering thought.
King               Edward VI
Henry had no particular          desire to "reform" the theology of the church, since it would          now more or          less serve him. However, there were many reform-minded people that did          care - particularly those frequenting the White Horse Tavern for Theological          Thursdays. Unfortunately for them, such desires found little royal          support during Henry's reign. After the King died in 1547, his nine-year-old          son Edward assumed the throne. Children would often rule through officials          called regents, much like agents chaperoning rock-stars today,          although with considerably less mess.  The two regents that aided Edward          were the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland, both of which          had some degree of sympathy for the reform movement's vision. The rush          was on for the “purification of the church and the state” between 1547          and Edward's death in 1553.
Mary: Olde England
Queen Mary                 I
"Bloody Mary"
The next Tudor on          the throne was Mary I Tudor, better known as "Bloody Mary." Mary wanted nothing more than to turn back the clock and return England          to the Roman Catholic fold, no matter what the cost. So she pulled a Crazy-Ivan,          doing an about-face, and set the ship of State careening back towards          Catholicism. The result was a massive emigration of Protestant exiles          to Europe, settling into pockets in Geneva and Frankfort. With them went          John Foxe, who would continue to drink deeply of the dreams of Church          reformation, presumably at the White Horse Tavern's counterpart somewhere          in Switzerland or Germany.
Then, in 1558, good          news for the reformists: Mary I died, and her Protestant sister Elizabeth          reversed the earlier tide towards Catholic reunification, sending the          émigrés back home in droves. Crazy-Ivan number two. From the pen          of John Foxe, the reformers would demand the pure practice of both the          Monarchy and the ecclesiastical leaders, directing all English affairs sola Scriptura – according to the Scriptures alone. Well,          with such momentum, what could possibly stand in their way?
Queen               Elizabeth I
The next Queen of          England. Just when they saw light at the end of the tunnel, Queen Elizabeth          I surprised them. Elizabeth I’s desire was for political stability and          order, not extremism – especially the kind which the theological heirs          of those White Horse participants seemed to be. The State and the Church          should, in her view, be broad and inclusive and should base its life on          tradition and reason as well as on the teachings of Scripture. As a consequence          of her moderate approach, the word "Puritan" as          it's associated with the nonconformists became a name of ridicule during          the reign of Elizabeth I.
By          1570, the nonconformists had split into two factions: those that wanted          to work within the system, and those that had had enough of it and wanted          to leave. And so they did, eventually. Elizabeth I died in 1603, and was          replaced by James I, first from the Stuart line. The Stuart line originated          from Scotland, and being from the north, they were natural allies to the Cavaliers - the supporters of the Monarchy, associated with          the Nobility, peasantry, and Episcopalians.
James               I
James enjoyed the          Monarchical power, the extravagant spending, and the belief in the divine-right          of kingship. James didn't like Parliament, Sir Walter Raleigh, or Puritans.          Over time, his relationship with Parliament eroded to the point where          they simply wouldn't give him anymore money. He had bungled foreign policy,          inflation was everywhere, and gave out peerages like cocktail napkins.          Politics spilt over into religion, and once again the ship of State made          a U-turn back to Roman Catholicism. Crazy-Ivan number three.
Though many considered         him a bit of a paranoid twit, he did manage to commission an Authorized         Version of the Bible, printed in English in 1611. In one of those         many ironic twists of history, an English Bible was probably on the Puritans'         List of Things To Do considering their strong belief in individual study         and practice of the Scriptures, not to mention scholarship in general.         Making the Bible so accessible to the masses was a great start. However,         it was clearly not enough. During his reign, the lines became more distinctly         drawn between the Episcopalians and Cavaliers of the North and West counties,         and the Puritans and their sympathizers in Parliament (later to be called "Roundheads") of the richer South and East counties.
In 1607, a group         of reformers - the ones that had had enough of the Church, the King, and         the warm beer (later referred to as the Pilgrim Fathers)         - put enough shillings together to hop a ship from Boston, England to         the Netherlands. This was risky stuff, because it was illegal to leave         England without the King's permission. As they boarded the ship, their         minds were on the adventure that lay before them. The captain of the vessel         had other things on his mind. He turned them in to the local authorities,         and they were thrown in jail. After a brief stay, they tried again in         1608, and this time succeeded. That is to say, they reached the Netherlands.         After 12 years, they decided the Dutch people weren't the right kind of         people, and split for the New World.
The Progress of Pilgrims
As         the Puritan movement gained a voice in the words of Foxe's Book of         Martyrs, so the "Pilgrim" movement could be         traced to Robert Browne's book, Reformation Without Tarrying for Anie (1580). Browne shared Foxe's vision, but after more than a decade of seeking         reforms within the English church, became disillusioned. He "separated         from" the English church, and in 1581 started his own congregation         in Norwich, England.
Thus began the Separatist          movement – a faction which later produced leaders like John Robinson,          William Brewster, and William Bradford. These three were directly involved          in that group of Separatists which, as mentioned above, left England for          the Netherlands, and then later decided to emigrate to the New World,          landing at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620, forever inspiring this bit          of prose:
April         showers bring Mayflowers.
What do Mayflowers Bring?
Pilgrims!
The Puritans emigrated         to the Boston, Massachusetts area throughout the 1630’s and beyond, whereas         the Pilgrims settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts from the 1620’s onward.         The Boston and Plymouth colonies were distinct political and religious         entities, until Charles II and the government combined them in the late         1680's. Relations between them were generally friendly, but members of         both groups were quite clear concerning the differences between them.
Puritans             wanted to remain a part of the English establishment, working for             biblical reform from within. To them, the purpose of their new             colony was to be a biblical witness, a "city on a hill," which would set an example of biblical righteousness in Church and             State for Old England and the entire world to see.
Pilgrims were             in no mood to wait. They wanted to achieve "reformation without             tarrying (delay)," even if it meant separating from their             church and their nation. While they continued to think of themselves             as English, their emphasis was on their new political and spiritual             identity.
Charlie's Lesser Angels
King               Charles I
In 1625, James I gave          up the throne, and his ghost. His son, distinguished in childhood by his          strong will, became Charles I. He kept frightfully busy using that strong          will of his: he mismanaged affairs (a chip off the ol' block), got into          a cantankerous battle with with Parliament, and brought on a civil war          that would result in his own execution. In his spare time, he was known          to like horses.
Charles pushed England          even a little further back towards Catholicism than his father had, chiefly          because he hated the Puritans even more. Parliament, now an even bigger          thorn in Charles' side than his father's, was summoned and dissolved three          times during 1625 - 1629. Parliament should have been summoned every year          or so in order to take care of the Kingdom's business. During the next          eleven years, no King of England would ever enjoy this kind of absolute          power again because Charles didn't bother to summon Parliament. Just as          well, since they weren't about to give the King anymore money. Fine by          Charles - he financed his reign by selling commercial monopolies (today,          we call them "franchises") and extracting ship money - a          fee demanded from towns for building naval warships (today, we call          that "extortion"). One such commercial monopoly was the Massachusetts Bay Colony. You were wondering when we'd get          back to Massachusetts, right? Hold on, it's coming up soon.
To add gasoline to          the fires already burning, Charles married a devoutly Catholic French          princess that further angered the increasingly Puritan Parliament. Her          Catholic friends held sway at the royal court. She interfered in the affairs          of state, and put her wants above the needs of the Kingdom. And you thought          the Beatles had it rough.
Massachusetts, Inc.
All          right, back to the Puritans. Things got worse for nonconformists under          Charles I. Sure, the Pilgrims got to leave in 1620, but what about the          poor Puritans, incensed by the tide turning evermore to the Catholic leanings          of the Church-State? As mentioned before, it was illegal to leave England          without the permission of the King, and that was fairly unlikely if for          no other reason than spite. However, fate finds a way - even if it's a          legal loophole.
On          March 4th, 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Company was given its Charter by Charles I. Although          it was a commercial company interested in cultivating trade in the new          colony, the leading promoters of it were Puritans intent on creating a          church free from outside interference. Apparently, they didn't write that          down on their application to the King. When King Charles granted a colonial          charter to the Massachusetts Bay Company, the document failed to specify          that the governor and officers of the company had to remain in England.          You can read it for yourself.          The Puritan stockholders took advantage of this omission, and moved the          whole company and its colonial government flock, stock, and barrel to          America. They would then establish a biblical community - "a holy          commonwealth" - as an example to England and the world. The Puritans          would finally get to leave England, under the nose of the King, all because          of a legal loophole. The Massachusetts Bay Company would ferry          thousands of Puritans to America over the next few years.
On August 26th, 1629, a dozen shareholders from Boston, Lincolnshire,          including John Winthrop and Thomas          Dudley signed a contract to "inhabit and develop New England",          assuming of course they'd be allowed to govern the new colony themselves          from Massachusetts. Seemed reasonable. The first governor of the Company          was John Winthrop, Dudley was made his deputy, plus there were the usual          entourage of bureaucrats, assistants, etc.
Puritan society was          very understandably excited about the venture. Many licenses to migrate          were applied for and granted, obliviously without background checks. By          April 1630, Winthrop's great fleet of eleven vessels was ready to sail          from Southampton carrying the first Lincolnshire contingent aboard the          flagship Arbella. Apart from Winthrop himself, these included Thomas          Dudley and his family, Anne Bradstreet and her husband Simon , and Lady          Arbella Johnson and her husband Isaac. Although ill, John Cotton traveled          to see them off, not passing up the opportunity to give a sermon for the          whole company.
The          Founding of Boston, Massachusetts
John               Winthrop
By          mid-July of 1630, Winthrop’s fleet had reached the shores of Massachusetts,          but their first landing at Salem was a disappointment as the settlement          was short of food and not able to support another thousand inhabitants          (much like cars today). Though they found their way to the mouth of the          Charles River, their health had deteriorated so badly that at least 200          had died. Across the Charles River, William Blackstone, a former clergyman,          was living an isolated existence as a trapper on the Shawmut Peninsula          - the original land mass of Boston. Word came to him from Indian friends          of the difficulties his fellow countrymen were having. He sent a message          to John Winthrop advising him that the Trimountain hills on his side of          the river were far more suitable for settlement.
Memorial               stone in St.Botolph's Church dedicated to the five Boston men who               became Governors of Massachusetts
Winthrop, who had          been at college with Blackstone          (as unbelievable as that sounds), went to see him and it was this meeting          in 1630 that really marked the foundation of the city of Boston. Within          the next few weeks several small wooden houses were built by the migrants          and at the suggestion of Thomas Dudley it was decided that the new settlement          be called Boston after its English namesake. Remember, the Puritans did          not want a break with England, just to create an example of what could          be if England followed their example. Hence, they'd fashion their Boston          in their own image, so to speak. Over the next few years many more Lincolnshire          migrants arrived. Indeed, a memorial stone in St.Botolph's Church commemorates          the five Boston men who became Governors of Massachusetts, those being          Thomas Dudley, Richard Bellingham, Francis Bernard, John Leverett and          Simon Bradstreet.
So that's where, and          how, Boston, Massachusetts got its name. From Boston, to Boston.          You can think of the two Bostons as opposite ends of the same conduit          stretching from the religious and political upheavals of England to the          hope and promise of the New World. Not all legal loopholes have worked          out quite so well.
But what happened         to Charles? I was just getting interested...
Meanwhile, Back in        England...
While          the Massachusetts Bay Colony began to thrive, Charles' problems went from          bad to worse. A problem back home in Scotland ended Charles' 11 years          of sole rule and brought about a civil war upon England. Charles had decided          that the Scots needed a new prayer book. "What's the harm in a new          prayer book? The Scots will love it." Instead, the Scots rebelled.          Due to the chronic lack of proper funding, Charles' army was no match          for the surprise resistance. The King called two Parliaments, one short,          one long, but they could reach no agreement. The Queen, of course, could          be counted on to have an opinion: why not begin arresting members of Parliament?          Charles went to the House of Commons - the first King to have ever done          so - and tried to arrest John Pym, the leader of Parliament and four of          his closest allies, but failed to do so as they had escaped the day before.          Embarrassed and in a snit, Charles ventured north to raise an army and          declared war against Parliamentary forces at Nottingham in 1642.
Religious and economic          issues added to the differences between the supporters of the Monarchy          (Cavaliers) and the supporters of Parliament (Roundheads). Roughly speaking,          Cavalier backing came from peasants and nobility of Episcopalian roots,          while Roundhead backing came from the emerging middle-class and tradesmen          of the Puritanical movement. In terms of geography, the northern and western          counties aided the Cavaliers, with the more financially prosperous and          populous southern and eastern counties supported the Roundheads. Not unlike          the American Civil War, the Roundheads, with more money and more population          from which to draw, were destined to win the battle.
In          1645, Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army at Naseby easily defeated          the Cavaliers. A year later, Charles surrendered to Scottish forces, which          turned the King over to Parliament, along with a considerable amount of          unused prayer books I should think. In 1648, Charles was put on trial          for treason. A tribunal, by a vote of 68 to 67, found the King guilty          and ordered his execution in 1649. He was beheaded.
After that, Oliver          Cromwell dismantled government and many governmental institutions, in          an almost Soviet-style of takeover. The Puritans were now in power, and          the State swung 'round again towards Puritanism and reform. Crazy-Ivan          number four. After many failed attempts of governing, Cromwell finally          came up with the ultimate solution: he would become "Lord Protector          of the Realm," or in effect King. Upon his death, his son          Richard became the new Lord Protector of the Realm, and through his inability          to do a better job, the Monarchy was restored about a year later, giving          England the restoration of the House of Stuart with Charles II: The Sequel.
Parliament had severely          restricted the powers of the King, however, the people were happy that          they had a King again... as long as he behaved. Conflicts with the Dutch          caused Charles to form an alliance with France that supposed he would          reintroduce Catholicism back to England "at an appropriate time." However, it never happened. No Crazy-Ivan this time, as Charles II did          nothing to steer the State anywhere in religious terms.
But that's all English          history. At that point, Massachusetts was a thriving colony, well on it's          way to forge it's name in history, with its Boston leading the way.
