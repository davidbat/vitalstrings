Historically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards while holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. [1] There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper ) instead, indicating that they were destined to die before they married. [1] [2]
In the present day, the summoning ritual requires that the lead participant must not look directly for Bloody Mary, but at their own image in the mirror. Variations of the incantation ritual involves: the number of times Bloody Mary's name is called; spinning (or not) after every repetition of the name; and the adding of the phrase "I've got your baby."[ citation needed ] The modern ritual addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's tenuous connection to Queen Mary I , also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies .
