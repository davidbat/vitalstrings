Everyone is tweeting about their hopes for Bloody Mary to be GaGaloo's next single.
And while nothing is confirmed, we can definitely say we are in love with it just as much as everyone else is!
Not only is the song just classic Lady GaGa , it would be PERFECT for Halloween!
Yes, yes, yes. We want this to happen!!! That video would be in-sane!
