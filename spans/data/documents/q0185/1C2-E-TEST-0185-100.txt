Well, bloody Mary is supposed to be about Mary queen of Scots when actually it's based on a silly Halloween card from the 50s. It states that on Halloween, if you look in the glass (mirror) your future husbands face will pass. This eventually came on to be the silly child's dare. The real bloody Mary was Elizabeth Bathory, Although her name isn't Mary , she killed virgins and bathed in their blood to keep her "Pure" So really if there was a such thing as "Bloody Mary" It should be Elizabeth Bathory. Hope this helped!
