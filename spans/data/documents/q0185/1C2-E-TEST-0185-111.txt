Yet another masterpiece!
Incredible! I find that everytime i read a book about the Tudor family, it takes my breath away. This book was boring at first but once you get into it, it will intrigue you. This book was as good as the others. I would deffinitely relate to this book because Mary has to care for her new baby sister, Elizabeth. She is evry jealous becasue she has gotten all of the attention. Mary is going through a very rogh time in her life. Her only choices are: Obey, or Die.

This book is awesome!
Although I don't like Mary Tudor, I found the story of her life quite interesting. When I opened the package I would of appreciated the advertised cover instead of a changed book. Still, I enjoyed the story. As a child Mary lived in luxery, though always neglected by her father and adored by her mother. When King Henry fell in love with the lovely Anne, his treatment of Mary had alread turned to neglect.  However, her life became worse when her father wanted her to sign papers saying he was the head of the church of England.  A devout Catholic, Mary refused.  Stubborn by nature, Mary obstinantly fought her father for years, and Henry only decreased her power and wealth.  I felt pity for Mary, as she was always frail and sickly, and when she came to court for the birth of Anne's child, she came clad in rags. Finally, she signed and her life returned to its former self. After reading this, I felt sorry for Mary, but I still view her as a tyrant. For although Mary despsised her father for persucuting the catholic church and being unfaithful to her mother, she became who her father was. Just as King Henry persecuted the Catholics, Mary took it to the extreme by violently burning the Protestants.  And just as Henry mistreated his family, so did Mary act cruelly to her sister by avenging herself against Anne and hurting Elizabeth. In the epilogue, Carolyn Meyer states that history was wrong for remembering Mary as y Mary, for her reign was no more brutal then any other monarch.  True, but the reason history gave her this horrific name was because England neither prospered nor flourished under her rule.  Instead Mary weakened England and killed its citizens. So history remembers Mary for how she ruled England, with a fist of y iron.

No Wonder She Grew Up To Be Evil
I loved reading this book! It was so sad that I cried at the end! Mary's father abused her! Her stepmother made her a servant! [I winced when I read the the part where Lady Anne forces Lady Mary to help her onto the chamber pot and then forces her to clean out the slops! That really grossed me out!]Anyway, this book is very well-written and I recomend it. I do not, however, recomend that you forget your tissues. When it's time to read the end, you'll probably cry.

AWSOME
This was the first tudor book i ever read. i thought it was about murder but it wasn't. after i read it i started to get more into tudor history and read all the young royals. Afetr reading them i decided i want to be a historian when i go into college. If they ever ask what inspired me i'll say 'Mary, Bloody Mary of course!!'

Thrilling and unforgetable!!
Mary, Bloody Mary is one of the best books I have ever read. It is full of adventure! The story demonstrates the courage and hope in one girls heart. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an exciting and historical book, and can stand a little blood and violence.
