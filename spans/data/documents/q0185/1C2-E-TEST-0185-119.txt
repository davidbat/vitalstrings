AZ 101: How did Big Bug Creek get its name?

Today's question:
On the way north from Phoenix to Flagstaff, Interstate 17 crosses Big Bug Creek. Can you tell us where that name came from?
As long as we're on the subject, there is a sign on I-17 for Bloody Basin. That got its name from a fight between the Army and a band of Apaches on March 27, 1872.
The Apaches came out on the short end of that deal.
And there is an exit for Bumblebee Road, which, it probably won't surprise you to know, was named for an area where there were a lot of bumblebees.
Anyway, about Big Bug Creek: It supposedly got its name from a group of prospectors who were camping there in 1863 and were set upon by a bunch of large insects.
Just which kind of large insects these were, we don't know. Prospectors apparently weren't big on entomology.
Also in Yavapai County are the ruins of a mining camp called Big Bug, according to www.ghosttowns.com .
That's a pretty interesting site, but the background music is kind of annoying and I'm too dumb to figure out how to turn it off.
There was a post office at Big Bug from 1879 to 1910. I'm not exactly sure where this place is, but I gather there are a few summer homes there now and not much else.
One of its founders was Theodore Boggs, a prospector who was the great-grandson of frontiersman Daniel Boone. That's kind of interesting.
Another thought: I am told that "big bug" at one time was Western slang for an important person, a big shot or a boss.
As in, "He's the big bug of this outfit."
