One girls asks another girl, Lilly, an                            embarassing "would you want to make out with..." question. Lilly doesn't answer it and is forced to do                            a dare. The dare was to say "Bloody Mary" 3 times in the bathroom, which Lilly does and is scared                            when her 2 friends shake the door in order to scare her. Then Lilly's dad, Steven Shoemaker, asks them to                            quiet down, then he goes into the bathroom, looks in                            a mirror and his eyes start to bleed. An older sister                            walks in "past curfew" and goes upstairs and                            sees her father on the floor, dead.

They say they are "medical interns" and that Dr. Feiklowicz is there to show them the Shoemaker                            corpse. Unfortunate,ly Dr. Feilklowicz wasn't in that                            day. The man does not let them through, that is, until                            Sam takes out Dean's money in order to bribe the man.
Now able to see the corpse, they interrogate the man. They see                            the corpse's eyes have "liquify."

They said they "worked                            with her father". They asked if they noticed any                            symptons. The younger daughter, Lilly interrupted and                            said that it was her fault and explained the Sam and                            Dean that she said "Bloody Mary."

Donna's friend,                            Charley, walks up to the bathroom and interrogates Sam                            and Dean. She explains to them that Donn'a s father                            was a day-trader and worked by himself. She is on to                            them and they come clean.
Central Library: They realize there                            are many stories on the Bloody Mary legend. They do                            know that they all have something in common that she                            always named Mary and you have to say her name 3 times.
Charley's Car/Jill's Room(Phone): Charley told Jill the truth about Sam and Dean via phone, which                            Jill only cared about how they were goodlooking. They                            also talk about the "Bloody Mary" legend,                            which Jill feels its a hoax, so she says Bloody Mary                            3 times in the mirror and screams to trick Charley into                            thinking something has happened to her. She laughs and                            hangs up the phone. Only moments later is when Jill looks into a mirror and her eyes start to bleed.
Next Day, Hotel: Sam wakes up with                            the same nightmare, again. He looks over to Dean and                            asks if he has found anything on the Bloody Mary case.                            Unforchanately, he hasn't. They get a called from Charley                            with something important.
School: They find Charley                            and ask her some questions about the death of Jill.                            Charley confesses that Jill said "Bloody Mary" 3 times and then asks them if they think the "Bloody                            Mary" legend is real. They tell her that they think                            it is, which doesn't make Charley feel any better.
Jill's house: With the aid of                            Charley, Sam and Dean are able to get into Jill's room.                            They turn off all the lights and use a black light on the mirror in Jill's room. On the back of the mirror                            the blacklight revealed it said Gary Bryman along with                            a handprint.
Back at school: Sam does his research                            and discovers that Gary Bryman was an eight year old                            boy, who was killed in a hit and run. Charley confesses                            that Jill drove the same car that was described in the                            hit and run.
Shoemaker's House: Now back at                            the shoemaker residence they do the same blacklight                            test to another mirror and it reveals the name "Linda                            Shoemaker" with the same hand print. Sam and Dean                            then go to Donna to question her if she knows anything                            about Linda. Donna says that Linda was her mom that                            died by overdosing and then she asks them to leave.                            They think that Donna's dad killed her mom. Jill said                            that she was going to stay with Donna.
Hotel: Dean is doing a                            nation-wide search to find any connection between deaths                            and the name "Mary." They discover that Mary                            must have a pattern in choosing her victims, killing                            someone and keeping it secret. Thanks to Dean doing                            a check he discovers "Mary Worthington" who                            had the same handprint like on the mirrors.
Fort Wayne, Indiana: They go to                            a guy that knows about her murder, Dean and Sam say                            they are reporters. The man says that the Worthington                            murder still confuses him. They ask the guy what he                            thinks happened with the murder, because apparently                            someone killed her by cutting her eyes out. Before she                            died he believes that she was trying to spell the name                            of her killer. She spelt "tre" on a mirror                            so one of the suspects was a surgent and his name was,                            Trevor. Mary kepted a journal and said she was seeing                            a man she called "T" and was going to tell                            his wife about there affair. The man says her eyes were                            cut out almost were professionally but never had enough                            proof or any witnesses. They asked if the mirror that                            she spelt the three letters on were still around but                            the man had no further information.
School, Bathroom: Charley meets Donna                            in the bathroom and Donna yells at Charley for bringing                            Dean and Sam to her house. Also Donna still doesn't                            believe in the whole "Bloody Mary" superstition                            so she says Bloody Mary three times in front of the                            mirror and Charley is scared.

Once in class Charley looks into her mirror                            in her pocketbook and notices her eyes start to bleed.

Dean                            tells Sam that it was not his fault because of Jessica's                            death. Sam feels that he could have warned her and also                            reveals he hasn't told Dean somethings. Dean questions                            what it is but Sam refuses to tell.

Eventually Sam's eyes start to bleed and he drops                            down his weapon. Mary taunts Sam now saying that he                            killed Jessica.
