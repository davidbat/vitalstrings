The 2011 Bloody Mary Invitational, held on Friday, December 30, saw the largest field in its 18 year history with a total of 28 players, and raised a total of $680 which was donated to Central Florida’s  Coalition for the Homeless , a good end to a tough year in Orlando for a lot of unfortunate folks.
The teams were treated to a new brew of Bloody Mary’s that may have become the recipe of the future combining a trademark concoction of traditional Bloody Mary ingredients, homemade V-8 juice, Siracha and Pete’s hot sauces, horseradish, and Guinness!
First Team off at 8:20 am
Danny, Dewayne, Dwight, and D'Brandon, I think Keysor is shrinking in his old age!
Messers. Thompson, Herring, Morphy, Crosbie, USGA oversight on handicaps limited their winnings this year
