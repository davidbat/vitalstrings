Heh Â– I'd like to think it's still going strong, three years later, and the Mary-thoners haven't put down their glasses long enough to report back.

I've posted before about the winning Bloody Marys at the Oak Bar in the Plaza Hotel.  The proportions seem ideal --texture not too thick, not ridiculously alcoholic, not overspiced.  Perhaps the winning move is the garnish:  An olive (not usual to me in a Bloody Mary but a perfect match) and a boiled shrimp.

Gin seems to win every time, even in a bloody.
Until the next morning.

Clamdaddy and Gin Rummy, pardon the interruption for a quick request: we ask users not to frequently change subject titles. Doing so screws up the many chowhounds who read these boards via HotPosts (check it out, it's great, via link atop our home page), which are unthreaded.
It's best for everyone if we keep the subject titles descriptive of the thread as a whole, and only change them if the discussion has substantially digressed.
Thanks a lot!

My favorite Bloody Mary destination is a place in D.C. I believe it was Sign of the Whale, that has a special on the weekends - something like all-you-can-drink Bloody's for $10.  You get (refills of) a pint glass with vodka and ice and they have a table with just about every ingredient you could ever think of putting in a Bloody Mary, so you make your own according to your tastes.  I would love to find something like that in New York.

Hands down (imho) the best bloody mary in Manhattan is found at Pravda (Lafayette and Prince).

The best bloody mary is at JG Mellon 74th and 3rd. The burgers there are also very, very good.
