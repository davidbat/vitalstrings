English Bible History
Queen "Bloody" Mary
The ebb and flow of freedom continued through the 1540's...and        into the 1550's. After King Henry VIII, King Edward VI        took the throne, and after his death, the reign of Queen “Bloody” Mary was the next obstacle to the printing of the Bible in English.        She was possessed in her quest to return England to the Roman Church. In 1555, John "Thomas Matthew" Rogers and Thomas        Cranmer were both burned at the stake. Mary went on to burn reformers at        the stake by the hundreds for the "crime" of being a Protestant.        This era was known as the Marian Exile, and the refugees fled from England        with little hope of ever seeing their home or friends again.
Queen Mary I of England was born February 18, 1516, the daughter        of King Henry VIII and his first of six wives, Catherine of Aragon. Mary        was the only child from that union to survive infancy. She reigned as Queen        of England from July 19, 1553 until her death on November 17, 1558.
The Early Years of Queen Mary I
Queen Mary I was alienated from her father, King         Henry VIII , during his        divorce (it was not a divorce in the modern sense, but an annulment) from        her mother. As her parents' marriage was deemed null and void, Mary was        then deemed illegitimate and thus deprived for a time of her status as an        heir to the throne. This fueled her rage regarding her father’s break        from the Roman Catholic Church, which had previously instructed him that        he could not divorce from her mother. Mary felt that if her father, King        Henry VIII, had obeyed the Roman Catholic Church, she would not be seen        as “illegitimate, and her right to the throne would not have been        questioned. This is the foundation upon which her loyalty to Rome was laid.        By the time of King Henry VIII’s death, however, she had been restored        as second in line to the throne, after her half-brother Edward, who was        physically weak.
Queen Mary I Takes the Throne of England
It was not until 1553 that Edward died, however, by which time Protestantism        had gained such ground that a rival claimant to the throne was put forward,        Mary's cousin Lady Jane Grey. Public sympathy remained with Mary, and she        soon overcame resistance to her accession. By July 19 Jane Grey had been        deposed and Mary was the undisputed Queen. Her official coronation came        on November 30, 1553 . Mary first began to earn her unofficial title of “Bloody Mary” when she had her cousin, Lady Jane Grey, executed        to prevent any possible power struggle. It is generally believed that Mary        might have spared Jane's life if it had not been for the intervention of        the Spanish diplomats who conditioned Mary's marriage to their king on her        executing Jane.
“Bloody Mary”… Relentless Papist and Mass-Murderer
Mary had always rejected and resented the break with Rome that her father        had instituted and his subsequent establishment of the Anglican Church that        had flowed from her half-brother's protestantism, and now she tried to turn        England back to Roman Catholicism. This effort was carried out by force,        and hundreds of Protestant leaders were executed. The first was John       Rogers (a.k.a. “Thomas Matthews”), the printer of the “Matthews-Tyndale        Bible”. His execution was followed by the execution of former Archbishop        of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer , who was primarily responsible for the printing        of the “Great Bible”. Hundreds more would follow in Mary’s        bloody reign of terror. This earned the queen the title of “Bloody        Mary”.
Her restoration of Catholicism was remarkable in some ways: Where only        one bishop, John Fisher of Rochester, had resisted King Henry VIII’s        rejection of Roman catholicism to the point that Henry had him executed;        most of Mary's bishops were more loyal and refused to conform to the restored        Protestantism under Elizabeth I, and they died under house arrest.
Mary’s Failure and Death
Mary's allegiance to Roman Catholicism inspired her to institute social        reforms, but these were largely unsuccessful. Her marriage to Philip II              of Spain, in 1554, was unpopular even with her Catholic subjects. Philip        spent very little time with Mary, once he realized that she was not able              to bear a child. Mary died at the age of 42 from uterine or ovarian cancer.        She was succeeded by her half-sister Elizabeth I, who quickly undid many              of Mary's changes, and returned England to its former Protestant-friendly        environment. This enabled the English refugees who had fled England to              ever-neutral Geneva, Switzerland to print the “Geneva Bible”,        to eventually come home and begin printing the Protestant Geneva Bible       in        England.
Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary…
Mary I of England is often confused with her cousin “Mary, Queen        of Scots”, who lived at the same time. Many scholars trace the nursery         rhyme "Mary, Mary, quite contrary… how does your garden         grow… with silver bells and cockle shells and pretty maids all in a row" to Mary’s unpopular attempts to bring Roman Catholicism back to England,        identifying the "cockle shells", for example, with the symbol        of  pilgrimage to the Catholic Shrine of St. James in Spain and the "pretty         maids all in a row" with Catholic nuns.
