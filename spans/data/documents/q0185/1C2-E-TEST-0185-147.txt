II Samuel 7:18 “Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, “Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?”

After the Prophet spoke to David, he was humbled before the Lord. Stop and think for a moment what this promise meant. David’s children will always be a royal house and have a throne to sit upon. There will always be a nation and nations to govern, and it will be David’s kids that will sit on those thrones. When you trace the thrones of all the kings of Europe back in their lineage, they all come from the seed of David. Think about it.

You still don’t get it do you? If you cannot understand what I mean than there is no sense in wasting my time in explaining that to you. The fact remains, that English people prefer to hate her, rather than try and see the truth.

Well, no, it isn’t science fiction. Obviously it’s sensational if it’s called “most evil…” and again, it’s about MARY not anyone else.
Elizabeth wasn’t glorified at all. I believe there were approximately two sentences about her that said she inherited a broken empire and that she united England.
Sympathy is good, but seriously, some people are taking that -ish too far. I mean, you can feel bad that Dahmer was abandoned, but don’t lose the fact that he made hamburgers of boy-meat.

Yes, 30 minutes which make her a monster, while her sister who was a real bitch is glorified. And it’s not a documentary, but a cheap piece od science fiction.
