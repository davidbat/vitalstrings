Question from Alice - "Bloody Mary"
I am in year 8 and need to do an essay on whether or not Mary the first deserves her nickname 'Bloody Mary'. I am supposed to give an argument (for and against) but can't think of any reasons or sources for against? Can you help? Do you know any good sources/reasons/websites that disagree with the nickname? It will help at lot becuase I am going to be graded. Thanks!
