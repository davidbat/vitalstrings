How did Freshies the company start?
Bridal Veil Bloody Mary mix was the house mix of the Swede-Finn Hall, a restaurant in Telluride, Colorado.  Ian Gustin and Colin Wells created the mix when they were working as the head chef and bar manager, respectively.  The two wanted to make a different Bloody Mary mix that would attract Bloody Mary aficionados.  There was such tremendous response from people who tried the mix that the two of them decided to put it in a bottle and sell it.
Since the inception of Freshies Food Corporation in 1994, the product line has expanded to currently 12 different flavors and 4 cocktail rimming products, with many more coming.  New flavors in development include Margarita and Mojito variations, seasonal offerings, and Top Secret Formulations.
