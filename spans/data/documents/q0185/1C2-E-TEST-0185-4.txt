Answer
Just to make thing perfectly clear one of the answers is too wordy and the other is not factual. The third answer to this question is the right answer.
Due to Fantastic Mr Foxes book of Martyrs where he refers to her as Bloody Mary, She only had just under 300 protestants burned as heretics. The majority were exiled (800) for the 6 years she was on the throne. During that time they worked on the cult of Bloody Mary by ensuring that Protestant propaganda out weighed that of the Catholics 2:1!! She was also the daughter of King Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. She took the throne when her parents divorced and after Henry split from the Catholic Church causing the devastating English Reformation. That is how she got her name.
First off I didn't understand a word of the first answer. I have heard that she carried a disease that made people bleed through their pores and another one that said she cut little girls through the mirror and used their blood to bathe.
The second answer is not correct, no offense to anyone but the first answer is correct, Mary did kill (not herself) but did send out her soldiers or something, she did send out people... to kill the protestants of England. Many as mentioned before about 800 protestants left England. Mary was hated for that, but was also given the name "Bloody Mary" for it. There is a legend that if you say Bloody Mary three times in the mirror with the lights off... Mary (Bloody Mary) will come and scratch you.
