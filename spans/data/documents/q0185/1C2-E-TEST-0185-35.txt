My understanding is that in Europe during the Middle Ages, insects were destroying crops and the farmers prayed to the Virgin Mary for help.  The Ladybirds/Ladybugs showed up and made short work of the pesky insects and the good bugs were named Beetles of our Lady, which morphed into Ladybugs.  Not quite sure how Ladybirds fits in, however.
Peace, Bill
