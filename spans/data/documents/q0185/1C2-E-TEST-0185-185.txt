Myths of their being an actual Mary are seemingly true, of course a story gets warped after so long. But no, looking into a mirror and saying her name in the dark three times doesn't make her appear. Think about it, if that's even possible. If you believe in apparitions or ghostly spirits, you'd know it (apparently) takes a **** ton of energy for them to present themselves, so being in a dark room actually would just lower the chances, if of course saying the chant made her appear-which it does not :p
