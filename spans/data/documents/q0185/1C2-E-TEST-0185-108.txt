It's hard to tell. The legend is so widespread and it's mostly a ghost story. Since a lot of people don't believe in ghosts, it's difficult to find the origin of her. I've heard several "real" names for her, including Mary Black and Mary Worth,and even more origin stories.
In some iterations of the story, you chant "I stole your baby" or "I killed your baby". This might tie into the belief Mary Tudor was Bloody Mary because she was unable to have children and, I think, wanted them badly.
Some people say she died in a car accident with her children, but that doesn't seem quite right to me. Car's haven't been around that long. I'm not sure how old the legend is, but I feel like it must predate cars.
In the World of Darkness book, "Urban Legends", she was married to a man and they had children. Everyone said the children had their father's eyes. Her husband eventually left her to be with another woman. He wrote her, asking for the children, so she sent him the part that was his-- their eyes. It further goes on to say that Bloody Mary may not be a specific ghost, but an avatar of mothers who kill their children. Whenever a mother commits such an act and then dies herself, Bloody Mary is reborn.
