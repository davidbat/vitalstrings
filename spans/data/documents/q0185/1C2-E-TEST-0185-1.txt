How did the Bloody Mary get its name?
The name may be attributed to Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII. In  her brief five-year tenure as Queen, she managed to kill off most of  her Protestant adversaries and became affectionately known as "Bloody  Mary" to her nearest and dearest. Another account tells of a patron who  said the drink reminded him of a girl named Mary he knew at the Bucket  of Blood Club in Chicago. It was originally made with Gin.
