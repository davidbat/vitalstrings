—Description. [src]
As a ghost, the Baron was very pale [4] , pearly-white and slightly transparent. [3] He had wide, staring, [15] black eyes [3] and a gaunt face. [3] He dressed in robes covered in silver bloodstains, [14] and carried chains in a final act of penitence for having murdered Helena Ravenclaw . [6] He also sported a curly powdered wig and carried his sword. [19] He spoke in a hoarse whisper. [11]
Personality and traits
Edit
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington: "Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude. Peaceful cooperation, that's the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron."
Ronald Weasley: "Only because you're terrified of him."

During his lifetime, the Baron was described by Helena Ravenclaw as a "hot-tempered man". He insisted on having his way in interactions, responding with violent uncontrolled anger when contradicted. [6] As a ghost, he was frightening and most people did not seem to enjoy his presence, [3] not even his fellow ghosts . [12] However, he seemed to have a cordial, if not friendly, relationship with the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington , [8] despite Ronald Weasley 's allegations of the latter being "terrified" of him. [17] The Baron seemed to be intolerant towards Peeves , who was scared of him, [11] and could not bear his lack of civilisation, putting "his foot down" over the Poltergeist 's presence in the 1994 Start-of-Term Feast . [14] He also seems to have a great deal of House pride; before Harry Potter 's arrival at Hogwarts, Slytherin had won the House Cup for six years in a row, and the Baron had become "unbearable" according to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington .
