Bloody Mary is actually Mary Tudor
Mary, the fourth crowned monarch of the Tudor dynasty, after the uncrowned Jane Grey and before Elizabeth I, is remembered for briefly returning England to Roman Catholicism. To this end, she had almost three hundred religious dissenters executed; as a consequence, she is often known as Bloody Mary. Her reestablishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed by her successor and half-sister, Elizabeth I (1558â€“1603). Mary and Elizabeth were both first cousins once-removed of Mary, Queen of Scots, granddaughter of their aunt Margaret Tudor.
During her reign, Mary's weak health led her to suffer two false pregnancies. After such a delusion in 1558, Mary decreed in her will that her husband Philip should be the regent during the minority of her child. No child, however, was born, and Mary died at the age of 42, most likely of ovarian cancer, at St. James's Palace on 17 November 1558. She was succeeded by her half-sister, who became Elizabeth I. Although her will stated that she wished to be buried next to her mother, Mary was interred in Westminster Abbey on 14 December in a tomb she would eventually share with Elizabeth. The Latin inscription on a marble plaque on their tomb (affixed there during the reign of James I) translates to "Partners both in Throne and grave, here rest we two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, in the hope of one resurrection".
Ive said her name 5 times in my bathroom mirror. I also tried saying it 3 times, but nothing happened =/. The only thing people see and get scared of is their own reflection and think it's "bloody mary".
