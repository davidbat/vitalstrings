Molly Hatchet – One of the super southern rock bands of the 70′s and a GLO favorite.  But, how did they get their name?

According to a British website recalling “ The Molly Hatchet Story “, the name is taken from a 17th century axe murderess.
1971, Jacksonville Florida.  6 band members put three names they’ve chosen for the band name in a John Deere hat…last name in the hat was “Molly Hatchet”.
According to Molly Hatchet guitarist, Dave Hlubeck, “Her name was Abigail something. The history books called her Hatchet Molly.”
Wikipedia refers to her as a 17th Century prostitute who murdered her “clients” with an Axe.
Guess that WOULD qualify as flirting with disaster, wouldn’t it?
