Tips & Warnings
Use regular or spicy V-8 juice from a bottle, not a can.
For a sweeter drink, add a few more drops of Worcestershire sauce.
Try adding 1/4 oz. horseradish sauce.
Substitute Seagram's 7 for vodka to get a Bloody Seven.
For a Bloody Beach, substitute one part Malibu rum and one part vodka for the vodka.
A Bloody Beer is 1/3 tomato juice and 2/3 beer - none of the other stuff.
Substitute beef bouillon for the V8 to make a Bloody Bull.
Use Clamato juice instead of the V8 for a Bloody Caesar.
Use tequila instead of vodka, and lime juice instead of lemon juice for a Bloody Maria.
Mixed drinks contain alcohol, so use moderation.
Never drink and drive.
