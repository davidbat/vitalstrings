Â 
This is a true story that has been happening to me and my friend.
A couple weeks ago we started messing around with Ouija board and doing Bloody Mary chants OVER AND OVER. I don't know if we have been imagining things or not but, just read this and tell me.
So we both did bloody Mary for the first time, and the mirror fell right off the wall! No one was home with us, so it couldn't have been my mom or dad. Then we got out the Ouija board and asked if anyone was with us. My room got freezing. We ran out of the room before anything else could happen. Lately, when I'm home alone I have been hearing footsteps and whispering. I might be imagining it because I love to watch horror movies, and I watch a ton! But in my mom's room, she has this old antique dresser, and every time I walk past it I see a dark shadow. It's in the form of a body wearing a hooded cloak or something.
I know everyone says you're not supposed to do the Ouija board alone but I did do it alone. When I did it, I asked it what it wanted and my room got really cold and I felt a breeze come at my face. Mind you, I have no windows in my room. I have also been hearing scratching in my walls, and footsteps in my attic, which is kind of weird because my attic is closed off.
My friend says that she hears footsteps and voices under her bed and in her closet. She said her dog acts really weird, and he never goes into her room. My dog is now always by my side and whenever I'm in my room with her she barks and growls at nothing.
I think its pretty much over now because I have started praying and wearing a cross on my neck since it has died down.
