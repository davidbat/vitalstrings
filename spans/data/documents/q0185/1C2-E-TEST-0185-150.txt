Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know
Will calm the storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boyÂ 
Has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God.
The blind will see
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The praises of the Lamb
Mary did you know
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
