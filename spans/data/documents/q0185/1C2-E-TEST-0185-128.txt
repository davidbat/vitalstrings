Just Who IS Bloody Mary, Anyway?
The Common Stories Behind the Legend
"Bloody Mary was a witch. She used to live up on Knobb's Hill 150 years ago, all by herself, practicing black magic," Alexis began, a gleam in her eye as she looked at the other girls at the sleepover. "Then one day, the people in town-"
"That's not right!" Natalie cut in. "I heard she was a prom queen who was in a horrible car accident in the 1960s. Windshield completely tore up her face!"
"That's not what I heard," Liz said. "I heard her baby was murdered, and she went mad with grief!"
On and on it goes. Like most urban legends, the stories behind Bloody Mary are diverse and colorful, if dark. Candidates abound. Most of the time, there's a connection to the home city or part of the state, and certain versions are more popular in specific parts of the country. However, there are three common themes that seem to be pretty popular:
Bloody Mary the Witch - In these stories, Bloody Mary has a tie to the occult, either as a practitioner of witchcraft in general, black magic, or just suspected of it by the locals. Typically, she ended up burned at the stake or otherwise killed by the townsfolk, usually after uttering some sort of curse. In these versions, she's been around for hundreds of years and lurks in mirrors, waiting for her chance to exact her revenge on unsuspecting school children.
Bloody Mary the Victim - In these tales, Bloody Mary has suffered some sort of tragedy that results in her face being horribly mutilated before she dies or is killed. In one version, she was in a car accident and the shattered glass cut up her face before her untimely death. In another, she was the victim of a crazed murderer who slashed her face before ending her life. There are, of course, many other variations in this category, and they all have one thing in common: her face was disfigured before her death.
Bloody Mary the Mother - In the final version, Bloody Mary has a strong connection with children. She may be a young mother driven mad after losing her child, either through miscarriage, at birth, or someone else kidnapping or murdering it. In a variation, she murders her child, herself. And then there are the stories that tell of her as a serial killer of children. In the Mary Worth/Worthington variation of the tale, she was falsely accused and executed for it. In the Mary Worth versions, instead of saying "Bloody Mary," the summoner says, "I believe in Mary Worth."
In many of these stories, summoning Mary comes with a risk. She may strike the person on the other side of the mirror dead, or drive them insane. Or, if the person doesn't flee the room or turn on the light fast enough, she may scratch their face or even pull them into the mirror. I was lucky: the only thing she was supposed to do in the story I was told as a junior high student was appear!
Was Bloody Mary a Mommy?
When I heard the story as a kid, there was no mention of Bloody Mary's baby. However, the ringleader at that sleepover wasn't exactly the world's greatest storyteller, and none of us ever bothered to wonder whose ghost this was supposed to be.
Fortunately, not all sleepover storytellers are quite that lax. One of the most common variations has Bloody Mary as a young woman driven insane by the loss of her baby. Which way did you hear?
