Bloody Mary is actually the nickname of Henry VIII's eldest daughter. Mary Tudor. She was called Bloody Mary because of the amount of executions she ordered. (Though I don't get the bloody part. Most of the executions were burnings!)
Edit: Mary did BURN people Upyr1. She burned Protestant heretics, because of her catholic beliefs.
