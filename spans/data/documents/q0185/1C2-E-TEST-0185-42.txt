This story is about my friend Cassie, Cassie's step sister, Macie and I after what happened in Party gone wrong we were at my house and were telling ghost stories and reliving our past experience when Cassie decided to try "Bloody Mary". In my bedroom my closet doors are mirrors so it's like having four full length mirrors. The lights were already off so we sat on my bed and looked at the mirrors.
We chanted bloody mary three times and nothing happened so we just laughed it off and turned the lights on. Nothing strange happened until my parents left to go see my aunt and uncle. We were laying on the floor getting ready to go to bed when we heard someone walking up and down the hallway and we knew we were the only ones home. Then I saw the hall light come on and my bathroom door flew open and the tap started running full force and the shower came on. Macie went and turned everything off and suddenly it was calm.  Then we heard someone drumming their fingers on my door outside in the hall. We all held our hands up to show we weren't doing it and it kept going. I jumped up and flung the door open and it stopped, then my closet doors burst open. We started praying that it would all stop and suddenly it did.
Nothing has happened since and I am so glad. Now Cassie and I don't look for ghostly encounters and we pray that they don't look for us.
