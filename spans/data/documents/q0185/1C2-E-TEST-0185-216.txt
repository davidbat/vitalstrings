Since moving from her homeland of France to Berlin in 2005, Marjorie Migliaccio has made quite a name for herself, or rather, for her dancefloor seductress alter ego Bloody Mary. As a world-class DJ, she has traveled throughout Europe, America and Asia, playing in top-name clubs like Fabric (London), Watergate (Berlin) and Rex (Paris). Her 12" releases for labels like Sender, Einmaleins and Toys For Boys also earned her new fans and ultimately an alliance with Contexterrior, who released her acclaimed debut full-length album Black Pearl in 2009.
After building up a successful DJ and production career, what's a girl to do next? For Bloody Mary, the next logical step was to found her own record label: Dame-Music has become a hub for tracks by the talent she has befriended over the years in the worldwide techno/house scene. Not pinned down by any particular sound, the label's output adheres to only one rule: music that Bloody Mary would include within her DJ sets. For those not lucky enough to have already heard her play, that means: powerful yet refined, invigorating, and ultimately optimistic.
Dame-Music celebrated its launch in May 2010 with a party at Watergate, followed by a showcase during SÃ³nar Festival, Barcelona, in June. That month also saw the label's premiere release: Decadence, a compilation mixed by Bloody Mary, which leading electronic music authority Resident Advisor noted as "bumping, bubbly, outgoing and juicy... a romping, vibrant party mix".
Since then, the label has released successful EPs, tracks and remixes from the likes of Argenis Brito, Arado, Marco Faraone, Quenum, Sierra Sam, Jim Choi and Basti Grub. What had the biggest impact, though, was Bloody Mary's Arabesque EP, featuring the dub, electro-pop creation "Spinning Around", more than just a club track but a proper song featuring up-and coming vocalist/lyricist Eyke. Expect more collaboration between the two as Bloody Mary's sophomore album is in the works, plus more material she curates from her friends' quality output for future release on Dame-Music.
