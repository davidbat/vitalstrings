Alright, I know it’s been a while, but i assure you, ‘s’ and I haven’t not been getting drunk on Sundays, we’ve just both been too busy to post.  As a reward for your patience, we have three new reviews for you, starting with Tonic in Mt. Pleasant.
If you’ve never been, Tonic is a sizable sports bar tucked away in a little strip of bars and row houses on Mt. Pleasant Street.  They’ve always had great food and drinks, I know I’ve enjoyed their Monday night wings special, and have always stayed surprisingly current and creative (how many sports bars have you been to that have a speakeasy style cocktail joint tucked in the back?) without sacrificing their core “neighborhood bar” aesthetic.
Several weeks ago we were with a friend, trying to get a later Sunday brunch at that new BBQ place at the corner of Irving and 14th.  Why didn’t I take five seconds and Google what their name is, you ask?  Because they don’t do brunch, so that’s why.  So hey, fuck ‘em.
Anyway, we were at a loss as to where to go, when someone suggested we meander over to Mt. Pleasant, and just pick whatever strikes our fancy.  As it so happened that place happened to be Tonic.  We sat down, quickly perused the menus for food and then immediately turned our attention to the drink list.  DING-DING-DING!!! They had bloody marys, which were ordered almost as swiftly as they were brought to the table.  I have to say, compared to the caliber of other food and drink I’ve had at Tonic, I was a little disappointed.  I found their bloody to be a bit weak.  It had a basic tomato flavor, but was not particularly spicy or robust.  however, the flavor was pleasant, and there was plenty of vodka.  Tonic apparently has a Sunday brunch deal that is bottomless bloody marys for $15, and I can honestly say that on the right Sunday I could easily knock back five of these things.
