No no and again no. Its a story made up to frighten little kids, much like the boogeyman. You aren't going to get any results by standing in front of a mirror & calling the name "bloody mary". This was going around back in the stone age when I was a kid, & as of now, not one death certificate has ever named "bloody mary" as a cause of death. Get real, kid.
