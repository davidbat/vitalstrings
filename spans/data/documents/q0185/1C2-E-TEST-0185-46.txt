Category: Magic_Fantasy
(0) Mary went to a store and bought a doll. It was pretty, but for some reason it had creepy red eyes. But she shrugged and bought it. She brought it home and went to bed. But in the middle of the night she heard a high pitched little voice whisper: "Mary, Mary, I'm going to kill your mom". Mary thought she was having some wierd nightmare. She went back to bed. But in the morning nobody could find her mom...  (SpongebobGrrl, Age 13 to 18, 1/3/2003 9:23:04 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(1) 'The doll.'Mary gasped.Mary ran to her room and found the doll on the floor.Dolls can't talk.'Mary whispered as she picked up the doll with her left hand.'Could the doll do this.I mean after all it may be beautiful but it matters what's inside.But it's eyes-it's,there red and unusal.'Mary dropped the doll.She ran to her dad and clamied that it was the doll.'No possibly not,A doll?Kids these days they just don't understand.A doll.HA!'the father chuckled.Mary brought the doll to her father.'Or maybe so.A doll?'the father said as he loocked at it's red eyes.THe father  fell straight on his back.Looking petrified and shocked.'Father!'Mary screamed.Something had happened it was... (PtrickGirl, Age 13 to 18, 1/5/2003 5:43:32 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(2) death.  Death had hit Mary's father.  Before he even hit the ground.  "Mother! Mother!" Mary cried, even though her mother had been dead for thirteen years.  She died after giving birth to her.  Sobbing, Mary hugged her father's lifeless body.  The doll's eyes glowed a bright red in the darkness of the living room.  The doll, who Mary had named Emily Rose.  The doll stood up and started toward Mary.... (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/15/2003 1:28:44 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(3) "I will kill your mother,"  Mary gasped.  "My-my mother is already dead. (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/15/2003 2:43:27 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(4) "Then i will come for you!!" Suddenly Emily Rose stood up and ran down the stairs.  Following her, she had ran into the kitchen and had hopped up on the counter where...HER MOTHER KEPT THE KNIVES!  'Oh no!'thought Mary"She really is going to kill me!'  then she ran out of the room and out the front door only to realize... (Spunky Gal 101, Age 13 to 18, 1/16/2003 9:24:58 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(5) that she had no where to go.  Her closest relative lived a whole state away and her best friend, Andrea, lived several blocks from here.  Although it always seemedliek a sort walk before, Mary knew that she wouldn't be able to make it.  She could feel Emily Rose hot on her trail.  She was going to die, simple as that.  Unless by some miracle she could escape the doll, Emily Rose, that should be locked up in an isane asylum.  She could go to the police, but they would belive her.  "A talking doll?" they'd say, "Threatning to kill you.  Come one kid, gimme a break,"  It was hopeless.  Doubling back, she headed towards home, but she would enter through the back.  Maybe Emily had gone out looking for her, and she wasn't home.  Mary could lock the doors so she couldn't et in.  Then what?  Her parents were dead, she had no brothers or sister, her relatives only came down for Chirstmas, and it was September!  She would die of starvation before then!  And what about school?  What would they do?  And bill collecters, and money, and NO FOOD.  She was doomed.  This was her destiny. (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/16/2003 9:32:15 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(6) But before she could get to her house, it started to rain, thunder, and lightning.  Lightning flashed, and she saw two red eyes coming for her in the darkness.  She started to run, not knowing where she was going. Suddenly, she stopped.  It was in front of the cemetery where her mother was buried.  She ran to her mother's grave.  It had been dug up.   (Jenna Ray, Age 8 to 12, 1/16/2003 9:38:47 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(7) Mary was confused.  She had never really known anything about her mother.  Her father just said she had died after she was born, and she had just assumed it was from childbirth.  But what if something else had happened?  Why would anyone dig up a thirteen-year-old grave.  Unless it wasn't dug up.  What if her mother was...murdered.  Maybe her mother had unfinished buisness.        Mary had no idea where these thoughts were coming from, but more and more swirled around in her head.  Then she saw images.  Images of her father slipping something into a cup of water, a drug.  Handing it to her mother, who drank it in one gulp.  She was tired and needed sleep.  But as she fell asleep she didn't know that it would be for the last time.  Or so everyine thought..    (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/16/2003 9:42:50 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(8) Why was she thinking these things?  What was happening to her?  Her mind seemed to turn over.  Her stomach churned with fear and dread.  She became cold all over and so she rubbed her arms.  After a time, she realized that nothing was in her mam's grave.  Not a corpse, or even a spot.  Then, Mary felt something that chilled her to her very soul.  A bony figure tapped her shoulder.  She turned around and...   (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/16/2003 10:01:44 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(9) "OM MY GOOOOODDD!!!"  A chilling figure she recognized as her mother from her vision she had.  "MaRRRRRY......" she groaned.  "I..possessedddd  the doolllll to get..to you.."      "W-W-Why??" Mary asked.  "Because..your father..he killed me..the night you were born at the hospital.."       "What?" Mary asked disbelieving.  "He...He...."        "What?  What did he do?"         "He..he put a sedative.....in my drink.."         "But why??" Mary asked.  "Because he had.....he had a..another.."       "Another what? What, Mamma?" Her mother smiled, on what was left of her face.  "Another woman," she said clearly.  "While I was having you, he ws there.  As soon as you were born.....he..he went to visit HER,"       "Who??" Mary asked.         "Miranda Sokolaff.  He had...had...an affair with her...after I got preganant with you.  He didn't mean to..kill me but he was going to visit Miranda and he put to many sedatives in my cup.  He broke up with her right after I...died....And now sweet Mary, you need to die, too,"  Mary took ma step back.  "Say what?" she asked.  Her mother advanced forward.  "You see, I made a pact with the devil himself, that if I could come back to kill you father, I would have to kill you, too.  He doesn't do these things for free,"  Mary took off like a shot, racing through the trees and headstones.  10 seconds later she was flat on her face and her nose was broken.  Tears streamed down her now dirt-streaked face.  She stood up and looked at what she tripped over.  A broken headstone.  She sighed, took a couple of deep breaths, and took off again.  Her 'mother' was right behind her...     (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/17/2003 4:46:33 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(10) waiting to attack.  Mary knew every decision would affect how long she lived.  She made a quick decision to run into the forest because it had better hiding places.  When she got in it was dark and damp and tangled rootsd covered the ground, like twisted arm clawing at her.  Suddenly, thats what they became, and her mother's eerie laugher filled the forest.  (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/23/2003 5:57:32 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(11) It got louder and louder until...Mary coulsn't take it anymore.  She got to her knees and prayed for got to stop it!  Make it stop!  Abruptly, it DID stop, and then her mom's piercing cry filled the forest, and swirled around her, alomost through her! (Mickey Mouse, Age 13 to 18, 1/29/2003 4:06:54 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(12) "Noooo!" her mom cried, "Noooo! She made contact with God! He listened!" In a quieter voice she said, "No, it must be stopped. I'll go tell the devil. He'll understand." After a moment of silence, she screamed as if she was being split in half and then there was absolute silence. Mary gathered up her courage and walked over to where she heard the screams. All of a sudden,  (Melody Zhang, Age 8 to 12, 2/15/2003 10:46:44 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)

(14) Mary ran as fast as she could but she tripped over a little toy car and the doll jumped on Mary and almost stabbed her,when her little brother ripped the doll's head off,and that's when Mary woke up.      (Drake, Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 10:34:39 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(15) (14)"Help Me ""Help Me". The knife went through her. She fell to the floor and fainted until a police officer knocked on the door. (Lara, Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 10:36:26 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(16) Then the little doll caught him and said you are going to die but he kicked him right in the head. Then he laughed, and the doll got right up and stabbed him in the leg. Then he stabbed him in the  rib.  (Max, Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 10:38:31 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)

Then a knock on the door "who could it be" maybe the police.She ran as fast as she could dragging the dead body behind her with the knife in her hand. Since then she hasn't been seen.   (Amber, Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 11:30:55 AM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(23) Later I saw her putting the dead body into the trunk of her little toy car, and took off down the street. She still had the bloody knife in her hand so she threw it out of the window. All of a sudden a car started chasing her. she pressed the turbo button on her car. Flames shot from the back of the car as she sped down the street. But she couldn't turn her car very good so she wound up hitting a lamp post. She flew out of the front windshield and landed on someone's front lawn.She noticed that the body fell out of the back trunk so she ran inside of their house. When she got inside she found a gun to pretect herself. All of a sudden a person jumped from behind the couch. She shot the gun six times, and hit him every time. She walked over to the body and saw that she had completely blown his brains out. Now she has another problem. (David , Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 12:44:35 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(24) After about a week Mary saw a little girl at the store in the doll department looking at scary dolls. When I was checking out I saw the girl with the doll with red eyes."Oh my," it continues. I ran up to her and begged her not to buy it. She thought I was a mad woman and ran with the doll out the door. Something wasn't right.That girl's name was Mary. The next morning my friends told me Mary was missing. They also told me there was a knife found in her bedroom with blood all over it. Later that afternoon I saw the same exact doll on the counter at the store.  (Jordan, Age 8 to 12, 4/28/2003 12:46:16 PM, Mary_Bloody_Mary)
(25) I was wandering outside and saw the doll again. The doll is chasing after me so I ran back to the house and I couldn't get the door open. I was trying hard to open the door but the doll was getting closer so I ran behind the house and tried to open a window. Then I tried and I forgot that my mother had locked all the windows. So I ran next door to my aunt Margret's house because I knew it was safe there. When she opened the door I told her to close it.......... HEY HEY I heard my mother waking me up and she told me that I was screaming. and I said I was. She said yes and I explained my dream to her and she said THANK GOODNESS IT WAS A DREAM!
