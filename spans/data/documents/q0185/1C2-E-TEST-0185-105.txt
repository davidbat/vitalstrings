UFC Octagon girl Arianny Celeste was arrested Saturday morning for domestic violence. Naturally here at Bloody Elbow we've been covering it like it's a heavyweight title fight. Now details are emerging via the Las Vegas Sun about the back-story that led to the beauty's arrest.
The report reveals all kind of juicy details including Arianny's age (26), her real name (Arianny Lopez), her boyfriend's name and age (Praveen Chandra, 34), the charges against both of them (battery domestic violence). The trouble came to light when a Wynn hotel employee heard a crash and saw Arianny running out of the hotel room.
Arianny is accusing Praveen of choking her and grabbing her right arm. Praveen is accusing Arianny of kicking him in the nose in a limosine and throwing two vases at him. Here are the juiciest bits from the article:
Chandra recorded parts of the argument on his cell phone, which showed him following Lopez around the hotel room and demanding to know why she kicked him in the nose, the reports said. Officers noted injuries to Chandra's nose and scratches to his chest and arm.
"Chandra also continued to laugh at Lopez every time she said how she felt about him," according to the arrest reports.
