The different ways to call Bloody Mary…
So, it seems everywhere has a different way of summoning Bloody Mary.  Usually, they involve a mirror and saying her name.  The biggest differences appear to be how may times you say Bloody Mary, whether or not to spin around, and how many candles to light.  Spinning around is always a common theme too (probably to make you dizzy enough to think you saw something)  And some parts of the world think Mary was a woman who was framed for killing her kids and if you say, “I killed your baby,” in front of a mirror, she’d come out and rip you to shreds.  It is strange how this legend is all around the world.  It makes you think, how did it spread so wide if there wasn’t an inkling of truth in it?
