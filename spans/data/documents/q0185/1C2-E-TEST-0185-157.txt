Ok, back when I was a young school age child there was this thing that when you looked into a mirror and chanted Bloody Mary you were susposed to be able to "see" the spirt of mary..and to be honest that was as much as i needed to know as being the worlds class chicken i never went any farther with that, and never thought about it again. But wouldnt it figure that yesterday afternoon my "chicken" child came home with the same story. Hailey and i laughed it off and talked about scary stories and how they are just that and nothing to worry about, then i crossed my fingers and said a little prayer and the subject was dropped by her for the rest of the evening. Only to rear its ugly nasty head just after i had her tucked into bed for the night.  She commes out of her bedroom telling me she was all freaked out, so I must not have crossed my crossables hard enough, we had a very long night that wound up with her keeping her light on all night and my bedroom door open so she knew that she could get to us in a hurry...Sigh....
this was one of the reasons we broke the news to her about the truth about Santa, easter bunny etc.. so that she knew that if they were nt "real" then her robbers and monsters in her room couldnt be real either, but now what? she was told these stories by Girls that she hangs out with and likes arrrg... Bed times were so nice lately that i have gotten used to her just going off with no worries now it seems that we are back to her being crazy again.. any ideas? I am in NEED here.
