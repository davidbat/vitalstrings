Bloody mary is about living halfway between reality and fantasy at all times. The song draws inspiration from mary magdalene, and frequently introduces religious references and connotations.

This song is about mary magdaline and jesus's personal relationship/love affair. For example the lyric: when your (jesus) gone i'll tell them my religion is you (jesus). Mary will not be ashamed of her more than platonic relationship with christ nor should she and she is ready to defend him even if she faces persecution.
The lyric when your gone i will still be bloody mary referes to the fact that she was ready for the stoning, hence bloody all in the name of her lover, jesus. And she is going to dance and celebrate despite persecution b/c she knows what wonders lay ahead. (btw punk-tius is cleary a play on pontius pilot the man who gave the go ahead with the crucifiction). This is a love song...
Interesting fact: the song mentions paris, supposedly mary had a child with jesus, a girl and she and her child fled to the south of france and supposedly the girls bloodline eventually became the powerful marovigions, a powerful line of kings that ruled france.
Lady gaga is apparently very learned and i have become a fan, she is a creative force to be reckoned with. I love madonna but gaga has taken her work and launched it further, way further, and i love that she writes her own songs, madonna did not.. Lady gaga has my respect.
