I'm happy to update and concur with the positive reviews previous to mine!
I just returned from New Orleans after a fabulous 40th birthday with my 2 closest childhood girlfriends. Mary actually reminds me of my favorite Aunt- she's beautiful. Hotblooded, spicy and shiny and all about the beauty of the region.
Typically Mary wasn't available to do a tour on the day we went(was Memorial Day Weekend), but was gracious enough to accommodate us and schedule a private tour for my birthday. We met at Lafitte's Blacksmith Bar which by the way is pretty fantastic (and I'm from NYC-I know good.)...gritty with great character, and THE best Bloody Mary maker.
As Kristi R. said, the tour was a blend of local myth as well as historical accounts. Great information and stories about Louisiana and general and of course New Orleans--from grand perspectives as well as more focused and local.
It's clear that Mary has a real grasp of the inner workings of the city from several perspectives. I was really impressed with her ability to portray the stories of a myriad of characters; we were fascinated with her knowledge(and sensitivity) of the politics that existed among the diverse strata of folks of color, Whites and those who were a blend.
Mary shared a few stories that her gram had passed down and bits from her childhood. We drove through Treme (I'm a Treme addict) and Mary was able to share about the current state of affairs regarding the housing situation and city politics re residential zoning, etc.
We ended the tour under a great tree, where the four of us made our VooDoo wish dolls. It was a perfect reminder to us of how fab life is as we made our dolls and she reminded us to incorporate positive, affirming wishes and qualities into our dolls(more great health, money and sex for me please!).
She's dynamite. Call her now and schedule a tour!!!
