The REAL meaning of Lady GaGa's "Bloody Mary"
It's about the Illuminati and their plans to take over the world and ultimately, destroy God, his followers and any hope left. Making way for Satan. She is basically telling God/Jesus her plans for world domination, that she is certain Evil will win and They won't be able to stop it.
Quote:
"Love is just a history that they may prove"
She's saying that love will be a thing of the past, something in the history books that they can prove but it won't exist in the New World.
Quote:
"And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you"
When Jesus is gone, she'll lie to the world, pretend that she is following His orders but really she is following the devil's or the anti-christ. She will deceive initially.
Quote:
"When Punk-tius comes to kill the king upon his throne"
When the devil comes to kill God.
Quote:
"I'm ready for their stones"
She's saying that when the war between God and Satan takes place, she'll be ready for the resistance. She's basically telling the Angels and God's followers "bring it on".
Quote:
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said"
She mocks Jesus. She will celebrate “just like he said”...but not for Him or His teachings, but for the Satan's triumph over God.
Quote:
"Forgive him before he's dead"
They are going to be so successful in their reign, and ultimately triumph over God that Jesus, rather, will beg for forgiveness.
Quote:
"I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary"
When God/Jesus is gone, she won't mourn Him, or feel sorry for Him, as she doesn't marvel over Him like His followers. Like Bloody Mary, queen of England, she will still be evil, and slaughter millions who don't concur. She will still worship the devil.
Quote:
"We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart"
She mocks famous historical artists for their depiction of heaven and hell. They cannot possibly measure the evil that's in their hearts with mere pictures.
Quote:
"I wait on mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourire tout seule"
She waits bitterly for the world to turn to the Devil and give into evil. She won't go down into the flames alone...she's taking the world with her.
Quote:
"GaGa, GaGa, GaGa, GaGa
GaGa, GaGa, GaGa, GaGa"
The chants of Gaga's and the Devils followers. The world will fall on it’s knees, forced to obey their evil master.
Quote:
"Dum dum da di da
Dum dum da di da
Dittie da di da
Dum dum da di da"
This is the foreshadowing of "dance, dance dance with my hands hands hands..." during the bridge. It even plays over the same chords as the bridge. The "dum dum da di da" is the rhythm of the dancing/laughing during the celebration. She's mocking Jesus again. It's like saying "na na na na".
