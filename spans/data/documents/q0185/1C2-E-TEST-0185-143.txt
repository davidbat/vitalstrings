Q:
A: Queen Mary I of England (reigned 1553 â€“ 1558) is called Bloody Mary because of her persecution of Protestants. The Protestant Reformation, started fitfully in England by King Henry VIII, became established policy under the brief reign of Edward VI. Mary, like her mother Catherine of Aragon, whom Henry VIII had spurned, was a devout Roman Catholic. She contracted an unpopular marriage to the equally devout Philip II of Spain. The pair, with the assistance of conservative churchmen such as Edward "Bloody" Bonner and Stephen Gardiner, sought to reimpose Roman Catholicism upon the religiously divided country.During her brief reign of just over five years, Mary had 283 people burnt at the stake for heresy. Her persecutions were notable also for the prominence of their victims; the first person to die was the Protestant John Rogers, who had completed and published Tyndale's work as Matthew's Bible. While heresy trials and executions occurred both before and after her reign, she executed more than twice as many as had been executed for this crime over the preceding century and a half.Mary's half-sister Elizabeth succeeded her. In contrast to Mary's violent epithet, Elizabeth was commonly known as "Good Queen Bess,". However, on one occasion, Elizabeth had about eight hundred Catholics executed for restoring the Mass in a few towns. This has prompted some historians to suggest that a more fitting name for Elizabeth would be "Bloody Bess."[1] Indeed, Irish Catholics reversed the epithets, calling Mary "Good Queen Mary," and Elizabeth "Bloody Bess."[2]
