Method#1: Go into a bathroom, look into the mirror with the lights off and say Bloody Mary 13 times. A woman will appear and scratch your face off.
Method #2: Say “Hell Mary” 7 times in front of a mirror in a dark room, and you will see an  image in the mirror. After 3 times of saying “Hell Mary”, the mirror will turn red, and after 5 seconds, a face will appear.
Method #3: Go to the haunted site and download audio of bloody marys husband, Marvin. (site might have moved the audio file, let us know if you can find it)
