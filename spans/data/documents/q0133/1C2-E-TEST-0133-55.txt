What a catchy tune…I’m hooked… Thanks for including the lyrics as well. This actually jives with my new practice of listening to Colombian music to learn Spanish.
After listening to this song, I’ve got to know… is Cali worth visiting??

Hey Ryan, glad you liked it.  Ironically, after 4 nights in Cali itself, I’ve yet to hear the song.  jaja
And I’ve started looking at song lyrics more as well…to improve my Spanish.

I lived in Cali for 8 months and it’s definitely worth visiting. If you go to Tin Tin Deo or Don Ever on a Fri you will hear it.
