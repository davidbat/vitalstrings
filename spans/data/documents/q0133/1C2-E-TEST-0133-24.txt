     If you like Salsa, Cumbia, Tropical, Merengue and Bachata rhythms,  you don't need a name of any specific bar or discoteque.  Just go to La Sexta Avenida (Sixth Avenue).  Go at about 8:00 p.m. and have dinner.  Then go to one of many open air places to sit and watch the crowd go by. Each spot has a dance floor,  so dancing is never too far away.
     There are also many malls that are partially roofed, with many bars in the couryard inside.  Don't forget, in Cali, the weather always hovers around "perfect" so all eateries and bars have you sitting in the wonderful open air.  The malls that I visited were "Chipchape", "Palmetto Plaza", "Unicentro", "Jardin Plaza" and one more whose name I don't recall.  All are safe and beautiful.  All offer wonderful shops and many eateries and bars.  The liquor, and music, is always flowing.
