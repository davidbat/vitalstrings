Lonely Planet review for Juanchito District
When the sun goes down, calenõs (Cali people) have one thing on their minds - salsa. The city's best-known salsa nightlife is in the legendary Juanchito district, way south of the center. Two of the most famous salsa places here are Changó and Agapito. Come on the weekend - preferably after ten - and take a taxi or a chiva(bus)tour.
