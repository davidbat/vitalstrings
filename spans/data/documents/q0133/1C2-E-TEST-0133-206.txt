Recorded live at Club Ibiza in Medellín, Colombia, this spicy Junior Gonzalez performance offers a colorful, fiery blast of salsa complete with sexy dancers and excellent sound.  Junior does the mega-hits La Cartera, Señor Sereno, Sexo, Cari Caridad and others -- tracks made famous during Mr. Gonzalez's tenure with the legendary Larry Harlow orchestra -- classic salsa given new life. High quality, with a great private-club party feel. This folks, is the way a salsa DVD should be: hot, intimate, and a lot of fun.
Very Highly Recommended. (BP, 2008-12-28)
