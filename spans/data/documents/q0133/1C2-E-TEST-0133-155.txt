Cali, Southwestern Columbia, Colombia
Es una ciudad fresca, al menos cuando pase por allí había un clima bien agradable. Aunque nos advirtieron que era una ciudad un poco insegura...

Cali, Southwestern Columbia, Colombia
Cali is a wonderful city. Although it's not really a touristic city there are a lot of beautiful buildings and museums.  for example, "la hermita" is a wonderful little church in the center of town.

If you are planning to go to Cali and you want to have a great party you will never forget, be sure to try the   " chiva rumbera"   It's an old fashion bus without doors that travels through the city with loud music. On the bus there's drinking and dancing and partying. but if this is still not enough fun for you, the chiva also stops at all the famous bars in Cali.
