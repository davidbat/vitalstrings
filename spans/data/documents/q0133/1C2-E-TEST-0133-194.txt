Mama Juana's, CURRENTLY CLOSED FOR REMODELING in Studio City - http://www.mamajuanas.com -    Restaurant/Club. If I must be honest, I hardly ever go.  It's a    little too far for me, a little too crowded.  But in all fairness,    it is one of the most popular places these days.  If you check their website you'll see    that they're open for live Salsa basically every day of the week.  One of the few places out there dedicated full time to 'tropical' music    with its variations. Saturday
 
Steven's Steakhouse, in City of    Commerce - http://sshpresents.com/ -  Salsa every day of the    week. Saturday
 
 
El Floridita, in Hollywood - http://www.elfloridita.com - This    restaurant/club is also great on 'Cuban' Fridays [my favorite],    as well as Saturdays.  The place is small, not exactly cheap    if you go for dinner, but the food is good, and the 'mojitos' are great.  If you skip dinner and go for entertainment only, the cover charge is    $10.  Parking is tricky unless you    valet... [but not impossible... heh]
 
 
Vasilios, in Downey - http://www.vasiliossalsaclub.com - This club has been at this    location for many years.  According to its manager, Carmelo, the    most popular nights for Salsa are Friday    and Saturday, but it is open other    nights of the week as well.
