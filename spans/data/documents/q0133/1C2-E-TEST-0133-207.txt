About me:
I was born in Cali-Colombia Salsa, Merengue and other Latin rhythms run in my blood. I started my sporting life with classic ballet when I was 7 years old, and then with synchronised swimming for nearly 18 years. I was a member of the Colombian Synchronised Swimming Team for 12 years achieved outstanding recognition; I also have an extensive Synchronised Swimming coach and Choreographer experience in Colombia and Sydney, this is the reason why the love for dancing has always been in my blood. I have a background in Occupational Therapy, a diploma in business and human resources and currently I am completing my diploma in fitness and remedial massage. I am happy that Zumba is now part of my life as I find in it important and motivating qualities when it comes to dedicating myself to a form of exercise, such as: Good music, dance, sport and group work. I recommend Zumba as a fun way to exercise without realising you are doing it and because it makes you feel as though you are in full "RUMBA".
