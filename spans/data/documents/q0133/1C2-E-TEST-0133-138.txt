Today,                     Salsa dancing can be divided into several styles defined                     by the geographic region from which they come. Generally,                     these styles are identified as L.A. style, New York style,                     Cuban and Miami style. Although these are not "official" styles, most salseros today identify the styles by these four                   names.
Linear Style
Refered to as dancing up and down a line rather than in                         circles (Circluar Style), the 2 major linear styles are                         L.A & New York. These styles are very closely linked.                         Both styles use the mambo step as a basic and are very                         slotted/linear in execution.
L.A. Style
L.A. style is very linear. It uses dips and arm styling.                       L.A. style is very flashy incorporating many flips and                       dips. L.A. style dancing is a pleasure to watch and a pleasure                       to dance and is usually danced on 1. The Los Angeles style                       uses the contemporary mambo basic as well but typically                       executes this step by breaking forward on count "1".                       The L.A. and New York styles consist of the same core components                       that make up their incredibly diverse repertoire of moves.                       The main difference is their approach to styling, the ebb                       and flow of movement. For example, if you were looking                       into a window at a group of dancers from both L.A. and                       New York and could not hear the music to determine the                       count you should still be able to ascertain the style of                       choice for each dancer. The New York dancers certainly                       have a more composed, elegant, and smoother look and feel                       for the dance. The women in particular tend to reveal a                       sensual quality to express the intricacies of this dance.                       Unlike the subtle nuances of the New York style dancers,                       the L.A. dancers would perhaps catch your attention first                       with their incredible display of explosive and technically                       challenging roster of moves. The execution tends to be                       crisp and sharp with a vivacious appeal. The L.A. men tend                       to really surpass the basic expectations of a good dancer                       with jumps, and flips, and splits, and spins, and get the                       picture?
New York / Mambo Style
New York style is more like Mambo. It makes use of body                       waves, free style footwork, shines, rib cage movements                       and shimmying.
New York has earned a reputation for                     dancing on "2" yet there are many New Yorker's                     who also dance on "1". There are two variations                     of the mambo step danced in New York, the contemporary mambo                     (a.k.a. Eddie Torres style) and the Palladium style. The                     Eddie Torres style is characterized by a continuous and smooth                     body rhythm and passing of the feet where the non-weight                     changing counts are on "4" and "8". The                     Palladium style is very much like the 1950's Mambo whereby                     the non-weight changing counts are on "1" and "5".                     Unlike the contemporary style, it can be very staccato (fragmented)                     in execution depending on the dancers interpretation and                     placement of the feet on counts "4" and "8".                     While this definition may seem trivial, it drastically changes                     the dynamics of how one dances salsa. The New York style                     tends to have the most varied interpretation/ opinion of                     the basic step than any other style. Although this is called                     New York style, the styles danced in New York dance clubs                     are fairly diverse.
Puerto Rican style
This can be danced on the "One" or the "Two" beat of the music, but it involves a tremendous amount of                     very technical footwork.There is more an emphasis on footwork,                     than in New York style, however, in recent years this can                     be argued by many a Mambo maniacs in Manhattan. In New York                     style, there is a strong Latin Hustle influence. The guess                     is that in the disco craze of the late 70’s and early                     80’s, when Eddie Torres was one of the only instructors                     in New York, single-handedly holding the torch of "Mambo                     Dance" with Tito Puente, Salsa dancing almost completely                     grew extinct to the Hustle dance. Because of the great Hustle                     craze of that area, many Hustle dancers incorporated a lot                     of their moves into the Mambo style during that slow transitional                     period back to Salsa music in the late 80’s and early                     90’s. Because Salsa is such a diverse dance, and there                     are no real "rules" of style, once you learn any                     style of dance, you tend to stick to that style when transitioning                     to Salsa.
The primary influence in Los Angeles is West Coast Swing                     and Latin Ballroom. Many of the showy tricks and Caberet                     moves are taken from Swing and Latin Ballroom, which is very                     prevalent and highly competitive and influential throughout                     the Mid and West Coasts. Unlike Miami, there are not many                     Cuban immigrants in Los Angeles, hence the Salsa dance style                     is predominantly a hybrid of Swing, Ballroom, and a soft                     Puerto Rican style. In New York, however, because of the                     high concentration of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Puerto                     Rican style is much like that of what is now New York style,                     Latin Hustle, or what we call "Mambo On-Two"
The fancy footwork (shines) is really starting to become                     very strong in New York because of this influence. It is                     almost an even match now, whether they do more shines in                     New York than Puerto Rico.
Miami Style
Although the Miami style has its roots in Cuba, it has evolved                       into a more refined and technically stronger variation                       of the Cuban style. It is also known as Classico Cubano                       style or Casino style. The basic step of Miami style salsa                       comes with a "tap" between measures. This "tap & step" is a characteristic                     of Miami style salsa and you'll know it when you see it.                     Miami style salsa makes use of "ganchos" or arm-hooks,                     which is when one elbow is hooked over the partners elbow                     to create a kind of arm lock giving the leader leverage to                     move his partner via the arm.
Dancers dance in a slot and do many flowing continuous circular                     turns. It also makes use of many pretzel- like holds, and                     as such, Miami style salsa becomes very intricate and complex-looking                     at its most advanced level.
On a social level, very little demand                     for technique is placed on the follower in terms of spins,                     footwork or dips. In a closed dance hold the basic mambo                     step is danced with an option to break on either "1" or "3" depending                     on the dancers preference.
Cuban Style
The music has determined the style of dancing. The contemporary                       faster rhythms of the more popular bands, such as Charanga                       Habanarra, and Los Van Van, are taking the style of Salsa                       to a more non-partner dance. If there is a tremendous amount                       of percussion, the woman can shine with her incredibly                       beautiful and rhythmic body movements. In fact, partner                       dancing the Cuban style is so restricting to the woman,                       that many of the women could not wait to dance solo for                       a while.
The way Cuban Salseros hold on to the women’s wrists                     during the majority of the dance, restricts her from extending                     her arm and fingers, and displaying a sexy style of her own.                     Cuban style appears to be a very male-dominated "macho" dance, more so than the New York or Los Angeles style, which                     fully displays the woman, and allows her to stylize with                     her arms, hips, and head.
"On-Two" dancing to hard-core Cuban music is also                     a bit more difficult, although it can be done with a very                     well-trained ear. In recent years, I found most New York                     dancers don’t particularly enjoy an entire evening                     of contemporary Cuban music. They prefer the traditional                     Salsa / Mambo music, that is more suited to their style of                     dancing.
The newer sounds of Cuban music emphasize the "One" beat of the rhythm and the "Three" beats of the                     rhythm, much more than the "Two" beat. The rhythms                     are also much faster, hence the solo styling done more often                     than partnering up. With the opening up of Cuba, and more                     and more Cuban music and bands visiting the United States,                     dancing on "Two" becoming tougher for the average                     dancer to want to learn, unless people still listen to Puerto                     Rican style music, and Salsa from Puerto Rico, New York,                     and Los Angeles. It will be interesting to see how the style                     of dancing in New York will change with more and more Cuban-style                     musicians entering the market.
Casino Style
This is a cuban circular style and turn patterns involve                       a lot more double hand holds. The complex but spectacular                       turn patterns resemble a game of ‘twister’ from                       which the leader will emerge, without allowing the viewer                       to see how he’s done the ‘Houdini’ act.                       It’s very clever, and it’s the role of the                       follower to ‘hang on’ keep rhythm and not allow                       the leader to ‘trick’ her. Cuban style salsa                       also has a lot of solo work which involves rhythmic middle                       body movements derived from the old Cuban rumba. These                       movements have an afro –Cuban heritage and are also                       popular in Mambo.
Although we have observed many different Cuban style dancers                     dancing on a variety of beats, it appears most comfortable                     within this style to break on the 3. When you listen to Cuban                     style salsa, son, songo or Timba (all related to Cuban salsa)                     it actually feels entirely natural to break on the 3. This                     has to do with the underlying clave rhythm which forms the                     basis of most styles of salsa music. The prominent bass encourages                     a lot of movement through the centre of the body and it’s                     more about rhythmic interpretation through the body than                     precision with the feet or strict discipline. It’s                     all about the feel of the music and therefore, there appears                     to be a fair amount of liberty there as long as you’re                     listening to the music. Frequent adjustments are made between                     partners to return footwork into sync, in order to do turn                     patterns.
Rueda
This is a Group Dance originating in Cuba. It                       is danced to lively, up-beat salsa music. The couples dance                       in a circle executing moves called out by a leader. There                       is a constant changing of partners, which makes it a vivid                       and joyful spectacle. There are three groups of participants                       in every Rueda. The caller, who calls out the names of                       the moves that are to be danced, (He may also use hand                       signals in a loud club setting together with the call.)                       The leaders, usually the men, initiate the execution of                       the moves. The followers, usually the ladies, perform the                       moves as guided by the leaders.
Colombian Salsa Styles:
Salsa is danced differently all throughout Colombia.  In Cali, it is more "showy", in other, more rural                     parts of the country, it is danced more closely and tightly,                     with heads touching in some cases.  However, the underlying                     commonality is that there is no forward and backward motions                     of the feet.  It is simply what we call "Cumbia" style, which is feet alternating to the back or to the side.   There are not too many fancy tricks, turns, or spins                     in Colombian style - except if you are a professional dancer,                     dancing with bands, or competing. There is record on                     film that professional Colombian dancers performing incredible                     lifts and swinging the girl around the guy's neck, etc.,                     however this is not the norm.  This is simply for show.   Casual social dancing, Colombian style is much calmer,                     closer, where both dancer's bodies are almost completely                     touching each other, from head to toe. 
Stylin'
No style is definitively better than the other. It's all                     really a matter of taste. They are all fun to watch and exciting                     to dance. Many salseros take the time to learn all the different                     styles and even incorporate their own personal inventions                     to create their own style. Salsa has no boundaries so many                     of the styles' combinations overlap, blurring the line between                     one style and another. The style taught at Dance Connection                     is predominantly, but not limited to, Miami/Casino style.
