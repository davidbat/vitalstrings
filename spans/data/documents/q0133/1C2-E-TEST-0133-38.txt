Extasis Club is located in a part of Cali 's city center where you don't want to be walking alone at night. The surrounding streets are deserted and scary and commonly known as dangerous.
The security at the door, a 128-year old, five foot Cale√±o doesn't make you feel a lot safer, but he's not to be messed with. You will not be allowed to enter the club if you didn't bring a partner.
The club itself is located in the basement of a shopping mall and never really seemed to have changed much when back in the 1980's Cali was flourishing because of the cocaine trade. The mirrorballs,the walls, paved with mirrors, the pink neon lights and pseudo luxurious loungelike booths make you feel like you just entered a South American version of Boogie Nights.
The music is the salsa cali became famous for. It's loud and it grinds and you can feel the bass in your guts.
The couples, attending the club to do their dances, make you feel white and stiff as they twirl around eachother and unintentionally show why Cali is the best place in the world when it comes to salsa.
The club itself fills itself on weekends with not only dancing, but also talking and kissing couples enjoying the buzz the combination of rum and salsa gives them.
Don't expect to be having any interesting conversations, because the volume of the music will kill any attempt. Do expect to see what Cali has been for years, the world's epicenter of salsa.
