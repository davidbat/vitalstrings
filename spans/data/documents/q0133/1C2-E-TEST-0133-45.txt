COLOMBIAN SALSA // LA POLLERA COLORADA — Every Friday, the Colombian community in all of Los Angeles says: "A Bailar a La Pollera Colora'!" The night famously promoted by Charlie D' Cali throughout the city of Los Angeles and going on almost 10 years now, has a new home: La Fonda Supper Club on Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles. 
 
La Pollera Colora' has become a Los Angeles tradition because of its joyful celebration ambiance where it is not just about the music, or the dancing, or the special shows that Charlie D' Cali is popular for putting together, but because it is a cultural expression where for one night you can transport yourself to Cali, Colombia and forget about the fact that you are still stuck in L.A. 
 
The support that this night has received throughout the years has been outstanding. Charlie D' Cali has never given up his night and even when venues are no longer available and a different venue has to be chosen, the crowd continues to come and celebrate as a big family! That, in itself, speaks miles of how good of a night this is.
 
When you go to La Pollera Colorada, you have to know that you will listen to the very best tunes in Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, Cumbia, Reggaeton. And get ready to party and dance a lot! Que Viva Colombia!!
 
Go to La Pollera Colora' every Friday, from 9 pm to 2 am, at La Fonda Supper Club, located at 2501 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90057.
