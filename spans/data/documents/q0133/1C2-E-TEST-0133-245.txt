ABOUT THIS ALBUM
Album Notes
Sensual latin vibes music for the salsa dancer! Sexteto Cafe\'s original inspiration lay in the vibes-led Latin music combos of the 1950s and 60s, such as the Joe Cuba Sextet and the New Swing Sextet.
Vibes musician and band leader Dorance Lorza has previously worked as arranger or producer with: Kike Harvey, Conjunto son del Barrio, Los del Caney, Fruko, Hansel Camacho, Orq Mantecana, Octava Dimension, Proyecto Omega, Los Nemus del Pacifico, Hanny, etc...
From label:
“The year after relocating to London in 1995 from his native Cali in Colombia, multi-instrumentalist, arranger and producer Dorancé Lorza organised Sexteto Café with a line-up inspired by the great vibes-led Latin combos of the \'50s and \'60s, such as the Joe Cuba Sextet and New Swing Sextet. In Cali, Colombia\'s third largest city and self-styled \"world capital of salsa\", he led his own highly successful group Renacer Antillano between 1983 and 1989. During the 1990s he worked on many Colombian salsa productions as a performer, arranger or producer, or all three, by such key names as Kike Harvey, Santiago Ceron, Los Niches, Los Del Caney, Los Titanes, Los Nemus del Pacifico, Fruko y sus Tesos, Conjunto Son del Barrio, Proyecto Omega and Cali Aleman, among others. He was one of the primary sources used by the late Lise Waxer for her outstanding book The City of Musical Memory about \"salsa, record grooves and popular culture in Cali, Colombia\".
Hand-picked by Dorancé, 10 Years of Salsa compiles material recorded by Sexteto Café between 1994 and 2003, 10 tracks of which first appeared on the albums Café Salsa (PCP Records) and Salsa Pa\' Ti (Candela); the remaining six cuts are drawn from the \"lost\" 2000 album Latin DNA…
… Over the 1999 Christmas period I was invited to predict who I thought would be the most influential Latin producers, musicians and key players for the coming decade. I included Dorancé in my shortlist of three names. I am looking forward to 10 Years of Salsa becoming part of the evidence to vindicate my forecast.”

DORANCE LORZA (2 Nov, 1967 Barrio P/to Mallarino, Cali, Colombia) tres, guitar, bandola and vibes player, arranger, musical director, rising name on the international salsa scene. He was introduced to the tres by the Puerto Rican maestro of the instrument, Nelson Gonzales. He cites the Cuban tres icons Nino Rivera, Arsenio Rodriguez and Pancho Amat as his principal influences. He studied to be and electronic engineer at technical school but opted for a musical career after leaving at 18,then studied at the Popular Cultural Institute in Cali. He played tres with veteran bolero singer Tito Cortes for two years and led his own group Renacer Antillano between \'83 and \'89 performing classic cuban sones by trio Matamoros, Gullermo Portabales, and others. Venezuelan trombonist/arranger/composer Cesar Monge hired Lorza to play tres and synthesizer with his short lived Colombian-based band la Pandilla \'90. While Monge was Kike Harvey\'s musical director, arranger and producer, he employed Lorza to play tres on the track \"La Batidora\" on Kike\'s Sonero Para El Mundo \'92 on Sonolux (the LP was included on UK compilation LA ISLA BONITA \'95 on Tumi) Monge gave Lorza another break when he commissioned him to write the chart for \"LLEGO LA ZAFRA\" for Tuto Jimenez\'s Regalame una Noche \'92 on Sonolux. The song turned out to be the album\'s biggest hit and an anthem for the soccer club deportivo Cali. In 1993, Lorza believes, he pioneered the vibes-led latin combo sound in Colombia with his production of the single \"Que Suerte Tiene El /Dudas de Mi\" by Siglo 21 on discos DCM. When Monge relocated from Cali to work in Bogota as a musical director on a soap opera, Lorza took over as Kike\'s musical director and produced Diferente \'93 (arranging three tracks) and the dazzling Pinceladas de Amor \'94 (playing tres and arranging two stunning medleys), both on Sonolux. On the latter he implemented Kike\'s concept of three trombone and baritone sax front-line, a combination that was also employed on the debut solo album La Perla Negra \'94 on Sonolux by Kike\'s vocalist sister Daisy (Kike penned all but one of the songs: Lorza produced, directed and wrote three charts). He has sessioned on numerous albums including conjunto Son del Barrio\'s outstanding Rumba Antillana \'92 on Kanaberal featuring Lucho Puerto Rico on lead vocals, Valdes Tipica Band on BMG, led by the father of Orquesta Guayacan and Grupo Niche alumnus Richy Valdes and produced by Niche leader Jiro Varela at Niche Professional Studios in Cali, La Sonora Miami\'s Con Sabor A Cali \'93 on SAR, also made at Niche Studios. Santiago Ceron\'s Desde Santiago De Cali \'93 on Astro Son/Fuentes,Tamba Fuego\'s Atizando \'93 on Codiscos, and Cali Aleman\'s Cali \'94 on RMM. Dorance wrote four arrangements and directed the recording of la Celestial\'s follow-up Como Caida Del Cielo \'93 on Codiscos, directed and played tres, guitar and bandola on Los Del Caney\'s Clave y Son \'94 on Fuentes, produced, directed, arranged and played tres on 100% Sabroso \'96 on Codiscos by Lucho Puerto Rico y su Grupo Sonero. His other production credits include: Montunos! \'93 on Fuentes by Los Nemus del Pacifico (for wich he wrote all the arrangements), 6a Avenida \'94 on Vedisco/Fuentes by Los Titanes, Salsa de Hit \'95 on Fuentes by Orquesta Internacional Los Niches, and the best-selling Con Sabor a Viejoteca-Exitos de Cuba \'96 on Fuentes by Los del Caney (issued as Me Contagie \'97 on Vedisco/Fuentes) He has also written charts for Hansel Camacho, Octava Dimension, Los Titanes, Fruko y sus Tesos, Los Nemus del Pacifico, Proyecto Omega, Orquesta Matecana, Grupo Canela, Orquesta Yerbabuena, Orquesta Zandunga, Orquesta Kamaleon (featuring Oscar Alberto Abueta) La Maxima Identidad, and others. In 1993 he was invited to Santiago de Cuba to perform with Sur Caribe at the Matamoros Festival. He played tres with the London based Conjunto Sabroso backing Henry Fiol at his UK debut gig at Brixton Recreation Center, June \'95.He produced The Voice of Cuba \'96 on Mr Bongo by Hanny And His Friends. In \'96 he started leading, playing vibes and arranging for his London based SEXTETO CAFE, and issued the group\'s Colombia recorded debut Cafe Salsa \'97 on PCP Records the following year. The intended follow-up, Latin DNA, was recorded in \'98 and \'99,but didn\'t find a release. Sexteto Cafe\'s 2004 album Salsa Pa\'Ti \'04 on I Love Salsa/Candela sets a new benchmark of creativity for reinterpreting classic tunes.
