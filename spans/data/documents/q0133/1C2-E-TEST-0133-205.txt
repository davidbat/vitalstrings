* El Cantante, a fi lm based on the life of Hector Lavoe, stars Marc  Anthony and Jennifer Lopez. The fi lm recently premiered at the Toronto  Film Festival to rave reviews and will open in theaters on August 1, 2007. * A rare 2003 performance by one of the greatest salsa singers of this or  any generation! * Marc Anthony delivers a passionate, exciting performance from Cali,  Colombia on a Latin American tour that took him from Miami to the capitals  of Central & South America. This concert captures the raw expression of his  tremendous artistic prowess. * Marc Anthony began his career as a songwriter and backing vocalist for  pop acts like Menudo and the Latin Rascals. He subsequently collaborated  with house producer Little Louie Vega, who featured the singer on the  Latin-fl avored club hits "Ride On the Rhythm" and "When the Night Is  Over." * In 1992, Vega and Anthony opened for Latin bandleader Tito Puente at New  York's Madison Square Garden.
