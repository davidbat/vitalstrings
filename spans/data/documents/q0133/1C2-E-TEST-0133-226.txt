CD Salsa Collection:  Fruko y sus Tesos - Power Salsa
'Power          Salsa'
Released in October, 2000
(Colombia)
The            group Fruko y Sus Tesos began in 1970. Fruko and musical director Mario            Pachanga Rincon were working for Colombia's leading record company,            and they wanted to create a sound similar to New York' Fania All Stars.            Rincon was a veteran of the Colombian music scene, having worked with            Pedro Laza, La Sonora Dinamita, the Latin Brothers, Los Corraleros de            Majagual and others. At the time, Fuentes distributed Fania's titles            in Colombia, so Estrada and Rincon listened to the albums of Hector            Lavoe, Johnny Pacheco, and Willio Colon religiously, and later went            to New York to study their music live.
In the decades since, Fruko y Sus Tesos, along with the king of the            Baranquilla carnival Joe Arroyo (Arroyo has earned the carnival's top            prize, the "Congo de Oro" eight times) and Grupo Niche have led a salsa            scene in Colombia that ranks second to none. Arroyo himself joined Fruko            in 1973, with "Piper" Pimienta Diaz and Wilson Manyoma to create a true            Colombian equivalent to Fania.
Released            on October 10, 2000, Fruko y sus Tesos from Colombia has a few hits            you probably heard regularly in the clubs last year, including my personal            favourites to dance to -- Cachondea, Cali de Rumba and El Swing de Fruko.
