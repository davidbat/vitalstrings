Posada Salsa Boutiqueis a salsa themed small colonial hotel situated in the heart of the World Salsa Capital, the city of Cali in Colombia. We are the first, and currently the only, salsa themed hotel in Cali and our aim is to cater to the needs of visiting Salseros, as well as general guests.
Our comfortable rooms are named after famous salsa soneros (“singers/vocalists”), including Hector Lavoe, Ismael Rivera and Celia Cruz. The decoration of the hotel is a tribute to the stars of the Classic Salsa genre.
Background hardcore salsa music (including difficult to find gems), can be heard at a comfortable volume, within the public areas of the hotel. The music is specially selected by DJ Ara.
All our rooms come with private bathrooms, ventilators and TV with cable channels. The reception is at your service as a source of salsa (and other) information as regards Cali and her musical heartbeat.
