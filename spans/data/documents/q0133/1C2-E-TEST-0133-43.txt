La Ermita

Cali, Colombia's third-largest city with roughly two million inhabitants, is noted more for its laid-back atmosphere and its Salsa scene than its tourist attractions. Cali is the capital of the department of Valle del Cauca , one of the most prosperous regions of the country and home of large sugar mills and numerous industries.
Located in the Cauca River Valley, Cali is also known throughout Colombia and the rest of South America for having the most beautiful women in the country and for its love of salsa music.  The best place to party Cali style is definitely Chango disco, across the river in Juanchito, which serves as Cali´s party district.  A smaller, more intimate yet still hopping salsa scene may be found in Tin Tin Deo, on the Calle Quinta (fifth street, Cali´s main artery) between the stadium and the Exito megastore.  Another great place is La Pollera Colora, in Menga. 
If salsa is not your thing, check out the many trendier bars in Granada neighborhood. 
At the end of the year, between December 25 and January 1st, the Feria De Cali (Cali Fair) takes place, with all kinds of street festivities. At this time of year the Bullfighting Festival, the most important event of its kind in the country takes place in the Plaza Monumental de Cañaveralejo.
Just 20 miles east from Cali is Palmira a nice and industrious town that is worth a visit.
Go to La Cumbre if you want to see a beautiful 1920s style mountain town. 
Another typical Cali activity is to swim in the Pance river, our version of the beach.  Go on a day other than Sunday if you want to avoid crowds.
