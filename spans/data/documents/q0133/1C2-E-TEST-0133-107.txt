The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added 12 more companies to its growing list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers. These additions continue the effort of trying to cripple the financial support of the Columbian Drug network. The companies added to the list are actually controlled by individuals who act as front persons for Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia (a.k.a. Chupeta). 
Ramirez Abadia was named by OFAC as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker in August 2000. Abadia was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in Colorado in 1994 and in the Eastern District of New York in 1995 and 2004. In 2004, Colombia's North Valle drug cartel was indicted in the District of Columbia under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Ramirez Abadia was identified in the indictment as one of the cartel's leaders. OFAC worked closely with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York in the investigation leading up to today's action. Abadia remains in Brazilian custody following his capture in August 2007.
