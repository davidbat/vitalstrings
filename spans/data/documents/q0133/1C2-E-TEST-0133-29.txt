Cali Overview
Cali is Colombia's 3rd biggest city. A place that might not present a lot  of interest at first but drives an infectious energy that takes all of  its essence during the famous Feria de Cali, the world's biggest Salsa  Festival.

Calenos are without a doubt some of the best dancers on the planet. Cali will primarily be a destination for Salsa & party lovers who  will encounter numerous options to practice their moves in some of the  best salsa clubs of South America.

Cali is an industrial city with more than a million inhabitants. It  is one of the major economic and industrial centers of the country, with not much to visit but  still possessing a few colonial buildings and museums that worth a  detour, aim for San Antonio, the old colonial centre or Barrio Granada  filled with great restaurants.
