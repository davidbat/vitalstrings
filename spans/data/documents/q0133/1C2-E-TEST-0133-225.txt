About SalsaEddy
My Bio...
Edmanuel Deynes, known as Eddy Deynes aka “SalsaEddy”, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 20, at 11:15AM. Son of Puerto Rican parents, he grew up in the cultural melting pot of the New York City, Eddy was introduced to all kinds of music at an early age. 
Being a young, active man, he was especially attracted to danceable styles such as Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, Dance, House, Techno, Reggae, Dance Hall, R&B, and Soul which he still enjoys today.
Eddy recalls being introduced by his parents to the varieties of music they especially liked. His dad liked the romantic music of Los Panchos, El Trio Vegabajeno. 
His mother was especially fond of salsa and merengue music. She would play salsa and merengue music while she took care of the daily household chores.
When Eddy was 5 years of age he remembers his first lesson in dancing from his mother. First she taught him the basics to Salsa and Merengue. Eddy fell in love with the style of music. It immediately led him to learn more about other Puerto Rican styles such as Bomba, Plena, Guajira, and Bolero.
At the tender age of 14, Eddy's initial exposure to Salsa and Merengue was both tested and further enhanced when his parents moved back to Puerto Rico. There, Eddy discovered the real Puerto Rican roots of the music he loved so much. 
Even though he still loved the other styles of music; such as,  Hip-Hop, House and Techno, it would be during this stage of his existence that he first would have an opportunity to advance his appreciation, understanding and technical skills Salsa and Merengue.
This comprehensive knowledge and dedication began to pay off when Eddy started competing in local and regional events in Hip-Hop, House and Techno and won 1st, 2nd and 3rd place awards from 1987 to 1992. As he grew older his interest gravitated more towards Salsa, Merengue and Bachata and from 1996 to 1998. He won 2nd and 3rd place in the “Triple Corona del Oeste.
”Eventually, as a young man and after 12 years in Puerto Rico, Eddy decided to move back to the U.S. and start a new life in Houston, Texas. He never suspected that this enthusiastic desire for Latin dance and culture would be his massive input to the society that would become his new home.In Houston, Eddy initially had a regular job just like anybody. 
His primary career occupation at that present moment was in computer graphics, web design and analyst in the financial services industry. His enviable experiences in those surrounding areas are evident in his personal web site, which is recognized as one of the top salsa websites in the salsa community.
