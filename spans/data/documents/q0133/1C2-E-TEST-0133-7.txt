The Fool on The Hill: missed the salsa but not much else

Cali is noted for its nightlife and salsa is king. Clubs abound and if so inclined you'll find NYC is not the only city that never sleeps. This does not fit our normal sleeping patterns and while intriguing, it never really crossed our minds to check it out despite Vinz from our hostel imploring us that it should be if we wanted to see the real Cali. This was fine for us and thankfully Cali not only has a steamy nightlife but a varied one. Well, what many would probably consider pre-nightlife. We enjoyed having a beer at Cafe Tostaky and also hanging out at Parque del Acueducto right in the heart of San Antonia where we were staying. Locals come to enjoy the cooler temperatures of the evening. Vendors sell local snacks like papas, empanadas, and papas rellenos generally for around 1000 COP (50 cents) so well worth trying. You can grab a beer like Club Colombian for 19000 (a little less than a buck) from park side stores and bring them to the park to consume, bringing the bottles back from your deposit when you are done. I'm sure many would venture out after this prelude but for us, it was a nice way to end our night and make the short walk back to our hostel, safe and sound for the night.
Dress Code: In warm Cali, you'll rarely need more than a light jacket and if you go to bed early enough, you won't even need that!
