CD  (Exclusivo 0602),    Released 2002;
Editor's Pick:
Celebrating their 35th Anniversary in salsa, the Lebron Brothers -- Angel, José, Carlos and Frankie -- have produced a fine new salsa project featuring the great vocalist Luisito Ayala on over half the tracks, with the brothers Lebron and sister Corine covering the other half.
With superb arrangements by José and Angel, the CD is split in two parts: the first half are new studio sessions, while the final six tracks  are recording live in Cali Colombia -- and this half is quite stunning. If you're concerned about the sound quality of a live recording, don't. The sound is perfect, obviously mixed directly from the control box at the show.
Luisito Ayala is simply great here, and he kicks butt on the killer, nearly nine minutes, "Disco Bailable / Salsa y Control," singing spontaneously, sonero-style, about the Lebron's 35th Anniversary. "Mi Morena," another Luisto Ayala gem, is an explosive dance number that would be perfect for the dance club. Follow this one up with "Sin Negro No Hay Guaguanco" -- a salsa dura gem, and you'll have 'em in the palm of your hands. Kudos, also, to timbalero Edwin Acevedo, who throws fiery sparks throughout.
Highly recommended. (BP, 2002-08-02)
