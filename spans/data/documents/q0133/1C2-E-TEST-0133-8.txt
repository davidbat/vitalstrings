Write a Review of Salsa in Cali
Ride in a public bus, sit in a bar or walk down Avenida Sexta in barrio Granada and you will know that this city is all about salsa. There are dozens of salsa schools in Cali where a novice can learn a few steps to impress friends back home. In addition, there are many clubs where the irresistible urge to get up and strut one’s stuff will be too overwhelming to resist.
No one should pass through Cali without attempting to salsa with a local at least once. Salsa is the pulsating heart of this city, and from cab drivers listening to the beats on their vehicle radios to live performances in public spaces and theaters, you can’t avoid it. Pick up some of the steps at one of the salsa schools, where even the most lead-footed foreigner will be left eager to give it a go.
If you left your dancing shoes at home, head to the chic barrios of El Peñón or Granada to browse the boutiques for a solid pair. Afterward, stick around and enjoy a sumptuous meal in one of the city’s most exclusive restaurants.
