Tin Tin Deo
Tin Tin Deo
Tin Tin Deo is a Cali favorite, and the #1 salsa bar to check out if you’re short on time.  It’s one of the three salsa bars mentioned by name in the New York Times’ blurb on Cali in the article  41 Places to Travel in 2011 .
Consisting of two rooms, with a bar in the middle, it draws a regular crowd Thursdays through Sundays.

The cover charge is slightly lower on Thursday nights, when only one of the rooms is open for dancing.  While it may seem high whichever night you go, it includes credit towards drinks at the bar.  Women pay slightly less than men, though if you’re going out with a Colombian woman, it’s all but expected that the man pays for both. Many traditional women will also expect the man to pay for any female friends along for the ride.
Due to it’s popularity, you’re likely to see a lot of foreigners here, mixing it up with the locals on the dance floor.  Unlike typical Colombian bars, there are a few open areas in each room where couples can dance more freely, though once the bar fills up, you’ll have to eek out whatever space you can manage.
The vibe is very friendly, and while the location requires a taxi, as it’s not near La Sexta, Juanchito or Menga, it’s worth the trip.
