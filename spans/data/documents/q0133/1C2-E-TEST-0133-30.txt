Outdoor Fun
There is no beach near Cali but residents compensate by swimming at the Pance river. It is the least polluted river in the city and maybe the only one suitable for swimming. Sundays are usually heavily crowded. Cali river is west of the city and is one of the more tranquil parts of town. It is surrounded by restaurants, hotels, and an art museum. Shopping can be done outside at the traditional open air markets at Unicentro in the south and Chipichape in the north. However, the best bargains can be found from street vendors on 13th, 14th and 15th streets downtown. Visitors can go exploring and paragliding at Farallones de Cali national park if they wish to escape the urban environment.  Farallones de Cali is a mountain in the Andes of Colmbia and is 4,100 meters in height.
