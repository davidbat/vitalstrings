From Tijana Ilich , former About.com Guide
There's nothing that spices up a party or just an evening of celebrating life like some hot salsa on the sound system. There's so much good salsa available that picking just ten albums can be a challenge. But here are my favorites for 2006. This year the charge to salsa is dominated by Puerto Rican artists - but who can complain with such a wonderful selection to pick from?
1. Victor Manuelle - 'Decision Unanime'
Sony BMG
Even though Victor Manuelle didn't get his Latin grammy ( Gilberto Santa Rosa 's Directo Al Corazon won), my vote was for Manuelle's exceptional Decision Unanime.
