SalsaMagic                                     was born on 20 January 2001 in Lewes, near                                     Brighton, Sussex.

According to Canadian anthropologist Lise Waxer:
'...the El Paso Caleño or Calidance step is a rapid                           double time shuffle on the tips of the toes, combined                           with high kicks and rapid footwork. Turn patterns and                           some style combine the old Cuban Guaracha and Mambo,                           North American Jitterbug, Twist and the Charleston."
The level of competition amongst Salsa schools in Cali                         is fierce - testament to this is the city' s world Salsa                         dance Festival held in September.
