Funny enough, this combination of ketchup and mayo is also very popular in Utah, of all places.  Travel anywhere outside of the vicinity (Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, California) and it’s hard to come by.  Utahns call it “Fry Sauce,” and typically eat it with fries or onion rings.  However, this stuff sounds better, since fry sauce typically has no lime, pepper, or tabasco sauce.
