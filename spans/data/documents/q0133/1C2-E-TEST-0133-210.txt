Santiago de Cali
 
Santiago  de Cali is a major tourist and recreation for both visitors and its permanent  inhabitants. The center of the city retains many of the original construction  of the foundation, and it is rather than museums and theaters for cultural  enrichment. San Antonio neighbourhoods and Grenada presents a tourist  attraction for its architecture, geography and culinary offer. Passing near the  center of the city are the river and the avenue Cali Colombia, which offer a  very nice walking route, with stops required in the zoo, the museum of modern  art the Tertulia, the source and The Rock park, the bridge Ortiz, theater Jorge  Isaacs, the church and the Hermitage la Torre de Cali, among many others.
