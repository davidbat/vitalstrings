Celia Cruz
Cuban icon Celia Cruz was dubbed the 'Queen of Salsa' and was known as much for her trademark catchphrase, 'Azucar' ("Sugar") as she was for her music. During her five-decade career, she won countless awards, including a National Medal of Arts presented to her by President Clinton in 1994. After her death in 2003, The National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibit celebrating her life and music. 'Quimbara' is from her 1974 album with Johnny Pacheco titled 'Celia & Johnny.'
