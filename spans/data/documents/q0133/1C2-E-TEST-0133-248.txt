What's This?
Rabbit Hole Mode
See how far the rabbit hole goes, you never know where you'll end up or what new music you'll discover. We'll keep playing songs, each one having some connection to the one before it.
You can exit the rabbit hole by either clearing your playlist or adding new songs to it.
Start rabbit hole mode on I Was Totally Destroying It's profile page and we'll play one of their songs.
When that song finishes we might play a song by Hammer No More The Fingers, an artist I Was Totally Destroying It has recommended.
When that song finished we might play a song by Organos, an artist Hammer No More The Fingers is about to play a show with.
Stay in Rabbit Hole mode and see how far down it goes. We'll keep playing music based off the previous song.
