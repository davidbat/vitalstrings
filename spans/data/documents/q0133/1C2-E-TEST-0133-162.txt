Tanya and Sergio are two professional artists from Cali -Colombia in South America, they have an amaizing variety of skills that ranges from dance theatre to puppeteers and have introduced thousands of people not only to dance but to Latin American Culture.
If you want to learn to dance then this classes are for you, during our classes depending on the level, we teach people first to learn to move their bodies and undrestand how to do this,then little by little you will be introduced to the rhythms that contributed to the creation of la salsa, so that after few years you can dance to any style and have fun!
