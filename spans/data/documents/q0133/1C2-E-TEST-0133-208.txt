a huge city
The bus ride from Salento was an endless succession of turns, downs and ups to the 2600 meters of Bogota’.
I’m glad I did it during the day: I couldn’t have sleep anyway, and the scenery as well as the on-board movies were good.
Allright, straight to the point: Bogota’ is the city that impressed me the least in my trip.
Let me say the bad things first:
It’s cold and huge (2600 meters and 8 millions inhabitants). It’s the only place in Colombia where I had to wear a jacket!
The rolo, this is the nickname for people from the capital, don’t have the beautiful Colombian attitude I found elsewhere
The Candelaria area, recommended for backpackers, was full of very insisting beggers that made me feel unsecure at times
The bus system is complex, aggravated by the fact that I got spoiled by the ease of Medellin unique Metro system
it’s more expensive, that means less cheap than the other Colombian cities (always a good reason for backpackers to complain, I had learn)
Did I have a bad time in Bogota’?
No way! I had good experiences (first CouchSurfing host) and enjoyed something different than in the previous destinations (the hostel lifestyle I ditched so far) :)
