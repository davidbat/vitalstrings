                                                      CONGRATULATIONS!
To Mina Queen Salsa’s students: Anwar Azari and Catherine Salter (Ani and Cat), Anupam Deep Singh and Elvira Gheno & Tony Gheno.  They all learned their Salsa with Mina from scratch and have all trained hard to become Salsa Champions in their own right.
Ani and Cat began learning Salsa with Mina just a few years ago.  Around Easter 2005 Mina teamed them up together and started training them for competitions.  Drawing on her extensive Salsa teaching experience, she set about creating some routines and choreographies that would raise Ani and Cat’s game, and lead them to a point where they could potentially triumph at any competition they entered.
Ani and Cat trained industriously, learning with intent any and all of the routines that Mina gave them, and practiced long and hard to improve their performance and to raise their confidence levels.  After a few doubts at the beginning, they persevered and are now the proud owners of the following titles: ‘Salsa Champs’ First South East England Open Amateur Salsa Dance Champions for 2005 – 2006 (Maidstone, UK) and World Cuban Amateur Salsa Champions for 2006 – 2007 (Miami, USA).  They were also runners up in the Semi-Professional category of the ‘Salsa Champs’ Second South East England Open Salsa Dance Championship for 2006 – 2007 (Folkstone, UK), and are now also the first North West England Amateur Salsa Champions for 2007 – 2008 (Preston, U.K.).
Anupam and Elvira only started learning Salsa with Mina, again from scratch, in April and January 2006, respectively.  They had heard of Ani and Cat’s success the previous year and asked Mina if she could train them in a similar way to achieve a similar, or the same success.  Mina said that she would do her best to help them achieve this, but they would have to promise to follow her instructions very carefully and be prepared to work extremely hard.
Thankfully, Mina did her best, and Anupam and Elvira kept their promise.  After some intensive fast-track training sessions, starting in May 2006, plus a lot of hard work and practice on Anupam and Elvira’s part, they too decided, with some trepidation of course, to enter the Second ‘Salsa Champs’ Salsa Competion in Folkstone, Kent.  And, once again, a couple from the Queen Salsa camp came away with the top amateur prize.  Anupam and Elvira are now the proud owners of the following title: ‘Salsa Champs’ Second South East England Open Amateur Salsa Dance Champions for 2006 – 2007 (Folkstone, UK).
Well, they've done it again!  Ani and Cat
produced another outstandingly theatrical
performance at the official North West
Open Amateur Salsa Championships in
Preston, Lancashire on Saturday 21st
April 2007 - organised by Salsa North
become the first North West England
Amateur Salsa Champions for 2007 - 
2008.
Ani and Cat achieved First Place in the
Cuban Category and First Place overall
(All Categories together).
Well done Ani and Cat!!!  Once again,
you've done us proud.
                                              
Well done also to Elvira Gheno and Tony Gheno for achieving Second Place in the Cuban Category and Fourth Place overall in the same championships.  For more about Elvira and Tony’s Salsa exploits, please click here .
               
                                                                                                                        
                                                                  WOW...
We, at QUEEN SALSA definitely think Anwar is a man on a mission.  On this occasioin, he decided to give Salsa a miss and try something new...Bachata.
With just around a month to go before the start of the competition, he decided he'd like to compete in a style of Latin Dance which, up to that point, he knew very little about.
With a great deal of hard work, intensive training and dedication to the cause, along with another of his dance partners Alina
Muskvina, who is also a highly dedicated and hard working amateur dancer, they tried their luck, entered the competition...
and won the first ever
Amateur Bachata title for 2008 - 2009 at the Official
2nd Annual North West
