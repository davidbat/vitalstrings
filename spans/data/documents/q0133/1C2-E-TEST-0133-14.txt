Exclusive              report by Alfredo              De La Fé for SalsaPower
A lot of salsa lovers don't know that Héctor Lavoe lived in Cali. I arrived in 1982 to play in Juanchito which is like                the crib of salsa in Colombia. Back then, in the glorious years                of salsa, there was a club named Juan Pachanga,                owned by Larry Landa, who was one of the people                in charge of spreading salsa in Colombia. He was the first to bring                the Fania All Stars to that country and had a great                love for this music.
A few                months after I arrived, Larry contracted Héctor Lavoe to sing at his club and he also fell in love with Cali and ended                up staying in the city for about six months.
We                lived togather and it was there that I had the opportunity to get                to know someone who I consider one of the best singers that salsa                has ever had. I had played and recorded with him on various previous                ocasions, and we always got along great, but I had not had the chance                to get to know him up close.
Héctor                was a person full of conflicts and suffering, but he only had happiness                to give to his public, and because of this, he was always considered                the People's Singer.
Now,                twenty years later, ABB Productions organized this                great event with two purposes: One, to pay tribute to this great                artist and the other to try to keep salsa alive in the Branch Office                of Heaven, as they call Cali.
I personally                think this is very important. Many times while I am on tour in different                countries, people come up to me and tell me, "I'm going to                Cali." And when I ask them why, they answer, "Hey brother,                that's the World Salsa capital!" That gives me reason to believe                that people don't go to Cali to see monuments or churches, but rather                they go there to see salsa, which is its main source of tourism.                For that reason, they should not let it die.
It                was a very well organized event and more than a concert, it was                a show with fashions alluding to the styles of the 80s and its salsa                movement. This part of the event was the responsability of the designer, Marcela Garrido and Colombia's top models. The                best salsa dance schools in the city gave a great performance together                with Sandra Hurtado, the 17 year old dancer who                surprised everyone in Puerto Rico at the World Salsa Congress. There                was a script that told a story of Lavoe's time in Cali and of course,                the interpretation of the songs that made him popular in Colombia                and the world.
I was                accompanied on this occastion by Ray Sepúlveda,                one of the best singers in salsa today, and whose idol was Héctor                Lavoe, and Little Johnny Rivero, the legendary                percussionist who is known for his participation with the Sonora                Ponceña as well as the Wilson Viveros Orquestra,                with some of the best musicians from Colombia.
I was                impressed to see that Cali still shows a great love for this salsa                that made us all vibrate in the 70s and 80s, while in New York where                it was born, it is almost dead. I was happy to see young kids, 15                or 16 years old, singing along with Hector's songs, as if it had                just been released on the market.
I want                to congratulate Andrea                Buenaventura and her team, the people from Rucafé (PowerPartners with SalsaPower), in charge of the production, Patricia                Delgado who made it possible for us to be there and Humberto                Valverde, a great writer who has taken it upon himself                to document the history of Salsa in Colombia. Congratulations to                Cali for this great event and for the world renowned Feria de Cali,                that is just around the corner and promises to be the best ever                this year!
Don't                miss it! Join me there!
