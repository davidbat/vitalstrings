Our team has successfully performed and completed projects totaling over 10 million square feet in the build-to-suit, design/build and competitive bid markets.  Rosenberger Construction has consistently ranked in the Houston Business Journal’s and San Antonio Business Journal’s Top 25 Contractor List. Our highly successful field and office management lineup understand and practice the team concept in all Rosenberger Construction projects. We believe if we maintain our owner’s trust, service their needs and provide a high quality product, then our goal of continued growth in the industry will naturally occur. Rosenberger Construction LP utilizes Single Source Management from conception to completion. Each project is assigned an experienced Project Manager - responsible for each aspect of a project - from the initial proposal stage through preconstruction, through contract administration, and through project close-out. This ensures that our clients will receive continuity throughout the various stages of the project.  Whereas contractors who are departmentalized place the responsibility of project continuity on the Owner, our Single Source Management philosophy ensures continuity and personal attention on each phase of the project. Our project managers and superintendents understand and practice the team concept on each and every project. Rosenberger Construction's experience in various building types and systems, with and without interior build outs, allows Rosenberger Construction's team to apply its knowledge and skills to your facility.  Rosenberger Construction's ability to provide early estimates, value engineering and scheduling is a key benefit to finalizing the documents and design decisions to meet the budget. While budget is a primary focus in preconstruction, the sequencing and scheduling to meet all of your needs is analyzed and considered along with the cost aspects at the time of preconstruction.
