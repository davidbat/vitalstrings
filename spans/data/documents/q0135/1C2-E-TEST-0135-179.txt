What is the best method to install new vinyl flooring?
Q. I'm remodeling my kitchen. The orginal vinyl flooring is really ugly, but not really that bad shape. I want to put new vinyl flooring. What is the best method. I don't see the option of removing the old flooring but instead, putting the new floor on top of the existing. Should I just lay down 1/4 inch luan or is there a better, more professional method?
A. If its only 1 layer down, most manufactures ok it it to go over the existing as long as its in decent shape like you say. Yes the use of a luan or birch luan is the best way to go. The new glue will take to the pores of the wood the best.Filling in the seams w/ a special cement based filler and if theres any imperfections in the wood. I ve always have used Ardex but there are other names out there.  Any questions you can e mail me through my avatar.  GL

How to protect myself from a general contractor performing home remodeling?
Q. I am about to have a general contractor perform services for me (tile in kitchen, wood flooring, wallpaper removal).  He told me that there is no contract to sign, and that we both can sign the proposal he has given me to act as a contract.  I trust the guy, as a trustworthy friend of mine recommended him, but what do I need to do to protect myself?    Is there a simple contract I can draw up to ask him to sign?  Where can I find it?  Thank you.
A. I would tell him that you don't feel comfortable moving forward without a contract.  He should respect that and draw one up for you.  If not, then you may want to try to find a different contractor.  It may be find without one, but if problems arise, a contract might make things much easier to resolve.

Experiences with basement remodeling?
Q. Hi I am an 18 year old female. I am going to college an hour away from home and want to transfer to my same school but in a closer campus so I can live at home.  Basically in order to do that, I want to fix up my basement (I gave my sister my room when I decided to dorm here) I was wondering if anyone knows general price ranges of fixing up a basement. Its a very small room (enough for one person though) with a kitchen and bathroom. I would need to remove mold, (its not a big mold problem but because of a flood we had in the basement its very damp) Also, re-do the carpet, repaint the walls. If I want the bathroom I think I think the shower needs to be re-tiled--but thats not a big deal I could always use the one upstairs. And I would also need to buy a bed and maybe a mini-fridge, everything else I have from when I dormed.  I have about $600 in a check, and get paid about $140 every two weeks.  I can save my money, but I would like to know if anyone has expierences with this, they can share their story.  In order to get this done I want to show my parents that I am serious about it and did some research. Thank you for your help.
A. Ok like with most renovations the kitchen and bathroom are going to be the most expensive thing to do so if they are useable for now then maybe forget them and focus on the rest of the room.  so first thing youll need to do is clean and prepare the site for your work so as you suggested getting rid of the mould is very important, its very important to find  where the moisture is coming from and then fix that to prevent any further leakage, if you can or can not fix it an important thing is ventilation, just make sure fresh air is circulating through the room, even use normal house fans to keep things fresh.  to save money on the carpet i would suggest getting an overall measurement of the room and look on ebay to find a roll that will fit the room, often people sell their used carpet when their renovating their house, you will also need carpet spikes which are nailed around the edge of the room and then the carpet grips to that lastly youll need under lay as well which goes on the concrete slab and then the carpet is rolled out on top of that, sadly youll need a carpet layer to do the final cut and install but by purchasing everything he needs youll save money.  as for painting ill leave that to you as it doesnt take a genius to figure that one out, $600 isnt much to work with but with the right preparation and doing as much yourself youll save alot.   the bathroom and kitchen are a little more difficult but if you have some spare cash to throw at them you can email me at cheerscraigo@yahoo.com and ill tell you about tiling and replacing the shower head and taps.

Any ideas on how to make a kitchen and bath remodeling business grow?
Q. My family owns a business that sells kitchen and bath cabinets. Any ideas on way's to advertise and make it grow effectively? It's not that we are small, but obviously you always want more? any suggestions will me read. thanks for the help. If you are in the kitchen/bath business please let me know what did or did not work for you. Thanks for the help!
A. You are kidding right? Have ya heard? We are in the worse depression since 1928 and the economy still continues to deteriorate. I can promise you that the last thing on peoples minds now is spending a wad of money on a new kitchen. They dont know when they too will be layed off. Besides everyone knows homes are depreaciating at a rapid pace. Why dump $20 grand into an asset that is losing value faster then this country is losing jobs. Any child knows better then that.  Even the wealthy stopped spending money on their homes but this is the only market worth going after because some still are spending, just being more careful. The economy is choosing what cabinet to buy, not the customer. Those who walk into my showroom make a beeline for the pretty cherry but end up buying the less costly oak. As little as 3 years ago I had 3 to 5 people per week coming in with a $25,000 kitchen budget. Today once a month some one walks in with a broken drawer box they need replaced. The best part is when they walk in with a stack of bids 5" thick and ask you for another one. New home starts across America stands just about at zero.  Now to answer your question with a wish and a prayer. Advertising in newpapers or magazines is a waste of money. The consumer is numb from ads that bombard them every day. Most saying the same old crap. Lowest prices of the year. Best sale yet. Compare and save. Free installation...and on and on. Another waste of money are those contractor referral services. You pay for so called qualified leads. But only one in 100 ever call you back. Most of us honestly believe the Bob Vila and Service Master referral services have hundreds of fake phone numbers to sell leads with. Out of about 40 leads so far that we paid $25 each for, we got 2 small jobs from them.   The one thing that does work is very expensive. It's called google optimization. It cost us $1500. What it does is anyone searching key words will get YOUR business web site as the very first listing on google. Google already knows where the searcher lives. If they simply type "cabinets" into the google search bar, YOUR company will come up because google knows the searcher lives in Anytown,USA so it will find Anytown Cabinet company.   My friend all you can do is sit and wait. I just hope you are living off the fat from the good days. But for most of us, the fat is decomposing quickly. I been in in this biz for 29 years and I still stand. But perhaps 70% of everyone I knew in the cabinet biz has moved on to something else. It is not good out there and I see little hope of any improvement in the housing market as well as the economy for a very very long time. Of course that is not what this govt says when they try to pull the wool over we the peasants heads. They are liars, criminals and crooks. I am honest and truthful with nothing to gain by being honest and truthful.  I wish you luck. I really do.

Remodeling a kitchen and bath. Can anyone suggest really good FREE virtual remodeling sites?
Q. The ones I have found so far are either too complicated...I don't need an inch by inch grid, or just too limited in choices. I very much appreciate your respectful, dignified answer to my question AND the valuable site information.  Thank you!
