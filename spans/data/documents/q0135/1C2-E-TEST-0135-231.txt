Tools & Equipment Coverage
Solutions to Protect Against a Catastrophic Claim
Miami Contractor General Liability Insurance policies generally include some coverage for hand tools and that limit can normally be increased for                                           a nominal fee.  If you choose to cover $5000 worth of your hand tools but do not want to specifically                                          describe them you can do this on your contractor's general liability policy.  Typically there is a                                          maximum per tool under this coverage.  Since you have not specifically described the equipment,                                          this is called unscheduled inland marine property insurance.
If you have more specific equipment with a greater value, you must specifically describe                                          it:  2006 Kubota Skid Steer Serial #KB126456 - purchased used $19,000 value.  Because you and the                                          insurance company have now specifically described the property to be insured, this is called                                          scheduled inland marine property coverage.
Some Good News For Our Miami Contractor Clients
With many insurance companies, when you add more than one line of insurance with another - here                                          commercial general liability and inland marine - you have created a contractors package policy.                                           The good news is that most insurance companies will allow their underwriters to credit or reduce the                                          premium on package policies.  It is possible that you could add coverage and actually reduce your                                          insurance premiums.
