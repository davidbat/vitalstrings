General Contractors License Class, Florida Contractor Exam
 
We     specialize in working with out of state contractors that need to     pass the exam on the first try.
Recently we have been asked if     getting the books highlighted is really worth it. When we started offering the     books highlighted and tabbed for our students, our pass rate     then skyrocketed! Below you will find some of the comments we have had     from previous students. In last seven years no one has ever     complained about getting their books pre-highlighted and tabbed .
"I didn't want to spend     the money for highlighted books, but I couldn't keep up with the     rest of the guys in class. I broke down and bought them highlighted.    What a time saver! The cheaper way turned out to be wrong for     me." Josh V.
"I've taken tests in other states and highlighted books is the     only way to go." Al P.
