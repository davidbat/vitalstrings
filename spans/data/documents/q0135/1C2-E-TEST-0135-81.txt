I want to solder new faucet in, but not licensed-need ur help professional plumbers?
Q. I have extreme experience in plumbing, among other trades and I want to install a new shower faucet and such, but the apartment wont' let me cause I dont' hold a license in this state,    Since this is an condo I never encountered this. I got the hotwater figured out, question is the main cold supply. But is there some way around this?? perhaps i could cut the pipe, then quickly attach a compression shutoff supply then go from there. I would think this would be an idea, I'm going to test this theory with another supply with a shutoff before I attempt but main importance is homeowners dont' care, and are really fustrated that about the situation, and said if i can get aroudn it to do it, They own the condo, and it should be their right to do it.  So any suggestions from professional plumbers? Yep thats right, years of experience, over 14 to be exact, electrical, plumbing hvac, roofing, new homes, additions remodeling, foundations,    Now im experienced as in own a "sucessfull" company, I do all trades therefore am not master of none. I know plumbing many roughins many many remodels, jacuzzis, sunken and surface, copper sweating no problem,  So in saying this, Its a condo, as in you have to jump through hoops, I am out of state, visiting family. They want their bathroom remodeled, All I need is the water off for 5 minutes, to solder a shutoff on there, But they want a licensed plumber. NOW...If I didnt' know what I was doing then ok, perhaps, but only hold back is fact that they want that paper, Where Im at they wants $350 just to come out. And the reason im in a hurry is because I need to get back to my state so I can continue my companys business.  Now I have always been able to shut off water everywhere I been, this is new to me. Just looking for solutions the reason im doing this is for family, I can't shut the water off cause its a condo with shared water. I think this is stupid, but Im not from this state.
A. Shark bite fittings can go on quickly , no solder and easy to work with. There is a freeze system that freezes two places on the pipe so you can cut into it to repair or (in your case ) modify .This may somewhat hard to find at a rental place.  Best bet is to use the shark bite set up ready to go and turn off the water cut and slap it together and turn the water back on  maybe 10 minutes of the water being off.  They may want the "license" for the bond  with the freeze system you don't have to turn off the water as it is frozen inside the pipe and therefore plugged

How do you remove dye from laminate flooring?
Q. The laminate floor in my bathroom has dye/paint on it and I don't know how to get it off.  The color came from the dye/decoration on a plastic bag that got wedged under a hamper and got wet.  The ink transferred to the floor and now I don't know how to get it off.  The flooring is not the best, and I know that if I use a scrubby on it I'll just damage the floor.  Any suggestions?  The floor is off white, so something that would bleach out the color without damaging the floor might work, but I don't know anything like that either (regular bleach will not work).  Thanks!
A. I wish I knew.  Sixteen years ago, my step-son and I were dying Easter eggs and some of the dye spilled on the flooring.  I am the guru of cleaning, but I have found no solution to this problem.  Good luck.

What is the appropriate flooring that need to be in place beneath porcelain tiles?
Q. I am set to install porcelain tile flooring in a bathroom where the house currently has carpet.  Provided it is in good condition (which I am assuming it is), is it OK to install the porcelain directly on the floor?  Do I need to prepare the floor?  If anyone has any pointers, I would appreciate it!  Thanks!
A. First things first..  Is the floor concrete or wood?   If it is concrete:  Take up the old carpet, pad and tackstrip. Scrape and clean the floor. Check the concrete for any cracks and prepare them with a good crack supression system ( I recommend Protecto Wrap ). After this you are ready to install the ceramic.  If the floor is wood: Follow the above with the added steps of a sturdy cement type backerboard, Wonderboard, HardiBacker or DurRock are just a few name brands. Wood floors need  this in order to reduce the flex felt in a wood floor.  I have known some installers to nail/screw this down without thinsetting ( tile morter) it down with good results. The correct way is to thinset the board down and then nail/screw it. The reason for this is to bond the board to the floor to reduce movement and thereby reducing cracks in the grout and tiles themselves.  I hope this helps, Good Luck.

Any Professional ceramic floor tile layers out their, advice required?
Q. A customer of mine has got someone to put ceramic tiles down in their upstairs bathroom. He has told them to rip up the floorboards and lay 12mm thick waterproof ply instead. Floorboards should be no less than 18mm thick, so whats he going on about?
A. Floor boards need to be screwed down in all cases. You can lay on boards with timber fix also use as grout (slow buts works). You can ply floor sealing the rear and edges of the board before screwing at 12" centers. You can level floor and fix wedi board. Fix tiles with flex andhesive and flex grout.  over 35 years in trade and still at it.

Do I have to remove the toilet to put down laminate flooring in the bathroom?
Q. Right now there's vinyl flooring there and I want to put down this laminate that looks like stone. I just don't know if I have to remove the toilet to put it in or do I cut around it and caulk? I want it to look as professional as possible. I just don't want it to scream "AMATEUR".
A. If you are going  for the pro look you will certainly want to pull the toilet to install your floor. When you go to reinstall the toilet you will more than likely need to add a spacer flange as well as a wax ring w/ horn to the original flange to accommodate the new floor height. Make sure you follow the  laminate flooring manufacturer's installation instructions for wet areas.  Regards,  Indy

Water Damage In Bathroom Floor - Question for EXPERTS, please no yahoo answer junkies...?
Q. We had two feet of snow on our roof for about 20 days here in Cincinnati. The ice dam put water into our bathroom ceiling, which flowed behind the tile and behind an acryllic insert, unde the tile floor and into the kitchen cabinets downstairs.  A deep sensing (probless water meter) shows spots with 25 percent ++  humidity behind the insert in the exterior wall and also under the floor tile.  The insurance company's remediation company just wants to dehumidify it and call it a day. I think the exterior wall at least needs to come down and have the insulation dried out. I also think it needs to have some sort of mold inhibitor put in the wall and the floor.  If, and ONLY if, you are a water damage professional, please hit me with your thoughts.  Thanks This is for EXPERTS only. The insurance company sent out an adjuster who says we only need to put dehumidifiers into the bathrooms and replace a little bit of dry wall. They are not going to pull down the acryllic (which is over the wall tile), or pull up the tile floors. I am particularly concerned about the outside wall which had most of the water and is covered by both tile and the insert.
A. Dehumidifying won't affect water inside the wall, especially if it's being retained by the insulation. The first answerer is 100% correct. Water inside your house is a serious problem. There is a lot more involved in correcting it than just dehumidifying the rooms affected. Sounds like your insurance company is trying to convince you otherwise to avoid a big reno bill. And, yes, a re-roof with an ice dam shield is a must for your situation.

DIY bathroom remodel question?
Q. We want to replace laminant tile with ceramic, and replace a vanity sink with pedistel sink. We aren't plumbers so curious if we should do sink or floor first. Also how difficult is the sink? I think we will leave the floor to experts.
A. Tear out the existing vanity. Replace the floor. Then install the new pedistal sink on top of the new tile. The sink should be easy to install, if you have trouble you can always call the plumber.
