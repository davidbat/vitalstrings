CHARITY 101: How to    Choose the Best & Avoid Scams!   
Giving to others in need seems to be a natural impulse the world     over. Many of us enjoy giving to causes, programs or research that     we agree with and believe in; however, sometimes we are caught     unaware and asked to give by volunteers. We may love the idea of the     cause but know little about the organization. Or we may like the     idea, but prefer it were handled differently. So how do you find the     best fitting charity and determine they are legitimate? We've compiled    a list of things to consider when choosing a charity,     such as when to give, how to avoid scams, and other ways to give to     the community rather than a cash donation.
SEASONAL ARTICLE:
AUTUMN HARVEST: Gardening & Landscaping in the Fall!
Fall is traditionally associated with harvesting and stocking up for     the winter ahead;  however, many locations in the U.S., even those    accustomed to getting heavy snow in the winter, embrace the fall as    a great time to extend their garden harvest and continue to play with    their landscape.  Gardeners may continue to plant a regular 'salad    mix' and root vegetables through November.  Fall is also a great    time to plant bulbs and other plants for the following spring.  Landscapers who think ahead may already have some great flower varieties    showing off their colors in the fall.  Finally, fall is a great    time to take advantage of mild temperatures to prepare the plants and    soil for the winter ahead.  There are many projects for the fall    garden to keep all green-thumbs happy!

THE HAUNTED -    Castles, Houses, Inns, Restaurants, & more!
Perhaps it wasn't         the wind that slammed that door shut?  Maybe the footsteps down the hall    aren't coming from a living being?  Are those shrieks and howls    outside the window really just a tomcat vocalizing his desire for    companionship?  Perhaps people just enjoy the idea of a haunting?  And maybe it's just a great marketing ploy for bed and breakfast inns and historical societies? While not everyone believes in ghosts, the stories and histories behind many haunted         places can seem just as lively as their "spiritual" residents.
HOMES of the FUTURE!
What better way to      look into the future than to peer into the technology and     innovation behind homes of the future.  As technology changes     so many aspects of our lives, it will soon also effect our personal     sanctuary.  Computers have changed how we watch television and     read books.  Software notebooks have changed our libraries, and     music     collections have gone from plastic CDs to bits of data.  So what about the home     structure itself?  How will new technology effect how we use     energy, water, communications, and the natural environment     surrounding the home?  What might the homes of the future look     like?  In this article, we take a look at changes to residential buildings that we might see in the next 10 years.

VIDEOCONFERENCING:     Made Easy Online!   
I     normally write articles as a detached third person, but for this     one, I'm sharing a personal story - the experience I had using online    videoconferencing when I took a trip to Poland and the Czech Republic.  Having been to Europe before, I knew I had three options regarding     communication home in the States: 1) buy an    international cell phone, 2) hunt down an Internet café, and 3) find an old fashioned payphone.  These    options have their ups and downs and various levels of expense.  Since I    was traveling on the cheap, I had decided to use option 3 and was relying on using payphones.  But this time I ran into a problem that I hadn't anticipated: I arrived in Gdansk, Poland on a late Sunday afternoon.  When I found my first payphone, I noticed that they did not accept credit    cards or coins and, instead, you needed a phone card or account    number purchased from where else - the post office, which wasn't open     because it was late and it was Sunday.  For the life of me, I     could not figure out how to make a collect call, either, so that     meant no phone call home    Sunday night for me!  How in the world was I going to let my family know I    arrived safely?  VIDEOCONFERENCING, of course!

HOME INSPECTORS: How    to Hire One!
So, you are buying or selling a home and you feel that    you need an experienced professional to inspect the property so that you    go into the sale/purchase knowing everything that you need to know to    make the proper decisions and arrive at the dollar/value amount that the    property is worth to you. But, how do you go about it? All of the    Inspectors’ ads seem the same - they all tout the same lines of how    great they are, etc., etc. It’s impossible to get a referral because you    really don’t know anyone who has bought or sold a home recently, and    you surely don’t trust the Realtor's choice because you are pretty sure    the Inspectors that they use are “their good Ol' boys” that solicit the    Realtors for work. So, what’s a person to do?
GREEN TIPS:
PAINT-ON INSULATION: Is    it Truly Green?
Winter is here, and if that utility bill    is high, you are probably already troubleshooting problem areas of your    home. One of largest contributors to drafty rooms is a lack of    insulation. Insulation is designed to stop air passage through ceilings,    walls, and the floor. The intention is to keep the right air where you    want it in each season. Obviously, the windows and heating source are    also important to maintaining an overall energy efficient program, but    having the right insulation is a key factor. In     existing homes, it can be difficult to go back and insulate after     the fact. If attic space allows, you can blow-in insulation.     Under-floors and in-between walls can be difficult as well. Even     with your best efforts, there is bound to be some location that is     hard to reach. What if you had a product that you could apply     from the exterior?
