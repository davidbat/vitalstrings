Contractor Insurance Is Different
Other Miami insurance agents might tell you that insuring contractors like you is                                          the same as insuring anything else.  This same thinking would suggest you can have heart surgery done by your family doctor.                                          I am not suggesting that insuring Miami contractors is as difficult as                                          coronary bypass surgery - just that, because I can swing a hammer, I am definitely not a                                          carpenter.  It's the same with insurance agents.

The Reason?
A Generalist Agent Wasn't A Miami Contractors Insurance Expert
One policy form one policy exclusion can literally make the difference for you between                                          sleeping like a baby and being thrown into a world of you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy.

Again, without                                          beating a dead horse  - the reason other agents don't tell you about it - they don't know it. It's not                                          that they are bad people, they are just not Miami FL contractor insurance specialists.
What Miami FL Contractors Insurance Is and Isn't
Miami contractors insurance is not sexy, it is not filled with laughs. Supermodels don't spend their time                                          at parties discussing changes in general liability.                                          But one thing that contractors insurance is - it is vital.
In an absolute sense, these policies can make or break you.                                           The nature of the contractor business is dangerous, people get hurt, property gets damaged.                                          Simply, you can't rely on the advice of someone who doesn't deal with Miami construction insurance all day, every day.
