Contractors
As the #1 educational resource for the residential metal roofing industry, the Metal Roofing Alliance helps match metal roofing contractors with interested home owners in your area. We help consumers decide if a metal roof is right for their home, and when they're ready, provide them with a list of contractors near their home.

Distributors
After learning about all that metal roofing has to offer through MetalRoofing.com, many homeowners are interested in installing a metal roof themselves. We make this home improvement project possible by directly connecting these homeowners to you, their local distributor.
