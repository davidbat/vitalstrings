Bathroom Remodeling                   Done Right adds Value to your Home! 
Remodeling Your Bathroom Can Actually 
Make You Money!
New home construction costs continue to rise, so the financial gains from remodeling existing homes,                   bathrooms (bathroom or bath) are much                   greater than ever! Remodeling  adds equity in your home and therefore                   achieve capital gains that can be deferred until your property is sold.                   Also, tax laws have made remodeling even more attractive to investors by                    limiting the tax write-offs allowed on new investment properties. Remodeling,                   especially in the bathroom and kitchen areas,  on the other hand, adds equity and                    therefore capital gains that can be deferred when your house                   is sold.

Bathroom Remodeling and Improvement
Tips and Tidbits
Remodeling the Bathroom
Much like kitchens, recent trends are toward lavish and spacious baths. The two-bathroom home has become a standard and it's growing to the 2 1/2 bath                   levels. Adding a second bath to                   a home may not return its full value, but it eliminates a major obstacle if you ever decide to sell your home.                   Why? Because                   buyers will be comparing your bath features to the ones present in new                   construction -- this includes a comparison of all fixtures,                   lighting, tile AND separate bath and shower areas. Because of the high cost of                   tearing out old fixtures and installing new ones, consider doing some of the work yourself. Tasteful decorating and a                   wise choice of fixtures will also add to the general value of your home without costing a small fortune. Whenever possible, consider adding                   a bathroom to the master bedroom if it does not already have one.  And always... always replace shower curtains with a glass                   shower enclosure!
Appraisers Can Tell You How Much                   Bathroom Remodeling You Can Do and How Much of that Costs You                   are Likely to Get Back if You Sell 
Before moving forward, confirm that the appraised value of the property matches the selling price and supports any                   major bathroom remodeling costs -- if you plan to stay for at least 5                   years, this is not as big an issue. And                   how does one determine "fair price"?  Generally, the fair price is one that satisfies both the needs of the selling party and                   of the                   buyer. As the buyer or the seller, you will want to bring to the                   table as possible. Although subjective, a reasonable and fair price can be calculated by professional home                   appraisers . 
Fact: Consumer marketing experts have long known the power of color and                       texture to influence the moods and perceptions of the buying public. That's why so many plain products are                       sold in fancy packaging.  And, you have to count on buyers                       analyzing your bathroom in detail.
The proper use of paint on a house, in the first 5 minutes, influence a potential buyer to buy your home.                       Especially true in a bathroom -- the 60s style wallpapers                       must go!
Painting a House (including the                   kitchen and bathroom)  Inside and Out - colors... colors... colors... 
Painting a house is critical! This is what a fresh paint does and why:
Makes the home appear clean and fresh 
Eliminates "old house" odors (especially in the                     bath)
Cover patches and imperfections in walls
Makes a room addition appear larger and brighter

Room or Bath Additions - Worth the Investment, but be Carefull
If the addition adds a much-needed                   bathroom or bedroom, it can add significantly to the value of the house. Just DO NOT overbuild for                   the neighborhood. Your addition could make your home the                   finest in the neighborhood, but then you start to lose the                   ability to recover remodeling costs. Sometimes a better choice is to open up                   the existing space by knocking out walls. Consult with a knowledgeable and professional contractor before attempting this                   conversion yourself because walls are load-bearing and                   plumbing cannot be easily moved.
Can Remodeling Costs be Estimated?
Starting right into your first remodeling project without a                   decent estimate of the costs could spell financial disaster. The                   biggest reason for failed renovation                   projects is poor estimating. Even many professional contractors                   fail to complete even a rudimentary estimate of                    the costs associated with a given project. Why is that? Because estimating is time consuming and requires a good knowledge of                   construction and accounting. Plus, it's just a bad habit even                   some professionals have developed.
Estimating a remodeling project properly can be a real                   challenge -- many necessary repairs may be hidden behind walls                   (plumbing) and floors. So, first inspect your project                   carefully using some type of checklist -- one can be generally                   be freely obtained from home inspectors. If                   you are remodeling a room such as the bath, you will need to make a checklist of each item you intend to                   replace. Don't forget the fixtures and plumbing upgrades. 
If you are working with a professional remodeling contractor                   (and on bathrooms you should be), that person should complete                   what's called a takeoff before bidding the job. All contractors                   generally include a "hidden costs clause" in their                   contracts to insure them against unexpected problems that may be invisible until the project is started. Examine this clause carefully to make sure that it can't be used to tack on additional                   bonuses for them and expenses for you.
Working with Remodeling Contractors
General contractors serve as managers of projects and hires                   all the other subcontractors and skilled labor used on the job. If you decide to hire and control the                   subcontractors on your own remodeling project, you become the remodeling contractor (with all the                   responsibilities and liabilities associated with that                   function).
One other factor... With complex renovations, such as adding rooms,                   replacing major fixtures such as tubs or major structural                   changes the expertise of professional remodeling contractors                   will be a blessing. 
and FINALLY...
Living with the Remodeling Project                   Nightmare -- Projects never perfectly and as smoothly as expected. They invariably encounter delays -- plan for this and                   prepare to live with it!                   Regardless of who does the work, you or a professional, remodeling                   while you occupy a home can be challenging                   and even dangerous. Expect lots of dirt, sawdust, interruptions of electrical and water                   services, loud noises and general inconvenience. Use the following                   guidelines to get ready:
Consider having children to sleep over with neighbors during the most intense part of the job.                     Put the dogs away -- they make subcontractors nervous and                     slow them down.
Cover all furniture fully and heavily.
Seal off the unaffected parts of the house plastic drapes. This will                     eliminate much of the construction dust getting into the rest of                     your house. 
Cover floors and walk paths with strips of vinyl carpet                     protector -- make sure it can take the traffic.
Arrange with neighbors to occasionally use their water                     and electrical facilities if yours have to be turned off.
