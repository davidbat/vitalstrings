<quoted text> ANSWER: There is a program called voluum pricing where as you must purchase at least $3,500.00 per purchase. A customer agreement is then done with all the items you wish to purchase on it then it is submitted to the bid room in Atlanta and a contract specialist will then look at the bid and return the bid back to the store with pricing at that time the District and Store manager must approve the bid then it is given back to the associate who created the bid for markdowns as these vary de[pending on product the price can be from 1% to 13% off depending on products.
As a wholly owned national company with 3 divisions and offices in CA., N.Y., WI., and MI., our purchases are usually in small quantities, but we may purchase at 10 different stores in 6 different states. We also do not have time to wait for your bid room process. Our experience with your out of stock products, bad service, and uncompetitive pricing has lead to my decision to forbid our crews to purchase home depot the closing of our corporate charge account. We are in process of negotiating corporate purchasing agreements with Lowes and Mennards as well as local lumber yards and hardware suppliers. We were a reasonably large customer since 1986 and enjoyed our relationship until the last 5 or 6 years, then it reached this point; so good by and we don't expect to return as customers.
