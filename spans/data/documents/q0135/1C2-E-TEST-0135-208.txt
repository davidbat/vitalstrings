TPO Roofing Miami
This is the most applicable roofing choice for commercial flat roofing decisions.   The safety of your business’s foundation and everything in it will be securely protected from water damage of all sorts thanks to its minimal shrinkage qualities which result in a superiorly water-tight roof.  The light weight material that TPO roofing is made out of, along with minimal seams thanks to rather large sheets, makes for a super easy implementation. Whether you are constructing a new location for a thriving business or simply doing repairs on your existing one, the easier and more cost efficient the better and that is exactly what TPO roofing offers. Quality is not sacrificed in the slightest as the durable nature of this commercial flat roofing will stay well protected from tears, wind-uplift, and punctures.
PVC Roofing Miami FL
Widely used in the commercial business roofing market, PVC roofing offers a strong and affordable roofing solution with extras. The extra flexibility of PVC makes for an easy fit for buildings with odd shapes.  This not only makes the installation easier but ensures a more snug fit for your roof, lessening the potential for damage and intrusion by the elements.   Like TPO, PVC roofing has larger slabs and fewer joints, resulting in a reduced potential for leakage in the future along.  This also helps make the installation easier on workers and contractors alike. The strongest roofing option, you will almost never have to repair your roof when you get PVC roofing, and even if you do they are cheap and easy to finish.
Miami Florida EPDM Roofing
Even more versatile and flexible than PVC, EPDM commercial flat roofing can fit on virtually any structure you want to place it on.  This is ideal because it ensures that you get top-quality protection with an easy installation at a great price, making everything about the construction or reparation process simpler.  Adding to the easiness is the light weight quality of the material itself!  When you use EPDM roofing you, your patrons, employees, merchandise, and your commercial building itself will be more than well protected for a very long time thanks to extreme resistance against tears and other typical roofing damages as well as superior protection from water intrusions.
