There is an old saying that a carpenter is only as good as  his tools. That’s not just true for carpenters. It’s true for mechanics. It’s  true for                      metal workers. It’s true for people who do simple, routine jobs around  the house. It’s true for artists. If you rely on hand tools , whether it's a                       hammer, a screwdriver, an electric drill, an air tool, a wrench, or a rotary  tool, then you need to find the very best tools you can. Of course, there’s                       always a balancing act between best and affordable. Many people can’t afford to  step out of their budget, especially if they are only given a small fund                      for  important items. We understand that.
