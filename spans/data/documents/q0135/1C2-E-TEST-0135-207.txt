Be careful of other "companies" without locations offering jet ski tours of Miami.                 Almost always, companies using boat ramps for trailered skis do not have proper licensing, are not fully insured for all skis, do not train and certify staff, and do not properly maintain their skis. Saving $20 wont seem like such a bargain when you break down on the water, get a bad jet ski, or get hassled by police during your rental time (as these "companies" often do). Only rent from legitimate businesses with actual locations that provide premium services and skis, like American WaterSports!!!
