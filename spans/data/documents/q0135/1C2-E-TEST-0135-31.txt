Why Hire Miami Building Contractors to build your home?
As explained above, a new home offers several advantages over purchasing a used property.  However, presently there are some disadvantages to building a new home due to the downturn in real estate values that began in 2006.  The extraordinary decline in home prices have created opportunities for buyers to purchase a home for well below the properties replacement cost.  Consider a home that was built in 2005 and sold for $500,000.  Roughly 75% of a new homes price reflects the land and construction costs.  In spite of the land and construction costs equating to $375,000 some recently built homes are selling for 50% or more off of the peak prices.  At a 50% discount the sample would sell for $250,000 representing a $125,000 discount from the actual cost.  It would be impossible for any builder to replicate a comparable new home to the 50% discounted 2005 home and cover the costs. Certainly in this hypothetical case the used home is a superior value.  However, the supply of bargain homes is diminishing and as the economy recovers this scenario will disappear.  In fact this question and answer will likely to be deleted from the website in the not so distant future.
However even with the current real estate situation there are situations where building a home makes more sense.
Are there special circumstances that make building a new home a wise choice now?
•
Research has shown that if you own a home site, the best way to unlock the value in that property is to construction a home upon it.
•
If you already own a home site and you want to live at that location, a newly constructed home is necessary.
•
The recession has been very hard on the construction industry and the best trades and companies are the only survivors.
•
If you have special need, such as handicapped access, aging issues, proximity to work or schools or specific lifestyle issues a new home may offer the most economical and effective housing situation.
•
New homes typically appreciate at a faster rate than used houses, so your equity will accumulate more quickly.  This is particularly beneficial in a down real estate market.
