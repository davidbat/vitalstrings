When it comes to home remodeling it is sometimes recommended to hire a professional. A so called handyman is a   contractor to do small repair at your house. They have often soft skills in all areas of expertise. If it is coming   to a bigger project like remodeling a bathroom, roof or kitchen you should consider to hire a professional with   special expertise. This would be a plumber, roofer or kitchen remodeler. Most times they will charge you higher rates   but they often deliver better quality in shorter time. Handyman are usually payed by hour rate. The remodeling   industry is a billion dollar game. Several thousand people work in this industry.
