Three of the most popular types of insulation in Miami, FL homes are blown-in, rigid, and foam insulation.

Foam insulation is a lot like hair mousse. It is sprayed into a wall cavity and expands, forming a strong seal against the elements. Rigid insulation is hard, pre-formed foam. It functions much like foam insulation, but is more dense, and therefore more effective at insulating.
