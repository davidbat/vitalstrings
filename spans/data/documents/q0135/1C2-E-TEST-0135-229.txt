About Contractor’s License
We have licensed over 75,000 contractors in the last 35 years. Industry Schools provide “State Study Kits” for ALL Contractors Trades. These KITS include Study Manuals, Licensing Checklist, Applications, Practice Questions and Answers & Course Updates.
Our Home Study KITS contain all the applications, forms, course study manuals and the class lectures on DVDs and CDs that you will need to get your license. In addition, our study manuals contain hundreds and hundreds of current practice exam questions. Our KITs are packaged specifically for each student to insure they receive the most current documents and study materials.
Our editors continually update our study materials to meet the changes in State Laws, Codes and Trade Practices.
Our courses are focused on passing the State Exam the first time.
Our staff has over 35 years’ experience as a General and Specialty Contractor and is ready to answer any of your questions.
Our courses are current and created for California but have been used throughout the United States.
