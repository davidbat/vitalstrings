Miami
Although winters are pleasant, when you’re living in   Miami you’re faced with  sweltering heat in the summertime, and many   people spend hundreds of dollars on  their cooling bills just trying to   create a livable temperature in their  house.  Although residents of   Miami can cool their  house to reasonable temperatures, these   temperatures quickly rise because cool  air escapes from the house   through the walls due to poor insulation.  Whether they lack quality   insulation in their  walls or in their attic, they’re wasting money on   energy bills.  If your house in Miami is a number of years old, you   probably  need new insulation.
