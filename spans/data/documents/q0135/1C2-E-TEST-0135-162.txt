What are the best home remodeling projects to increase value?
Q.
A. Kitcken and baths are the best remodeling projects that will most likely bring an increase in value to your home.  Other projects that bring extra value (but not as quick of an increase as kitchens and baths) are additions, landscaping, new roofing, and enlarging rooms.    Not all remodel projects will bring an increase in value dollar for dollar and if you are doing the remodeling to increase the value if you are moving soon, build to what most people like, not what you like.  Update anything that can no longer be cleaned to perfection (countertops, faucets, sinks, etc).    If you are remodeling your home and plan to live there for awhile, build what you want for you and tailor the remodel to your wishes, not just potential value.  Good luck.

What flooring and trim goes nice with white walls?
Q. Im remodeling my apartment and my roommate chose white to paint the walls in our entry way and living room? i get to choose the carpet or flooring (hardwood, etc) and color of the trim, does anyone know what color of trim, and what type of floor would go nicely with the white walls?
A. Lucky you!  I'd rather be allowed to choose flooring and trim any day!  That's a keeper whereas paint can be changed.  As for what matched white walls, basically everything!  White is not a color in decorating, but the absense of all color and that is why you can match it with anything.  So, you can buy whatever pleases you!  Do keep in mind that the lighter the floor color, the larger the room will appear and the darker the floor color, the smaller the room will appear.  Also, lint, dust, etc., shows up more on dark floors.  What you choose to use as material for the floor really depends on your budget.  Hardwood floors are definitely the best for getting a return on your money.  If you can't afford that, then consider these types of flooring: - laminate wood floor - vinyl soft floor covering - bamboo flooring (my favorite, by the way!) - ceramic tile (did you know that you can get ceramic tile that looks soooo much lilke wood, you have to touch it to know the difference?  It's better than hardwood since it doesn't scratch and is very resistant!)  Will you be painting the trim or using natural wood?  If using natural wood, it is advisable to match the floor.  Enjoy!

What is the best method to install new vinyl flooring?
Q. I'm remodeling my kitchen. The orginal vinyl flooring is really ugly, but not really that bad shape. I want to put new vinyl flooring. What is the best method. I don't see the option of removing the old flooring but instead, putting the new floor on top of the existing. Should I just lay down 1/4 inch luan or is there a better, more professional method?
A. If its only 1 layer down, most manufactures ok it it to go over the existing as long as its in decent shape like you say. Yes the use of a luan or birch luan is the best way to go. The new glue will take to the pores of the wood the best.Filling in the seams w/ a special cement based filler and if theres any imperfections in the wood. I ve always have used Ardex but there are other names out there.  Any questions you can e mail me through my avatar.  GL

How to protect myself from a general contractor performing home remodeling?
Q. I am about to have a general contractor perform services for me (tile in kitchen, wood flooring, wallpaper removal).  He told me that there is no contract to sign, and that we both can sign the proposal he has given me to act as a contract.  I trust the guy, as a trustworthy friend of mine recommended him, but what do I need to do to protect myself?    Is there a simple contract I can draw up to ask him to sign?  Where can I find it?  Thank you.
A. I would tell him that you don't feel comfortable moving forward without a contract.  He should respect that and draw one up for you.  If not, then you may want to try to find a different contractor.  It may be find without one, but if problems arise, a contract might make things much easier to resolve.

What Fasteners Should I Use To Install Birch 5-ply Underlayment?
Q. I am remodeling my bathroom and decided to go with Loose Lay Sheet Vinyl Flooring, I have 3/4" subfloor and am going to install 1/4" 5-ply Birch Underlayment on top of this, however, I need a way to fasten this to the subfloor, I have seen Chisel Staples, Ring-Shank Nails, and Underlayment Screws.  My problem is deciding which to use, but also, I have been told that you do not want to have the fastener break through the subfloor, meaning I need a fastener < 1" long.  Assuming 3/4" is what I need, I cannot for the life of me find 3/4" nails or screws, but I would rather use these then staples.  Is there any way I can get 3/4" nails or screws for underlayment installation?
A. Underlayment is normally installed with staples. They are normally 1/4 inch wide and 3/4 to 1 1/4 inches long.   Directions call for a staple every six inches on the entire underlayment. These staples will shoot into the top layer of the underlayment.   Once fastened, floor leveler is used to fill the dents and joints of the underlayment. This is then sanded lightly to remove excess floor leveler, and make the surface smooth and ready to install the vinyl.   Screws or nails will work, but the finished product will look much better if staples are used according to the directions for the underlayment.

Remodeling basement, exterior walls and electrical circuit.?
Q. I am remodeling my basement.  The current exterior walls are 2x2 nailed to block and covered with sheetrock.  I plan to add a 2x4 'bumpout' against the old 2x2 along the entire exterior walls that will be 36" high.  The problem is if I do this the electrical wires in the the old boxes will not meet regulation of <=6" and <= 3" extending beyond the box.  Can I abandon the old 15a electrical circuit (disconnect) and run a new circuit though the bumpout and new boxes I will install or can I not run electrical circuits through a partial wall?
A. As long as you plan to abandon the old, go ahead and wire up the new. Its fine.
