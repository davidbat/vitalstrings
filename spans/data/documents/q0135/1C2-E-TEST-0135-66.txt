This company is by all means super. They built my tiki, 23 x 17 over the Thanksgiving holidays. They showed up on time, on the day they said they would and worked non stop. They not only build a quality tiki, they are neat and tidy to boot. Vicki was easy to work with and her word is truly her bond. I would recommend this company to everyone. If you would like to speak with me call Vicki and she will give you my number. Thanks again for a wonderful job.  Debby
