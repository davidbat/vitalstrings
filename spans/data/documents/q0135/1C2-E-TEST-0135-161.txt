What flooring and trim goes nice with white walls?
Q. Im remodeling my apartment and my roommate chose white to paint the walls in our entry way and living room? i get to choose the carpet or flooring (hardwood, etc) and color of the trim, does anyone know what color of trim, and what type of floor would go nicely with the white walls?
A. Lucky you!  I'd rather be allowed to choose flooring and trim any day!  That's a keeper whereas paint can be changed.  As for what matched white walls, basically everything!  White is not a color in decorating, but the absense of all color and that is why you can match it with anything.  So, you can buy whatever pleases you!  Do keep in mind that the lighter the floor color, the larger the room will appear and the darker the floor color, the smaller the room will appear.  Also, lint, dust, etc., shows up more on dark floors.  What you choose to use as material for the floor really depends on your budget.  Hardwood floors are definitely the best for getting a return on your money.  If you can't afford that, then consider these types of flooring: - laminate wood floor - vinyl soft floor covering - bamboo flooring (my favorite, by the way!) - ceramic tile (did you know that you can get ceramic tile that looks soooo much lilke wood, you have to touch it to know the difference?  It's better than hardwood since it doesn't scratch and is very resistant!)  Will you be painting the trim or using natural wood?  If using natural wood, it is advisable to match the floor.  Enjoy!

What is the appropriate flooring that need to be in place beneath porcelain tiles?
Q. I am set to install porcelain tile flooring in a bathroom where the house currently has carpet.  Provided it is in good condition (which I am assuming it is), is it OK to install the porcelain directly on the floor?  Do I need to prepare the floor?  If anyone has any pointers, I would appreciate it!  Thanks!
A. First things first..  Is the floor concrete or wood?   If it is concrete:  Take up the old carpet, pad and tackstrip. Scrape and clean the floor. Check the concrete for any cracks and prepare them with a good crack supression system ( I recommend Protecto Wrap ). After this you are ready to install the ceramic.  If the floor is wood: Follow the above with the added steps of a sturdy cement type backerboard, Wonderboard, HardiBacker or DurRock are just a few name brands. Wood floors need  this in order to reduce the flex felt in a wood floor.  I have known some installers to nail/screw this down without thinsetting ( tile morter) it down with good results. The correct way is to thinset the board down and then nail/screw it. The reason for this is to bond the board to the floor to reduce movement and thereby reducing cracks in the grout and tiles themselves.  I hope this helps, Good Luck.

What is the best kitchen flooring for a home with a very slobbery dog?
Q. My dog slobbers a lot on the kitchen floor when we are out. We come home to lots of very watery slobber on the floor. Our current linoleum flooring is old and needs replacement. I would like something in style but it needs to withstand the slobber. Thanks for any suggestions.
A. I would say basic tile. You know, the foot by foot squares? They're very much in style and they don't get ruined by water or anything. You can easily just come home and get a towel and wipe it up! Simple as that.  Good luck!

Need help finding a good flooring company to install floors in Southern California?
Q. We just bought a new home in Rancho Cucamonga and we're trying to find a good flooring company to do the entire house for us.  Carpets upstairs, hardwood floors downstairs, with tile in the bathrooms.  We've stopped by a few stores but something just didn't feel right with each of them.  Any suggestions or past experiences would greatly help.  Thanks in advance.
A. Try Service Magic in your area by going to their website and putting in a job order.  All of their contractors are pre-screened, legal, liscensed, bonded and insured.  They will come out and give you estimates of both labor and a time schedule.  They will have 3 different contractors give you estimates so you have instant comparision.  In my experience, they are fair and honest contractors and with Service Magic behind them, their work is guaranteed.  Once you get their estimates, you can verify real customer experiences on kudzu.com for added peace of mind.

Flooring Question: What flooring should I use for an entry way?
Q. My living room is going to be laminate wood flooring, but I am thinking of using another surface for the entry area, to create a sort of mudroom space. What flooring should I use? I want something very durable because the kids run in and out with sand and mud. Slate? The style of the house is rustic, so the polished or modern look wouldn't fit. Thanks for your input! If you reply tile or slate, what about the grout? I hate the way old, dirty grout looks. Are there any alternatives????
A. Ceramic tile will last forever if done correctly...     At least 3/4" marine plywood screwed down well, two layers if area will allow it, then cementboard screwed down to that.  Fill all screw holes with floor patch, also level corners or uneven spots with "floor patch and level".  Be sure to use good quality adhesive, and use spacers for even grouting.  Use good quality grout and apply it maticulously, then seal it.  If any steps are skipped you may get a loosened or broken tile through the years, and you basically have to rip up the whole thing to fix one spot.  But a job well done will last decades!    Good luck  :-)

What flooring is best for my kitchen and bathrooms?
Q. I wanted to replace the ceramic tile in my bathrooms, dining room and kitchen with travertine marble.  Someone told me that travertine would be a bad choice since it can stain easily.   I donâ€™t want a ceramic tile that looks cheap. I want something that looks really nice.   Can I find a ceramic tile that looks good, maybe even resembles natural stone?  What is the best flooring for my house? What do you suggest?
A. Sheet linoleum .   I put in kitchen, breadkfast room, downstairs.. it looks like slate, even has a depression in it to simulate the group line BUT no grout to try to keep clean.   Armstrong makes good stuff, but I'm sure there are many other manufacturers out there.  The secret is getting an installer who knows what they are doing it is worth the price

We would like to put anything but carpet. Would you reccomend wood or bamboo flooring? Are either of these better when it comes to slipping and sliding around?  Thanks!

Cork flooring would be a great option to consider..... see the following page for more info: http://www.building-your-green-home.com/natural-cork-floor.html  Bamboo and wood are also good options.

Tile Flooring
Tile offers a combination of strength, sturdiness, durability and practicality that is unmatched among flooring materials.  It's easy to clean with simple soap and water doing the trick, and this makes it perfect for areas like kitchens where there may be food and liquid spills, or hall ways and stairs, where there is a lot of dirt coming into the house from outside. Tile harbors no dust mites, pollen, mold and mildew that can cause allergic reactions in family members. It's easy to install, and this combined with its relatively affordable cost and low maintenance expenses make tile flooring one of the most cost effective flooring options. The range of designs, colors, textures and sizes is mind-boggling, allowing you the freedom to experiment with different combinations of textures and colors for different rooms in the house.
Tile flooring can come in a staggering number of sizes, colors and shapes besides textures, polishes and finishes. Costs can range from the most affordable basic ceramic tiles, to the high gloss of granite tiles. Ceramic tiles are sturdy, and very easy to take care of. This makes them perfect for kitchens and bathrooms, where cleaning is heavy duty. They are also resistant to mold and mildew.  Mexican tiles are beautifully rustic, and are very popular in the south western part of the US. Exclusive marble flooring now comes in the form of easy to install marble tiles that can be combined in varying sizes and shapes to add an interesting touch that was impossible earlier with solid marble flooring. If you are looking for a high gloss flooring that can last for the life time of your house, look towards granite tiles. Their incredible hardness makes them ideal for kitchens and other areas where traffic is heavy, without fading, staining or wearing out.
The beauty of a floor is reflected by the quality of the installation. Hire only a qualified and licensed floor installer to lay out your new floors. We give the control of selecting an accomplished flooring contractor back in your hands.
