Has anyone had any success iliminating the smell from fire damage in their home?
Q. I am considering buying a house with fire damage.  I would have to take out a loan on the restoration.  Just speaking specifically of the smell, is there anyone who was able to get it out?  I know there are ozone treatments and different types of shellac and primers that can be put on.  Did any of it work for you?  Ps..  ALL of the drywall and flooring is going to be removed with the restoration.
A. I used to do this ALL the time. I GUARANTEE the following WILL work.  Simply blast, with Baking soda (or Soda Blasting as it is called), any remaining structure after you remove all wall and ceiling board/material(s).    Use the same method you would for sand blasting. Rent a machine, purchase the baking soda (they also offer a rough soda) and have a ball.  For nooks, crannies, Foundation and other unreachable areas, use a good Primer/Sealer (such as Bin Zisser) to complete the job.

Help! Condo owner needs advice. Negligent/filthy neighbor with extensive water damage and rat infestation!?
Q. I own a condo/town home.  I noticed water was puddling in my kitchen from under the baseboard of the wall that adjoins my neighbor. I called a plumber out to be sure it wasn't an issue in my unit.  Couldn't find anything here.  Noticed that the next door neighbor's patio area had a lot of collected water and also mold on the exterior siding.  Also noticed what looked like water coming down the window from inside.  Rang the doorbell and knocked w/ no answer.  Noticed her car parked out front ( she only has one).  Got worried and called condo association but couldn't reach anyone since it's Saturday.  Got really worried after extensive knocking on neighbor's door and no answer.  Called cops.  Cops come out and enter home ( back door was unlocked).  Cops find home empty but are flabergasted at the state of affairs inside.  The entire upstairs bathroom floor had collapsed into the kitchen area with water pouring down walls-- entire dining room/kitchen area flooded.  Cops also mention extensive mold on walls and rats and roaches running around!!  Garbarge everywhere inside.  A complete nightmare.  The cops said the place needs to be condemned.  Finally talk to property management company who seems to think that it's okay to wait until Monday to do anything.  We have our plumber turn off the water outside.   A few hours later a water and fire damage restoration company shows up stating they received a call from the unit owner ( landlord).  The guy says the tenant has 'been out of town' and is supposed to be meeting him there.  We inform him of what is going on inside.  Tenant shows up in a cab and promptly tells us that she was unaware of any problem and has been out of town since Wednesday.  She also mentioned that the landlord was aware of the issue before the condo association called him??  How did he know if she didn't know?? It's obvious by the extensive damage inside that this has been an ongoing problem.  Not only that but what explains the filth, garbage, and rats?!   I need some good advice on what my next steps should be.  We are going to file a complaint at city hall and I will be contacting the owner and demanding that he pay for a full inspection of my unit as well as any necessary repairs.  I am worried about the health hazard and the potential damage to my structure!  Should I seek legal help?  Any advice is greatly appreciated.
A. Sounds like you have your bases covered already. Except you didn't mention contacting a lawyer.  This is the exact reason I am opposed to condos, but i do hope things work out for you.

I purchased a home & the seller did not disclose flood damage that occurred before I moved in. What can I do?
Q. I recently learned from the neighbors that days before I moved in that a fire/smoke restoration team was brought in to clean up water damage.  This information was not disclosed at closing.  What are my options?  I want the carpet replaced and a letter stating that the seller will be responsible for any future mold/mildew damage for the next ten years.  This was a brand new home when I moved in.
A. You need to confirm the accuracy of the neighbor's story and validate they aren't just running off at the mouth.  Probe the neighbor to find out the name of the team that performed the restoration - if so, contact the team and confirm with them that they actually performed work in the house.  If possible request something in writing.  Don't tell them you believe you've been deceived - keep it generic such as you're trying to make a file of the history of the house repairs in case you need it in the future.  If you tell them you might sue the seller the restoration team might be leary of helping for fear of becoming locked into a legal battle.  In Texas the consumer is protected under The Deceptive Trade Practices Act - I'm sure there's one in your area as well.  If the seller intentionally withheld this information you can file suit deeming false, misleading or a deceptive sale and sue for damages.  When you sue you are entitled to amounts up to three times the damage.  Advise the realtor that represented you of your new information and have them contact the selling realtor to see if a suitable agreement can be reached.  If the seller refuses to budge,  express your desire to pursue legal action.  At this point if it comes to this you must place in writing a notice to the seller telling them your findings and that you believe they have deceived you under the Deceptive Trade Act.  Let the seller know in writing if they don't agree to your terms or make suitable amends you will sue and be entitled to damages of up to three times the amount.  Typically once you write a letter expressing your intent to sue, deceptive sellers will try to make amends.
