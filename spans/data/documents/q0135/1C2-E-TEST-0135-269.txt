Pool Cleaners
In 1985, Westside Wholesale, Inc. opened its doors to the city of Los Angeles. Over the course of a few years, the company established itself as a legitimate Electrical Wholesale Distributor, focusing on serving electrical contractors. Westside Wholesale’s reputation for product availability, knowledgeable service, & great pricing became highly recognized, attributing to the company’s steady growth & success. As the company developed, Westside Wholesale gained the loyalty of customers beyond the Electrical industry.
In order to meet heavy customer demands, Westside Wholesale realized that they needed to expand into the Lighting Industry, which is now heavily interrelated with the Electrical Industry. After many years of continued success, the management at Westside Wholesale decided that they would not shy away from expanding into other related industries.
Due to the wide variety of products, Westside Wholesale was already serving installers & contractors amongst different fields. The company strategically broadened its marketing efforts to attract not only contractors & tradesman in the related fields; but also to development firms, management companies, designers, engineers, architects & other professionals who appreciate high quality products, superb service & highly competitive pricing.
The management at Westside Wholesale noticed the frustration of customers waiting in line at the will-call counter only to find out that the order cannot be completely fulfilled.
As a solution, Westside Wholesale offers a fully functional & easy to navigate website for its many loyal customers nationwide to eliminate that frustration and loss of time. WestsideWholesale.com enables customers to find exactly what they are seeking and to conveniently pay online by credit card without dealing with the hassle of "accounts receivable".
