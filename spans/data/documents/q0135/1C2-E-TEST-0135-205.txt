ABOUT THE MY SAFE FLORIDA HOME PROGRAM
Thank you for your interest in               the My Safe Florida Home               program.
In 2006, state lawmakers               took action and appropriated               $250 million to create the               My Safe Florida Home               program.  The program               was created to help               Floridians identify and make               improvements to strengthen               their homes against               hurricanes through free wind               inspections and grant funds. 
The Florida Legislature               directed the My Safe Florida               Home program to target its               resources to homeowners               living in single-family,               site-built homes in Florida               by providing up to 400,000               free wind inspections and at               least 35,000 grants to               eligible homeowners.  The program provided               inspections to more than               400,000 homeowners and retrofitted nearly 33,000               homes.
Due to budget               constraints, the program expired on June 30,               2009. 
If you have resources               available, we encourage you               to take steps to protect               yourself and your property               against hurricane damage.               The first step is pursuing a               wind inspection to identify               how you can strengthen your               home or determine if you are               eligible for discounts on               your wind insurance.
