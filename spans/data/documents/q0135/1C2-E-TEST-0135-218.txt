Real Life Answers About Contractors Insurance
What A Miami County Contractor Needs To Know
As an artisan contractor doing business locally here in Miami County Kansas,                                          a number of insurance policies apply to your unique insurance risks and exposures.                                           This page provides a basic overview of the major coverages and policy forms and how they need to be incorporated into your Kansas Contractors Insurance Program.
Contractor's General Liability Insurance
General liability insurance is the backbone policy of the contracting industry.  General liability insurance                                          concerns itself with tort liability, and provides protection against financial loss arising out of lawsuit against your company from a covered loss. Part of the policy provides defense coverage. If your contracting company is sued for a covered claim, your insurance company will defend you.
As a contractor, one part of the policy that you will use just by the very nature of                                          your business is "Products & Completed Operations".  You may or may not have                                          coverage currently, but, as a contractor, you have a "Completed Operations" exposure.
Let's say you build a new deck on my house in Miami County Kansas in                                          September of 2012.  The project goes as planned and you move on to your next project and so on for years to come.                                           In August of 2013 we are having a party and the deck                                         collapses.  All the guests are hurt and the damage was due to your negligence.   A couple of things are now going to                                          happen. The injured guests are all going to be sending me certified mail                                          notifying me of their injuries.  Either right before or right after that,                                          I'll make my problem your problem when I send you the same certified mail.                                           There is coverage under "Products & Completed Operations", but which policy will pay? The one you had at the time you installed the deck or when the guests got injured?
The one that was in place when the guests got injured is the answer.                                           If you have coverage at the time, that insurance company will respond.  If you                                          have no coverage, you are on your own for the damage, the injuries and the cost to defend the lawsuits.
It Gets Worse If You Did The Work In Your Own Name
It gets even worse if you did the work in your own name. In that event, you are personally on the hook with all of your personal assets.
In my opinion, you have the wrong insurance agent if your agent doesn't explain to you about this problem while you are shopping for coverage. (It's called Discontinued operations and the huge liability that never goes away).
A general insurance agent may or may not pass this information along to you.  A Kansas contractor insurance specialist most certainly would.                                           Here in Miami County Kansas, ContractorsInsuranceKansasCity.com is the answer to all of your                                          contractor insurance questions and concerns.
Commercial Auto Insurance
The Second Component of a Miami County KS Contractors Insurance Program
As a Miami County Kansas artisan contractor, the next policy that many contractors need                                           is a commercial auto insurance policy or business auto insurance policy.
In insurance terms, this policy includes first-party coverage (you) and third-party (another person)                                          losses arising out of the contractor's ownership and use of cars, trucks, and trailers.
One of the key areas that start-up contractors sometimes try to blend together is                                         the use of their personal vehicle in their contracting business.  This is a                                          colossally bad idea. Many personal auto policies have an exclusion that strips away all coverage for Vans, Pickups, and Panel Trucks                                          carrying tools for use as a trade contractor or used in business.
Let's say you have a contracting business and keep your pickup truck on your                                          private passenger auto policy. You figure you will get around to switching it over later.                                           If there is an accident with serious                                          injury - the other driver is injured, you are injured, and both vehicles are damaged.                                           With a business auto policy, there is coverage within the correct policies for all of these losses.                                           With a personal auto policy - NO Coverage - the lawsuit that will follow is on you.                                           The damage to your vehicle and the other vehicle is on you. Your medical bills are on you.
"Don't risk what you can't afford to lose". You have set yourself up to lose everything when you don't properly insure your vehicle as part of your contractor's insurance program.                                          Insurance risk managers say their smartest clients spend pennies to protect dollars.  No matter whether you are                                         a start up artisan contractor or long established, you should heed this advice as part of your contractor's insurance package.                                          Insurance industry experts suggest that the business auto policy is probably the                                          largest exposure to loss that you have as a Miami County contractor.                                           Whether that is true or not, it is certainly close enough to debate.
The good news:  Contractor Insurance Specialists not only have many different companies to approach                                          with these types of risk, but they also know all the rating and coverage parameters to minimize your expense while maximizing your coverage.                                         Many insurance companies either create a "package" or will give substantial policy savings for combining your                                          Commercial Auto Policy with a Contractors Commercial General Liability Policy.
Workers Compensation Coverage
The Third Component of a Miami County KS Contractors Insurance Program
If an employee is injured in the line of their employment, workers comp is the exclusive remedy.                                          My agency receives calls from small contractors day after day asking if they need workers comp coverage.
The answer is simple - Yes.  There are options as to whether or not owners choose to be included or not, but                                          the short answer is that Workers Comp applies if an employee is injured in the course of their employment.
There are a number of cost saving measures that can be used to help reduce premiums, as well as industry                                          accepted practices to control claim frequency and claim severity.  Nobody wants an employee to be injured. Proactive                                          employers use every resource they can to protect their employees, as they are the company's lifeblood.
Contractors Workers Compensation coverage scares many insurance companies.  The reason is simple. The                                          frequency and the severity of the claims, but also workers comp claims are long tail claims.                                           There isn't a maximum for how long a worker's compensation claim can go or how much it can cost.                                           That whole idea terrifies the bean counters.
Don't Let An Uninformed Agent Cost You Thousands
The Answers is Easy For Miami County KS Contractors
Many agents will tell their clients that Workers Comp is Workers Comp and there is no difference.                                           That is completely wrong. Contractors Workers Compensation Insurance is expensive.  In no                                          line of insurance do you, the insured, share in the loss the way you do in Workers Compensation.                                           I have seen actuarial estimates that show that, on anything other than what insurance professionals call                                          a "shock loss" or large loss, you as the consumer are going to pay back                                         not only the cost of the claim, but probably 3-5 times the entire claim due to poor loss experience modification.                                           If an employee is injured in the line of their employment, workers compensation is the exclusive remedy.                                          My agency receives calls from small contractors day after day asking if they need                                          workers comp coverage.
The answer is simple - Yes. There are options as to whether or not                                          owners choose to be included or not, but the short answer is that                                          Workers Comp applies if an employee is injured in the course of their employment. sub-contractors, or seasonal or casual labor without the correct documentation, you will have                                          their payroll and exposure added to your workers compensation policy.  As an agency, we provide our contractors with a proprietary audit package to do everything possible to bulletproof your                                          contracting business from what - for other contractors - is an absolute nightmare.
Workers Compensation for Miami County Kansas can go a smooth, hassle free path with the proper knowledgeable and informed agent.
Increased Limits - An Umbrella or Excess Liability Policy is the Answer
If your business is that of an artisan contractor here in Miami County Kansas and are dealing with                                          General Contractors, Risk Managers, or state or local municipalities, chances are very good that                                          you will need to provide higher limits of liability.                                           It is not at all unusual that you would be required to provide $3 million worth of bodily injury                                          coverage or more - $5 million limits are not at all uncommon.
To achieve these limits, the insurance industry uses an Umbrella or Excess Liability policy.                                           An Umbrella policy provides excess or increased liability over your primary business policies, your                                          Commercial Auto, Employers Liability and Contractors Commercial General Liability policy
Umbrella policies are purchased in increments of $1 million. The insurance                                          company will quote a price per million and then give you the ability to increase your                                          liability coverage up to those required by contract.
Inland Marine Coverage - Miami County Kansas
Inland Marine policies cover your contractor's equipment - from something as simple as your hand                                          tools to larger equipment like backhoes, booms and cranes, skid steers, etc. Depending on how the insurance company files their product, this coverage can either be                                          added to your General Liability policy or standalone.  Given the examples, the norm would be that you would have your hand tools                                          "unscheduled". You would not have to enumerate each and every                                          tool but instead would take a limit of insurance - say $5,000 - with no                                          tool individual covered for more than $500.
When you get into larger equipment, you will move from unscheduled to scheduled coverage.                                         You and the insurance company will agree to a specific amount of coverage for each piece of                                          equipment.  For instance, 2008 Kubota Skid Steer Serial #4879452 with a value of $20,000 and a $500                                          deductible.
One of the benefits to this line of insurance is that it creates a package or multi line policy when                                          combined with your commercial general liability. Generally, this means that a credit will apply and                                          your premiums should be reduced.
Miami County Builder's Risk Insurance
Construction projects involve unique risks not covered by other insurance coverage forms.                                          Structures under construction are more likely to suffer damage from the elements - wind, rain, snow, hail etc. - than completed structures.                                           These structures are much more apt to sustain vandalism and theft of unsecured contents than an from                                          an existing structure.
Another issue that must be addressed with a builders risk policy is that the values change                                          dramatically throughout and do not remain stable as they would with an existing building.                                           For example, the value of the building as it is coming out of the ground is very                                          slight. As time progresses the value continues to                                          increase. Often the increase is well beyond the original contemplated value.
Another issue which the builders risk policy addresses that others don't address well is that during                                          the project, property to be used in the construction may be owned by many different parties.                                          The general contractor, subcontractors, and the owner. And, just to add to the issue, property can be                                          in transit, at the job site, or at off-site locations.
Miami County Employment Practices Liability Insurance
Employment practices lawsuits have become an accepted part of the workplace in America.  These                                          lawsuits are based on allegations of discrimination, sexual harassment, wrongful termination,                                          invasion of privacy, slander as well as a host of others.
The truth is insurance companies lose these lawsuits with alarming frequency and the financial hits are beyond steep.                                           Currently, the average plaintiff's verdict in employment practices lawsuits exceeds $250,000 with 15% of                                          all verdicts breaking the $1 million barrier.
A good chance of losing with huge dollars at risk is a perfect storm for financial disaster as well as                                          people chasing this and, in reality, your participation in their pursuit of the pot of gold.                                         Contractors' unique business model compounds this problem with the use of temporary and seasonal                                          workers, lack of centralized managerial control and less formalized control on harassment and                                          discrimination.
As a professional contractors' insurance specialist, I can tell you without hesitation this is an                                          area many insurance agents aren't telling their contracting clients about.  As the economy flip flops                                          this makes for far more disgruntled employees or, worse yet, former employees.
Simply put, if you decide to self insure this risk that is certainly your option. Our job is to                                          present you with your options and provide you with ability to make the most informed decision possible.                                         More bluntly put, this is one area where many contractors have a bright "bulls-eye painted on your                                          back". If your agent isn't talking to you about the real world issues - find another                                          agent - one who specializes in protecting businesses like yours.
