Kitchen remodeling design involves not just going over different looks for cabinets and countertops, but also trying to come up with a unified kitchen style that reflects your taste and your goals for function.

The specifics of design such as the coordination of the colors and materials of the countertops, cabinets, paint and flooring all need to be looked at with at least some thought down the road.
Whether you are interested in a modern or a classic design, consider what is cost effective to replace and what has a more expensive price. For example, if you want a wild paint color or some contemporary curtains, that is must cheaper to change than if you want a bold tile floor or unusual colored appliances. This has more or less importance depending on your plans. If you are primarily interested in a remodeling your kitchen for resale, than you will want to choose neutral and basic colors and design elements. If you plan to stay in your home for many years to come and simply want your kitchen remodel to meet your specific needs and style, than go ahead and lay those purple floor tiles that you love.
