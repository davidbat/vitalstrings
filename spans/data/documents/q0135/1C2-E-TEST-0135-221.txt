Week in Review
Message from Mayor Gimenez:
In honor of Independence Day, let us remember all of the men and women in uniform at home and abroad, who defend and protect our freedom and way of life. Whether you are spending time with family and friends, organizing a barbecue or watching fireworks , may you have a safe and enjoyable 4th of July!
