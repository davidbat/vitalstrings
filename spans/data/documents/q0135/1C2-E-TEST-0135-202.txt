Install Metal Siding
Install Metal Siding '
Residential metal roofing is quickly becoming the popular choice for homes in Okaloosa County, Florida. Although it can be costly to install initially, it looks beautiful and has a 50-year average warranty.
Metal siding can be designed to look like other types of siding. For instance, from the ground you can't tell a simulated cedar-shake metal roof from a real cedar one. If you prefer an elegant tile look, choose a steel roof that uses special paint processes. Real earth tone granules are placed on the final paint coat, which is then covered with a super-durable clear coat.
Metal siding has safety advantages as well – it doesn’t burn - and your insurance company may offer a discount for having it. Beyond that, metal siding reduces heat gain in the summer and in warm climates by 34 percent, according to the Solar Energy Center. That translates into big savings in air-conditioning costs.
