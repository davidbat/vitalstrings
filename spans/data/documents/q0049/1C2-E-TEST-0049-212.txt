Obesity Watch: Millions Wasted To Bring Fresh Produce To Poor Areas
One Country, One People, One Flag, One Destiny!
“The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and  conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies, all who question its  methods or throw light upon its crimes.
As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money powers of the country will endeavor to prolong it’s reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.
