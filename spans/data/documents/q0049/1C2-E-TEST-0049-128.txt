PHOENIX -- Tea party supporters voting in a straw poll at a national summit favor conservative Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Georgia radio host Herman Cain for president in 2012.
Cain won 22 percent support from the audience in Phoenix at the summit organized by the Tea Party Patriots. He was followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Paul among those casting ballots in person.
Paul had the most votes overall, thanks to a swell of support from online voters. Between the two sets of results, there were about 1,600 votes. Paul gathered more than one-third of them.
Pawlenty and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin each had 9 percent overall. Cain, Paul and Pawlenty were the only three to speak at the three-day summit.
