It was Ron Paul’s message which people felt with such compassion that lead to people organizing groups to get together and spread the message (the Tea Party).
On November 5, 2007, Guy Fawkes Day, supporters donated a total of $4.2 million. Then shortly after, on December 16th, 2007 they donated another $6.4 million. Which other candidate in existence has ever made that much from supporters alone with absolutely no help from corporations? This shows of the strength of Ron Paul’s message and of his integrity.
Unfortunately, the Tea Party has been partially hijacked by people whom don’t really support the message, but want to use the people that do to their benefit. Just keep an eye out for that and remember that the true members of the Tea Party support Ron Paul.
