Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul received the endorsement of a second Dubuque Tea Party co-founder Wednesday in the run-up to the grassroots organization’s first in-person 2012 presidential straw poll scheduled this evening.
Michael Heeren, a co-founder of the Dubuque Tea Party, commended Paul on his adherence to tea party values his announcement. Jeff Luecke, another group member, named Paul as his pick for the presidency in June.
“Ron Paul is a champion of the Constitution and has dedicated much of his life to restoring the United States by following the three core principles that we prescribe to in the Dubuque Tea Party,” Heeren said in a press release. “Dr. Paul believes in fiscal responsibility, free markets and a Constitutionally-limited government.  Since 1976 in the U.S. House of Representatives, every single vote he has made, without exception, can be traced to these principles.”
Heeren, of Dubuque, is also a Dubuque County Republican Central Committee Member.
The Dubuque Tea Party was founded in April 2009 and includes about 500 members. The first in-person Dubuque Tea Party straw poll will be held tonight at the Dubuque Best Western Plus, 3100 Dodge St.
