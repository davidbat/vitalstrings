4 million raised. Sounds a little disappointing, but wait!
4 million raised, on top of the half that the campaign asked for the week prior, and on top of all the money we have been spending on brochures, and on top of all the increasing daily donations from all the support he is getting in the polls.
The moneybomb itself may not have been the biggest ever, but the total funds going in to the campaign must be huge! 4 million on top of all the other stuff we've been doing!
I can't wait for the end of the quarter to find out how we really did in fundraising! I hope they can release the numbers before Iowa!
