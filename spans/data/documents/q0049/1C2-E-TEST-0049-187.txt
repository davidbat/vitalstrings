The national Tea Party Patriots convention or “Policy Summit” occurred this past weekend at the Phoenix Convention Center.
Here’s a snippet from Reuters:
Rep. Ron Paul and Georgia businessman Herman Cain were conservative Tea Party activists’ top picks to run against Barack Obama for president in 2012, leaving former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in third place (click here for whole article).
“In a ‘presidential straw poll’ of nearly 1,600 conservative members of the Tea Party Patriots released on Sunday, 581 voted for U.S. Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, to run against Obama next year
“Herman Cain, a Georgia businessman and talk-radio host, came in second with 256 votes.
“Palin, a favorite of the conservative movement who was Senator John McCain’s running mate against Obama in 2008, trailed in a distant third place with 149 votes.
“‘Mr. Cain and Rep. Paul’s positions resonated with Tea Party Patriots this weekend,’ said Mark Meckler, the Tea Party Patriots’ national coordinator, of the poll taken at the group’s policy summit in Phoenix over the weekend and online.”
