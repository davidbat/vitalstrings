Mitt Romney may have won over New Hampshire Tea Party members, but the jury’s still out on whether he can bring over disaffected Ron Paul supporters, according to this week’s Red Granite survey of influential conservatives.
In all, 103 Republicans from New Hampshire were asked using an automated survey tool whether they think Romney – who is visiting the state today – has gained the support of Ron Paul backers in New Hampshire.
Fifty responses were collected.
Only 44 percent of those surveyed agreed that Romney has to some degree wrapped up the Paul supporters. Thirty-six percent said they somewhat agree, and 8 percent completely agreed. Meanwhile, 28 percent said they somewhat disagree, 12 completely disagree, and 16 percent are neutral. Several people responding to the survey suggested that Romney needs to work harder to win over Paul supporters.
“Pick a Ron Paul favorite as VP, and promise an administration spot to Ron Paul or his choice,” said one. .
Even after Romney’s overwhelming win in the New Hampshire Primary, many Tea Party members here said  they wouldn’t vote for him . But it appears that sentiment may be changing somewhat now that Romney is set to become the Republican nominee.
