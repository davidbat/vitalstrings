AUSTIN, Texas (AP)     Republican Presidential hopeful Ron Paul is teaming up with son Rand for what organizers promise will be a "massive" rally at the Texas Capitol.
The national Tea Party Express is sponsoring the event which also features Ted Cruz. Cruz is the tea party darling in a crowded field of Texas GOP candidates vying for their party's nomination to replace retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has joined his Texas congressman father frequently on the presidential campaign trail.
Texas holds its primary May 29 and the elder Paul drew thousands to another Austin rally at the University of Texas late last month.
He has attracted big crowds on college campuses in many states, but hasn't won any presidential caucuses or primaries.
