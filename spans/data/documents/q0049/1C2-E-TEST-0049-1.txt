The Next Moneybomb:
In It to Win It - April 15th, 2012
"It's not like I'm just trying to win and get elected, I'm trying to change the course of history." - Ron Paul, 2011
For more than 30 years Ron Paul has honored his oath to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic."
30 years of consistency and courage now comes down to a single day - Friday, December 16th. Will it be a historic day - the day we made clear that the supporters of Ron Paul will not being going gently into the Establishment's cold dark night, but that we will instead, stand together and fight.
Each and every one of us needs to donate whatever we can on Friday December 16th, so that Dr. Paul's campaign has enough money to break through the media blackout, deliver his message of Liberty directly to the people and WIN the GOP race. So please, pledge your support and help us promote what we expect to be "the money bomb heard 'round the world".
