Calling him the "singular defender of liberty" in the GOP field,Â about 30 leaders of Ohio tea party groups this week endorsed U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas for the Republican presidential nomination.
The leaders, stressing they were endorsing Paul as individuals and not on behalf of groups they represent, said in a press release they are "tired of typical Republican establishment candidates whosw rhetoric do not match their record."
Referring to Paul as a fighter "against big government in Washington for over 40 years," the tea party leaders said, "Ron Paul's record of fiscal discipline is unmatched. In 12 congressional terms he has never voted for a tax increase. He has never voted for an unbalanced budget. He has never voted for a bailout. He has never voted for raising the debt ceiling."
Among prominent signers of the release endorsing Paul: Joe Bozzi, co-founder of the Ohio Freedom Alliance and Ohio Liberty Council; Maurice Thompson, executive director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law; and Chris Littleton, co-founder, Ohio Liberty Council and board member of the Cincinnati Tea Party.
