How is the onsite audience developed for these debates?  How are they chosen or how does one get tickets?  I’d be interested in knowing if these straw crowds, or first come first serve.  Last debate there was applause related to Rick Perry overseeing, as governor, over 200 executions.

Overreacting a bit don’t you think? A handpicked group of neoconservative morons presented to us as mainstraem “teapartiers” is not representative of the nation. Not only is Dr. Paul’s the prevailing view according to most major polls, the peace candidate has won every single presidential election in history. The war Presidents always find a reason to go to war AFTER running on a peace platform. FDR was in fact a peace candidate.

 Please, do not confuse Americans with the BULLSHIT that the Media presents as the “truth”.  I know it seems so hopeless, but when this debate is fixed, the questions fixed, seating chart is fixed, the crowd is planted, the camera angles are on purpose, the commentary is biased, the candidates are shams, and we are supposed to believe this is AMERICA.
Wrong.  I think there are many more of us then we think.  This is 1984, and we are deep inside the police state.

If the truth wasn’t welcome, then Dr. Paul would not be rising in the polls. Truth is not welcome among the establishment. But the people in general welcome it when they are allowed to hear it.

Proving once again that the tea party is terminally stupid.   Like children, they can’t handle the truth.  The  statements of Mohamed Atta and Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Bin Laden himself all indicated that our support of Israel’s brutal policies was a primary motive in attacking us.  
You really have to be stupid, as stupid as  George Bush or Joe Biden, who just yesterday said they attacked us to end our way of life(!) when all the facts point to our foreign policies as their primary motivation.  The 9-11 Commission came to the same conclusion.

 If so,  the attack was a raging success, because with the Patriot Act, and declaration of a “State of Emergency”, giving the President powers of a dictator,  we lost all those freedoms.  The  ” State of Emergency” has been renewed every year since 911 by the way, but I am sure you know that Bamboo.

Retards want government intrusion into personal lives but not economic lives. Libertarians don’t want government, and any Libertarian who tells you they do want government, frankly, don’t know the meaning of the word. As for any Libertarian running for preznit, it’s sort of impossible given that the Constitution is hardly a libertarian document, and, as such, no Libertarian could ever take the oath of office.

Most R. candidates are completely ignorant isolationists.  If they would have travel abroad, even to Mexico, and talked to real people, not the elitist politicians, they would know that most people around the world are not much different from ourselves.  Most people just want to live their lives with some dignity and some basic freedom to do what they need to do to survive.  For politicians to say that terrorists hate us because of our “freedom” would logically assume that terrorists know first hand how we live, what our laws are, how people can and cannot express themselves in public in our country and so on.  In short, they would all have to come and live here to know how we live so they can truly “hate” our way of life.  The only alternative for people to believe in something without witnessing it themselves is for them to believe blindly in someone else’s perception of reality, which is the same as being indoctrinated into a belief —sort of what these politicians are doing.—

The core of the Republican “base” are brainwashed and nothing anyone says or does will get through to them.  This base is comprised of people who experience more feelings of fear & vulnerability than do progressive-leaning voters.  That is why they abhor change.  It frightens them.   This biological condition has been exploited by Fox News, Rush, Beck, and other right-wing pundits.  Big oil & gas, the military industrial complex, big pharma, etc. fund think tanks that publish “research” papers which corroborate the propaganda.  Everyone involved – except the American people and people of other nations who also suffer from right-wing policies – makes out great.   The right would have no power if the truth was known.  That is why there is BIG money in obfuscation!  Just ask Andrew Breitbart and James O’Keefe.

Iran has a population of 75 million people while Iraq has a population of 31 million people. Given the neo-cons propensity for doing everything half-assed or making completely, pathologically bad decisions (such as firing 400,000 Iraqi army personnel after blowing up the country thereby mandating a future insurgency).
Bad decisions in Iraq made by fantasist arm chair Generals that all neo-cons aspire to be:
1. Lying about WMDs and committing THE war crime of invading Iraq in the first place.
2. Using an inadequate amount of military personnel to secure the country.
3. Not securing weapons bunkers in Iraq, yet securing oil facilities.
4. The above mentioned firing of 400,000 Iraqi army personnel.
5. Firing all Baathist party members who actually knew how to run Iraq instead of slowly replacing them through elections and attrition.
6. Hiring the wrong people to rebuild Iraq… though it benefited their wallets immensely.
7. The list could go on about what failures these people are.
Now, to go to war with Iran? When we would have to use an unsecured rear area like Iraq to ship our supplies through? Trying to occupy a land area three times larger holding a population 2.5 times the size of Iraq? When in Iraq it took seven years to reasonably ‘stabilise’ the country? When Afghanistan is nowhere near being solved after ten years of war?
Sheer insanity. And f*cking stupidity on the part of neo-cons. For them, war is a business and business needs to be good. They will make their war-business good even if they have to manufacture wars.

Ron Paul did not mention that Osama’s plan also included luring us into an intractable occupation that the Soviets had tried before… an occupation that eventually helped bankrupt the Soviet empire. That Osama did not envision how wildly successful he thought he would be when the US went into Iraq to further his vision of bankrupting the US.
How is the economy and deficits doing, America?
Bush and the neo-cons were led by the nose by Osama Bin Laden into doing exactly what he wanted. And then some. Sure, he was killed. But look at the sorry state of America now, in doing so. He succeeded beyond his wildest imaginings thanks to neo-conservatives and Republicans.

That abouts sums it up. Also…
The more one tries to convince them of the truth, the more the feel personally threatened and vindicated that their fantasies are in, reality, quite true. That then leads to them viewing you as the enemy who must be destroyed or negated. Possibly even being viewed as a greater existential threat than others.

If they believe that it’s because we were “free”, then they must admit that it was a very effective attack, as our constitution has been ignored as historic fiction since the Patriot (Fascist America) Act. We now live in a police state. You can’t even fly to the next state without some child molester with a TSA badge feeling up your junk. The USPS monitors your mail (as evidenced by them notifying police about a grandma buying grow lights, resulting in a SWAT raid finding tomato plants), the NSA, CIA, and FBI all have computers monitoring our phone calls, they can even monitor your reading habits at your local library.

OK guys, this America, she has freedom and even though we can not feed our own troops, we must stop this freedom thing going on, on the other side of the world. So to stop this freedom, that does not effect us in anyway. We will sacrifice 20 of our brightest martyrs  and blow up some buildings in a country that 90% of us have never even seen in print.

Jesus was not set up on false charges by ROMANS.  The ROMANS didnt give the traitor 30 coins to point Jesus out.  The ROMANS didnt shout for a known criminal to be released instead of Jesus.  The ROMANS didnt spit and humiliate Jesus as he struggled to the punishment hill. 
The Romans only carried out the sentance on an innocent man, that the Romans tried in every way possible to get out of.  In other words…the ROMANS caved in to a political decision to save themselves from the fall out whipped up the puppet leadership of Jeruselem.

Ron Paul is absolutely correct in his statements regarding Al Qaeda. He did leave out one other important factor, that being our withdrawl of support for Afghanistan after the Russians were booted out, creating a power vacuum filled by the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The movie “Charley Wilson’s War” points this out and it is one of the worst diplomatic blunders of all time. The root cause of all of our problems in the ME is OIL, someone else’s oil, and we continue to prop up the most repressive regime of all in Saudi Arabia. We could most likely pay $500/bbl for oil and it would be far cheaper than supporting our military presence there. Nearly $4,000,000,000,000 and close to 5000 American lives later, we are still floundering about in the ME with no discernible positive results other than Halliburton, Blackwater and other private “security” companies getting filthy rich.

“CNN/Tea Party Republican debate”, the Tea Party gets top billing
The first sentence is the perfect frame for a Obama re-election, label the Repub. nomination winner the Tea Party candidate, winner of the Tea Party primaries and debates, never mention them as a Repub.  Tea Party, Tea Party, Tea Party all the way back to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  It will be the truth too, this Repub candidate will be the Tea Party candidate as all those running for the nomination are wholly catering to the Tea Party line/base.
Now don’t mistake me for some Obamabot, I am most certainly not, but I do spot a weakness for the R’s and strength for the D’s (not that I am some prescient super genius, anyone can see the toxicity of the Tea Party brand).  The sooner the better too, because the R will have to pick their poison, distance themselves from the Tea Party label and risk the nomination, or marry themselves to the hideously unpopular brand and get crushed in the general election.

He may be a bit naive in thinking that removing government regulations would make everything better, but only because most businesses were more public-minded than they are now.  After a hundred years of Profit Before Life Propaganda from the “Federal” Reserve and the corporate/parrot media, civility has been abandoned pretty much altogether.  I know there is no way Paul can get elected because there are too many powerful people and institutions that won’t allow it.  But I’m betting that if he was in charge, and his agenda was actually considered, he’d be very reasonable.

Given the obvious nature of what they consider terrorists, I can’t help but wonder how many of the stories of pioneers getting slaughtered by The Sioux were made up, embellished and impressed upon the settlers so they would sacrifice their kids so our government could get their hands on the black hills and The Sioux onto reservations?
Same motive, different time, probably perpetrated by the same family lines.
They fooled your great grand-pappy, their kids are fooling you!
Keep on with the Boo, yah chuckleheads…

He forgot to mention that the US, especially in regards to the 19 Saudis who participated in 911, prop up tyrannical dictators who rule with an iron fist. So actually, they don’t hate us for our freedoms, they hate us for taking their freedoms away.

What can we really expect in an era of 24/7 propaganda and spin? Our electorate is now so ill informed and bigoted…and even puffed up with a certainty that they are well-informed in spit of a near absence of facts and a bumper crop of feeling based opinion…that they can’t discern fact from fiction even on a good day. They live from gut reaction to gut reaction…like skittish herd animals that aren’t even sure why they just started running…but everyone near them just did so it must be the right thing to do. Theres just one problem…the predators got smart and are making the herd run where they want them…and the herd is just to dumb to know it.

Koch brothers patriarch. Fred Koch, was one of the founders and financial supporters of the libertarian John Birch Society. With their insane policy of finding a communist under every rock, JBS was seen as a bunch of loons by most Americans and lost much of their political clout. The Koch brothers poured money into the Tea Party in an attempt to breathe life back into the libertarian movement, but without the baggage of JBS. The GOP was quick to co-opt the bagger party and make it their own. The party that Ron Paul helped to found was taken over by slave state republicans who no longer want any part of Paul. Libertarians have always sided with republicans and it came back to bite them. The moral of this story is that rattle snakes do not make good pets.

Paul has the most conservative voting record of any congressman since 1932. That alone qualifies him as an extremist.

“…preserve our sovereignty or let it go to the globalists.”
Uh, Libertarians want to end government regulations and get government completely out of business which will create more corporate globalism not less. If you drown government in the bathtub, who the fuck do you think will step in to fill the void? Mom and Pop?
Btw, our government and its Constitution is the only thing that makes us supposedly better than other nations. Dirty Neocons and  delusional Libertarians want to destroy that one thing that makes us superior so traitorous corporations can own everything. Get rid of that avatar! You don’t deserve it.

Booing the truth – that speaks volumes about the audience.  Its willful ignorance and it hurts us all.  The amazing thing is that generally speaking the same people determined to hate based on ignorance are the same ones preaching religion to the rest of us. 
They want to hate and be ignorant yet demand we believe how benevolent and kind their particular religion is.  It only takes a little common sense to see that following the ‘Religious Right’ is a very poor idea.

He’s still wrong, as usual: Bin Laden used rhetoric just as he has and still does for political ends. None of it is sincere and most in the Middle East don’t care for al qaeda if they even know who they are.

I disagree. In most cases the “people in general” wouldn’t know the truth if it bit them in their fat T.V.-watching asses.
Iconoclasm
On the contrary Paul is absolutely right, AS USUAL and I am sure those jeers were elicited from his mention of the plight of the Palestinians rather than the CORRECT articulation on Al Qaeda.
The government has LIED on every facet of the September 11, 2001 attacks but has its controlled lapdog media using Hitlers propaganda tactics to flood your indoctrinated minds of the masses with Bullshit! They don’t hate us for our freedom they hate us for bullying them in their own back yard any other rationale for the attacks is sheer arrogance on our parts. If that were the case Holland , Sweden and Switzerland would be the first to succumb. Furthermore, bin Laden (who was killed in 2002 incidentally, not recently as propagated by the Obama administration) was a CIA asset the entire time! Anyone that believes the governments conspiracy theory should have their heads examined because you are victims of brainwashing techniques embraced by our government per Adolph Hitler. Please, do yourselves a favor and read Bernays Propaganda and look up Sibe lEdmonds if you want toget at the reality of the situation.
RON PAUL 2012!!!!!

You should get your facts straight. Liberals and libertarians both want government to stay out of people’s private lives. Since the article was about Ron Paul, my response was about libertarian ideas. I said nothing about liberals one way or another. I will add that you seem to be one of those people so hung up on labels that you’ve lost track of ideas and nuances. Most people have a mix of liberal, conservative, libertarian and other ideas depending on the issues. I am socially very liberal. I am economically conservative in the non-right-winger sense of believing that government exists for the purpose of serving people and therefore should invest in them, including public schools, health care, the environment–you know, actually conserving things. Most of all you need to remember that the labels you use so freely are attached to human beings and human beings are not consistent or 100% logical. It is therefore perfectly possible for a self-called libertarian to run for President. You’re as out of touch with reality as the right-wingers are–just in a slightly different direction.

Your post doesn’t make any sense. The fact that I agree with Paul on a few ideas does not mean I have to accept all his ideas. That’s a ridiculous notion. In fact, I get the impression that you agree with Paul that government should stay out of our bedrooms. So where does that leave you, other than up a creek without a paddle? You should stop making up silly rules and actually try to think through ideas and issues.

What I learned last night;
They attacked us because we have the fastest rocket ships and the tastiest sandwiches.  They attacked us because we’re so wonderful.   HPV vaccines make girls retarded and Obama busted into our house and stole 500 billion dollars and gave it to the most undeserving negroes. 
I didn’t hear a single specific on how to make health care affordable after they pull up the current health care legislation and replace it with what again?  But I did hear them talk about people who speak Spanish as being like cockroaches. 
Santorum has a perpetual expression on his face like someone gave him a dirty Sanchez.
Honestly, if there was a God who wasn’t asleep at the wheel the earth would have opened up and swallowed them whole. 
This was pure and unadulterated vomit, from beginning to end.

Please… get your facts straight before you attempt a smear.  This is purposeful distortion on your and Raw Story’s part.  I was more busy watching the Patriots whip up on the Dolphins last night but I did happen to catch this exchange on health insurance.
The question was not framed as “letting uninsured die” and Ron Paul said nothing of the sort.  As a matter of fact (since I can tell you didn’t watch any of this but are just regurgitating liberal talking points), he said he was a practicing physician in the days before Medicare/Medicaid and nobody was denied treatment due to finances.  Prior to the government involvment in health care there was a thing known as charity or personal responsibility for some aspects of your health care costs.
Since I worked for years as a Medicaid auditor in the state of Ohio I can tell with with expert and informed precision, that since the adoption of these programs health care inflation costs have quadrupled the nominal rate of inflation.  This is always the effect of slack as produced by artificial demand and subsidies (which is essentially what Medicare/Medicaid is).  The correlation between rising health care costs and the integration of government is so statistically correlated that one can assume causation.
I know, I know… economic reality and facts are not something the commentors on Raw Story are very good with dealing with if it is outside the polemics of the liberal establishment dogma.  But, I have no desire or time to debate reality.  This is simply an axiom, subsidies increase bottom line costs.

Paul was booed by those still in the service of the oligarchic kleptocracy plundering the nation and the world. In order to keep the military/industrial machine fed with Trillions of tax dollars, the perception of everyone is against us is heightened again, and again keeping fear in the forefront.  
Its amazing; but, dumbed down Americans are still buying the fear card,

And need I also remind you, that it was the New York Times and Newsweek who both penned pieces saying we need to kill Granny and ration health care. 
So, what is “rationing”? 
It is denial of services.  So that is somehow more humane than the alternative?
Read…. the arguments made in these pieces are to let people die if treating them costs too much.  That is more humane and acceptable than Ron Paul saying charity should care for the poor?
Bizzaro world here.

Ron Paul had courage to make that truthful statement. If you asked any person “what would you think of a country that placed other people behind a concrete fence, refuses to allow them to travel on the highway, denies them health care, education, water and food, would you support that nation? The majority of all people would be on the side of the Palestinans. But, if you use the name Palestine and Israel….they get booed..just like the Teabaggers did last night when Ron Paul told the truth. Proof that the teabaggers are a bunch of christian evangelicals stuck in the old testament and support the apartheid, un democratic, racist state of Israel. Baggers are the most demented, hate filled uneducated people on the planet.  God help this country if even ONE of the them gets to be anywhere near the Whitehouse.

Some of you people here who still think Ron Paul is the “leader” of this corporate media/neocon abomination called the “Tea Party” are as brainwashed as the “tea partiers” you are bashing.
Yes, in the very beginning of the pure, grass-roots movement , eventually referred to as the”tea party” Ron Paul could be said to be a spokesperson. But that Tea Party has become infiltrated and corrupted to such a degree that the participants now boo the one presidential candidate that consistently tells it like it is. Their spokesperson is now Sarah Palin.

Paul like many know this was about oil and nothing else. Both the Saudis and the White House had this planned long before Bush stole the office of President.  Cheney was given the VP spot to assure the mission was done and as he saw the idiot President really thought he was a President, Cheney took the Executive Presidential Powers to get the job done.  Bush was told information on an add needed basis.  The Saudis had an employee with his own office in the White House that should have told Americans something. Have you ever seen/heard of a Foreign country with an office in the White House?  Osama Bin Laden was used to put fear in Americans.  Osama’s only honest tape where he said he praised those who bombed the WTC but he had nothing to do with it, but he said no one would ever have to attack the United States again because the USA would destroy itself.
