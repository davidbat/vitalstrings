I mean the "get off my property" types, kinda like the video.  Many of them can be deprogrammed from the Iran stuff if you start talking to them about facts, like the things Israel has said about Iran, and the things our own CIA has said about Iran.  Then hit them with the things leading up to the first Iraq war.
I keep repeating this lately...  everyone is not as good at spotting fakes and liars as many of us here are.  This is why we still see people falling victim to various street scams.  But these people still really don't like being lied to.  Once you make a convincing case for them that they've been scammed by both politicians and media, they start popping over to our side rather easily.

The impossible is what we came to do because all that is possible is what everyone else does everyday.
