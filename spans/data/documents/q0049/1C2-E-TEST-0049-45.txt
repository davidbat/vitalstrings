Ron Paul isn’t the answer – he’s a doddering isolationist fool who thinks we can put the geo-political genie back in a 100 year old bottle. That isn’t my brand of Tea-Party Conservatism and as a rugged individualist, I bristle at Glenn Beck and others when they tell me how to cast my vote.. 
I’m with Eric Bolling on this. We can not abandon our ship of state in foreign waters. Ron Paul is the wrong answer.

Ron Paul can’t get elected. He does keep a group pulled together that will vote as a block against Obama, so that’s good. The Tea Party is just this cycle’s version of the Moral Majority and who will also vote as a block against Obama, so that’s good. We need a President who will scare the piss out of our enemies, that man is Newt Gingrich, so that’s good too.

No matter how you slice it the republicans have had only 5 african americans represent them in almost 100 years, the democrats have had well over 100.  At some point you have got to call that a pattern.

Right.  This was before the movement was co-opted by a bunch of know-nothing neo-cons trying to portray themselves as outsiders (Palin and others).  The tea party of today represents very little of what was going on with Ron Paul’s movement in 2007.

I actually think there is a lot of the original Tea Party from 2007 mixed in with the current expanded Tea Party.  And I would certainly not call Sarah Palin an insider.  Seeing Ron Paul close to 1st place in the latest polls in Iowa tells me the Tea Party still contains a big libertarian influence.

Eric Bolling is completely wrong on this and it is very provable. Look at YouTube or some newspapers from 2007.  
To label Ron Paul an isolationist is the pinnacle of inanity.  Our current foreign policy is isolationist.  It is not synonymous with non-intervention — unless, of course, you define the antonym of isolationism to be having 700+ military bases in 150+ countries paying for the national defense of supposedly sovereign nations while exerting the will of our corrupt political ruling class around the world.  Attitudes like yours will see us bankrupt with hyperinflation and lots of dead soldiers with their families wondering why we were ever over there in the first place.  
I do, however, compliment you on rebuking Glenn Beck when he tells you how to vote (though he certainly hasn’t told you to vote for Ron Paul).  Beck and all the other pundits are caricatures of themselves.

Ron Paul’s supporters will vote against Obama, that is true.  However, they will never vote for anyone other than Ron Paul.  Unless the GOP wises up and stops undermining Dr. Paul’s campaign, they will either see Obama’s second term or a Ron Paul presidency in another party.  Newt and Romney have no chance.

So being friends with other nations, and trading with them peacefully and not meddle in their affairs is isolationism. 
No. It is not. It is the foreign policy of the U.S. 
Principles come first. I don’t let lies about how Iran will destroy the U.S. or Israel scare me dumb. It’s war propaganda. If you can’t see it, then I’m sorry for you. It’s bullsh1t.

Not true,,,, don’t buy the media definitions of anything including the Tea Party Patriots that are really all just individuals of a similar mind set on the Constitution that are standing together as individual free persons and are really not a “party” at all

I’m sure you think that your “crack” point is unassailable, but making sweeping generalizations based on race…is pretty much a textbook definition of racial bigotry.
I’m not really interested in participating in an argument where the subject is: “is white supremacy justified?”  You yourself are an example of white people who are most definitely inferior.

You are proving his point that people are so hypersensitive to race discussions because of political correctness. Whenever you hear the word ‘black’ in a sentence, you automatically think racism.
Although this is an irrelevant point, it’s not racist to say that blacks smoke crack at a higher rate than other races. Are facts based on racial statistics somehow racist?

Crack Cocaine is more prevalent in poor black communities than any other racial demographic. How is that a racist statement? He’s not saying that all blacks smoke crack, he’s saying that its more common in the black community.

Actually, every President that has served in office since the Cuban Trade Embargo is a isolationist. Ron Paul as President wants to open trade with ALL nations including Cuba, This would make him the FIRST non-isolationist President since JFK.

Guns, Germs, and Steel is an attempt to deny reality.  The notion that all races are precisely equal is insanity.
The ‘out of Africa’ depiction is also insanity.  Anyone who understands evolution understands that if a species separates from the original group, it evolves new and different traits from its original group.  To say that these groups are identical is moronic.  They’re NOT.  There are clear, observable, differences between the two groups, and that’s not even getting into the more complicated, not easily observable, differences.   
The ‘out of Africa’ theory is over-simplified to explain that all human beings moved out of Africa in a concerted effort at the exact same time.  What if over the course of 60,000 years, 400 different groups moved out at different times and each developed its own tiny differences.  Some of those groups developed higher brain capacity, some developed stronger muscular traits, etc.?  Is it racist to acknowledge this?  In reality, yes.  It is completely racist to say that one group of people is different from another group.  I can hardly call this science – it’s the exact opposite.

You are correct when you say that Ron Paul supporters will vote as a block against Obama.  However, they will also vote as a block against any status quo candidate. The Paul supporters who are ex-republican and right-leaning independents will most likely either write in Ron Paul or vote 3rd party (assuming Paul doesn’t run 3rd party..).  The left leaning independents and blue dems who support Dr. Paul will either vote 3rd party or swing back to Obama.
If Ron Paul is not the GOP nominee, Obama wins in a landslide.
Most true Ron Paul supporters would as soon have another 4 years of a war-mongering big-spending democrat as 4 years (with an incumbent running in 2016) of a war-mongering big-spending republican.  By 2016 enough people will have awakened that liberty will prevail — assuming there is anything left of our country by 2016.

So a fair election process that doesn’t automatically result in a black man winning the election is somehow racist? You’re making it sound like you want affirmative action for politicians.
Just because there are few black GOP congressmen does not at all mean that the GOP is racist. There are so many other outliers that your race obsessed mind can’t realize exist. 
Based on your logic, MSNBC is the most racist network because they consistently have less black anchors than FOX and CNN. MSNBC only added Sharpton because they were criticized by black groups for having too many white newscasters on the network.

So some grew smarter and others grew stronger. Hmmm so you discount all of guns,germs and steel? How do you account for Black scientist,doctors,lawyers and engineers then? Do you discount this or is it just a coincidence? Do you then say that Asians are smarter than white people because they kick our asses on tests? And are Americans stupider than europeans because they know multiple languages, and also kick our asses on academic tests?

I didn’t say what you just wrote in your first paragraph Ry. But you are in denial when your side has had 5 black men and no black women represent you in almost 100 years. You think these are just coincidental statistics? Like I said your side has chosen over 100 years not to elect black people to represent you. Now you can make excuses for this but then you would be denying the obvious.  My mind is not race obsessed in any way shape or form. You then went on a rant about Sharpton which has no relevance what so ever to this discussion. The conservatives in this day in age are just what their name implies. They do not wish to move forward they generally wish to move back to a time in which they believe the country was better. They were against gays in the military, they are afraid that our culture is being destroyed, they are paranoid that their religion is being taken away from them and many don’t believe in evolution or modern scientific methods. Now you can not really argue this. But in the long run you will lose, and you know it. You can argue that Democrats were once racist and I would agree many were. But these democrats were conservatives and they were rolled over by history just as the modern conservatives will be. Social and scientific change is happening everyday and those living in the past will become relics just as the men were who were against women voting and against blacks from voting. Just as the men in the Catholic Church were left in the dust by the enlightenment. Its inevitable.

Dear Ryguy,
Both points are socioeconomic, and have precious little to do with skin color.  There are plenty of white crack smokers, and plenty of whites who drop out of high school.  Poorer people of all races are more likely to smoke crack and poorer people are more likely to drop out of high school.
But Tim isn’t a real deep thinker, so he thinks this proves some point about all black people.  That is one indicator that he is a racist. 
“How is stating that fact racist?”
Connecting it to race is what makes it racist, stupid.
http://twitter.com/jtstellar htu
the rule for this election is very simple–who does the least to piss off paul supporters.  whichever side manages that, manages to clear one major obstacle of concerted effort of at least 10% of a very cooperative, highly energized grassroots work against him.  you republicans in name only can keep attacking paul and alienating supporters, just know that many of paul’s supporters did not have political allegiance before 07 but came into politics at the coincidental timing of financial crisis which paul predicted, essentially granting paul a political-teacher like status among many supporters.  to assume you owned these people’s political allegiance all along is ridiculous.
even some establishment libertarians tried to attack paul, and in fact libertarian party is split right down half half for and against paul right now.  make no mistake, allies and enemies are distinguished very clearly by paul supporters.  if we aren’t afraid to split from libertarians, whom media likes to smear paul as, what makes republicans in name only the ego to think differently of the outcomes here.  disagree with paul supporters all you like, political discourse is good and necessary, but, smear and attack paul and his supporters un-courteously as mark levin, see what happens.

Libertarianism and Ron Paul supporters are the only semi-rational movements in American conservatism today. The rest of the party is a struggling dinosaur. I think in a battle of wits, Liberals would win against Libertarians, but no doubt if we had an honest battle, both sides would learn something.
So why don’t we Liberals help our Libertarian brothers and sisters. If we crossed over party lines and voted in primaries for Ron Paul and supported other Libertarian candidates, then we could help give them a chance. Then two positive ideologies could battle it out.
I think Libertarianism would fail to win general support as it is only an hypothesis — one that should be tested before being applied to the country at large. There are no tests going on in north Texas or eastern New Hampshire or wherever. Libertarians aren’t even talking about the need to validate their hypotheses, but this will become apparent. I am sure of it — if only they can get a chance.
What is there to be afraid of? There is no hope for the rest of Republicanism. Conservatism needs to rise again from the ashes. Libertarianism is the only decent thing it has going for it.
And Liberalism will have a chance of being purified from its own cronyism, exclusion, cliqueishness, corruption, and outright naivete in what government can do.
I don’t shy away from such a battle. Let’s join together! The Occupy Wallstreet Movement and “the” Tea Party. We can both rid our house of its leeches if we work together.

Actually, just a side note, brains in an IQ sense often don’t have as much to do with success in the world.  Tenacity and a high functioning ability to measure individuals around each other are coming out as more indicative of success.
High IQs are often linked with higher than normal rates of depression and social anxiety.
Fact of the matter is, society makes up for just about everything that the genepool has given advantagewise or taken away in every case.  Pretty weird.

Not only did Ron Paul hold the first Tea Party march on December 16, 2007, it can be argued that Ron Paul fathered the “ANONYMOUS” use of Guy Faulkes masks with his November 5, 2007 money bomb, with it’s “Remember, Remember the Fifth of November” theme that broke all records for online daily fund raising with Six million raised!

Non-inteventionist.  Get your facts straight.  And Ron IS THE ORIGINAL TEA PARTIER.  It was his grassroots who created the Tea Party.  Newt is a big government liberal and I think the Democrats are being very smart here, they want Newt as the GOP nominee thats why they are pumping him up as a Tea Partier.  They’re hoping the GOP voters will come to his defense and rally around him.
Also lest we forget George W Bush’s foreign policy he ran on in 2000, which is very similar to Ron Paul’s.  With one exception, Ron Paul actually means what he says.

The original Ron Paul Tea Party and the expanded group calling itself the tea party now still share a lot in common with Ron Paul’s platform when it comes to cutting spending.  Let us not forget the tea party stumped for Rand Paul in Kentucky.  So they do not dislike Ron Paul or his family as much as you might think.  The difference is Rand is politically better at getting essentially the same message across.  But there is very little difference between him and his father.

This gave me goosebumps. You seem to be a left-minded individual, but you figured out on your own what Ron Paul has been saying forever. It’s what the whole Revolution is about: United we stand, divided we fall. The media and the political parties keep us going forever in a left-right continuum. But that continuum swings up and down as well. And right now the 1% at the top are coming down hard and squeezing the middle class via false loans and “quantitative easing.”
