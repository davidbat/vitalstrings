My understanding is that the original word that the Bible used that was
translated as 'virgin' can actually be translated to mean *either* a
woman who has never had sex, or just 'young woman', and that in the case
of the description of the virgin birth, the context made it plain  that
it simply meant 'young woman', not a woman who had never had sex.
Willing to be corrected as it was a long time ago that I did that
research and I was new to the process (using concordances and such)...
