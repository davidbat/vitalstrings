Ron Paul loyalists have been vindicated. After months of observations that the mainstream media was ignoring the libertarian standard-bearer, a new study by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism shows just that: the Texas Congressman, who has consistently polled in the high single digits — Real Clear Politics’s aggregate poll currently has him at 8 percent — has received the least overall coverage of any candidate. From May 2 to October 9, Paul appeared as the “primary newsmaker in only 2% of all election stories.”
The study measured mainstream exposure by compiling a list of 52 mainstream news outlets across “newspapers, cable news, broadcast television, the 12 most popular news websites in the country, and radio news.” To register as a story about the candidate, he/she had to be the focus of at least 50 percent of the story.

Paul generated a good deal of attention on blogs, registering as the fifth most-discussed candidate with more than 89,000 opinions tracked about him.
