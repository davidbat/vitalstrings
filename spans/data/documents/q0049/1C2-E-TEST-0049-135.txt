And, Mark Levin would be absolutely correct about that. Paulites have attempted to co-opt the Tea Party message from day one. Let me give you Paulites a clue about the Tea Party: we are not about cajoling other patriots into lobbying for and voting for ONE candidate like your beloved R.P. (stands for Ross Perot as well) but about getting all candidates to start getting their minds right about the issues the Tea Party stands for … those candidates that do are the ones the Tea Party will rally behind. When you attend a Tea Party rally try to be mindful of that … otherwise you look not much different than an SEIU thug attending these rallies.

To those who doesn’t understand Ron Paul’s National
Security policy go learn from C.I.A. chief of the Osama bin Laden unit
at the Counterterrorist Center, Michael Scheuer, and educate yourself.
Read a book and stop believing the war propaganda. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scheuerhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8592669916552553093
