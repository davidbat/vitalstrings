Via the Daily Paul, we learn that the straw poll taken at the Cincinnati Tea Party handed a victory to Ron Paul. (It's at 3:05 in the video.)
Like he did in the MSNBC/Politico debate, Paul decided to stay in the conversation by attacking his opponents -- chiefly Rick Perry. Getting bogged down in a deja vu foreign policy discussion didn't go as well for him, but it moved his base of support not at all. It angered the crowd in the room, because the Tea Party is a more jingoistic, less America First movement than Paul's. But Paul's not trying to win 51 percent of GOP votes. He's trying to build his movement. Standing his ground against a pipsqueak like Santorum did good for him.
