Paul has no shot to win period.  Love him in Congress and firing shots at the liberals but has no shot on the national level.

I disagree with Angelo.  Ron Paul is already at a nation level and has been for some time.  One of the reasons he has been in congress for so long is that many people in his district respect him for his honesty.  A lot of people call him a nut or even worse names but really where most people from the conservative right disagree with him is on foreign policy.  But if you listen to him carefully you would understand why.  I remember seeing him on D.L. Hughley and was asked about his view on the civil war.  At first D.L was upset that Ron Paul said he thought the war was not needed, but then he went on to explain that over thousands of lives were lost and we could have simply purchased the slaves and then freed them like some european countries had done.  Saves lives and would have been far cheaper.  Another was an argument about Ron Paul saying no to giving a gold medal to Rosa Parks and a couple others.  What he did say was that this medal which cost over $30,000.00 should not be allowed because Congress should not use tax payers money to give it to her.  He then took money out of his own pocket and said if we want to give her the medal all congress members should chip in.  Some say this argument is no longer valid because he then supported the boy scout commemoritive medal but I say this is completely different issue being it is an organization who has helped so many kids over the years plus the coin was only a $1 each.  And it is a national organization.
 
What is so wrong about Ron Paul is that it is easy to not understand what he is saying.  But if you disagree with something he says look up his whole stance on the issue and see if it then sits better with you.  People demonize him so much but I think it is because he stands by principles more than party which is why I think many tea party folks like him but not all.  Many in the Republican party also do not like them because the party is controlled by mostly moderate republicans.  I know plenty of old McCain supporters who now support Ron Paul and some still do not agree with his foreign policy ideas but they feel they can trust him and think he is the best guy to really get spending under control.
 
I do not see why some people who associate themselves with the tea party say they agree with the priniciples but then call Ron Paul crazy on foreign policy because limiting government means also reducing our military presence which could be to reduce troop numbers and even closing bases.  But by bring more of our troops home we can have a better national defense along with protecting our borders.
 
I for one agree with Ron Paul obviously but so many people think he is wrong but if you do not listen to him at least consider history that all empires ended when spreading their miitary too thin and devaluing their currency wth hyperinflation.  It is the direction we are going.  And if our country collapses will you then feel safer?  Ben Franklin once said those who put security before liberty deserve neither.  Eisenhower in his final address also warned of the industrial military complex and that the people need to keep it under control or else the misuse of power could bring this country down and so when I hear all this war mongoring I think of that.  I do believe sometimes fighting is needed but it should not be the first thing used and we should not threaten war which only leads to it.  We can be smarter than that.

The last video I watched of Ron Paul he claimed we spent 5.1 trillion dollars bailing banks out, and that money should have just been sent directly to the American people. However, that was not true. We've basically recovered our money back from the bailout of the banks, but are 25 billion in the hole, mainly from losses from AIG, General Motors and Chrysler. Big difference between 5.1 trillion and 25 billion. The video I watched before that, he was criticizing the Bin Laden operation. He said he would have never ordered it, and that he would have abided by international law, and would have just told Pakistan that we know where he is. He would have told Pakistan. lol. Out. of. touch.

Actually your statement about being paid back is not true.  The paybacks are coming from more loans.  Even if you do not like Ron Paul maybe you might like Glenn Beck.  He has video where he talks about this.  Plus it has even made it into the news.  Really very little money has been paid back.  The money is just floating around in circles.  It is like you ask me for $5 and I give it to you, then you ask for $10 where you pay off the $5 and then tell the world that you paid off the bailout in record time.  I do not think anyone really feels like we have been paid back, the debt did not go down.  In fact it has been going up at a faster and faster pace over the last few years.  If Ron Paul would had been president we would have had a higher chance of getting Obama years ago before he crossed that border.  It may just be my opinion but I can not help to feel that way because of how close of a relationship Bush had with the Bin Ladens.  We know for a fact we had Osama in the cross hairs a couple of times but the slow response from Bush helped him get away.  Can I prove that the delays were deliberate, no, but it is definitely a possibility.  I do understand the importance of getting Osama but we do have to respect other countries and their laws.  We would not want someone doing that to us.  But that is okay, we just keep spending like we have, we will lose this country which the left and moderate republicans want, and then how safe will you be?  Has anyone noticed how short our ally list has gotten over the years, how strong China and Russia has become, and realize just how in debt we are.  As soon as that spicket stops, hyper inflation, country collapses.  And we can not change what happened now and so we will not know but Pakistan and other countries have given us terrorists and criminals in the past and they are in prison today.
 
To think Iran is a threat is really an insult to our intelligence and our military.  Our strength is so good that we toppled two countries in a very short period of time.  Israel would take Iran down.  Iran really does not have much of a military.  However we are losing our friends which is not good and not being talked about.  Talking about how dangerous things would be if Ron were president but look at how dangerous of a mess we got now which had nothing to do with Ron Paul.  Obviously more of the same is not the answer.

We think we are right about our military and foreign affairs but if you want to listen to the people who matter the most then notice how Ron Paul always gets more military votes over anyone else.  I think this shows very clearly who they want in their leadership and you have to respect that.

IN SOME CASES, HE IS A NUT CASE, WE CAN NOT GO BACKWARDS.

Hi Larry,
 
Really, I think the bailout money from the banks has been paid back. Here's an article about it on the LA Times :
 
The program under the $700-billion financial bailout package that pumped money into banks moved closer to break-even Wednesday as another large financial institution repaid its cash infusion.
The Treasury Department announced that Fifth Third Bancorp had fully repaid the $3.4 billion it received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Cincinnati institution received the money on Dec. 31, 2008 -- some of the $245 billion dished out under TARP's Capital Purchase Program to stabilize the U.S. banking system.
With the check from Fifth Third Bancorp, total repayments under that program have reached $243 billion, Treasury said. Programs that bailed out banks are now estimated to turn a $20-billion profit.
“As the economy heals, we’re continuing to see private capital step up and replace public support in the financial sector, which has dramatically lowered the cost of TARP for taxpayers,” said Tim Massad, who heads TARP as acting assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability.
But while the bank bailouts are expected to make money, TARP also pumped about $165 billion into a host of other programs, including rescues of American International Group, General Motors and Chrysler, that are projected to post an overall loss.
Still, the latest estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office put TARP losses at $25 billion -- far less than initially projected. Only about $410 billion of the $700 billion was distributed and no new TARP programs can be started.
Overall repayments now stand at more than $274 billion, Treasury said.
Part of the reason the bank bailouts are set to turn a profit is the dividend payments on the preferred shares that Treasury received for the cash infusions. Fifth Third Bancorp has paid about $341 million in dividends so far -- a 10% return for the government -- with more money likely to come in because the government still holds warrants to purchase about 44 million shares of common stock.
 
As far as Glenn Beck, I just don't care for him. Not a fan. And, I don't understand what you mean, "the money is just floating in circles." But, don't take that statement as if I'm directly challenging what you're saying, as I'll be the first to admit that economy related topics are not always my best subject.  :) 
 
With Osama, it's hard to say. But I'm glad, for the sake of the families of the 911 victims, that the operation may bring some closure, however small. With Russia, they are worse off than we are. Their S & P rating is a BBB. China is certainly not bad off, but their economy is quite dependent on selling products to the US an Europe and currency manipulation. Here's an article that describes their economy as unsustainable and volatile long-term .    
 
After critizing Ron Paul, I kind of had second thoughts, but I didn't see an edit button. lol. Mainly just because I would feel bad if I were to offend anyone on here. So you know, I do like this forum and many principles of the Tea Party. However, I'm not in the Tea Party. I usually get along easily with people on the left, the right, and center fairly well. I think politics are interesting, but haven't seen a single candidate, including Ron Paul, that I could get behind in 2012. I probably just won't vote. Anyway, it's nice to meet you Larry.

Because so much money went out to hundreds of banks and companies I can believe that some money was paid back.  But I would have to wonder though if the money is coming back then why did we hit the debt ceiling so fast?  It is just really crazy how much money this government is spending.  The big bailouts made news but while those were being discussed other smaller bailouts were being given out left and right.  It is not that difficult to feel how bad things are.  If you were to go back to the old way we use to calculate unemployment we are pretty close to the same numbers during the depression.
 
Not a member of the tea party.  Well really the tea party is just a group of people who promise to stand by the principles.  It is not really a party at all and the idea behind that is to not become like the two top parties now.  I guess you can become a member of each of the sites but that is about it.  Personally the idea of backing the constitution should make more tea party folks support Ron Paul.  The media is trying to not give as much attention to Ron Paul now which does not surprise me because about this same time in 2008 the Republican party and the media began ditching him.  Some people resort to name calling but really if he is so crazy then let him speak, give him the same coverage, and then see if he wipes himself out.  Personally I know he gets more military votes then anyone else, his people love him for his honesty, he has not been able to get much done because of the corruption in Washington, but where he is making a difference is the organizing to knock out incumbents and the movement is growing at a really fast rate.  Really, I do not think anyone can change Washington as well as he can because he has been heavily involved with different committees over the years and has constantly been a whistle blower when he sees others wasting the peoples money and the trampling of our liberties, etc.  The others are a lot of talk but nothing that comes close to back it as much as RP's record.  Just watched this video a minute ago and thought I would share it:   http://video.foxnews.com/v/1113357701001/

I'm not sure what you mean by "Why did we hit the debt ceiling so fast?" President Bush had the debt ceiling raised seven times between January 2001 and January 2009. So, for Obama to request to raise the limit doesn't seem that out of the ordinary. With Ron Paul, I actually voted for him in the primary three years back. It's just over time that I've come to like him a bit less. I remember then, he struggled to get 4% of the vote. I've heard from RP supporters before how he gets more military votes then anyone else. It doesn't calculate. With only 4% of the total vote, I'm confident that he's not the most popular candidate among the military (or none of the military is voting). But, you're right. Some of his ideas are brilliant. This Wiki page goes over his political positions (which appear to be more "Tea Party" values than the rest of the candidates). That was a great video. It's true, he is snubbed by the media.
