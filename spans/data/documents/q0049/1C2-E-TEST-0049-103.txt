Ron Paul has endorsed  Duopoly: How the Republicrats Control the Electoral Process.
The ten-term Congressman and three-time Presidential candidate from Texas wrote, “Darryl Perry has produced a comprehensive examination of the ways in which ballot access laws, campaign finance ‘reform’, gerrymandering, and other restrictions limited participation in the electoral process. I recommend this to anyone interested in learning how the political monopoly arose and what we might do to open the process to new candidates promoting the old idea of liberty both inside and outside the major parties.”
In addition, one of the reviewers suggested that “the book be read by every Political Science student, State Legislator & Congressman. I’m hoping that people get on board with the suggestion and send a copy to their State Rep., State Senator & 3 members of Congress (1 US Rep. & 2 US Senators)”.
