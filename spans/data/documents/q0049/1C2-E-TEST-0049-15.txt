Ron Paul on Sunday dismissed the idea that Newt Gingrich is gaining support among members of the tea party movement, saying it seems “a little strange” that an “insider” would claim to be a leader of an anti-establishment movement.
“The tea party is not a tea party. I mean, it’s all over the place - everybody’s claiming they’re the tea party,” Paul said on CNN’s “State of the Union. “Somebody like Newt Gingrich who’s been in politics all these years and is an insider is claiming that he’s leading the tea party movement  - that to me is a little strange.”
There is no one tea party movement, the the Republican presidential candidate insisted, saying it represents a wide range of frustrated Americans, including the Occupy Wall Street protesters.
“It’s the frustration level that’s so high and I think that’s one of the things that’s energized our campaign," Paul added. "Our meetings and rallies that we have are made up of Democrats and independents and frustrated Republicans."
