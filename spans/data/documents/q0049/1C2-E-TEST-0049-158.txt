These numbers also fall in line with Wrong Paul’s performance in the last presidential elections. As I recall, he won a bunch of straw and internet polls. And his delusional paulbot followers claimed this represented reality. Of course, us sane people knew that he had no real life political support. And that was proven in the 2008 when the nutjob only got 5% of the primary vote. That means 19 OUT OF 20 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS REJECTED HIM AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LAST ELECTION!!!
And of course his followers are the dirtbags of society. Conspiracy loons, anti war leftists, and anti semites. That is why the Republican Jewish Coalition banned him and his paulbots from the presidential debate they moderated. And that is why most sites, including this one, have policies banning paulbots. I say they are a cancer to the conservative movement and we should treat them like lepers and shun them.
