Applauding emotional appeals to patriotism dressed in vapid poetry and booing information... If the information is false, shouldn't the audience patiently wait withï»¿ confidence for their side to (at least try to) show its falsity? Why would you express disapproval even if it were false? Shouldn't you clap when your side gets the facts right and boo when the other side counters with vapid poetry?
