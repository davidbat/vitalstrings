Just what Ron Paul needs. The Tea Party. Even though I don't agree with all of Paul's stances, he does seem to be one of the more realistic, down-to-earth candidates. So the endorsement by a radical, fringe group like the tea party will probably be the death knell for his campaign, once he gets lumped in with the crazies. After all, these are the people who are so committed that they change who they want every month. First Bachmann, then Cain, then Paul… and I read about tea partiers supporting Romney, too. So this “focused” group is, in fact, pretty splintered. Most of them would vote for Tim Tebow tomorrow if he showed up on a ballot. If I were Ron Paul, I'd be working overtime right now to ask the Tea Party to NOT endorse me. Kiss of death.
