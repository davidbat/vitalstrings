Ron Paul placed first Thursday night in a Dubuque Tea Party presidential straw poll that included 90 participants.
Five elimination rounds of voting took place, and in final round Paul won 59 votes, defeating second-place finisher Newt Gingrich who garnered 24 votes.
Exact numbers from each early round were unavailable, according to a press release. However, Paul led the voting in all five rounds, leaders with the congressman’s Iowa campaign said.
“We have always said that Ron Paul and tea party supporters have shared values, and today’s results illustrate crossover support in addition to organizational muscle,” Iowa Campaign Chairman Drew Ivers said Thursday.
The Dubuque Tea Party was founded in April 2009 and has 500 members.
