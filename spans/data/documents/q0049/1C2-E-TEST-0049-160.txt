With those numbers, it certainly looks better for Ron Paul.  Unfortunately for Paul, it isn't good enough.  In order to secure the nomination, even with these inflated numbers, Ron Paul would need to secure 71.9% of the remaining delegates.  Romney would need 40.2%.
Again...  Given that Ron Paul's best performance thus far has been 4.8%, I do not see any mathematical reality in which Ron Paul could suddenly pull off 71.9% of the remaining delegates.  It just isn't possible.
Given this reality, it is time for Ron Paul supporters to do what is in the best interest of the nation.  That is get behind Mitt Romney.
Mitt Romney is our best -- our only -- hope of defeating Barack Obama in November.  When it comes right down to it, defeating Barack Obama in November absolutely must be our number one priority.  If Barack Obama wins re-election the damage he will do to our nation will take a century to repair.  That is if the damage can be repaired at all.
The survival of our Republic is at stake.  We absolutely must unite and defeat Barack Obama.
