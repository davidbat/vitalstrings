What Does it MEAN?
Tea Party Debate Audience Cheer for Ron Paul’s Death Panel
I did not watch CNN’s Tea Party debate last night because I’m not into self-induced vomiting, and I knew that would be the result if I listened to that bullcrap.  After seeing this clip over at MPS ,  I am very glad I made that decision.

When Wolf Blitzer posed a hypothetical question about  whether a 30 year old man with a good job who decides to forgo health insurance because he is perfectly healthy and feels he doesn’t need it is suddenly struck with a catastrophic illness he cannot afford to pay for should be left to die, the audience breaks out in applause and whistles and  loud shouts of “YEAH!!!!”  can be heard.
These are the people who say that liberals are godless evildoers who are out to destroy America.
People who applaud and cheer for executions, and applaud and cheer for leaving uninsured people to die, because, hey  -  FREE MARKET, BABY!!!!!!!!!
These are the people who make Jesus weep.
