Ron Paul Weekly Update - May 5th thru May 11th
We seem to be entering a new phase of the campaign, as Ron Paul has returned to Washington this week, and some campus events have been cancelled. Mittens Romney swept three additional primaries this week, reportedly bringing him to 919 of the 1,144 needed to secure the nomination. It becomes clear to me that Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich probably took yet another one for the team, despite their stated aversion to a Romney nomination. With Dr. Paul, the three likely would have blocked Mittens and forced a brokered convention, which would have been a good thing for legitimate tea party voters. Now, whether they know it or not, Ron Paul and his dedicated delegates are conservatives' only hope!  Enjoy coverage of this week's significant delegate victories in Nevada and Maine!
