Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul will hold a Sunday afternoon tea party rally on the south steps of the Texas Capitol with his son, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
The rally, announced this morning by Paul’s presidential campaign, will be sponsored by the Tea Party Express, a national organization active in electoral politics, supporting past campaigns by Rand Paul, Sarah Palin, U.S. Sen. Scott Brown and other conservative candidates.
Ted Cruz, seeking the GOP nomination to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, also will address the rally, which begins at 2 p.m.
“One day this rally will occupy a special place in our history books when the Paul family and tea party are credited with restoring American government to its constitutional limits,” said Jesse Benton, chairman of the Paul presidential campaign. “How soon this recognition comes is up to voters.”
A Ron Paul rally last week at the University of Texas drew 6,000, according to campaign estimates.
