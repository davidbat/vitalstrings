Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, told CNN’s Candy Crowley on Monday that the tea party movement would probably not be a decisive factor in the Republican presidential nomination process.
“We were identified with the beginning of the tea party, and yet the tea party is not a tea party,” he said. “I mean, its all over the place and everybody is claiming they are tea party. How somebody like Newt Gingrich who has been in politics all these years and an insider, and claim that he is leading the tea party movement, that to me is a little strange.”
“But there actually is no one movement in the tea party, it actually started in our campaign four years ago ,” Paul noted.
“It represents a significant number of people who are frustrated with the process, as well as Occupy Wall Street,” he continued. “See, I talk to those people as well, because the frustration level is so high, and that is one of the things that I think have energized our campaign.”
