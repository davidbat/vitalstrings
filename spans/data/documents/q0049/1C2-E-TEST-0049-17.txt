When the man who is credited with the inception of the Tea Party, as a grassroots movement, says it’s now corporately owned, it’s worth hearing — but we already knew this.
 
While I’m certainly not a Ron Paul supporter, he brings up some valid points in this video — a few of which most Dems share in their thinking. After recently winning the Straw poll , he was deemed as unelectable by his Republican counterparts.
 
While there have been only a few Paul supporters daring to urge a Paul/Palin ticket , that would dissuade most Paul supporters of backing him.  Palin supports pouring money into the military — proving they are polar opposites.
 
 
“I wonder whether she’s energizing the 15-20 year olds,” Paul asks The Politico:
“That would be a question I would have. Because she  doesn’t talk about the Federal Reserve and some of these issues. She  doesn’t talk too much about personal liberties, civil liberties, getting  rid of drug laws, attacking the war on drugs, punishing people who  torture.”
 
Dr. Paul admits that the Tea Party is now corporately owned. Original Tea Partiers give credit to its inception to Dr. Paul.

Worth noting is that Ron Paul voted against the Patriot Act, leaving him fairly ostracized from his own party.  While many of his political beliefs I give pause to, auditing the Fed is not one of them.
 
Corporatism in the Tea Party negates the grassroots movement which it once claimed to be — have you heard them recently still claim their party to be a grassroots movement?
