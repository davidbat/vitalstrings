Ron Paul Tea Party endorsement may be on the way in South Carolina. (Getty Images) Political pundits are buzzing this week about Ron Paul and the South Carolina Tea Party.  Insiders suggest that Senator Tom Davis may formally endorse Ron Paul in time for the primary. 
Davis is considered one of South Carolina's top Tea Party leaders.
Could a Davis endorsement inspire more Tea Party support for Ron Paul?  Perhaps.  But we also have to wonder if Davis is just jumping on the 'Anyone Except Mitt Romney' bus.
Davis posted this on his offical Facebook page :
In  the next few days, I'm going to announce support for the one candidate  in the race for president who has consistently stood for taxpayers- one  who has a plan to balance the budget RIGHT NOW. Ron Paul's fiscal conservative credentials may help him win S.C. Tea Party support
South Carolina Republican Executive Director Matt Moore spoke to the press about the impact of a potential Tom Davis endorsement.  He described Davis' "fiscal conservative credentials" as "outstanding" and concluded; “Any candidate would do well to gain his endorsement.”
The Ron Paul campaign has momentum from strong results in Iowa and New Hampshire.  The next big test comes on January 21st, when all eyes will be on South Carolina.
