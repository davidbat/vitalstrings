Ron Paul: How badly does GOP need his voters?
But the second one just isn’t going to happen, as BuzzFeed’s Rosie Gray explains .
After this presidential run, [Ron Paul’s] campaign has said he’ll retire. And when he does, a generation of loyalists will need a leader.
“I think [Ron’s son and Kentucky Senator] Rand could be a wonderful president,” said Jesse Benton, the Paul campaign chairman and husband of Rand Paul ’s niece.
In the meantime, the family’s dreams for Rand have created something else: A hostage. Terrified Republican leaders worry that Ron Paul will take his rowdy mix of Republicans and independents and run a spoiler third party campaign he hasn’t quite ruled out. Ron Paul, they are making clear, has nothing to lose – but his son’s career.
“The question of Rand’s future hangs over the 2012 race in a real way,” said John McCain ’s 2008 campaign manager, Steve Schmidt .“If [Ron Paul] were to leave the GOP it would have a crushing effect on his son’s political career in the Republican Party and would be ruinous to any chance of a serious national campaign under the Republican banner.”
And while Ron Paul hasn’t ruled out a third party bid, his aides insist it won’t happen. Inside the Paul clan, Rand’s generation is rising, and the dream is a new kind of Paul campaign: One that’s dead serious, a tick or two closer to the mainstream, and one that wins.
