...but also deliver the Republican nomination gift-wrapped to Mitt Romney.
Romney will have the nomination no matter what happens. It's his turn.

yes, romney is the man the gop want. he might loose (or win) vs. obama, but the banks won't care.
the central banks seem to run the world now, and they just need a cheerleader in the white house.
gingrich, i guess, might be the tea party's answer to romney, but like this page says, that choice is very short-sighted.
paul on the other hand seems to be the future of the GOP. yeah, he's a bit much sometimes, but he reps the more interesting ideas, and stands for freedom (which seems to scare people these days.) but if the economy does in fact collapse, the paulian movement will just get bigger. paulites are also young, and i think once the neocon ideology fades (and it will; it's too paranoid to last) future republicans will have tweeked paul's general ideas, give him is just due, and restore the constitution.
it might take a few cycles to get this done, but the structural problems facing america (FED, wages vs china) will not be solved by more welfare or wars. both parties are the walking dead at the moment, and it's the reason a 76 yearold outsider commands so much attention. if he wins Iowa...
btw. there is nothing much israel or the usa can do to stop a nulcear iran. china and russia would flip. what the war mongering about is beyond me. there is no money left for war.

Look, I agree with Ron Paul on ending the stupid government handouts to corporations, but he is just so wrong on so many things.
First, it is stupid to legalize drugs. People get addicted to them and then they impose huge costs on the rest of us that we have to pay. I don't want my kids being able to get high at school because Ron Paul tells them its okay.
Second, his foreign policy isolationist views are just crazy! I mean, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, then the whole world is fucked. Does he seriously think we would be able to avoid being involved in a war between Iran and Israel? Isolation has never been an efective policy.
Newt is the only serious conservative candidate running, and we should all support him to avoid Owebama getting another term!

Yeah, I was trolling the HuffPo comments section earlier. They are much easier, you guys are getting too hard to fool what with Dunphy et al. doing most of my job for me.
Hopefully this site gets some fresh blood if/when Ron Paul does well in the primaries.

Yes, because alcohol has been getting elementary students drunk in school for decades...
Second, his foreign policy isolationist views are just crazy! I mean, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, then the whole world is fucked. Does he seriously think we would be able to avoid being involved in a war between Iran and Israel? Isolation has never been an efective policy.
If Pakistan/China/North Korea gets a nuclear weapon the whole world is fucked...oh wait...and why are you so sure Iran and Israel are just about to fight a war that we'll for some reason need to get involved in.
But then again, I forget. Convenient fictions and wild imagination is what this nation needs more than facts and logic.
Newt is serious...as a fucking fiscal heart attack.

i think you got your facts wrong.
Ron Paul does not want to legalize drugs. He wants it to be handled at the state level.
Ron Paul is not an isolationist, he is a non-interventionist. Big difference. He wants to trade freely with all countries.
And where is the proof that Iran is building a nuke? Remember all the "proof" of WMDs in Iraq?

Re: TrueConservativeSocialist,

The same argument could be applied to just about everything we humans do. You're not arguing anything.
Second, his foreign policy isolationist views are just crazy!
Not wanting to send troops to some backwater shithole to kill brownpeople while we are extorted out of our money to pay for it is hardly an "isolationist" policy.
I mean, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, then the whole world is fucked.
Yeah, that makes sense - not that the country that actually USED nuclear weapons not once, but TWICE, fuck up the world by having them. Nah, it would have to be the mighty Persians.

Nationalistic jingoism is hardly a non-Progressive, non-morally relativistic stance, T.
Iran is not anything like the United states[.]
You're absolutely right - the US has killed far more people than the Iranians. They're certainly not equivalent.
[...] and would not hesitate to use their nuclear weapons to wreak havoc!
They don't have even ONE, let alone many, you nitwit.

Korea and Vietnam were necessary but regrettable wars against communism-- now we have a new existential threat called fundamentalism islam that we have to take seriously if we want to survice as a civilization. But you probably think that we should just arrest terrorists and give them the same privileges we give citizens! What a joke!

The reason the world has been less warlike now than in the past has nthoing to do with us being benevolent. It has everything to do with the fact that we would fuck up whoever upset the order that we created. Now knowing that, it means that whether or not we had troops in Korea, Germany, or Iraq wouldn't make a difference. As long as no one can rival us on the seas or in space there will be peace, as long as we wish there to be peace.

Gingrich a conservative! Ha that is the funniest thing I've heard all month. I've been responsible for convincing five independents and democrats to register as republicans just so they can vote for Paul. Imagine if every Paul supporter did the same. Who do you think will win? And my thinking is I haven't done enough.

A newt is characterised by a frog-like body with four equal sized limbs and a distinct tail. They have true teeth on both upper and lower jaws, and external gills. They have the ability to regenerate limbs, eyes, spinal cords, hearts, intestines, and upper and lower jaws.
Doesn't sound like presidential material to me.

I happen to enjoy most of Paul's planks, but I get the feeling that most of the commenters on this site go more for the reasoning & exchange of ideas as opposed to the "shameless" RON PAUL 2012!! Might want to make the arguements and endorsements a little more subtle.

Paul is all bone and sinew and nervous energy – an Ichabod Crane or a Jack Sprat, hunched and herky-jerky in too-large suits. Gingrich is broad and self-assured and faintly decadent, with a Cheshire Cat’s face and a body that looks like it’s ready for its toga.
