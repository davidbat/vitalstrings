Take a look at what happened last time!
The Boston Tea Party helped ignite the American Revolution 234 years ago
On Sunday, December 16th, 2007, Americans "dumped" over
$6.04 Million
(The largest one day political donation ever!)
into the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign
A total of 58,407 Americans just like you donated an average of               $102
to protest the oppressive and unconstitutional inflation tax -
which has enabled a flawed foreign policy, a costly war
and the sacrificing of our liberties here at home.
The new American REVOLution               has begun!
This time the revolution will not be fought with bullets, but               with ballots...
not with muskets, but with sound ideas & principles.
Those ideas & principles are embodied in the
Presidential Campaign of Congressman Ron Paul.
Liberty is lost through complacency...America was born of protest [and] revolution...
- Congressman Ron Paul, August 9, 2004
