Welcome     to Thanksgiving activities and crafts for toddlers, preschool and kindergarten (ages 2 to     6).  You will find printable crafts and activities, and related resources.  Most of the activities below are suitable to celebrate Thanksgiving in     Canada - the second Monday in October, or in the U.S.A., the fourth Thursday     in November.  
I would love to hear your kind comments and ideas to make     this a better site.
