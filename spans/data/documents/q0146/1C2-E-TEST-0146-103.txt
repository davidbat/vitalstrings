Thanksgiving in Canada
Today it was my Thanksgiving dinner. Here in Canada we have Thanksgiving in October, I know our southern neighbors have Thanksgiving in November we just get to see the football scores from work that day.
Two things that I noticed at dinner today, we had the big spread with lots of people and even more food. We of course have a couple of drinks before dinner, graze for a while rest for a while and then have pie. This is probably the worst way to eat as the meal takes a few hours and is thousands of calories.
My wife had no food before dinner and just drank water, she had a little of everything at dinner and then after dinner had a fork full of my pie and that was it. On the way home she was saying how great all the food was while I was complaining about how much I had to eat this afternoon and evening. I bet Michelle also sleeps better tonight and feels better tomorrow morning as well.
Some people have until tomorrow to think about this and the rest of you do not have to worry about it until next month.
There are two ways to lose that weight. Through Diet alone and through Diet and Exercise.
Fat Loss for Idiots
is the other alternative. A great diet that calls for just a little walking for exercise. Read my review of the Fat Loss for Idiots review. See if you can lose 9 pounds in 11 days and find out what Cycled Eating is.
Burn the Fat Feed the Muscle
is an exercise and diet program. My review of Burn the Fat shows that it is designed and written by an ex-pro natural bodybuilder but is a system that was written for regular guys and gals. Teaching you how to workout and eat to lose weight.
