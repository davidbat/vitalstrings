History of Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving day is celebrated mainly in America             and Canada. Much like the annual harvest festivals celebrated in             other countries throughout the world, Thanksgiving Day was meant to             pay our homage to the Almighty for this bountiful harvest. While the             purpose and origin of the concept remains the same, the day of its             celebration differs from country to country. In the United States,             the holiday is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November while             in Canada (which has an early harvest cycle and season), the holiday             is observed on the second Monday in October, known as the Columbus             Day. Much like the Christian Thanksgiving day, it is celebrated with             pomp and show.
This year, Thanksgiving Day will be celebrated on 10th October 2005             in Canada and 24th November 2005 in the US. Since 1930, the end of             Thanksgiving season marks the beginning of Christmas shopping             season. In Canada, Thanksgiving holiday lasts for only three days             but the time period may vary in the US. Let's have a look at the             brief history of Thanksgiving in North America, U.S. and Canada:
In North America:
Thanksgiving Day was first celebrated on September 8, 1565 in St.             Augustine when Pedro Menendez de Aviles and his men shared a feast             with the natives. After that Pilgrims held a three days feast to             make merriment on their enormous harvest.
In United States:
The immigrants who sailed to this country aboard the Mayflower were             basically members of the English Separatist Church (a Puritan sect).             They took shelter in Netherlands but soon were disgusted by their             lifestyle. They settled in United States with a desire for a better             lifestyle. But their beginning was horrendous. The climate was             unfavorable and many of them died. But in 1621 they hard turmoil             bore fruits for them as there was a huge harvest. They celebrated it             with a feast with 91 Indians who had helped them during their harsh             times.
Thanksgiving was celebrated after that at irregular intervals until             Franklin Roosevelt, had set it one week to the next-to-last Thursday             of November in order keeping an eye on commercial benefits as             Christmas was nearby. Allegations were brought against this             decision, which made the President to move Thanksgiving back to its             original date two years later. And in 1941, Thanksgiving was finally             sanctioned by Congress as a legal holiday, as the fourth Thursday in             November.
In Canada:
Probably the Americans who migrated to Canada after American             Independence brought with them the practices of Thanksgiving.             Initially it was celebrated in English Canadian Society but later it             became a countrywide practice. Formally, Canadian Thanksgiving Day             was celebrated on April 5, 1872 on behalf of the Prince of Wales'             recovery from illness. Innumerable transformations took place before             the date of celebration finally settled on the second Monday in             October in 1957.
