Thanksgiving is a special holiday for both Americans and Canadians.
Thanksgiving is a day to give thanks and is not based on a historical date like Christmas. So, the entire world does not celebrate Thanksgiving and even those that do frequently celebrate on different dates than the United States. Canada is a perfect example.
This festival is celebrated in much the same way in both countries, although in Canada Thanksgiving is always celebrated on the second Monday of October whereas in the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.
Though the exact date is unknown, the first Thanksgiving clearly took place in late autumn.
Canadas Thanksgiving is based on a bountiful harvest and not on the Pilgrims and the New World like the Unites States holiday. The reason it occurs earlier than the US Thanksgiving is that Canada is north of the United States and because of this the harvest season occurs earlier during the year. So, it only makes sense for Canada to celebrate its fall harvest during their fall and harvest time!
