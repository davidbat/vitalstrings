How we celebrate Thanksgiving in Canada
We celebrate in Thanksgiving in Canada on the second Monday in October. We celebrate earlier then some countries. On thanksgiving day, all our family gathers together and give thanks or what we have in life. We say a prayer around the table, then we have a big feast. We have a delicious turkey, carrots, potatoes, cabbage, beet, mustard pickles, turnip, green peas, stuffing, and lots more. In Newfoundland, most families will cook a big Jiggs dinner with a turkey! Yummy! Most families enjoy a pumpkin pie or desert. In our family, the children do a thanksgiving play while the adults drink their tea. Families go to church because of their religious beliefs. The first thanksgiving in Canada was because of the plentiful harvest in the fall. The farmers would gather and share stories and prayers. They would give thanks to god for their harvest to make money and feed their families. In 1957, the Government of Canada announced that the second Monday in October would be a national holiday, thanksgiving day.
