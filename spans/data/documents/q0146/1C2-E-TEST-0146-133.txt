This low-carb stuffing sounds wonderful…and pretty easy to make.  It is such a good idea to incorporate some low-carb/healthy options into your Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanksgiving is definitely a holiday when we over indulge.  By adding some healthier options, we don’t have to feel as guilty.  I am always in search of delicious and easy to make low-carb recipes.  I work with Better Recipes.com; if you are looking for the same for the holiday, I would definitely recommend checking out their Low-Carb Thanksgiving Recipes
