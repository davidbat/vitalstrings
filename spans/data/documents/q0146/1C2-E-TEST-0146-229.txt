Tablescape Thursday ~ Our Canadian Thanksgiving…
October 12, 2011 by Ellen
It has been a long time since I participated in Tablescape Thursday with Susan at Between Naps on the Porch . We decided to celebrate both Canadian and U.S.A. Thanksgiving this year so I decorated the table and invited some family over for a less traditional meal.
I was happy to be able to use these green and amber goblets together.
The transferware have stable scenes on them and stagecoach scenes.
My sister and her husband joined Dear, Katie and me for our meal of Honey Baked Ham, candied carrots, scalloped potatoes, asparagus casserole, rolls. We had a simple dessert of ice cream to finish off the meal. We also test tasted some white wines to narrow down our choice for the wedding in March. We’ve already chosen the red wine.
I’m looking forward to coming around and seeing some old bloggy friends and your tablescapes this week.
