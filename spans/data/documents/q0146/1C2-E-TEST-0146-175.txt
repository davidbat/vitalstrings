Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated in North America, generally observed          as an expression of gratitude. The most common view of its origin is that          it was to give thanks to God for the bounty of the autumn harvest. In          the United States, the holiday is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in          November. In Canada, where the harvest generally ends earlier in the year,          the holiday is celebrated on the second Monday in October, which is observed          as Columbus Day in the United States.
Traditional Celebration
Thanksgiving is traditionally celebrated with a feast shared amongst          family and friends. In the United States, it is an important family holiday,          and people often travel across the country to be with family members for          the holiday. The Thanksgiving holiday is generally a "four-day" weekend in the United States, in which Americans are given the relevant          Thursday and Friday off. Thanksgiving is almost entirely celebrated at home, unlike the Fourth of July or Christmas, which are associated with          a variety of shared public experiences (fireworks, caroling, etc.)
In Canada, Thanksgiving is only a three-day weekend, and the holiday is          not as important as in the US. Because of the shortened break there is          far less travel during Canada's Thanksgiving and it is far harder for          families to come together. Additionally, while the actual Thanksgiving          holiday is on a Monday, Canadians may eat their Thanksgiving meal on any          day of that three day weekend. This often means celebrating a meal with          one group of relatives on one day, and another meal with a different group          of relatives on another day. Christmas is far more family oriented in          Canada than it is in the United States.
Since at least the 1930s, the Christmas shopping season technically begins          when Thanksgiving ends. In New York City, the Macy's (department store)          Thanksgiving Day Parade is held annually every Thanksgiving Day in Midtown          Manhattan. The parade features moving stands with specific themes, scenes          from Broadway plays, large balloons of cartoon characters and TV personalities,          and high school marching bands. It always ends with the image of Santa          Claus passing the reviewing stand. Thansgiving parades also occur in other          cities like Plymouth, Houston, Philadelphia, which claims the oldest parade,          Detroit where it is the only major parade of the year.
While the second-biggest day of shopping of the year in the U.S. is still          the Black Friday after Thanksgiving (the biggest is now the Saturday before          Christmas), most shops start to stock for and promote the holidays immediately          after Halloween, and sometimes even before.
U.S. tradition associates the holiday with a meal held in 1621 by the          Wampanoag and the Pilgrims who settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Some          of the details of the American Thanksgiving story are myths that developed          in the 1890s and early 1900s as part of the effort to forge a common national          identity in the aftermath of the Civil War and in the melting pot of new          immigrants.
The history of Thanksgiving in North America
Thanksgiving is closely related to harvest festivals that had long been          a traditional holiday in much of Europe. The first time one of these festivals          was celebrated in North American was by the Frobisher Expedition in 1578.          Another event claiming to be the first Thanksgiving occurred on December          4, 1619 when 38 colonists from Berkeley Parish in England disembarked          in Virginia and gave thanks to God.
Most people recognize the first Thanksgiving as taking place on an unremembered          date, sometime in the autumn of 1621, when the Pilgrims held a three-day          feast to celebrate the bountiful harvest they reaped following their first          winter in North America.
Two American colonists have personal accounts of the 1621 Thanksgiving          in Massachusetts:
William Bradford, in Of Plymouth Plantation:
They began now to gather in the small harvest they had, and to              fit up their house and dwelling against winter, being all well recovered              in health and strength and had all things in good plenty. For as some              were thus employed in affairs abroad, others were exercised in fishing,              about cod and bass and other fish, of which they took good store,              of which every family had their portion. All the summer there was              no want; and now began to come in store of fowl, as winter approached,              of which this place did abound when they came first (but afterward              decreased by degrees). And besides waterfowl there was great store              of wild turkeys, of which they took many, besides venison, etc. Besides,              they had about a peck of meal a week to a person, or now since harvest,              Indian corn to that proportion. Which made many afterwards write so              largely of their plenty here to their friends in England, which were              not feigned by true reports.
Edward Winslow, in Mourt's Relation:
Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling,              that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we              had gathered the fruits of our labor. They four in one day killed              as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost              a week. At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our              arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their              greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days              we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer,              which we brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and              upon the captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful              as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are              so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty.
The Pilgrims did not hold Thanksgiving again until 1623, when it followed          a drought, prayers for rain and a subsequent rain shower. Irregular Thanksgivings          continued after favorable events and days of fasting after unfavorable          ones. Gradually an annual Thanksgiving after the harvest developed in          the mid-1600s. This did not occur on any set day or necessarily on the          same day in different colonies.
Some, including historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., point out that          the first time colonists from Europe gave thanks in what would become          the United States was on December 4, 1619, in Berkeley, Virginia. That          was when the thirty-eight members of The Berkeley Company landed there          after a three-month voyage in the Margaret. Having been recruited from          Gloucestershire to establish a colony in the New World, the men were under          orders to give thanks when they arrived, so the first thing they did was          to kneel down and do so.
Thanksgiving in the United States
George Washington, leader of the revolutionary forces in the American          Revolutionary War, proclaimed a Thanksgiving in December 1777 as a victory          celebration honoring the defeat of the British at Saratoga. The Continental          Congress proclaimed annual December Thanksgivings from 1777 to 1783, except          in 1782.
George Washington again proclaimed Thanksgivings, now as President, in          1789 and 1795. President John Adams declared Thanksgivings in 1798 and          1799, and President James Madison declared the holiday twice in 1815;          however, none of these were celebrated in autumn.
It was President Abraham Lincoln that set the holiday as a regular yearly          event for the final Thursday of November in 1863.
In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared that Thanksgiving          would be the penultimate Thursday of November rather than the last. This          was to give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas;          at the time it was considered inappropriate to advertise goods for Christmas          until after Thanksgiving. However, Roosevelt's declaration was not mandatory;          some states went along with this recommendation and others did not. The          United States Congress in 1941 split the difference and established that          the holiday would occur annually on the fourth Thursday of November, which          was sometimes the last Thursday and sometimes the next to last. On November          26 that year President Roosevelt signed this bill into US law.
Since 1970 some American Indians and others have held a National Day          of Mourning protest on Thanksgiving at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
Thanksgiving in Canada
Canadians trace the holiday to a feast held by Martin Frobisher in Newfoundland          in 1578. It is also probable that American loyalists who emigrated to          Canada after American independence brought with them many of their Thanksgiving          traditions.
The Thanksgiving celebration was held occasionally in English areas of          British North America in the eighteenth century, especially in Nova Scotia.          The holiday rose to much greater prominence with the arrival of the United          Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. The holiday became entrenched          in English Canadian society. In 1879 Canada's parliament declared Thanksgiving          to be a national secular holiday. This date was moved several times, finally          being set on its current date in 1957.
Thanksgiving Dinner
The centerpiece of the contemporary American Thanksgiving is a large          dinner (a.k.a. supper), starring a large roasted turkey. Because turkey          is the most common main dish of a Thanksgiving dinner, thanksgiving is          sometimes called 'Turkey Day'. The USDA estimated that 269 million turkeys          were raised in the country in 2003, about one-sixth of which were headed          for a Thanksgiving dinner plate.
Many other foods are served alongside the turkey, so many that, because          of the amount of food, the Thanksgiving meal is generally served midday          or early afternoon to make time for all the eating, and preparation may          begin at the crack of dawn or days before.
Traditional Thanksgiving foods are sometimes specific to the day, and          although some of the foods might be seen at any semi-formal meal in the          United States, the meal often has something of ritualistic, traditionalistic          quality.
Commonly served dishes include cranberry sauce, gravy, mashed potatoes,          green beans and stuffing. For dessert, various pies are served, particularly          pumpkin pie, strawberry-rhubarb pie and pecan pie. Other dishes reflect          the region or cultural background of those who have come together for          the meal. For example, Italian-Americans often have lasagna on the table          and Ashkenazi Jews may serve noodle kugel, a sweet pudding. Another common          Thanksgiving dish is candied yams.
There are also regional differences as to the "stuffing" (or "dressing") traditionally served with the turkey. Southerners          generally make theirs from cornbread, while in other parts of the country          white bread is the base, to which oysters, apples, chestnuts, or the turkey's          giblets may be added. These eating patterns are very similar in Canada.
Foods other than turkey are sometimes served as the main dish for a Thanksgiving          dinner. On the West Coast of the US, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate          main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Turducken, a turkey          stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken, is becoming more popular,          from its base in Louisiana. Deep-fryed turkey is rising in popularity,          requiring special fryers to hold the large bird.
