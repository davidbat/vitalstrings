I see the Resident restaurant  in Old Montreal still has the minithanksgivng menu listed, their miniature version so praised in past:   La mini assiette d’Action de Grâce ................................................................................................................. 23 $
Mini Thanksgiving Dinner
I hope they keep it on for awhile as it sounds intriguing, might give it a try next weekend when family visit
On the radio they were discussing family excusions to Quinn farm and stocking up on their homemade pumpkin pie, I know we are past the Canadian Thanksgiving but it all is good fall feasting and the American thanksgiving is coming up
