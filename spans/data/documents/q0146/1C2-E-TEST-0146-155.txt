Thanksgiving Gift Baskets
Thanksgiving in Canada marks the end of summer and draws us into the abundance of the harvest!  Turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie… All wonderful scents and colours of the season. When you can’t join them for Thanksgiving send an autumn gift basket from our collection instead.  Whatever the occasion our fall gift baskets are the perfect way to give thanks. We thank nature for the inspiration of the brilliant colours of the leaves and the warming scents of fall spices. Please enjoy browsing through our interpretation of autumn!
