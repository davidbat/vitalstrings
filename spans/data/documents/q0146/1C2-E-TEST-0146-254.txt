Thanksgiving Day is a harvest festival. Traditionally, it is a time to give  thanks for the harvest and express gratitude in general. It is a holiday  celebrated primarily in the United States and Canada.
The date and location of the first Thanksgiving celebration in the United  States is a topic of modest contention. Though the earliest attested  Thanksgiving celebration was on September 8, 1565 in what is now Saint  Augustine, Florida, the traditional "first Thanksgiving" is venerated as having  occurred at the site of Plymouth Plantation, in 1621. Earlier still was the  first formal Thanksgiving in Canada when explorer Martin Frobisher, who had been  trying to find a northern passage to the Pacific Ocean held a formal ceremony,  in what is now the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, to give thanks for  surviving the long journey in 1578. The feast was one of the first Thanksgiving  celebrations by Europeans in North America.
Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the  United States and on the second Monday of October in Canada. Thanksgiving dinner  is held on this day, or over the course of the associated weekend in Canada,  usually as a gathering of family members and friends.
