Happy Thanksgiving Canada!
Happy Thanksgiving to all my Canadian family and friends. Early though it is, I have a feeling most of you are already hard at work in the kitchen producing a fabulous dinner of epic proportions. Alas, there's no turkey cooking in our kitchen today so I thought we'd do a little reminiscing instead and pass along a few ideas of what to do with some of the yummy leftovers you're bound to have.
The first thing that comes to mind in our house is using some spare bird pieces to make a glorious little pot pie. It should be no surprise there are several versions on this site - we happen to love the things,Â  so just use up some of that turkey bird and wow your family with one of these.
