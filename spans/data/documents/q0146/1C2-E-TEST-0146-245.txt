Hi Sooj O.,
I saw the Chowhound post earlier this AM ... was thinking it sounded potentially "Americanized" as far as T-Day dinners went. Still holding out for a French Canadian meal...fingers crossed!
Thanks for the reply tho!

This makes me wonder... The "Americanized" Thanksgiving has been around since the 1500's... the Canadian thanksgiving was created in the 1950's.
So do you guys eat turkey like your American neighbors? Or did you reinvent it for yourselves?
