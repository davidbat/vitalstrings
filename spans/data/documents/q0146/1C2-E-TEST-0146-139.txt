Rockview Camp Cottage Resort - Callander
Canadian Thanksgiving is a special time for harvest feasts and   family gatherings. The second Monday in October (October 11, 2010), allows for a   scenic colourful long weekend when heading north. A number of   destinations and resorts bring the fall colours to life with displays of   pumpkins, coloured leaves, corn stalks, scarecrows, and bales of hay. On your fall colour   road trip north stop at a Farmers'   Markets or road side stand and celebrate the harvest and Ontario's farm   fresh produce. You will find specialty fall food items served at resorts and   restaurants north of Toronto. A number of Thanksgiving getaway resort long   weekend packages are listed below. Consider a Thanksgiving Fall Studio Tour or October Fall Fair during your weekend getaway.
