Thanksgiving                                           Day , legal holiday in the U.S., first                                           celebrated in early colonial times in                                           New England. The actual origin,                                           however, is probably the harvest                                           festivals that are traditional in many                                           parts of the world Festivals and                                           Feasts. After the first harvest was                                           completed by the Plymouth colonists in                                           1621, Governor William Bradford                                           proclaimed a day of thanksgiving and                                           prayer, shared by all the colonists                                           and neighboring Native Americans. The                                           Pilgrims of Plymouth Rock held their                                           Thanksgiving in 1621 as a three day "thank you" celebration to                                           the leaders of the Wampanoag Indian                                           tribe and their families for teaching                                           them the survival skills they needed                                           to make it in the New World. It was                                           their good fortune that the tradition                                           of the Wampanoags was to treat any                                           visitor to their homes with a share of                                           whatever food the family had, even if                                           supplies were low. It was also an                                           amazing stroke of luck that one of the                                           Wampanoag, Tisquantum or Squanto, had                                           become close friends with a British                                           explorer, John Weymouth, and had                                           learned the Pilgrim's language in his                                           travels to England with Weymouth.
After                                           the first New England Thanksgiving the                                           custom spread throughout the colonies,                                           but each region chose its own date. In                                           1789 George Washington, the first                                           president of the United States,                                           proclaimed November 26 a day of                                           Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving day continued to be                                           celebrated in the United States on                                           different days in different states                                           until Mrs. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor                                           of Godey's Lady's Book, decided to do                                           something about it. For more than 30                                           years she wrote letters to the                                           governors and presidents asking them                                           to make Thanksgiving Day a national                                           holiday.
Finally, in 1863, President Lincoln issued a White House proclamation                                           calling on the "whole American                                           people" wherever they lived to                                           unite "with one heart and one                                           voice" in observing a special day                                           of thanksgiving. Setting apart the                                           last Thursday of November for the                                           purpose, the President urged prayers                                           in the churches and in the homes to "implore the interposition of the                                           almighty had to heal the wounds of the                                           nations and to restore it...to full                                           enjoyment of peace, harmony,                                           tranquility and union." He also                                           states that they express heartfelt                                           thanks for the "blessing of                                           fruitful fields and healthful                                           skies."
In 1939 President Franklin D.                                           Roosevelt advanced Thanksgiving Day                                           one week. However, since some states                                           used the new date and others the old,                                           it was changed again 2 years later.                                           Thanksgiving Day is now celebrated on                                           the fourth Thursday in November.
The first formal celebration of Thanksgiving in North America was held                                           by an English explorer, Martin                                           Frobisher, who attempted to establish                                           an English settlement on Baffin                                           Island, after failing to discover a                                           northern passage to the Orient in                                           1576. Canada established the second                                           Monday in October as a national                                           holiday, "a day of general                                           thanksgiving," in 1957.
In 1817 New York State adopted                                           Thanksgiving Day as an annual custom.                                           By the middle of the 19th century many                                           other states also celebrated a                                           Thanksgiving Day. In 1863 President                                           Abraham Lincoln appointed a national                                           day of thanksgiving. Since then each                                           president has issued a Thanksgiving                                           Day proclamation, usually designating                                           the fourth Thursday of each November                                           as the holiday.
Why                                                     Turky
The                                           turkey tradition was really pushed by                                           Benjamin Franklin, who wanted to make                                           it the United States national symbol                                           because it is a quick runner, wary,                                           with sharp eyesight, and exhibited a                                           regal stance, at least to Franklin.                                           While the bald eagle nudged out the                                           wild turkey for our official national                                           symbol, Norman Rockwell has probably                                           made the image of the family                                           Thanksgiving turkey even more famous,                                           and certainly more mouth watering.
Tradition
The American traditions of                                                     Thanksgiving revolve around                                                     a huge and lavish meal,                                                     usually with Turkey as the                                                     centerpiece. For those who                                                     do not like Turkey, a Roast                                                     or Prime Rib is common. As                                                     tradition has it in most                                                     families, a special prayer                                                     of thanks precedes the meal.                                                     In many homes, family                                                     members will each mention                                                     something they are very                                                     thankful for. 
Thanksgiving is a time for                                                     families to create                                                     traditions and memories that                                                     last a lifetime.
