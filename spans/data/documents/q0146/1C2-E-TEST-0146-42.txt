Thursday, November 28th
In Canada:
The Canadian Thanksgiving is celebrated on             the second Monday of the month (the reason for the earlier date in             October is their earlier harvest occurring farther to the north).
The Canadian holiday comes from different traditions although it is now meant to convey thanks for their harvest.
