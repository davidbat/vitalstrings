Traditions
Â 
Thanksgiving is all about togetherness, love & giving thanks for all our blessings ! It is a time for celebrations... a time for family, friends, fun & of course 'turkey'. On Canadian Thanksgiving, reach out to all your friends, family members, colleagues & acquaintances with a special message.
In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday in October. Unlike the American tradition of remembering Pilgrims and settling in the New World, Canadians give thanks for a successful harvest. The harvest season falls earlier in Canada compared to the United States due to the simple fact that Canada is further north.
In 1957, Parliament announced that on the second Monday in October that Thanksgiving would be "a day of general thanksgiving to almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed."
