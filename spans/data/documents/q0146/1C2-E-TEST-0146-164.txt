About Thanksgiving
American Thanksgiving commemorates pilgrims from England surviving their first brutal New England winter with the help of Native Americans. During the winter of 1620 most of the pilgrims stayed on the Mayflower where half of the 102 passengers died from scurvy and exposure.  When they came ashore in spring, they were greeted by English speaking natives from the Abenaki and Pawtuxet tribes who showed them how to hunt, fish and farm. That fall, the Pilgrims invited their new found friends for a three day long feast which probably included deer, lobster, fish, and all types of fowl.
