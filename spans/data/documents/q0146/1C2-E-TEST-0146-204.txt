Find the Thanksgiving words from the bottom in the Thanksgiving word search grid. The words can be forwards or backwards, vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Circle each letter separately, but keep in mind that letters may be used in more than one word. When the Canadian Thanksgiving word search puzzle is complete, read the remaining letters left to right, top to bottom, to learn an interesting Canadian Thanksgiving fact.
