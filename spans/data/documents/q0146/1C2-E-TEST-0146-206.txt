ok during day, dead at night
Canadian Thanksgiving isn't that big of a deal in Canada. American Thanksgiving tends to revolve more around historical events key to American history, like pilgrims arriving, etc... whereas, since Canada never had any pilgrims, Thanksgiving revolves more around the harvest season. Also, Thanksgiving in the USA appears to be central to bringing the entire family together under one roof... and it appears that you get more time off, so it's a busy weekend for travelling. Most Canadians do not fly away on Canadian Thanksgiving... as it's only a 3 day weekend. It's essentially an excuse to get together with some local family and eat a turkey. Most things will be open, but on holiday hours, although banks, schools, etc, will be closed on the holiday.
