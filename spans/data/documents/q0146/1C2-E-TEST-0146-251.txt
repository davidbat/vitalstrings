Question: What Holidays are Celebrated in Canada?
We share some holidays, but other holidays are uniquely Canadian, whether it be in the way they are celebrated, when they fall or what they represent.
Answer: Like the United States, Canada officially recognizes several Christian holidays, including Christmas, Good Friday and Easter. Canada, however, gives its citizens a few more days off to celebrate. For instance, the Monday after Easter is an official holiday, as is Boxing Day (the Feast of St. Stephen) on the day after Christmas.
While Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving , the holiday arises from a different set of circumstances and falls on a different date than the same-named holiday in the United States. In Canada, thanks is given on the second Monday in October for the 1872 recovery of the Prince of Wales from a serious illness.
Other Canadian Holidays:
Victoria Day on the Monday before May 25th celebrates Queen Victoria's birthday.
Canada Day on July 1st celebrates Canada's birthday.
Remembrance Day on November 11th is the official day of remembrance for those killed in World War I.
