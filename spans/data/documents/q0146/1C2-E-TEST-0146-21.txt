 
About Thanksgiving Canada
Thanksgiving in Canada is a three or four day weekend (Friday -                Sunday or Monday) It is a celebration of being thankful for what                one has and for the bounty of the previous year. Celebrations                include spending time with family, large family dinners, and                parades. Some celebrate it with a weekend getaway to enjoy the                autumn and outdoor activities before the winter. It corresponds to        the English and continental European Harvest festival.
