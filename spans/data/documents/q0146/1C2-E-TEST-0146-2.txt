Canadian Thanksgiving 2012 Overview
Like the United States, Canada gives thanks for its good fortune once a year and eats itself silly with turkey and mashed potatoes.
Whereas American Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, in Canada the second Monday of October is a statutory, or public, holiday. This year, Canadian Thanksgiving falls on Monday, Oct 8, 2012.
The Canadian Thanksgiving holiday is officially observed on the second Monday of October, however people generally get together for their Thanksgiving meal on any one of the three days of this three-day holiday weekend.
Although Canadians do tend to get together on Thanksgiving weekend, the holiday is not as big a celebration in Canada as it is in the U.S., where Thanksgiving is the year's biggest holiday occasion. Nevertheless, Thanksgiving weekend is a popular time for Canadians to gather with family, so more people than usual are traveling on that weekend.
In Quebec , Thanksgiving, or, action de gr√¢ce , is a bit different. Though celebrated by the English-speaking population in Quebec, French Canadians generally do not carry on with turkey and family get-togethers.
No Black Friday in Canada
Canada does not have a big shopping day after Thanksgiving the way the United States does. Boxing Day - December 26th - is the equivalent in terms of sales and shopping extravaganzas in Canada.
Like other public holidays in Canada , many businesses and services shut down, though Quebec sees fewer closures.
