When Do Canadians Celebrate Thanksgiving Day and What Is the Significance of Thanksgiving Day In Canada?
Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving Day, but their Thanksgiving is on the second Monday in October, not the fourth Thursday in November, as in the United States, because harvest time comes earlier in Canada.
Canadians do enjoy turkey, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, but they don’t associate their holiday with pilgrims and the landing of the Mayflower.
Instead, they refer back to the landing of Martin Frobisher from England at what is now Newfoundland in 1578, 43 years before the pilgrims landed in Massachusetts.
Although the original act of Parliament references God and the holiday is celebrated in churches, the holiday is also celebrated in a secular manner.
