Response to Mulgabob:
I was just making sure.  I'm from the US actually, and was planning to go there for a vacation during thanksgiving and check out a school in Montreal (to do the whole student-for-a-day thing) but wasn't sure if Canadians celeb. the US holiday or not.  If they do, then classes would be out that week...
anyway, that's why I asked.  I kind of guessed they do not, but wanted to verify.

and you never really know.  I mean, Americans celebrate cinco de mayo (I believe that's the Mexican indep. day, but I'm not well-informed on that particular holiday), so I thought maybe Canadians would celebrate TG too, being so close to the US geographically and all... >.<

LOL, thank you for all your responses.
I was unaware that Canada had it's own Thanksgiving (I was aware of some sort of similar holiday, but that it has the same name! lol)
