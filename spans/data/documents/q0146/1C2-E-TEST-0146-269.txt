As an American who has lived in Canada for sev­eral years, I don’t find myself miss­ing that much about the U.S.
I do miss my fam­ily and friends. Good Mexican food now and then. And maybe July 4th picnics.
But come the fourth week of November, I miss American Thanksgiving .
And when I talk with my expat friends here in Canada, many of them also say that Thanksgiving makes them home­sick.
Of course, Canada has its own Thanksgiving hol­i­day . But it’s just not the same big-​​deal event that turkey day is in the U.S.
So if you’re feel­ing home­sick in Canada this week, here are some tips for beat­ing the Thanksgiving blues:
Host your own Thanksgiving din­ner. Yes, I know every­one has to work on Thursday, but you can orga­nize a Thanksgiving meal on the weekend.
Volunteer. If you have a lot to be thank­ful for, share that hol­i­day cheer with oth­ers. For vol­un­teer oppor­tu­ni­ties, see Volunteer Canada , Volunteer Toronto , Go Volunteer Vancouver , Réseau de l’action bénév­ole du Québec , and Volunteer Alberta .
How do you cel­e­brate American Thanksgiving in Canada? Do you have ideas you can share with fel­low expats? Leave a com­ment below.
And wher­ever you are, have a happy American Thanksgiving!
