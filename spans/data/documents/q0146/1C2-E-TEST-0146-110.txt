In: Thanksgiving , Canada [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
Canada has an earlier harvest season than its neighbors to the south. Crops are usually all harvested by mid October therefore the celebration of Thanksgiving is during that month.
Many Canadian provinces also receive Remembrance day (November 11th) as a holiday. In order to break up the holidays, Thanksgiving was placed in October, between the two holidays Labour Day and Remembrance day.
There is also Canada's long association with Britain where the harvest cycle begins with Lammas Day (August 1st) ends at the autumnal equinox in late September. This time of year is associated with the celebration of bounty since the 6th century and is marked by church and laic celebrations
