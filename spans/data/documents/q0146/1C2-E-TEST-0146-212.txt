Thanksgiving Traditions in the United States of America
From a common celebration between Indians and Pilgrims to a religious gratefulness
In the United States of America, the celebration of Thanksgiving has started as a way to thank God and Indian people (Native Americans) for Pilgrim's first bountiful harvest. The celebration dates back from the XVIIth century, when puritan Pilgrims, who arrived from Great Britain at the American continent, died because of their ignorance in anything related to agriculture on the New Continent.
Squanto, who was an Indian, has provided the surviving Pilgrims with food and has taught them how to grow local vegetables, as well as given them lessons of trapping and fishing. Because, thanks to Squanto, their harvest was successful, Pilgrims spent three days praying and celebrating this huge success. Therefore, they invited Indians to share their meal and to seal frienship.
Naturally, the tradition to eat turkey on Thanksgiving comes from this very first celebration as turkey was the main meat they ate.
Although Thanksgiving hasn't been held each and every year and not always at the end of the month of November, the celebration quickly became a religious feast (and Pilgrims forgot about their friendship with Indians). President Franklin Roosevelt asked the Congress to declare Thanksgiving "legal holiday" and the Thanksgiving Day was officially established on the 4th Thursday of November.
When it comes to food, the most popular and traditional menu includes stuffed turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie. As for Thanksgiving symbols, they're cornucopias filled with flowers and fruits, wheat, corn, acorns and pumpkins.
Pressure Cooker Steams Healthy Potatoes and Carrots
Steamed veggies are more tasteful
When it comes to steamed vegetables, the best option is using a pressure cooker as it steams vegetables faster than any other means even faster than your microwave! In addition, pressure cookers preserve vitamines contained in vegetables; which ensures that you always serve healthy meals.

Thanksgiving Traditions in Canada
Thanking God for a bountiful harvest
Thanksgiving celebrations in Canada don't have the same signification than in the USA. In reality, the first Canadian Thanksgiving celebrations were observed because an English explorer survived to his journey on the ocean.
The Canadian Thanksgiving is also celebrated at the same time as the harvest celebrations in Europe. Although European harvest celebrations are totally secular and originate from pagan traditions, since the 1950's Canadian Thanksgiving is, however, intended to thank God for the bountiful harvest.
Traditional Thanksgiving Day in Canada falls on a Monday; which allows Canadians to gather their families for a three-day weekend of enjoyment. After the main meal, Canadians have made a tradition to watch the Thanksgiving Day Classic football competition. In addition to activities indoors and the family dinner, the weekend is also the occasion to take a last big outdoor pleasure.
Besides family gatherings, Thanksgiving in Canada is also the opportunity to watch or take part to dozens of Thanksgiving Day parades which are part of the enjoyment in the end of the summer air. For some, Thanksgiving weekend is also the chance to take that last outside getaway before the arrival of a long cold winter.
