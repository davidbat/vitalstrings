Thanksgiving Day is                celebrated on the second                Monday of October. It is                a statutory holiday                throughout all of Canada                except the Atlantic                provinces (New                Brunswick, Newfoundland                and Labrador, Nova                Scotia, and Prince                Edward Island).
Before the first                Europeans arrived in                North America, the                farmers in Europe would                hold celebrations at                harvest time. To give                thanks for their good                fortune and the                abundance of food, the                farm workers filled a                curved goat's horn with                fruit and grain. This                symbol was called a                cornucopia or "horn of                plenty". When they came                to Canada they brought                this tradition with                them.
The first North American                Thanksgiving was                celebrated in 1578 when                the English Navigator,                Martin Frobisher, held a                formal ceremony in what                is now called                Newfoundland, to give                thanks for surviving his                long sea journey. Other                settlers arrived after                him and continued these                ceremonies.
During the American                Revolution, Americans                who remained loyal to                England moved to Canada                where they brought the                customs and practices of                the American Thanksgiving to Canada. There are                many similarities                between the two                Thanksgivings such as                the cornucopia and the                pumpkin pie.
The first Thanksgiving                Day in Canada after                Confederation was                observed on April 15,                1872, to celebrate the                recovery of The Prince                of Wales (later King                Edward VII) from a                serious illness. In                1879, Parliament                declared November 6th a national holiday of                Thanksgiving.
Over the years many                dates were used for                Thanksgiving, the most                popular was the 3rd Monday in October. After                World War I, both                Armistice Day and                Thanksgiving were                celebrated on the Monday                of the week in which                November 11th occurred. Ten years                later, in 1931, the two                days became separate                holidays and Armistice                Day was renamed Remembrance Day .                Finally, on January 31st,                1957, Parliament                declared the second                Monday in October of                each year to be "A Day                of General Thanksgiving                to Almighty God for the                bountiful harvest with                which Canada has been                blessed".
Most families in Canada celebrate Thanksgiving                with a special dinner                for family and friends.                The dinner usually                includes a roasted                turkey and pumpkin pie.                Thanksgiving provides an                opportunity to look at                pioneer life, and it is                an ideal time to                celebrate the importance                of Canadian farmers for                all Canadians.
