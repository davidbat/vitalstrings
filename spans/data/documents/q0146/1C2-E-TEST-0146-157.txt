True
Card Message
When you smell the autumn in the breeze,  And the grass drinks full the morning dew,  When the children wash in piles of leaves,  And the morning sun rises new for you Thats when you know that life is beautiful,  When every wrong becomes a right.  Thats when the world is fresh and wonderful,  And nights cold rain welcomes suns warm light.    When the painter colors the autumn tree,  And the harvest moon cools summers sky,  When the leaves give way for all to see,  And your life doesnt need a reason why Thats when you know that life is beautiful,  And what matters is not whats bought or planned.  That's when you see what is true and bountiful,  And the love in your heart is in the palm of your hand.    Have a beautiful Thanksgiving Receiver(s)
