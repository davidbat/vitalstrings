If you have a sweet tooth, then this is something that you should have in your Canadian Thanksgiving menu. This delightful mousse is characterized by the blending of whole berry cranberry sauce with pineapple. Nutmeg spices it up a bit, pecans add a crunch, while the lemon juice highlights the subtle tartness of this mousse. A completely thrilling gastronomical experience indeed.
                      
                                                                                                   
7. Spiced Cranberry Relish
I'm told that the Canadians get grumpy if they see no cranberry on their table, especially on Thanksgiving. The oranges and sweet spices really balance out the flavor of tart, fresh cranberries. This spiced cranberry relish is best if served as a light, palate cleansing, final dessert.
