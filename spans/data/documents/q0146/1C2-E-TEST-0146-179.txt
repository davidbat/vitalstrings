+ Posted by Jeff Rubenstein // Sr. Social Media Manager
We wish a football, GT5, and turkey-filled Thanksgiving to you from SCEA and your PlayStation Social Media Team!
We’re taking the next few days off for um, football, turkey, and GT5, and will be back with our regularly scheduled programming on Monday. While Sid is evangelizing Twitter and The Walking Dead back home in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, and Rey and I are freezing our asses off in the significantly-colder-than-normal, but-not-actually-that-cold Bay Area , we’ll leave you with links to the best PlayStation Black Friday deals.

I’ll now wait for our Canadian friends to remind us that Thanksgiving was last month :) We’ve got you covered too. Toronto-based correspondent Ashley Beaulac sent along these Canada-centric Black Friday Deals:
Often referred to as the busiest retail shopping day of the year, Black Friday serves as the ‘unofficial’ beginning of the holiday season, falling on the Friday after Thanksgiving Day in the United States.
