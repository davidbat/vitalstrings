Thanksgiving Day Food Tips
Canada had a difficult time deciding when to celebrate the holiday. Between 1879 and 1898, the celebration happened on a Thursday in November. Between 1899 and 1904, it was celebrated on a Thursday in October. It then became a celebration on a Monday in the month of October between the period of 1908 and 1921. Then for 19 years, it was celebrated on 'Armistice Day' until Parliament announced the second Monday in the month of October as the 'official' Thanksgiving Day'. After being declared as "a day of general Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed."  The Thanksgiving celebrations include parades, customary 'family feast' and 'turkey'. It is a time for sharing, loving and family reunions. The central idea behind the celebration is to be thankful for the past harvest and praying for the coming year.
