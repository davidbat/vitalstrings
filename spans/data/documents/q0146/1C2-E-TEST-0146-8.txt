Thanksgiving Day 2009 : Canadian Thanksgiving 2009 Date
Canadian Thanksgiving 2009
In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second         Monday in October. The origin and history of Thanksgiving Day in Canada         is different from the American Thanksgiving. Whereas the American         tradition talks about remembering Pilgrims and settling in the New         World, Canadians give thanks for a successful harvest. The geographical         location of Canada is further north as compared to the United States         therefore the harvest season falls earlier in Canada.
In Canada Thanksgiving 2009 will be celebrated on second Monday in         October - 12th October 2009.
History and Origin of Canadian Thanksgiving
There are three traditions behind Canadian Thanksgiving Day:
1. The farmers in Europe held celebrations at the time of         harvesting to give thanks for their good fortune of a bountiful harvest         and abundance of food. The farmers would fill a goat's curved horn with         fruits and grains. This curved horn was known as a cornucopia or the         horn of plenty. It is believed that when the European farmers came to         Canada they brought this tradition of Thanksgiving with them.
2. The history of Thanksgiving in Canada is related to Martin         Frobisher, who was an English navigator. He made a lot of efforts to         find a northern passage to the Orient. Though he did not succeed in his         efforts but he was able to establish a settlement in Northern America.         In the year 1578, he held a formal ceremony, in what is now known as         Newfoundland, to give thanks for surviving the long journey. This is         considered the first Canadian Thanksgiving. Martin Frobisher was later         knighted and an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Canada was named         as ' Frobisher Bay' after him. When other settlers arrived here         they continued this ceremony of giving thanks.
3. The third influence occurred in 1621 in what is now the         United States. Here the pilgrims, who were the English colonists,         celebrated their first harvest in the New World at Plymouth         Massachusetts. By the 1750s this celebration of harvest was brought to         Nova Scotia by American settlers from the south.
In the 1600s, another navigator Samuel de Champlain crossed the ocean         and arrived to Canada. Other French Settlers also came with him and         their group held huge feasts of thanks for the harvests. On this event         they shared their food with the Native American neighbors and thus         involved them in their celebrations. Then they formed ' The Order of         Good Cheer' which marked the harvests and other events as well.
After the Seven Year's War ended in 1763, the citizens of Halifax held         a special day of Thanksgiving.
During the American Revolution the Americans who remained loyal to         England moved to Canada. They brought with themselves the customs and         practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada.
In 1879, the Parliament declared 6th day of November as the day of         Thanksgiving and also declared it a national holiday. Over the years         different dates were used for celebrating the Thanksgiving Day in Canada         but the most popular date was the 3rd Monday of October.
After World War I, both Armistice Day and Thanksgiving Day were         celebrated on a common day that was Monday of the week in which fell the         11th day of November. Ten years later, in 1931, both Armistice Day and         Thanksgiving Day became separate holidays and Armistice Day was renamed         as the 'Remembrance Day'.
Finally, on January 31st, 1957, the Parliament issued a proclamation to         fix permanently the 2nd Monday in October as the Thanksgiving Day. The         Proclamation goes as...
"A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the         bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed ... to be observed         on the 2nd Monday in October"
