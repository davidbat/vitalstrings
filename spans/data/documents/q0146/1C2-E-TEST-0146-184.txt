When is Thanksgiving?
Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, which  will be 24th November in 2011. In Canada, Thanksgiving will next be  celebrated on 8th October 2012.
"Our rural ancestors, with little blest,
Patient of labour when the end was rest,
Indulged the day that housed their annual grain,
With feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain."
Alexander Pope
