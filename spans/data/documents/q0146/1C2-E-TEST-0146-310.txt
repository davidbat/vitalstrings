About Canadian Holidays
Canadian Holidays include Victoria Day, Canada Day, August Civic Holiday, Labour Day,Thanksgiving, and Boxing Day and several other listed below.  Some of them are International, some of them are Canadian public holidays, and another are statutory Canadian holidays.
While Canadian culture is heavily influenced by British and American culture, Canadian culture still retains many unique Candian characteristics. In the past few decades, a more robust and distinct Canadian culture has developed, partially because of the nationalism that pervaded Canada in the years leading up to the Canadian Centennial in 1967.
