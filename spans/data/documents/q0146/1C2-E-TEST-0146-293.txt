1.5 L  red wine  (use a fruity red such as Merlot)
1 cup  honey
1 orange 
Using a vegetable peeler remove the zest from the orange. Rinse and wring out a 10-inch square piece of cheesecloth. Wrap the orange zest, cloves, allspice, cinnamon sticks and cardamon in the cheese cloth and tie. Cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice out. Set aside.
In a large non-aluminum pot, combine the wine, honey, orange liqueur, orange juice, and spice packet. Heat and stir for about 30 minutes to dissolve the honey. Do not boil. Transfer to a slow cocker or insulated carafe and serve hot.
3/4 oz brandy or cognac
3/4 oz Cointreau
1/2 oz lime juice  (or lemon)
Shake all ingredients with ice in a shaker or blender. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
