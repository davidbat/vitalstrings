Today is a very festive day.  We are honoring two holidays – Columbus Day and Canadian Thanksgiving.
Columbus Day recognizes the anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas, which occurred on October 12, 1492.  It is observed throughout the country every year on the second Monday in October.  Coincidentally, Canada’s Thanksgiving also occurs on the second Monday in October.  Since 1957, Thanksgiving is an annual Canadian holiday to give thanks at the close of the harvest season.  Canadian Thanksgiving corresponds to the English and continental-European Harvest festival, with churches decorated with cornucopias, pumpkins, corn, wheat sheaves, and other harvest bounty, English and European harvest hymns sung on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, and scriptural selections drawn from biblical stories relating to the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot.  While the actual Thanksgiving holiday is on a Monday, Canadians might eat their Thanksgiving meal on any day of the three-day weekend, though Sunday and Monday are the most common.
What are all of our Canadian Swaggernauts feasting out on this Thanksgiving?  Did anyone take a nice weekend getaway for the holiday?
In honor of this celebratory day, here’s a code worth 6 Swag Bucks until 5pm PDT!
