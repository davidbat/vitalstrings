Newfoundlanders will be somewhat warmer than what they have been experiencing the past few days, but not as warm as the rest of Atlantic Canada. Temperatures in the St. John’s region should get up to around 15 today, a bit warmer than our 9 degree high on Saturday. Other regions in Newfoundland should also get to around 15, with coastal areas a bit cooler. There will be some scattered rain showers today as a weak trough moves across Newfoundland. Cooler temperatures are on tap again for Newfoundland and Labrador in the coming days as a low moves down from the north, advecting cooler fall-like temperatures across the province Tuesday and Wednesday.
Needless to say, after a good hardy turkey dinner today, Canadians on the east coast should enjoy this sunny and mild Thanksgiving weather , as it will not last for long.
