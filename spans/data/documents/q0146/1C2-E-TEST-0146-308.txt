Holidays
Thanksgiving
Get the entire family together for your Thanksgiving Day party with a great big Turkey dinner! Stop by a Party Packagers location near you for some themed tablecovers, cups, and paper décor to transform the kids table to the fun table while serving your meal in our handy, disposable tableware, cutlery and buffet sets.
Try creating your own centerpiece for the dinner table with dry leaves, gourds, twigs and dried flowers. The items can then be arranged with something like floral foam, or add flare by presenting them in a small, hollowed-out pumpkin.
