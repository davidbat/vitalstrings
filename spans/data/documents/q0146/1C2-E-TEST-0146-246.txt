Diane Kruger carried her fedora Saturday when she touched down at the airport in Vancouver. She traveled north of the border to visit with her boyfriend, Joshua Jackson , while he works on Fringe in his native country. Diane's trip was timed to coincide with Canadian Thanksgiving today! The holiday should mean that Joshua has a day away from the set of his sci-fi show. The latest episode of Fringe aired last night, and it seems that the current season is one of Josh and his costars' best yet. As Josh focuses on the small screen, Diane has a few films heading to theaters. Her Special Forces is out in France on Nov. 2, and post-production work on Farewell, My Queen has started. At the moment, Diane's shooting Fly Me to the Moon with French director Pascal Chaumeil, who was the man behind Vanessa Paradis's 2010 movie Heartbreaker.
