Is Walmart Open On Thanksgiving Day Canada?
Is Walmart open on Thanksgiving Day in Canada?
I think that they are staying open the entire holiday, all the way into the next day, but I don't know for sure.
Can you confirm this?
Answer Question!
Some Wal-Marts will be, which is a shame. I don't think anyone should be open on Thanksgiving. Not even gas stations. Get your gas a day early for Pete's sake!
Businesses don't usually take a vote on who wants to work on Thanksgiving. They just schedule you and if you don't comply then you will probably be fired.

Yes it is, sometimes they close in the evening to allow their employees to have time with their families, and to stock up before black friday sales.
