After many changes of date, on January 31st, 1957, Parliament proclaimed "A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed  ... to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October". Why they chose this date, I cannot tell. Save for the rationale behind the Monday holiday, in general.

We Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Sunday of October.   We are giving thanks for the harvest, which comes earlier up here - we are not giving thanks for the Pilgrim Fathers arrival in the New World.

In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday in October. Unlike the American tradition of remembering Pilgrims and settling in the New World, Canadians give thanks for a successful harvest. The harvest season falls earlier in Canada compared to the United States due to the simple fact that Canada is further north.
