1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1 cup pure maple syrup
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
    1 teaspoon Bourbon Vanilla extract
Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.
Prepare muffin pans by rolling out pie dough and cutting 4-inch (approx) circles; fit dough circles into muffin cups; set aside in fridge until ready to fill.
In a small bowl, place raisins and cover with hot tap water; let stand on the counter for 30 minutes. This will plump them up.
  In a large bowl, using a wooden spoon, mix together the soft butter, brown sugar, salt and maple syrup; stir well until sugar is dissolved and butter is creamed.
Add eggs and vanilla, then mix well.
Drain raisins.
Retrieve tart shells and divide raisins equally into all shells; then divide butter mixture into all tarts.
Bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes; filling will be lightly browned but still bubbling.
Canadians fall into two camps about butter tarts and are quite loyal to their favourite type: runny or firm.
For runny (the type that dribbles when you bite into one) tarts, you can take them out of the oven after about 15 minutes.
For firm tarts, bake them for the full 20 minutes, even adding another minute or two if you wish.
Let cooked butter tarts cool in pans for 10 minutes after removing from oven; then remove and place on racks until completely cool.
