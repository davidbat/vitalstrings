The origins of Canadian Thanksgiving        are closely tied to European traditions.  Long before Europeans settled in        North America, festivals of thanks and celebrations of harvest took place in Europe during October.  Canada’s earliest        Thanksgiving, also considered the very first Thanksgiving celebration in        North America, took place in today’s Canada when Martin Frobisher, an        explorer from England, arrived in Newfoundland in 1578.  He wanted to give thanks not so much for        the local harvest, but mostly for safely arriving to the New World – the        Americas.  Frobisher established the first settlement in North America.  As other settlers arrived later in today’s Canada, they continued to        celebrate Thanksgiving each year yet with emphasis on giving thanks for        the harvest.
Over the next few hundred years,        Canadian Thanksgiving was celebrated in either late October or early        November.  It was eventually declared in 1879 a national Canadian holiday,        with November 6th being the official Thanksgiving Day.  Following the        World Wars, however, Remembrance Day (November 11th)        and Thanksgiving kept falling in the same week.  To prevent this overlap,        finally on January 31, 1957, the Canadian Parliament announced that from        then on, every second Monday in October shall be a day of Thanksgiving        celebration for Canada’s plentiful harvest.
The Americans, on the other hand,        first celebrated Thanksgiving some 43 years after Canada’s earliest        Thanksgiving.  This is because the American Thanksgiving is based on the        arrival of Pilgrims from England.  These Pilgrims, in search for new land        to freely practice their religion, landed in 1620 in Plymouth Rock, Massachusetts.  Following a very difficult first year, these pilgrims in 1621 enjoyed a        huge harvest.  They held a great feast in celebration.  The American        Thanksgiving, held now on the fourth Thursday of each November, is to        commemorate that great feast.
This year, our Canadian Thanksgiving        holiday falls on Monday, October 9th.   We celebrate this        special day with family and friends, over a special feast, as we give        thanks for all the good and prosperity in our lives.  A traditional meal        is a turkey dinner with stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry        sauce, squash, wild rice, yams, and for dessert, pumpkin pie.
Happy Thanksgiving!
