Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November: Thanksgiving 2011 falls on Thursday, November 24th.
The four-day Thanksgiving weekend is a major occasion: legions of people fly home to be with their families. (The Canadian holiday, in early October, is much more low-key.) Thanksgiving weekend also starts the "Holiday Season": Christmas decorations go up at  resorts, theme parks, etc., and many places stage a tree-lighting or an appearance by Santa.
