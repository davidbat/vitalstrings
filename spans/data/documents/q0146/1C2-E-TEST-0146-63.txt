We Canadians have much to be thankful for today --not least for the relative stability of our economy has so far maintained amidst the steadily worsening global storm. It's no wonder, then, that Forbes magazine declared Canada the number one country in the world with which to do business, a fact celebrated by our blogger, David Gratzer . I will be celebrating the holiday with my family out in our little cottage in Prince Edward County, Ontario . Out in the county, pretty much everything we eat is grown within a 20-mile radius.  If you have not tried this sort of produce, I urge you to follow the advice of our new contributor, Malcolm Jolley , and do so. You'll never go back to an imported waxy January tomato again. Happy Thanksgiving to all.
