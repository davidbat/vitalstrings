Thanksgiving Holiday in Canada
Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated on the second Monday of October each year and it's an official statutory holiday - except in PEI, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, however federally regulated instututions do observe Thanksgiving in these provinces too.
The original idea is to give thanks for the past harvest season but for many Canadian families the tradition has shifted and the focus is now to eat a large turkey dinner and get together with family. Apple cider and pumpkins are a must for any traditional thanksgiving celebration as well as turkey stuffing and pumpking pie.
The first time Thanksgiving was held in Canada was in 1872 to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales from a serious illness. After 1879 celebrations were held every year but not always in October - it used to be observed around Armistice Day in November.
At Crawford Lake conservation area (on Guelph Line in the Milton, ON area) a path around the lake has pictures and short stories of native people. One of the stories is about thanksgiving; it start with this sentence:
"Thanksgiving to native indians was a way of everyday life rather than a one-day celebration."
Take a few minutes to think about this quote. Thank you.
