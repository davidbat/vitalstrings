History
The first North                         American Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1578 when the                         English Navigator, Martin Frobisher, held a formal                         ceremony in Newfoundland. He did this to give thanks for                         surviving the long sea journey, and other settlers                         arrived in Newfoundland, and the tradition was continued                         by them. 
In 1879, Parliament                         declared November 6th a national holiday of                         Thanksgiving. Over the years this date changed, and on                         January 31, 1957, Parliament declared the second Monday                         in October of each year to be "A Day of General                         Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest                         with which Canada has been blessed".
Tradition
Most families in Canada celebrate Thanksgiving                                 with a special dinner for family and friends.                                 The dinner usually includes a roasted turkey and                                 pumpkin pie. Thanksgiving provides an                                 opportunity to look at pioneer life, and it is                                 an ideal time to celebrate the importance of Canadian farmers for all Canadians.
Many families use to have special meal, and go                                 around the table expressing their thankfulness                                 for during the past year.  It is a special                                 day for children to spend with their Canadian                                 grandparents, and to appreciate the abundance in                                 everyone's lives.
Many friends and family members use to get                                 together to convey their thankfulness for the                                 past year.

Facts
Long ago, before the first Europeans arrived in North                         America, the farmers in Europe held celebrations at                         harvest time. To give thanks for their good fortune and                         the abundance of food, the farm workers filled a curved                         goat's horn with fruit and grain. This symbol was called                         a cornucopia or horn of plenty. When they came to Canada                         they brought this tradition with them.
During the American                         Revolution, Americans who remained loyal to England                         moved to Canada where they brought the customs and                         practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada. There                         are many similarities between the two Thanksgivings such                         as the cornucopia and the pumpkin pie. According to one                         Canadian resource the Canadian table usually features                         venison and waterfowl over turkey. However, a professor                         from Durham College tells us that in Southern Ontario                         eating waterfowl or venison at Thanksgiving has never                         happened and that the turkey or/and ham is the featured                         food.
