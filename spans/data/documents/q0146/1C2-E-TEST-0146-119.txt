Thanksgiving
Though it started as an annual tradition in 1863, Thanksgiving didn't become a federal holiday until 1941.  Today it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November with family gatherings and an abundance of food. Originally, it was a day to give thanks to God but has become a holiday celebrated by everyone, regardless of their faith or beliefs. Ancient origins of the holiday can be traced to harvest festivals. However, it is taught in schools and throughout modern culture that the holiday is a celebration of the unity found between English settlers and Native Americans after the harsh and deadly winter at Plymouth, Massachusetts.
