Thanksgiving in Canada is all about being thankful for a plentiful harvest and spending time with loved ones. Canadians celebrate the holiday earlier than their neighbours south of the border due to an earlier harvest season.
T for time to be together, turkey, talk, and tangy weather.
H for harvest stored away, home, and hearth, and holiday.
A for autumn's frosty                art, and abundance of love in the heart.
N is for neighbours, and                October, nice things, new things to remember.
K for kitchen, kettles' croon, kith and kin expected soon.
S for sizzles, sights, and sounds, and something special that abounds.
The      first North American Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1578 when the English      Navigator, Martin Frobisher, held a formal ceremony in Newfoundland. He did      this to give thanks for surviving the long sea journey, and other settlers      arrived in Newfoundland, and the tradition was continued by them.
In 1879, Parliament declared November 6th a national holiday of      Thanksgiving. Over the years this date changed, and on January 31, 1957,      Parliament declared the second Monday in October of each year to be "A Day      of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which      Canada has been blessed".
