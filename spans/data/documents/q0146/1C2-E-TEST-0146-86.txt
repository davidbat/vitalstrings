The setting of Thanksgiving holiday in October was simply an act of parliament (in 1957), which decreed that the second Monday of October would be a national holiday to give thanks for Canada's bountiful harvests. Canadian Thanksgiving was not always on that date: from 1879 until 1957 the date changed several times, and only starting in 1879 (when the holiday fell on a Thursday in November) was the event annual. In any case, that act of parliament acknowledges a long and multicultural history of harvest festivals, going back centuries before Canada was a country. French, Scottish, German, and Irish settlers had their own traditions, as did indigenous people long before them.
The earliest European strand of the thanksgiving tradition in Canada, though, was not about harvests, but deliverance from disaster. It concerns the English explorer, Martin Frobisher, who undertook three expeditions to search for the Northwest Passage. After two earlier attempts in each of the two previous years, Frobisher's third expedition to the Baffin Island area in 1578 met with severe storms, shifting ice, loss of a ship and equipment, and separation of his fleet. When the surviving ships finally managed to reassemble at Frobisher Bay (on the southeastern side of Baffin Island), the minister assigned to the expedition, Robert Wolfall, preached that this return to safety was a miracle of deliverance from danger. They celebrated with Communion, and that event got linked after the fact with an emerging tradition of celebrations to give thanks.
