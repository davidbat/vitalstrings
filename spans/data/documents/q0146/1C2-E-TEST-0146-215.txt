Give Thanks for all you have.
Traditionally, Thanksgiving Day has been a time to give thanks to God,
and enjoy friends & family.
Thanksgiving Day is celebrated mainly in the United States and Canada.  Other countries probably have their own special days throughout the year.  Thanksgiving is usually the best Holiday for Family gatherings, food and a little football.
Canada celebrates Thanksgiving on the second Monday of October and the United States celebrates on the fourth Thursday of November. Canada’s Thanksgiving Day is on the same day as our Columbus Day.
The most popular origin of Thanksgiving in the United States traces back to Plymouth with the Pilgrims and Indians sharing their food together, in Peace, back in the early 1600's.
There is also evidence of an earlier one by Spanish explorers down in Florida, but the memorable one that sticks with most people is the first version, sharing food in friendship and peace at the birth of our country. The American Natives were actually quite helpful and neighborly with those Pilgrims.

Thanksgiving Day was observed on various dates, following each year’s harvest, for many years.  Finally in 1941 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill into law making Thanksgiving a National Holiday to be observed on the fourth Thursday in November.
It also kicks off the Christmas Holiday Shopping season every year with that infamous day after Thanksgiving Sale.   But let’s not get ahead of ourselves; Thanksgiving Day is for giving thanks for the blessings you have, and to share the day with family and friends.
When family and friends are around, enjoy the time together
