Thanksgiving Day in Canada is the second Monday of October and observed as an official holiday in all of Canada's provinces and territories .
The Saturday and Sunday leading up to Thanksgiving is business as usual, but on Thanksgiving Monday, most businesses, stores and services shut down.
That said, Canada is a big country and not every province has the same closures. The following list of what is open and closed on Thanksgiving is a general guide. Exceptions apply across the country, especially in Quebec where Thanksgiving (action de gr√¢ce) is not celebrated in the same way by all residents and many shops and services remain open.
Closed on Thanksgiving Monday
Federal government offices are closed right across Canada.
Most local government offices, including Passport offices and post offices. Some post offices in the private sector do not close (like those within malls, supermarkets or drugstores that are staying open for the holiday).
