In the USA, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in  November. In Canada, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the second Monday in October.
The first Thanksgiving in the USA was a feast in 1621 shared by the Pilgrims (who had recently settled Plymouth Colony in what is now Massachusetts) and the Wampanoag Indians, who shared their corn, squash, and wild turkeys.  This first feast was not repeated until over a decade later.  Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln.
In Canada , Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by the Canadian Parliament in 1879.
