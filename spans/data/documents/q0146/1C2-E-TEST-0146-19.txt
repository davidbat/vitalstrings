Canadian Thanksgiving Date 2011
Celebrating the Harvest
The Canadian Thanksgiving date differs from the U.S Thanksgiving date because in Canada Thanksgiving is not derived from the Pilgrims but the end of a successful harvest. Because of the northerly location of Canada, their harvest season ends earlier than the USA.
The designated date for Canadian Thanksgiving Day is the second Monday in October. In 2011 this is the 10th October.
Thanksgiving in Canada was originally observed in Newfoundland, and other parts of the country by new European settlers. Over the years it moved between various dates, sometimes being observed in November and sometimes in October. It was not until the 1950's that the current date was proclaimed as being the official date for Canadian Thanksgiving.
In Canada, Thanksgiving is about family and food, and for many, football, just as it in United States. Some families choose to observe a four day weekend (Friday through until Monday), but the official public holiday in Canada is the Monday, giving most a three day weekend.
Thanksgiving for families is simply about spending time decorating the house, preparing all of the Thanksgiving food , Thanksgiving crafts and decorations , (and of course the dinner!) as well as enjoying a long weekend before the onset of Winter.
