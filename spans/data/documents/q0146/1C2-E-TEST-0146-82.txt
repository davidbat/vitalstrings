In Canada, Thanksgiving is only a three-day weekend, and the holiday is not as important as in the US. Because of the shortened break there is far less travel during Canada’s Thanksgiving and it is far harder for families to come together. Additionally, while the actual Thanksgiving holiday is on a Monday, Canadians may eat their Thanksgiving meal on any day of that three day weekend. This often means celebrating a meal with one group of relatives on one day, and another meal with a different group of relatives on another day. Christmas is far more family oriented in Canada than it is in the United States.
Canadians trace the holiday to a feast held by Martin Frobisher in Newfoundland in 1578. It is also probable that American loyalists who emigrated to Canada after American independence brought with them many of their Thanksgiving traditions.
The Thanksgiving celebration was held occasionally in English areas of British North America in the eighteenth century, especially in Nova Scotia. The holiday rose to much greater prominence with the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. The holiday became entrenched in English Canadian society. In 1879 Canada’s parliament declared Thanksgiving to be a national secular holiday. This date was moved several times, finally being set on its current date in 1957.
