CHIN #1:  In the fourth week of November  As Im sure were all aware,  We celebrate Thanksgiving  And we eat till were impaired.    Watch some football on the TV  And parades with relatives,  No one spills the gravy   On the tablecloth and lives.    ALL CHINS:  Turkey on the table  Its Thanksgiving Day  Sauce made from cranberries,  Broccoli soufflé,  When I eat more food  Than a rabid beast,  Youll know its at the annual  Thanksgiving feast.    CHIN #2:  I see yams and I see brussel sprouts  And green bean casserole,  Mashed potatoes and hot stuffing  Overflowing from the bowl.    CHIN #3:  Then theres pumpkin pie and whipped cream  Triple layer carrot cake,  My chin gets tired from chewing  And I have a tummy ache.    ALL CHINS:  Turkey on the table  Its Thanksgiving Day  Sauce made from cranberries,  Broccoli soufflé,  When I eat more food  Than a rabid beast,  Youll know its at the annual  Thanksgiving feast.    Happy Thanksgiving, Everybody
