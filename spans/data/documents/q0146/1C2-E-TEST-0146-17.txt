Origins of the American Thanksgiving
Popular opinion has it that “the first Thanksgiving in North America” was held in Canada, in 1578, 43 years before the Plymouth Pilgrims. The credit goes to the first explorers of the Northwest Passage and (fool’s) gold miner, the Englishman Martin Frobisher (1535-1594). Frobisher supposedly gave formal thanks after his safe arrival in what is now called Newfoundland.
What is wrong with this story? First, some details. Frobisher’s doomed mining colony was situated on Baffin Island, north of Newfoundland. And in The Unknown Shore, Robert Ruby also alleges that, upon landfall in August of 1578, it was the Rev. Robert Woolfall who gave thanks.
More importantly, this “thanks” came not in the form of a gathering around a festive meal, but a hurried prayer. This is not problematic, for the custom of Thanksgiving was and still is, for many, a thanks to God for a bountiful harvest. But there’s the rub: there was no harvest. The meal of salt beef, biscuits and peas came out of the ships’ barrels.
So sorry, Canadian people, but in my opinion this does not constitute Thanksgiving. And for the same reason, neither does 1710 (when Port Royal, Nova Scotia, celebrated the return of the town to the English), or 1763 (when Halifax gave thanks for the end of the Seven Years War)... But by then, of course, the Puritans and the Wampanoag had already given their thanks, in 1621, in Plymouth, New England.
