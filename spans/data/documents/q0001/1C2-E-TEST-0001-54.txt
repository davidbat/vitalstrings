Michael Michael Michael So sick of hearing about him. Yes he could sing and he could dance. But he was a terrible person. He really should have died in prison. He sexally abused all those children and got off because he paid off the families of the abused children. I think justice was served.I feel sorry for his family but not for him.

see how shes putting her music at the back of her book about his death? This is just a ****** singer capitalizing on the death of her famous brother to sell a few records. ******* pathetic

Nothing like making a buck off your dead brother. No wonder he was so screwed up, you'd have to be growing up in that family!

LayToya Jackson is one person I wouldn't believe a word that comes out of her mouth.  What she did to her brother when he was living speaks volumes about her as a person.  She is worst than the snake she used to pose with arounbd her neck.  Now, she wants to write about a brother she loves more in death than in life.  I would hate to have her for a sister or even a distant relative.

Another sibling trying to capitalize on Little Mike's death. Sad and tragic as his death.

@Jean - I could not agree with you more and was thinking the same thing.  Sad.
Professor Reaves | June 17, 2011 10:56 AM
Cecil you are IGNORANT of the FACTS about Michael and if you are so sick of him, why'd you read and write about him here?  YOU are the sick, negative, evil one!  I just hope that LaToya can PRODUCE those handwritten notes by MJ where he wrote that he had to get these people out of my life.

First of all, LaToya can't sing, nor is she any faithful family member.  She and her brother Jermaine are trying to capitalize on Michael's death.  The meal ticket is over, the entire world is laughing at their total lack of dignity.  Michael no doubt is laughing at them too, from wherever he is.
LaTaya | June 17, 2011 11:12 AM
How Sad!  LaToya should be ashamed of herself and Jermaine shouldn't write a book of this topic.  Jermaine should focus on singing, he has a beautiful voice and can be successful if he focused harder on his music.  I would never do this to anyone of my brothers.  Rest in peace Michael!
