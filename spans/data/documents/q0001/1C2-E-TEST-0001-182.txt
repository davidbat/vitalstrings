I think it is good to see this, and to see he is as vulnerable as everyone else.
A message to all of you that are hero worshiping the man, are you forgetting that he liked to touch up little boys? and that he paid his way out of a child molestation prosecution?
This over the top mourning of someone who is completely CRAZY and probably a child abuser is DISGUSTING!
Elisha
OMG shut up, you have all obviously had a good look yourselfs!!!! I liked him, i thought his music was great too, but come on… look how popular he was this is exepected people!!! & he’d be having the last laugh anyhow as he loved the media so well done ET. However R.I.P Michael.

You all talk about how disrespectful this pic is, but did you not look at the photo? It is sad, yes, but this is what the tabloids do, and you feeding into it only gives them more of a reason to keep doing their job.  You clicked on the link, you are giving them publicity and keeping them in business.

where is micheal’s soul now? sorry to say but micheal was never a child of god all the time 4rom he was 5 untill now i have never heard any one say that he is a christian. y did they not introduce him to the lord? if micheal was a christian his soul would have gone to heaven singing 4 the lord but now he is going to hell singing 4 the devil annd his angels. we still love him though r.i.p.

Janice, whoever you are…how dare you? Are you God? No. So to say Michael has gone to hell is rude and insensitive. God is his only judge, not you. Yes, you are entitled to your opinion, but this opinion should have been kept private. You should only be concerned with whether you will go to heaven or hell. The devil in you is a LIAR!!!!! God gave Michael his talent and I think Michael appreciated the gift from God that’s why he used it and touched millions of people’s lives. Only the God in someone can have that impact on so many people. I forgive for your ignorance because the God in me says I should. The bible says “judge not yet ye be judged.” Are you perfect? What have you done that may keep soul from going to heaven? Michael did love God check out his interviews with Oprah and Martin Bashir.
wilkes96
i think MJ was a lovely man he only tried to do best by his kids think how you would feel if your kids saw a picture of you like this! Show sum respect & TAKE IT DOWN !!!!
JUST AMAZED
This is for the comment Max made.
hope the people that keep saying that he’s a child molesterer even though he was PROVEN innocent should rote in hell! He was so misunderstood.
R.I.P MJ you are a GOD & always will be!
Does that mean that OJ is inoccent? Also many of those police that shoot someone who isn’t armed ang get only a slap on the wrist? But honestly, Let him rest in peace… How do you think his children will feel when they see this all over the internet?
Show a little respect, if not for us, for his children.
http://unitedhlm.com Freddie Avila
Allow the man to rest in piece. Show some respect at least for his children.
Savanna D.
I don’ tthink that it’s right to have the man’s picture on here like that. When he was here nobody didn’t really talk about, and from what I heard every time someone would mention his name it would be something rude. And now that the he’s gone your disrespectful ass’s wanna try to show some respect. STOP BEING FAKE, AND GET REAL! Ya’ll are some fake ass little freakers. And as for who ever the freak Janice is, you are like a dirty rag in the eye sight of God. So if anybody is going to hell, it would be your ass. As a matter of fact in The bottom pit. You need to have some respect for him. Good God almighty, it should’ve been you in this case. So as for you BITCH, DON’T HATE ON ALL THAT HE HAS DONE! Anyway, I hopes that Mr. Michael Jackson can rest in peace. In other words, GET HIS DAMN PICTURE OFF OF THE INTERNET.
Natasha Franklin
For all those people who are saying harsh things about Michael Jackson especially Brian Johnstone who left a terrible comment may the comments fall directly on the person you love most. And then may be you learn when to have respect for each other as human being and respect for the loss of life.
Scotty M
Everyone, get a grip and get over yourself. Every single Star or Famous person gets way to much respect and publicity, when in fact they do not deserve it at all. I do not believe the picture is authentic, I always liked Michael Jackson, even though I truly believed he was an odd duck. I only believe that his weirdness started when he began having all of his plastic surgeries, he was a goodlooking black man, but he was an extremely weird looking female and or white person. I had all of Michael Jacksons albums and music I loved his voice, he was a faboulous singer and dancer. He should have just accepted who he was, and that would be an extremely talented black man. I would not want my loved ones dead picture plastered anywhere especially not on national television or the internet. I do not believe Michael Jackson was a pedifile but now days you have to be extremely careful how others see you and especially if you are in the media and television regurlarly anyway…that was extremely carless on his part to leave room for minds to wander. I believe his death was caused by his financial collapse due to all the money he paid his attorneys during the pedifile trial…

I have to agree with the people that have questioned Michael Jacksons faith and his final destination (Heaven or Hell). To those whom do not believe there is a hell than he is in heaven and to those who believe in hell he would most definately be in hell….he might have even split hell wide open? However, I am a firm believer in last minute confessions..I believe he could have made it in…no-one will ever know till we get up there. I believe that all the cheap shots should stop. Everyone needs to respect his family especially his parents and children. (This is to the man who made a comment about the white race disappearing?) That is an extremely ignorant comment to make…first of all that will never happen and secondly you are making that comment on Micheal Jacksons Dead Picture Blog ” Michael Jackson wanted to be white”…so next time think about what you are saying…I know lots of black people who would not agree with your comment anyway.
fredericko
yep, hes dead and gone to god knows where, i guess he was the king of pop,like my ole friend Elvis was the king of rock n roll, no one could knock Elvis off his perch, and no one can knock MJ off his, there are a hell of alot of great singer entertainers, but as we look back on those who have gone b4 him, i’d say that there was only Elvis that could hold a candle to MJ,why i’m saying this is pretty weird, because i didnt even really dig the guy, crazy, but for the complete packgage of dancing, singing, and life lived to the fullest, he will never be outdone, a true Legend i guess,

oh get the hell over it people, it’s freedom of the press, he supposedly “wasn’t dead” in the picture, he’s no more import than the average working person who died, it’s harsh but true, there’s worse shit on the internet anyways, and they tried to bring him back for an hour i guess? his brain would be mush, no oxygen? cuz he’s famous i guess he’s just that important, w/e i’m done with all you peoples complaining, i’m 15 by the way wanna shoot me a complaint e-mail, be my guest, brandonf300zx@yahoo.com

WAT RESPECT?   WE LOVE HIM MORE THAN HE FAMILY DOES
C MON  WE RESPECT HIM AND WE WANT NEWS
pamela
since when has the media gave a damn about people? all you tabloid trash magazines care about is the green dollar and if pics of a dead superstar get cash for you then you don’t lose any sleep over posting it. you have no concious, no morals. and to all of you that keep calling him a molester, are you one? what if i accuse you of it and a court finds you innocent? can i still say i know for sure you did it? he was found innocent so just leave it alone and have some respect for the dead. what likely happened is the parents of certain children knew he was rich and thought it was as good a way as any to get some money out of him. if my child was molested i wouldn’t stop until that person was behind bars. why do you think these freak people setteled for 20 million out of court? i guess suddenly their child was not going to be injured anymore if they got enough money. think about it?

wow he died he’s doctor whonted him died probley he’s doctor probley killed that women too and others too.

all of you people want to feel sorry for micheal jackson.WHY? some of you know caring ass people drove him crazy all in his damn business. and then you try to keep your business to your self the man was trying to live a life for him and kids but you kept on dragging his name in dirt now you want to cry and bring flowers and card tears no body wants to hear that shit I am mad as hell if only you people beleave in him he wouldn’nt hurt a fly. he would have still been hear. if you all have just let him live. no one wanted to surport his music I say shame shame do not fill sorry now because you all have done it to him. a Icon who rasied millions of dollar’s went to hospital all over country helping and encourage kids just loving people PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES  HAD LET HIM DOWN so don’t cry beause you don’t really mean it you kiied my brother.

Michael Jackson you are the best and you will truly be missed.I always believed you were innocent.Thank you for making the 80′s a memorable time.I pray for your kids and hope that God keeps them safe from the paparazzi and the media.

Can’t Wait!!
You know, I can’t even start to imagine that God would send such a person as Micheal to hell. And really that’s none of our concern. SO LEAVE IT TH FUCK ALONE!! DAMN!! As for me on the other hand I do believe in last minute confessions, I hope he did have time to ask God to forgive him, and as far as all the shit talkers that r posting nasty shit. Go eat a dick!! And just remember the next one of you that says another mean thing about him that your mothers suck cocks in hell ha ha ha, now shut the hell up.. RIP Micheal, and I hope people can see you for what a talent you were and get over flaws, hell everyone has them NO ONE IS PERFECT!! And f someone has something to say to me here’s the email, I dare ya :pollarda29@yahoo.com….

thomas
i am just asking you people who think that reading about MJ’s last mins is wrong that how can you say that when i was his fan from early childhood that i want to know what happened to him at that time of his death of course other than curious i feel i should know just how can you leave just like when we are dealing with emotions not rules.its our wish that he should have had a happy life when compared to what he has contributed to this world thru music.its natural to know about the likes and dislikes of the people we love
alan
goodbye child molester…may you rot in hell for all the victims’ pain.

Hey come on guys, All those who think they are good from all aspect i m sure that each and every one who is quoting above that michael is a child molester is a #$@#$@$, DONT say that as if all you guys an gals are some children who have never done any shitt thing in you life,Its his life and he has lived what he wanted to be like,,, COme on man, He has been the King of Pop he is the king of Pop and He is going to be the king of Pop,.

You dummies sit there and type how disgusting it is that there is a “death” pic of ol’ Jacko. You idiios clicked on the site, nobody forced you to. If you don’t like it, don’t look at it. Why this person is being revered in death is beyond me. The man was a PEDOPHILE. Now because he bit the big one he’s a saint. Check yourselves people.

MJ was a person that always wanted to expierence the “regular joe expierence” and he died like everyone else does. His picture was taken and put on the news like millions of other people that have died. In wars, in car crashes, in all sorts of ways. Why should his pic be taken down? No one has their pic up or everyone does…grow up folks!
Mary
PLease take this photo down. Give the king of pop some respect and also take it down for the family who are in mourning. You have to understand that he was a person not just a picture
Geacie Tomson
WHO HAD THE TIME TO TAKE SUCH PICTURE? HOW MUCH WAS THE PERSON PAID FOR IT? WAKE UP PEOPLE!HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO MEAN? TAKING PICTURE OF A DEAD OR DYING MAN IS A SICK THING. GOD HELP US ALL. REST IN PEACE MJJ. WE WILL ALL DIE SOMEDAY. I PRAY WE ALL MAKE HEAVEN AS WELL.

I always believed this is how it would end for this poor soul. A child at heart living in an aging man’s body and needy and dependent on all kinds of devices to keep him in a supernatural state so he could be all he could to his fans – never to waiver. I truly believe in all my heart that his physical abuse began as a young child and never experienced any sort of normalcy that we take for granted. His love was so immense for kids as he was a grown adult because he was like Peter Pan – he just never wanted to grow up. But unfortunately he had to play in the sand box with the wicked world of money and greed from those parents that used their children to coherse them to lie. I don’t believe this gentle soul ever did anything wrong to anyone – but because he was a decent human being he was scoffed at and ridiculed like other children by 100 times worse because of the money temptation.
May God bless those who never waivered and always believed in his innocense. God bless his family to get through this devasting, heart-wrenching loss. No family is perfect but I do believe this family really and truly loves each other and we should all give them respect and give them peace at this time.
Much love to the Jacksons,
Susan Hodgkins – 50 myself, born a month apart, and the hugest fan of your son, Michael. I will miss him forever.

i like this picture. it’s interesting. i would like to see more dead photos of him. im just morbid like that. and death fascinates me. its crazy how someone can be the most famous person in the world, and then die. what the hell is everyone wasting their time obsessing over a person? we all just die in the end anyways. no one ever makes it out alive. maybe if he would have been a normal person and not the worlds most famous person, he would still be alive. but i always thought he was a weirdo anyways. hes the strangest looking person i’ve ever seen. why someone would mold themselves into looking like that is beyond me, its fucking weird. and maybe he did molest those young, innocent children. And god took him away because you cant have your cake and eat it to. Even if youre a billionaire and VERY VERY famous, does not give you the right to touch little kids in a sexual manner. Thats gross and sick and twisted. You can’t do anything your heart desires just because your fucking famous. famous people suck.they’re spoiled rotten with millions of dollars that most people cant even comprehend and will never comprehend. and its sick and discusting!!
Laura
you think your smart because you wrote a big paragraph about nothing but sht so please shut the f*** up because honestly hun………you know crap about him so anyone can write a paragraph about anybopdy just like this is made for your dumb@$$ so write what you know *positive things* or DONT

To all the MJ fans,God bless you all and keep his memory alive. when our time comes we will be reunited with Michael and our loved ones in Heaven.Do not read what the haters are saying and don’t respond to them cos all u r doing is feeding there destructive evil bahaviour.Put all your energy in writing nice thing about Michael cos LOVE is stronger than Hate.Karma will come there way on there children or when they have them or maybe they don’t deserve them.Eg My father hated Elvis and all his kids loved him so there you go.Love rules and heals the world.Be kind and love one another because we don’t know whats around the corner.If this can happen to Michael it can happen to anyone.Don’t forget God is testing you.Peace to you Michael and God Bless you.Amen

What everyone should do is put aside allthe negative comments. For crying out loud he is dead. All we need to keep in mind is the inspiration he gave us, also that his music and his life purpose remains in our heart. Micheal Jackson is truly a good man. R.I.P Micheal. WE LOVE YOU

How distasteful of ET to post this pic!  Do we really need to see this photo?!!  Please show some respect…
Michael, even in your death you are not allowed peace, I am so sorry for the actions/greed of others, I am ashamed.  My heart has been heavy since the news of your untimely death, my tears overflow with sorrow for you and your children.  My prayers are that your light from the heavens shines on us and warms our soul.  Thank you for all of the memories.
http://showbizspy keith John
it’s funny how people can judge others and not look at themselves, he’s been proven not guilty and still people want to break him down because they do not want to believe that MJ is innocent. May your soul rest in peace MJ, and i pray that all these cruel things that people are still bringing out, may come to an end, the King of POP is no more, but i do believe that he will still remain in out hearts forever.
So please can everyone that still has something bad to Say about MJ just keep it to yourself, and stop making fools out of yourselves.
To all the Fans, thanks for your support in keeping Michael Jackson’s name alive. WE LOVE YOU MICHAEL!!!!!!!
God Bless you all.

This is the most disgusting and disrespectful thing ive ever seen in my life!His loved ones and fans dont want to see this.Can you imagine what it would do to his children if they ever saw this!!?

It’s news. He was a big news item, so he’s fair game, dead or alive.
O.D & D.L
People have no repect for stars these days. No one was talking about MJ until he died and that’s just not right. If you are going to wait to talk about people until their dead, that means that you are very afraid of them. I mean what has MJ done to any of us to talk about him so badly because he is dead. Leave him in peace and stop talking about him.like the old saying,if you can’t say anything good don’t say anything at all. about that trial he went through, PLEASE drop that, that’s old and stink by now. look at a bigger picture, what pic is that yourself. RIP michael jackson we love you

OK FIRST OFF I THINK MICHAEL WAS AN AWESOME PERORMER. SECOND OFF I AM ONLY 15 YEARS OLD…AND I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE THAT THEY HAVE A PICTURE OF MICHAELS LIFELESS BODY ON THE INTERNET…THEY NEVER DID ANY OTHER CELEBRITY LIKE THIS…AND I BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL JACKSON WAS INNOCENT…U CNT ALWAYS JST BITE THE BAIT JST BECUZ ITS THROWN AT YOU…MICHAEL IS GONE AND ALL Y’ALL CAN THINK ABOUT IS WHAT SUM MAGAZINE OR SUM LIL BOY SAID…HAVE YOU EVER HEARD IT IS TWO SIDES OF A STORY. AND THAT ONE PERSON IS TELLING THE TRUTH AND THE OTHER IS LYING. I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAPPY THAT HE IS GONE. I PERSONALLY FIND IT VERY SAD AND DISTURBING THAT YOU GUYS ARE BEING THIS COLD HEARTED. YOU GUYS FAIL TO REALIZE THAT MICHAEL JACKSON WAS A HUMAN BEING JST LIKE US. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE WAS A CELEBRITY. HE IS NO LONGER WITH US SO AND FOR YOU PPL THAT ARE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY NEGATIVE ABOUT HIM IT DOESN’T MATTER BECAUSE HE IS NOT HERE TO HEAR IT. I AM JUST GOING TO PRAY THAT GOD HEELS YOU GUYS’ HEART FROM THE SPIRIT OF HOLDING A GRUDGE…AND I WILL CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR THE MICHAEL JACKSON FAMILY…AND MAY MICHAEL JACKSON REST IN PEACE.

I don’t think that a picture of a person being kept alive with an ambu bag and CPR is a corpse. He is not dead in this picture obviously. He is intubated and is not even blue. It is not that bad. It is no different then those trauma shows on TV. Get a grip people.

Let’s be realistic here. Although it can’t be denied that the media machine twists public opinion, too many facts of his actions and dealing with children pointed to the fact that he molested lots of little boys. His only saving graces to keep him out of prison were his money and fame, which bought immunity from some corrupt parents through his lawyers….indeed, they were mostly poor families who were paid in the first place for the use of their children.
Those who can’t wrap their heads around the fact that rich celebrities can buy their way out of criminal charges should pause and remember the OJ fiasco.
I know he had some good tunes a couple of decades back, but why do so many fawn over him as if he weren’t the monster he was? Is it because we remember him as we thought he was when we were innocent kids in the ’80s, combined with the old hypocrisy of over-eulogizing the dead? It would seem so.
Other than the fact that a pedophile lives no longer, at least two other good things have happened from this…Jesse Jackson is too tied up in it to bother meddling in Iran, and those MJ bubblegum collector card packs I bought up for 5cents each at BigLots, when I was a kid, will sell to some idiot mourner on Ebay for big $!!!!!!!
Those who scream ,” How dare you speak that way of a dead person” should consider the trauma caused to those who live on, who he molested. Their wrecked lives are the truest way in which MJ’s life “touched” those around him. Pun intended.

And I keep seeing these weakass comments that, since he was acquitted, that means he didn’t molest those kids. OJ was acquitted too…it’s called shit-tons of money and the lawyers working the issues! He settled out of court before the criminal trial, so the parents were already paid off.
As a parent, I’m disgusted that a molester is being made a hero! And what’s up with a guy who dangles his kid over a balcony? Check out the youtube of that… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aiAqR5jF2s….completely F’d up. The poor kid’s kicking the empty air cuz he’s scared. What a great dad, my ass!
Aussie
Micki rest in peace, mate.God has saved you from this cruel world.Us Aussies are most discusted in the way the American media are bringing up Michaels bullshit past we all think this is very disrespectful and the man isn’t even burried yet.You are not setting avery good example to the rest of the world in showing compassion,but only greed in who gets the most rating and sells the most magazines.Here downunder the media have reflected on all his accomlishments and played Michael Jackson specials on tv.When you turn to American news programs on cable,Geraldo, Enews,CNN all the vultures coming out of no ones land claim they no this and that bullshit about Michael.It seems everyone wants a piece of the action like lions on a dead corps(shame on you all).And the people who say they were his closest friends….well If I were in trouble I know my mates would be there to help me.”WHERE WERE YOU FRIENDS”when he needed you.Too late now.RIP MICHAEL.Im glad your not here to whitness this media circus.Shame on you USA to do this to one of your own.

really are you so stupid to think that the syatem does not love all this hate.How many of us have donated what he did to improvished people.if anyone killed michael Jackson it’s the haters.Haters have no souls they hated jesus ,mary, malcolm x. john kennedy and you and me.Haters drove michael jackson inside because people took advantage of him.The babies mama,his father,the press,Lisa Marie Pressley who he probably thought would know how it was. Look at her 3 or 4 husbands ignorant living off her father.The haters set Michael up like the haters are doing on this website.Michael Jacksons one fault He should have went to the gym grew some guns and went to kicking ass like there was no tomorrow.Now fuck with Lil Wayne,T-Pain, Busta Rymes and see what you will get Wakeup stop being suckers life is too short remember what goes around comes around it may take a while but it gets here.You pull shit on the dead and you will have it comeback on your family, your kids when you least expect it.I don’t care what you critics say about my article other than i got glocks, 357′s and am not afraid of HATERS.

I couldn’t read anymore!  People please learn english and how to spell!  Everyone knows the good and the bad about Michael Jackson.  We all have our opinions.  Everyone came here, why?  To look at the picture.  If you have ever lost a loved one you don’t need other’s exploiting their character, because you loved them, even though you didn’t approve of their ways.  We all have our demons and will answer to only One when our time comes.  After reading some of these comments, aren’t you glad you only have to answer to One!
Madas Hell
eddyW(WANKER) get ya fukin facts straight it was proven that da boys lied that there stupid ass parents put them up to it.Michael was hypnotised and there was no evidence of him molesting any body.The boys could’nt even prove that Michael had a distinctive birth mark.The boys cried at school to there Teachers and told them they were put up to it.The reason he settled out side of court was because his health was in jeopardy.In a clip with Michael and one of the boys you can see the boy putting his head on Michaels shoulder in a loving way????? Michael may your soul live on.RIP

Wow,  I can’t believe Michael Jackson died. My mom is a fan of him.She also told me than he was better than Elvis Presley. Well that’s what he gets for being on drugs for a long time. My mom and I saw pictures of him before and after his plastic suregy and I liked him before he had the suregy. My guess the doctors messed up on Michael’s suregy. My mom was shockes when heard the sad news.

Michael I apologise on behalf of all the stupid ass fuckers who don’t know shit about you.There a bunch of sheep who listen to lies.(look it up ‘SHEEP’)what can I say,you can’t put brains in statues.WE LOVE YOU MIKE (NZ) BE WITH YA BRO.RIP LONG LIVE THE KING.BILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN’T BE WRONG.

the kids changed their testimony AFTER he paid them off, please get YOUR fact straight “Madas Hell”…at least google it. It’s a key point to how it’s obvious he really was a molester.

MICHAEL THE NARC-ANGEL
Millions of little members of the worldwide F.F.A. (Future Followers of the Antichrist) have finally learned how to find a certain part of their lower anatomy and quickly touch it while dancing – thanks to Michael Jackson, the highest paid Lower Anatomy Toucher of all time! Special thanks also go to the Jesus-bashing, Hell-bound Hollywood moguls who were just as quick to see higher profits in lower anatomies!   [Just saw this opinion on the web. Other grabby items on MSN, Google, etc. include "Separation of Raunch and State," "David Letterman's Hate, Etc.," "Tribulation Index becomes Rapture Index," and "Bible Verses Obama Avoids." - something for everyone!]
wusup
Eddy Wanker you seem very interested in this child molestation story and you know alot from what I have read,for someone who’s a hater.Are ya a child Molester.You r spending shit-tons of  time hear talking shit go “play”with ya little boy.Pun intended.Go take your negativity bullshit some where else asshole and leave Michael alone.How disrespectful to talk such ways of a man in death.R.I.P Michael.
robocop
i think he died a while ago just people had to sell his belongings so after they announce him dead some people get extra millions after a few years
eddyW
Not negativity, just plain fact. What’s negative is giving someone vast ammounts of credit, even worship, who is the most famous child molester of all time. It only encourages other molesters. Another negative thing is trying to use someone’s words against them, “wusup”, but you did so so very retardedly i can’t stay mad atcha.

He beat the molsetation charges, but that doesn’t mean he didnt do it . he paid 20 million dollars to a molested childs family. Think he had something to hide? They past a law in california so that people cant pay to get out of trouble when they molested children. He was an over rated mutant freak. You are all sheep.Yes only GOD can judge but atleast our children are safe now. if i hear another story on that freak im gonna shoot myself. He was so young you say yeah well so were all those molested children. Leave the picture up who cares.bye bye weird O.

Now it is proved that he hadn’t done anything as Jordan Chandler has himself stated that he lied because his father wnted him to do so. He DID THAT FOR MONEY! True MJ fans like me feeling blue. RIP MJ.
Daniel
I Think Its great that once again a child predator has died and the kids have been vindicated. This time wacko jacko wont be able to pay someone off to keep them quiet. You should all be celebrating his death becaue the world is just a little bit safer for kids!
Julia
First of all, nobody had to know Michael Jackson personally to be upset about his death. If that were the case then nobody would be upset about the other legends that had died, for example: Elvis Presley, JFK, Tupac, etc. etc. As far as him being a child molester…he was never convicted. It’s all about the money for the parents. He may have had a messed up childhood, but I do not believe that he would ever endanger a child. Why not call Kobe a rapist then? He was never convicted. Regardless of all the accusations and rumors, he was and is The King of Pop and always will be…nobody could ever take that away from him.
Sabir Mirza
Now those people should be worried how they will make money through their kids. I request please don’t publish those pic. no one likes to see them and after his death please give him some respect and leave his family alone…the man is gone…but he will remains in our hearts for ever….
http://none annnna(:
right?  all thoose poeple who have put they dont care about him, well i tell you what, your sick! michael was a absoloute legend, he was the king of pop, i recon no one in the whole world has ever or will do better then michael jackson, he was the best dancer and no one could ever beat him! all his songs was about how he feels, like earth song, hes telling everyone what we are doing to the world. And all the press you are tight, all he wanted was to be left alone, all the press ever does is make up storeys about him that are not even true, he was found not guilty so. and he was NOT a child molester!!!!.
and one last thing take that picture off!!.  think about how his family feels about this, show some respect.
R.I.P MICHAEL JACKSON.  you will never be forgotton king of pop.

People actually WANT to see this picture of him.
He was a GREAT performer, like John Lennon and Elvis Presley.

When I turned on my T.V. I couldnt belive this tragic loss. I felt a terrible pain rush through my heart. Tears were pouring from my eyes.MJ did alot for the world. He gave the world pop music. And if MJ wasnt in the music industry no other singer would be who or where they are today. So as we give thanks to MJ for making the world a better place . Love to the Jacksons famliy. [.RIP M.J.]…

Not only did he dance and sing, But he wanted to change the world. He wanted it to be a better place and he tried his best to get the msg out there and change peoples lives. So say what you would like about him. Nine times out of ten, Your the reason he wanted to change the would. Sitting on your ass isnt stopping war or feeding kids that havnt ate in days. Think about it.

eddyw you sound like a real dickhead and for someone who dislikes Michael I can’t believe how many comments he has written.Regardless of how you feel it is truly disrespectful to write such things for the Fans to see.You will not change there opinion of him so get over it.Havn’t you heard the saying ‘if you have’nt got something nice to say don’t say it at all’.And that goes for all you other tossers.I myself am a U2 fan but I also recognise Michael as a great performer.Sorry to all the Fans of your loss may he rest in peace now.

ok…heres some things i would like to say! I am only 13 yrs old…but i still understand completely about these kind of matters. i liked micheal jackson in his older days. From what my parents said…he sounded kool! BUT he may have and may hav not molested those childeren..but even if he did…i still show repect for his death! i think you people out there who like the announcement of his death are inmature FREAKS…who don’t give a crap about other people…and i think that one day that will come back and haunt you…..nd not in the good way!! My best friend sydney would like to show her respect by saying….all you people who don’t care should shut your FREIKIN MOUTHS and get a life and stop putting the family’s through more than its worth. you may not care but the familys’ do…rather hes a molester or not..and you should lopve for who he is nd noy what he is!! thank you and feel free to comment back!!! Thanks from two 13 yr old girls who actually care!!! rest in peace jackson.

All of the whiner fan-bots who can’t handle the fact that there are people whose eyes have been open to the FACT that this dead has-been was a collossal pedophile…just keep on being tools, i guess. I hope SOMEBODY figured out that even tho he had some neat well marketed hits he obviously deserves NO memorialization due to the ammount of evil he inflicted on the world’s children.
We lost a pedophile last week, and the world got a little lighter. Y’all try to figure out how to pick your heros better, and have a nice day.

I THINK THAT IT IS COMPLETELY SICK AND TOTALLY DISRESPECTFULLY FOR MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS FAMILY TO WITNESS HIS BODY ON THE INTERNET. AS IF THEY HAVENT BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH TAKE THE DAMN PICTURE OFF WHO WANTS TO SEE A DEAD BODY ON THE INTERNET NEWAYS. RIP MICHAEL JACKSON U WILL BE GREATLY MISSED. P.S. TO ALL THE HATERS THAT KEEP BRINGING UP THE CHILD SHIT YOU MAY THINK THAT HE STILL DID BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THERES ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT REALLY KNOW IF HE DID AND THATS THE MAN UP STAIRS AND MICHAEL JACKSON SO SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT THAT CAUSE U BRINGING IT UP IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE NETHING.

Lisa UK…you mentioned u2, so maybe this explanation will help you understand, ready? That tired old saying you mentioned, ” If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all” ? It applies to U, 2 ! So why you must you bother complaining about me, I’m only here cuz the subject is that molester’s corpse, and what I say bears mentioning: that molesters don’t deserve eulogies.
Now if only Bono would fall into jacko’s grave at the funeral while spouting off about how his ideas would save the planet. HEY JK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dig u2, er, when they’re PLAYING MUSIC
For what

And no matter how much you love him or loath him he will be talked about and remembered for generations to come like (ELVIS) another king.On that fateful day 25.6.09.all fans around the WORLD will remember and love him and celebrate his music.He will live on and on.Michael thanks for the Music.RIP over and out.

Johnny, your post has been said by many already. It’s another tired internet cut-and-paste non-thinking fake opinion ( another media quip). It’s full of irony, hats off to whoever wrote it the first time. Because the only reason he was “king of pop”, i.e. POP CULTURE, was because he and his staff used THE MEDIA like noone has before or ever will. All he was was media…and molestation. You’re just blinded by his poppy charisma and can’t separate his (long gone) talent from the evil he brought to this world. People like you will keep buying enough DVDs and Tshirts to keep that kind of shit going on, unfortunately, while those like myself say it like it is. Life goes on…thankfully with one less famous pedophile
Jami
I just wish the media would leave it to rest and stop being so ignorant. The world just loves to feed on the innocent and every bodies faults. None of us are perfect. He was a caring, kind, compassionate person, no matter what may have faultered. Leave him be, so his family can find peace, and he can be at peace.

R.I.P Michael Jackson,
your definately well missed by millions of people all over the world. You were a great inspiration for many musicians, you were even an inspiration for me , i find it terribly sad that you had to die, you had so much talent, you could dance like no other, you created music videos basically, and your music was just incredible. I used to dance around to your music all the time, it was so much fun , his music was just to energetic and fun and just made you want to get up and dance. But he is definately remembered as the KING of POP.! <333333
ILOVE YOU MICHAEL JACKSON! <3
MJ Forever
Michael you will be sadly missed and I am heart broken since the day you went away.We were looking forward to your concert in July.My daughter and I were going to London to see you in concert and instead we will be paying our respect to one of the memorial sites.Love you always my heart is shattered for you,you’re family and especially your kids.God bless you.

Michael jackson will live on and on for generations to come.He will never die,his music,dance moves and his kids will keep him alive.He is an icon to this world and will be sadly missed.God bless you, thank you for your extroadinary talent and beautiful nature.
Bee haive
There’s only one person to blame for Michaels sad, lonely destructive behaviour,and thats his Father.Joe treated Michael very badly when he was a child.I watched the movie about Michaels life and it brought me to tears what his father did to him as a child.He is responsible for everything.That man should be locked up.He is a very disturbed person and I can’t believe he was promoting his record comp whilst being asked quwstions about his sons funeral plans.Shame on you Joe.Rest in peace Michael and God bless you.

Have some respect man… Just take the picture down..

kya yaaro mare hue aadmi ki photo ka waisa thamasha banatey? ye media waale mar gay toh unki bhi laash ku TV pe dikha kar enjoy karein kya?It’s a shameful deed by media.
Cayte
I NEED to see this. I grew up with him, and it is so unbelievable … I don’t think it’s sick.
He still looks alive ..
If it were a photo of the autopsy-I would be upset. That would be inappropriate.
Michael is loved and made music what it is today. The man was aquitted of all the nasty things that people are still saying he did.. when are we going to let him be?
So tortured by greedy money grubbing untrustworthy assholes.
I am of the belief that the stress of being innocent and having to tolerate all the nonsense probably finally took it’s toll on his heart and spirit. Combine that with drugs to relieve the pain…I am so sorry Michael. I have been crying for days.

When he faces his creator: “Job well done Michael!
You’ve done your best.” For the ‘Holier than Thou’ people, pls look at your mirror and check your own backyard for some sins…
