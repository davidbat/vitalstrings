The manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's personal doctor began Tuesday with a shocking photo of the singer's dead body and an eerie recording his voice slurring through a purported propofol haze.
The prosecution picture projected in the courtroom showed Jackson's lifeless body on a hospital gurney under the powerful heading "Homicide."
Have you seen the recently released photograph that is said to be Michael Jackson's death photo? Is it real? I have not only done online research, but I made actual phone calls to prove that this photo is fake.
In this video, you will see proof that the STRETCHER used in this photo is from Stryker's "RENAISSANCE" series. These stretchers were made from 1991-2003. Michael was suppossedly at UCLA Medical Center June 25, 2009. I called UCLA to see if they keep any OLDER models of any stretcher and they confirmed that they in fact got rid of any old stretcher they had there. If this is an OLD stretcher NOT USED IN HOSPITALS ANYMORE, than this photo is a proven fake.
What is the truth behind Michael Jackson's death? It seems as if Michael Jackson is ALIVE and this is a proven HOAX. Stay tuned for more information as the conrad murray trial continues on.
