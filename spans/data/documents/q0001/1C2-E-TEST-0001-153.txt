Michael Jackson is Dead
Michael Jackson was found in his Los Angeles home today at about 12:30 pm not breathing, and had no pulse. Someone in the home was doing CPR, and paramedics took over the CPR while transporting Jackson to Ronald Reagan (UCLA) Medical Center where Jackson was pronounced dead at the age of 50 years-old. There is a large crowd outside the hospital. People don’t want to believe Michael is gone.
Michael’s father Joe Jackson said by phone from Las Vegas:
"He had a heart attack. He is not OK."

Michael was dancing and working out to get in shape for his 50 show tour in London this summer. Many, including myself, doubted Michael was in good enough physical condition to keep his commitments, and some shows had been rescheduled for later dates because Michael was not ready. Michael was also rumored to have had a MRSA skin infection, and skin cancer, but neither rumor was confirmed.
Michael is survived by three children: Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr., Paris Michael Katherine Jackson and Prince "Blanket" Michael Jackson II.
Debbie Rowe, Jackson’s ex-wife, and mother of his children, gave up all parental rights, so she cannot legally take custody of the children.
Michael’s death at this time is said to have been caused by a heart attack that caused cardiac arrest. A Los Angeles homicide detective has been assigned to investigate Michael’s death, just to make sure there was no foul play.
The news of Michael’s death has completely overshadowed the death of Farrah Fawcett earlier this morning.
Despite all of Michael Jackson’s weirdness, he was still a great artist, and will be remembered for his creativity, and music above all else.
