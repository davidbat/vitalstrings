Re: AttFinch – You don't have to click a post just to want to view the photos .. you can just click because you want to make a comment and then there they are not even on a separate link.. use your fucking head and stop pointing the finger…

I I dunno what you bleeding heart mj fans are getting all bent out of shape about. They haven't even started the autopsy in those pics!!!! That's what I'm looking for, frankly. The pictures of him totally cut open and having his organs weighed. They do that during an autopsy. Or what about pics of the eye goo samples that were taken? Those pics could be way worse. And Perez, you show what ever the fuck you want, as long as I can say what ever the fuck I want. Kiss kiss.

Re: Vigilant Phantom – Whether one clicks or not, comments or not, the photos are there. If one doesn't like that the photos exist and are thus made available to the public, why click on them? Doing so just registers that they are popular. Further, to wish someone a rotting in hell for being a messenger is silly. If you hadn't noticed by now, for better or for worse, Perez simply echoes information that exists. It's the reader's choice whether to partake in the conversation. Since counters don't recognize the difference between a good click and a bad click, a veto of participation is best if one TRULY wishes for this sort of information to be made unavailable.

People who are against Micheal's photos being released here are rather hypocritical as they came to this web page knowing that the headline read: Shockingly Sad Photos of Michael Jackson's Dead Body.
Seriously guys, why come here in the first place if you're so dead-set against seeing them and them being shown? (And no, you can't be against them being shown and still want to see them)
The photo itself is disturbing. The bloody bandage over his nose, the wound on his chest, and the lack of belly button are confusing.

From what I remember when he died I thought you didn't want to show the photos of hus dead body going into the ambulance because you thought it was a shit thing to do? Unless I'm thinking of someone else but yuck.

Re: GayRay – So… you go out of your way to deliberately try and upset and annoy a person? Yes, that's so much better than being an attention-seeker…
As for the pics: didn't have to be released but am not offended by them. If I hadn't known it was Jackson it would be your random dead person. Besides, nothing is sacred anymore, weren't we used to that already?

It's so sad that they are publishing this horrific picture all over the internet. The media has no respect for the dead.

i   dont  see what  the  big  deal  is?  he is   dead.  he  proclaimed  HIMSELF    the  king  of   pop.  sure  he  was  talented  but  he  also  had  mental  issues.
