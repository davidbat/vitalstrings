Michael got injections of drugs daily.”  The insider is said to have traveled with Michael for an entire year and revealed that the singer “was doing massive amounts of skin grafting. It was very unhealthy and sad to witness it all.  The source adds, “Michael was worried about losing his popularity and his relevance. Even when he was at a personal high, he was terrified of losing his edge. He felt very alone. Michael had no close friends around him and he always harbored miserable feelings with his father. He was always sad that his family was not with him.”
