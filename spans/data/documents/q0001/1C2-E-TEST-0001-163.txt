ONCE YOU START TREATING A PATIENT, WHO IS A DRUG-HOOKED, YOU ARE  RESPONSIBLE TO HAVE THAT SICK PERSON  GET 24/7 HELP. ALL MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE HANDLED BY A 24/7 NURSE, NOT BY THE PATIENT. IF YOU CAN NOT CONTROL THE PATIENT, DON'T TREAT HIM/HER.  TELL THE FAMILY AND  COUNTY MEDICAL AGENCY AND STOP TREATING THE PATIENT.

murray got a raw deal. when he was hired by jackson, jackson was allready a dope fiend. murray just happened to be the one. jackson would have found someone (another dr.) to get him what he wanted. jackson enabled murray (with $$)  to act the way he did. people with money have been doing it for a long time.

And this is justice?  For whom?  Four years and it is quite possibe the sentence will be a lot less due to over crowded jails!  This man, I do not consider him a doctor, for doctor's take an oath to protect and care for their patients!  Conrad did neither of those things for Michael Jackson...HE BELONGS IN JAIL FOR THE FULL FOUR YEARS, AND NOT A CUSHY JAIL, BUT DOING SOME HARD TIME...HE STOLE A LIFE, NOT MONEY.  If Madoff is in jail for many years for defrauding of money,  why would he get more time than conrad murray, who by neglect, malpractice and providing a lethal medical substance out of its context (operaating room), to Michael Jackson, causing his death.  I would hate being the Jackson family right now!

Dr. Murray was just an escape goat for Jacksons death.Michael should be held accountable for his owns actions. He thought he could do whatever he wanted.  Look at all the Drs. Elvis had, but the difference is it all caught up with him and caused his death in a different manner!You get yourself hooked on DRUGS.

OK, you are right. Don't forget there is a big "but." Dr Murray, shouldn't have continued treating him after he learned that  MJ WAS DRUG HOOKED.(ACCORDING TO YOU).

Justice was served in Michaels and his Docs.Michael wanted the drug that he knew would kill him sooner or later and the doctor was following orders for his own greed.They were both headed for destruction and both got what was coming to them.

Please, the family thinks Michael would want him convicted? Michael was the one who pressured him into giving him the medicine!

Michael Jackson was a druggie, plain and simple. He sought out this doctor because he knew the doctor would administer whatever drugs he wanted, no questions asked. Where was the responsibilty on Mr. Jackson's behalf?   This is a tragedy, however, all the blame cannot be placed on the Doctor. Plus, where the hell was the family? Once again, they all come out of the woodwork when it's too late.  Michael Jackson had issues long before this doctor got involved with him. His family is responsible for that!! That whole family has issues....

well it looks like a civil lawsuit now, looking like the parents are still out to make a buck or a few millions from the tv talk shows and magazines.

Well I guess we got our scapegoat. Murray was negligent but, Michael Jackson killed Michael Jackson.

Mike went shopping for a Dr and found him.  Dr Murray is guilty of greed.....MJ was hardly a saint and had some hand in his own demise.

Shame Shame on the Jacksons. How could they call themselfs or associate themselfs with a religion. The religion this momma claims to be would never condone the going ons in this weirdo clan. They are all to blame. Theres all the brothers still dressing like back in days and the sisters all wanting to look like Michael. Oh what a messed up bunch of coconuts.
