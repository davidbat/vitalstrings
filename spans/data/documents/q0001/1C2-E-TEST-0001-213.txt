Seemingly throwing the book at Murray, Judge Pastor peppered his sentencing with acknowledgements of the doctor's unethical use of propofol in treating Jackson -- and that his behavior after Jackson's death did not help the matter.
"Dr. Murray engaged in a recurring, continuous pattern of deceit and lies," said Judge Pastor. "There are those who feel Dr. Murray is a saint. There are those who feel he's the devil. He is neither. He's a human being."

A Jackson family attorney read a statement before the sentencing."We respectfully request you impose a sentence that reminds physicians they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder," he said.
California law means that Murray will serve his time at a Los Angeles County Jail, where he is expected to only serve half of his four-year sentence.
