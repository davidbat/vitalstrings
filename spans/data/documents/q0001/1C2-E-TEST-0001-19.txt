Dr. Conrad Murray guilty
A Los Angeles County jury convicted Michael Jackson's personal physician of involuntary manslaughter, concluding a trial that offered a glimpse of the last days of one of the world's most famous men by deciding that his death was a criminal act.
The verdict was delivered  in a windowless downtown L.A. courtroom a world away from the turreted Holmby Hills mansion where Dr. Conrad Murray had a $150,000 a month position that included providing what the pop star called "milk" -- the surgical anesthetic that ultimately claimed his life.
