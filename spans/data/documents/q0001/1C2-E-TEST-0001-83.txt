Carol and Reggie Sumner, both 61, were robbed in their Duval County, Florida home in July 2005. With a telephone wrapped around his neck, Reggie Sumner was forced to give the robbers his ATM card and access number. He and his wife were then pushed into a shallow grave and buried.
Four people were arrested and charged in the case: Tiffany Cole, 23 at the time; her boyfriend Michael Jackson, 23; Allen Wade, 18 and Bruce K. Nixon, Jr., 18.
Michael Jackson was convicted of first-degree murder and given two death sentences.
