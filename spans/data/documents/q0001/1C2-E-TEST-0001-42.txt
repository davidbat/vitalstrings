An auction house in Los Angeles will be selling off items from Michael Jackson 's home, including the bed where he died in 2009. The auction will include various personal items, artwork and furnishings from the singer's rented home in Holmby Hills, where he and his family lived while he prepared for a series of comeback concerts in the months before his death.
Other items on sale include upholstered chairs from his "medication room" smeared with the singer's makeup and a chalkboard on which one of his children wrote "I (heart) Daddy. SMILE, it's for free." The chalkboard is expected to be sold for over $400, while Darren Julien, owner of the auction house, tells E! News that the death bed will start at $3,000-$5,000.
