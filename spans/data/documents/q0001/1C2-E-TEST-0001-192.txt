Michael Jackson was renting a home for nearly $100,000 at the time of his death last July 25, 2009.
The address for the Homby Hills house is 100 N. Carolwood Drive, Los Angeles, California, 90077.
The home has a large gate around and it is hard to see from the street. It is right off of Sunset Boulevard.
The other two homes most often associated with Michael are the (in)famous Neverland Valley Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, and his parents Encino home on Victory Boulevard where he lived as a young adult before purchasing Neverland.
