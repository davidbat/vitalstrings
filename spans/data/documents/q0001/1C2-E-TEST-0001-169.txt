Nationality: United States
Executive summary: King of Pop
Liberace 's adopted boy/plaything Scott Thorson told The National Enquirer in April 2004 that he and Michael Jackson had sex in 1979, and later pursued an affair in the early '80s.
While much of the world expected a guilty verdict, in a high-profile trial Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges on 13 June 2005, with the assistance of attorney Tom Mesereau . Santa Barbara County district attorney Tom Sneddon 's case was very weak, particularly in that it brought the issue of the motives of the accuser's mother into question. Bringing the first charge, that of child abduction, was an error of strategy that likely killed the entire case.
Died 25 June 2009 while under heavy sedation, a circumstance which led to the prosecution and conviction of Jackson's personal physician, cardiologist Conrad Murray .
