GEORGE W. BUSH IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CRIMINAL STALKER!
George W. Bush continuously criminally stalked Margie Schoedinger to the point that she could not get away from it, and she committed suicide in desperation to escape: he murdered her.
â€œIn her suit, Margie Schoedinger states that George W. Bush committed sexual crimes against her, organized harassment and moral pressure on her, her family members and close relatives and friends. As Schoedinger said, she was strongly recommended to keep her mouth shut. . . . Furthermore, she alleges that George Bush ordered to show pressure on her to the point, when she commits suicideâ€ (blog of drizzten).
â€œGeorge [Bush is personally complicit] in the death (murder to be precise) of my friend Margie Schoedinger in September of 2003. Determining the exact whereabouts and contacts of . . . George Bush on September 21 thru 22, 2003, should be entirely lacking in difficultyâ€ (Leola McConnellâ€”Nevada Progressive Democratic Candidate for U.S. Senate in 2010).
McConnell is correct: George W. Bush applying pressure (continuously criminally stalking Margie Schoedinger) purposefully to force Schoedinger to commit suicide does in fact constitute murder where it culminated in her death.
Bushâ€™s method of murdering Schoedinger cannot exist in a vacuum: he must have murdered other people in the same way.
While he was president, actually, George W. Bush continuously criminally stalked numerous people to the point that they could not get away from it, and they committed suicide in desperation to escape: he murdered them. During Bushâ€™s presidency, of course Bush would have desired to kill people whom he hated or get them out of his way. Insofar as Bush was clearly capable of murdering Schoedinger in broad daylight and is clearly capable of getting away with it, in consideration of the laws of human nature, Bush of course murdered numerous people in the disgusting way he murdered Schoedinger. However, the vast majority of such scandalous information will never come out (the grisly details are typically hard to substantiate). A prosecutor really can lawfully charge a former president with murdering one or more people in the disgusting way Bush murdered Schoedinger. The American people unfortunately live in a world where evil presidents can murder any number of peopleâ€”figurativelyâ€”with a wave of a magic wand and get away with it.

Dear Jackson Family:
I am sadden about the lost of Michael Jackson. I still do not believe that this has happened to a legend. I keep saying to myself Michael Jackson is not suppose to die he’s suppose to live forever. Well he will live forever in my heart. I adore him and my nine year old son loves Michael Jackson he was really hurt. When he was at school he told one of his teachers this is funny, that Michael Jackson was his father. He loves to listen, watch and dance to all of his videos especially to Thriller. He even has youtube video of Thriller.
This seems like a dream everytime I wake up I’m thinking that he’s going to be still alive and it’s all but a dream.
Love you always, Wilma, Edwin, Jonathan, Giovanni and Demetrius M
