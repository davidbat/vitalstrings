Los Angeles prosecutors today began their opening statement in the Conrad Murray manslaughter trial with a bang, projecting a photo of a dead Michael Jackson on what appears to be a hospital gurney.
As seen above, the photo was taken shortly after the singerâ€™s June 2009 death from an overdose of the powerful anesthetic Propofol.
