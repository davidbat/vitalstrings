Biography
A performer since the age of five, MICHAEL JACKSON was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the '80s, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists in history. Referred to as the King of Pop, Michael is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His 1983 album, 'Thriller,' holds the record for the best-selling album ever, selling an estimated 110 million copies so far. He was the first black artist to find stardom on MTV, breaking down innumerable boundaries both for his race and for music video as an art form.
Born in Gary, Indiana on August 29, 1958, Michael Jackson is the fifth son of steelworker Joe Jackson. From the age of five his amazing talent showed itself. His dead-on mastery of James Brown 's dance moves and soulful, mature-beyond-his-years vocals made him a natural focal point, especially given his incredibly young age. By the age of 11, he became the dominant voice and focus of the family pop group, Jackson 5. The group signed to Motown in 1968 and issued their debut single in October 1969. "I Want You Back," "ABC," "The Love You Save," and "I'll Be There" all hit number one in 1970, making the Jackson 5 the first group in pop history to have their first four singles top the charts.
