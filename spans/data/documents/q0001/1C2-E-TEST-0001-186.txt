Dr Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial over the death of Michael Jackson is set to be televised.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor has ruled that a camera will be allowed in the courtroom as long as its presence does not interfere with proceedings, reports Reuters .
The trial is set to begin on March 24, having been brought forward from its original start date of March 28. Judge Pastor has asked for the "absolute least-intrusive placement" for the camera, and the jury selection process will not be filmed.
Murray has pleaded not guilty to the charge of manslaughter, and faces up to four years in jail if found guilty.
A preliminary hearing saw several witnesses testify that Murray had given Jackson powerful anaesthetics in the hours before his death in June 2009, and that he had subsequently tried to hide drug paraphernalia.
The trial is expected to last around six weeks.
