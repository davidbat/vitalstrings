A photo of  Michael Jackson 's dead body was shown in court during the Dr. Conrad Murray manslaughter trial yesterday.
During day one of the trial, there were a lot of other bombshells dropped.
Bombshells like an audio recording of a non-lucid King Of Pop talking about building a Children's Hospital.
As for the opening remarks, the Daily Mail reports:
As Dr Conrad Murray appeared before the jury charged with involuntary manslaughter over Jackson’s death more than two years ago, deputy district attorney David Walgren displayed the picture that appeared to show tape or tubing over Jackson's face.
But the doctor's attorney Ed Chernoff told the jury it was the singer who caused his own death by swallowing a 'perfect storm' of drugs.
‘He died so fast he did not even have time to close his eyes.' he said.
Chilling statement after chilling statement, during day one, had many legal analysts calling this the trial of the century. It's all just sad if you ask us.
