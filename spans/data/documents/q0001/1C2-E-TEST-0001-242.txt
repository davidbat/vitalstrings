PHOTOS: 10 TV Trials That Shook the World: Casey Anthony, OJ Simpson, Rodney King
" 'Call me right away, call me right away, thank you,' " he said on the stand of what Murray's message was that day. Williams said that he returned Murray's call minutes later and he recalled what the doctor said, Jackson had a bad reaction and to immediately send someone. Jackson's assistant noted that Murray did not tell him to dial 911.
Williams recounted Murray's behavior when Jackson was being wheeled into the ambulance, saying he was "frantic."Â 
Jackson's head of security, Faheem Muhammed, testified that Jackson's children Prince and Paris saw Murray attempting to bring Jackson back.
Footage of Murray pacing in the waiting room at UCLA Medical Center after Jackson died was also shown in court. Prosecutors said in court that Murray left the hospital about about two hours after Jackson was pronounced dead, but Murray's lawyers said that the footage showed that he had left a little later -- near the 5 p.m. mark.
On the first day of the trial, This Is It director Kenny Ortega and Gongaware took the stand after opening statements by the prosecution and the defense were made.
If Murray is convicted of involuntary manslaughter, he could be sentenced to four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.
