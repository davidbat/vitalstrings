Everyone                    who knows me will know the truth which is that my children come                    first in my life and that I would never harm any child.

Why                    can't you share your bed? That's the most loving thing to do,                    to share your bed with someone. You say, 'You can have my bed                    if you want it. Sleep in it. I'll sleep on the floor. It's yours.'                    I always give the beds to the company.

Well                    they say the sky's the limit

Because I'm bad, I'm bad.

It don't matter if you're black or white.

So beat it.

I                    wrote a song called Dirty Diana. It was not about Lady Diana.                    It was about a certain kind of girls that hang around concerts                    or clubs, you know, they call them groupies.
Michael Jackson
Speaking to Barbara Walters.
Our                    parents taught us to always be respectful and, no matter what                    you do, to give it everything you have. Be the best, not the                    second best.
Michael Jackson

When                    you just look out over the stage, as far as the naked eye could                    see, you see people. And its a wonderful feeling, but                    it came with a lot of pain, a lot of pain.
Michael Jackson
Speaking to Ebony magazine in 2008.
The                    truth is, umm, no. Not the way James Brown did, or Jackie Wilson                    did, where they just ran it out, they killed themselves. In                    my opinion, I wish (Brown) would have slowed down and been more                    relaxed and enjoyed his hard work.

Michael Jackson
Daily Mirror interview 1999.
Because                    I think every child star suffers through this period because                    you're not the cute and charming child that you were. You start                    to grow, and they want to keep you little forever.
Michael Jackson
Opray Winfrey interview 1993.
I                    love my family very much. I wish I could see them a little more                    often than I do. But we understand because we're a show business                    family and we all work.

I'm                    a black American, I am proud of my race. I am proud of who I                    am. I have a lot of pride and dignity.
Michael Jackson
Oprah Winfrey interview 1993.
Yeah,                    Wacko Jacko, where did that come from? Some English tabloid.                    I have a heart and I have feelings. I feel that when you do                    that to me. It's not nice.
Michael Jackson
To Barbara Walters.
No,                    I've never taken hormones to maintain my high voice! No, I've                    never had my cheekbones altered in any way! No, I've never had                    cosmetic surgery on my eyes!

I                    have a skin disorder that destroys the pigmentation of my skin,                    it's something that I cannot help, OK? But when people make                    up stories that I don't want to be what I am it hurts me.
