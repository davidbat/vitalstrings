TODAY'S THOUGHT IS ABOUT BALANCE IN LIFE ...
"If the events of these past days have taught us anything,
it is to HONOR THE MOMENT. CHERISH those around you.
Try to FIND A BALANCE between WORK and FAMILY.
CONTRIBUTE something to your COMMUNITY, and above all,
SHARE the LOVE you feel for others EACH and EVERY
DAY ...."
MINUTES IN LIFE ARE WORTH MORE THAN MONEY ~
SPEND THEM WISELY!
