New!  Follow the Conrad Murray trial on Facebook
Los Angeles, California- September 24, 2011
Is Michael Jackson still alive?  Some say yes.  In fact, they believe that he either staged his own death or that his death was part of a conspiracy and that he was actually kidnapped.  The theories even make use of something referred to as the “zombie drug,” that supposedly leaves people in such a state that they appear dead (without a pulse or heartbeat).  A wide array of Michael Jackson fans are convinced that the “King of Pop” is still alive, as the manslaughter trial for his doctor, Conrad Murray , has begun with a jury selected.  Some theories even supposed that Michael Jackson has been turned into some sort of a music slave, where he is forced to create music

HLN’s Jane Velez-Mitchell spoke with attorney Lisa Bloom regarding the conspiracy theories and shared her views regarding whether or not she thought there was any credibility to the rumors.  Speaking on televised air she stated, “Ok, conspiracy theories are great in the movies and on television shows, but in real life, they`re almost never true. And I`ll tell you why. It`s hard for people to keep their mouths shut. In this day and age, to get a whole bunch of people to be involved in a conspiracy and everybody`s going to be quiet and they`re going to turn down huge payments from the media for these kinds of stories, it`s just impossible.
I`m sorry to say it, but he is gone. And usually the simplest explanation is the right one in real life.”
What do you think?  Do you believe Michael Jackson is still alive, was his death a hoax?
