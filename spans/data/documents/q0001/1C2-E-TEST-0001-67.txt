Katherine Jackson Shoots Down Michael Jackson Death Conspiracy Theories

Katherine Jackson, the mother of the late Michael Jackson, says she is aware of NO evidence to support any sort of conspiracy surrounding his death.
A number of people, including MJ's sister La Toya Jackson, have suggested there was a conspiracy among people close to the star to kill Michael.
La Toya said she believes people were involved who remain closely involved with the singer's estate, but Katherine has all but shot that down.
Katherine told TMZ this: "It is only natural for people who loved Michael, including family members, to be suspicious about the circumstances."
"So far I have not seen one shred of evidence that anyone associated with Michael’s estate conspired to bring about Michael’s untimely death."
She continues, "If such evidence ever comes to my attention I will be the first to bring those facts to light ... No one loved Michael more than I loved him, but no one should face false accusations, as Michael did, of a crime they did not commit."
The list of falsely accused does not include Dr. Conrad Murray , who Mrs. Jackson believes should absolutely stand trial for involuntary manslaughter.
