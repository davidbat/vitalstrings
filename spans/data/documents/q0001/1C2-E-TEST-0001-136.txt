V for Vendetta - V for Vengeance
Q - If Michael Jackson hoaxed his death, how many people would had to have been in on it to make it work? Any idea?
A - Three? Five? Eleven? Thirteen? Thirty-Three? Who knows? But those numbers we gave you are pretty interesting. As for the people involved, how many people do you think Michael Jackson trusted with his life? Others can be bought. His whole life is based on confidentiality agreements.
Q - The Associated Press is reporting that prosecutors in the L.A. District Attorney's Office are preparing to indict Dr. Conrad Murray (Michael Jackson's doctor) on involuntary manslaughter. So obviously they do not believe Michael Jackson is alive. Do you really believe in your heart that the L.A. District Attorney's Office would seek an indictment of involuntary manslaughter against Dr. Murray if they believed Michael Jackson was alive?
A - We don't co-operate with the mainstream media, so we have no idea what they might know or think. But it is very weird that not even one reporter questions all the strange events that occurred after June 25th, 2009. Either they are really that stupid or they are afraid to talk.
Q - If Dr. Murray goes on trial, he will have an attorney. Should he be found guilty of anything, do you think he will stand in court waiting to be sentenced for something he did not do?
A - Until now, Murray still hasn't been charged with anything, while the investigation was wrapped up weeks ago. He was supposed to be charged in October already. That didn't happen. Everything gets postponed in this case or you will never hear of it again. May we remind you that the 2002 Will should have been revoked on the 28th of January (2010). That didn't happen to the best of our knowledge.
Q - Am I correct in stating that no doctor has signed any legal document concerning the cause of death for Michael Jackson?
A - We don't know that because that area on the paper is blocked out. Why they decided to block certain things escapes our logic capacity.
Q - Why didn't a doctor come out in front of the cameras and make the announcement of Michael's death? Has anyone ever asked the hospital about that?
A - Has it ever occurred to you that he might not have been there at all? So the doctor at UCLA couldn't make a statement about it. As far as we know, people did ask, but never received a proper answer.
Q - If the photo of the person being taken out of Michael's house is not Michael Jackson, then who is it?
A - Is it a friend of mine? Is it my brother? Who knows, Gary? Much can be done these days with PhotoshopÂ™ and since we see a popping vein on the forehead, it might as well be an old picture of a very much alive Michael Jackson.
Q - Has anyone been able to talk to this tabloid reporter from TMZ that took the last photo of Michael Jackson?
A - For the record, this photographer is not from TMZ, but from the National Photo Group. No one has been talking to him to our knowledge. We think he is in the Bahamas spending Diane Diamond's dollars he received for an obviously fake picture.
Q - Much has been made about the Jackson family referring to Michael in the present tense. Couldn't we just write that off as a slip of the tongue? Maybe there's nothing conspiratorial here.
A - Look at this interview from Jermaine that was taken this month: Jermaine Jackson Interview Still a slip of the tongue after seven months? Come on...
Q - Who fired all of Michael's staff within hours of his reported death?
A - Who says there was staff to be fired? Besides the chef, we haven't heard anything from the other staff members. So who says they exist at all?
Q - Jermaine says "My brother, the legendary King Of Pop passed away on Thursday, June 25th at 2:26 PM. Why did he have to say "Legendary King Of Pop"? I don't mean to split hairs here, but can we read something into this statement? The King Of Pop passed away, but how about Michael Jackson, the man? Is he still alive?
A - We think that could be the case.
Q - Do you believe it was an impersonator who was onstage at the 02 on March 5th, 2009?
A - Yes. That was not Mike.
Q - Have you heard from anyone in the audience that day that said "that was not Michael Jackson"?
A - No. We still haven't heard from someone in the audience. There are a lot of UK members on the forums and not one of the fans was present there.
Q - I've seen reports that after June 25th, 2009, Michael was spotted in Eastern Europe and Moscow. What do you know about that?
A - We call them Spartacus MJs. He was in Hawaii too, and we heard he was in Australia as well. As long as he's spotted around the world, they will leave Mike himself alone.
Q - I've also read a statement from someone claiming to have seen Michael Jackson at the Miami International Airport on September 30th, 2009. I believe he was walking through the airport surrounded by bodyguards. This makes no sense. If he hoaxed his death to get away from his former lifestyle, would he go ahead and call attention to himself?
A - He is not getting away from his lifestyle. If he would be out in public, we are certain that no one would recognize him.
Q - Why is it such a big deal that there was no contract rider in Michael Jackson's contract with AEG?
A - Anyone familiar with the music industry knows that without a signed rider, there is no contract at all.
Q - I'll agree that it is odd for Joe Jackson, Jermaine Jackson and manager Frank Di Leo to all state they heard about Michael's death from a fan, but what is the implication here? What does that mean?
A - It's not like we drink tea there everyday. We have no idea why they heard it from a fan.
Q - Is it true there is time missing from the security cameras at Michael's mansion?
A - Well, the story is even more interesting. There is no footage at all available
Q - Dr. Murray was a "Holistic Doctor". Where did that information come from?
A - In our opinion, that is sucked out of someone's thick thumb. He also has been a gynecologist. So, who knows what he will be next. Maybe a basketball player. Have you seen the dude? He's like eight feet tall!
Q - Has anyone ever been able to trace down when Michael Jackson first became familiar or aware of Diprivan?
A - We think he has been involuntarily involved with drugs for most of his life. If you want to know why, we ask you to read the story on our website.
Q - Have any of the dancers, musicians, or stage crew members made any statements concerning Michael's health or appearance?
A - Yes, they did. We want to advise you of the following websites:
