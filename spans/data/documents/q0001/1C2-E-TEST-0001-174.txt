Michael Jackson's Death Bed for Sale?
Michael Jackson's death bed will be going up for sale at auction in December.
How sick, disturbing ... and downright creepy is that?
While it's understandable that Michael Jackson's home and belongings will be sold, it's unclear why anyone would want to own the bed that Jackson died in.
 
The Julien's Auctions event next month will include a variety of items from his Holmby Hills home, including the queen sized bed he passed away in. Linens have been changed since his death, of course.
Nice.
For those looking for some less morbid MJ items to buy at auction, a mirror from his "inner sanctum," a private bedroom that no one was allowed in, will be up for grabs.

According to a rep for the auction house, the mirror has a message that Jackson wrote on about his This Is It concert tour: "TRAIN, perfection, March April. FULL OUT May."
Jackson died on June 25, 2009. He lived in the North Carolwood Drive home from December 2008 until his death.
The auction of MJ's items will be held on December 17.
Hundreds of items will be sold, including antique furniture, sculptures and paintings, with Darren Julien, president of Julien's Auctions noting, "We want to preserve the history of these items."
