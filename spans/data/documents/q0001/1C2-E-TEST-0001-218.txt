OK Magazine Michael Jackson Death Cover PHOTO
Posted:  July 2nd, 2009 in Michael Jackson by LALATE
PHOTO. The OK Magazine death cover picture of Michael Jackson is not ok. OK’s Jackson near death cover  puts the tabloid magazine under huge outrage this week.
But isn’t that what the magazine wanted?
In a week in which People, Time, Newsweek all issued stunning, beautiful covers that remember Michael Jackson at his career height, all commemorative editions, glowing glossy covers, along comes OK! Magazine that plasters a Michael Jackson possibly already dead.
The person who made the decision on this reportedly is Richard Desmond, owner of the magazine, who paid a reported $500,000 for the photo.  Smart of not? The photo is everywhere today online, the photo doesn’t show really anything, and it’s out of focus.
The magazine came to fame for carrying the Jamie Lynn Spears pregnancy revelation. But how a death photo, that doesn’t reveal anything of news value except someone about to pass or going to pass, is fitting for a magazine cover is unclear. It doesn’t show anything that gives insight into how Jackson died. It just shows him passing or having passed.
News worthy? No. Creating controversy and curious attention? Absolutely. It won’t appear on this site. But if must see it, click HERE or click HERE
