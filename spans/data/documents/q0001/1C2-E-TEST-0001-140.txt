By going at this clip with an occasional freeze frame, I see more here than just “sitting up”. Because of this I suspect there's a reasonable explanation for the footage. The first thing I see is that the body isn't moving by itself but is being moved …not upward, but instead away from the door. This quickly becomes even clearer when you see that a fold appears in the blanket, resulting from being pulled upward and inward at the same time while, of course, the rest of the body remains in place. Also, the band of color which crosses the blanket can be seen to gradually change position, sliding farther and farther down toward the end of the blanket. This tells us that it's a strap. It also tells us that the strap is being pulled on, (upward and inward). And finally it tells us that what's involved here is the foot of the body rather than the head. Since the transport is just about to touch down, we can safely conclude that someone was simply starting to shift the body in order to position it for removal from the helicopter. Pulling on the strap was probably a mistaken effort to move the gurney, not the body.
