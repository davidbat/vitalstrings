Homicide Investigation
It's expected that on February 8 , 2010 , Jackson's former personal physician Dr. Conrad Murray will turn himself in to authorities with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
Prosecutors have not revealed what charges will be filed against Murray, who was originally scheduled to turn himself in on February 5 .  His attorney was attempting to arrange it so that Murray would not be photographed being arrested.
The county coroner determined during an autopsy that Jackson's death was a homicide which resulted from a lethal combination of drugs.  These would include lorazepam and propofol .
On March 22 , 2010 , it was widely reported in the media that Michael Jackson 's doctor Dr. Conrad Murray stopped administering CPR to Jackson and instead collected drug vials to store away in his medical bag.
