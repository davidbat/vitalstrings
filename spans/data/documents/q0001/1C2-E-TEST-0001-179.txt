And for those on this board, that figure that Jackson was guilty of sexually assaulting Evan Chandler in 1993, do your homework. The bs that Chandler "knew about Jackson's privates" is false. Police transcripts later proved this explicitly. The description the child gave was completely inaccurate. It was in fact later proven by police photographs that Jackson was NOT circumsized (a key piece of the description given by Chandler). The child was also put on a "truth serum" orthodontic drug by his father (who was a dentist) during the time which they took the statement from the child (unbeknown-st to police at the time). This was all later found out (and published) by police. Jackson paid the child's family so that he could move on with his life and career. The allegations had taken up several years of his life, were hurting his personal and professional life, and was making public life for him, with the misunderstood or false facts out there, a living hell. I probably would have done the same thing.  Either way, let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Unless you knew Mr. Jackson personally, you know nothing. And you have no right to judge.

Michael died for several very simple reasons. First of all, he was made famous from the time he was a child. As most of us know, men as sensitive and artistic as Michael Jackson, when exposed to the rigors of childhood stardom, often reach adulthood with major mental and emotional challenges. Jackson was no exception. This did not allow him to deal with the extraordinary extortion attempts on his life in a very constructive way. This, coupled with Jackson's unique artistic vision of life in general, only made him less understandable, and thus, us less empathetic.  Michael had often said that he would kill himself if all the children in the world died. This statement is not an admission of pedophilic obsession, but rather an admission that the only people in his life that did not want anything but love from/for him were children. Practically all adults that contacted him due to his immense celebrity wanted something from him. Usually this involved either money, romance, or sex. Children, who for the most part on their own do not consider either of these things important, were his reprieve from the constant torment he received from adults.  Then, cue the molestation extortion attempts. Similar to claims made about Peter Pan author J. M. Barrie, who also had a platonic, fatherly love for children in general, Jackson's life was surrounded by grand extortion of the worst kind - pedophilia. It's been shared, widespread by friends and colleagues that beyond all that the trials exhibited, and beyond on the bad press, from what they knew of Jackson, he was most definitely not a pedophile. Think about it, if Michael Jackson was Michaela Jackson (a woman instead of a man), would you have thought that her taking care of children to be pedophilia? Most likely not. The woman would be considered as "maternal", not a pedophile.   Michael in his life continuously chose and was wired to blur the sexual roles that men and women have in our society. This was partly biological, partly choice as a marketing method to make him more attractive to a broader, sexually diverse audience.   That being said, the extortion attempts on Michael Jackson were essentially the nail in the coffin, not only for his career, but for his passion: taking care of children - no matter what the parent or circumstance. He truly saw himself as Peter Pan, in the benevolent means. What the trials exhaustively did, besides attempt to gain financial gain and career ruin, was to take away his ability to be around the only demographic in his life that he felt he had left to trust - children. After the trial, it has been documented that his Heal the World Foundation went largely defunct, childrens charities would have nothing to do with him (even after the trial - acquittal or not, it was just too risky a move PR wise). Basically, Jackson was cut off from the only people left that he trusted in a world who were not out to target him for every reason in the book.  It was commented by several close friends of Jackson, that after his return from Bahrain, he seemed different. His creatively was not what it once was, and it seemed that the only thing that kept him going was his own children. Had they not existed when he did, I doubt Michael would have returned from Bahrain at all, or even had lived long enough to go there in the first place.  It was this reason that Jackson began to casually go to doctors in order to be medicated out of this realization and pain. The stress of being famous, and hectic tour schedules had led Jackson down the road to insomnia for many many years already, was only heightened by his personal distress. In his last months, he was so medicated at times that he became paranoid, and feared for his life. For all we know, this may be with good reason. One will never know.  In the end, Michael was taken advantage of in many ways. His handlers were, as usual, out to protect their greatest investment - Michael Jackson the icon, the moneymaker, but not necessarily Michael Jackson the person. The situation surrounding the doctor which eventually led to Jackson's death is a sad testament to this. Dr. Conrad Murray was thousands of dollars behind in child support, desperate for cash, his home ready to be foreclosed. Then along comes a miracle (or opportunity depending) - Michael Jackson of all people wants HIM to be his doctor. Afraid to lose his meal ticket, Dr. Murray forfeited his Hippocratic oath in order to retain his most prized patient. Unfortunately, at the expense of his patients life.  Alas, money begat Michael Jackson, and money, ultimately killed him.  If we had only taken Michael for who he is, and not what we wanted him to become, we would be telling a very different story, then the one that transposed on June 25, 2009.  There was once a reported who asked Ghandi what he thought of Western civilization. He replied, "I think it would a good idea." Someday, we'll realize this, and and will desist to cost us so dearly.  - J. L. Fowlow  May God forgive us all.
