Kids can be so darn cruel... but the joke is on the meanies because adversity breeds strength!
We give BUNDLES of props to Paris Jackson - her life has been constantly under scrutiny, nasty rumors surrounding late father Michael Jackson run rampant, and now we learn she is a victim of bullying!
14 year-old Paris recently sat down with the always inspirational Oprah Winfrey for an intimate, revealing chat about everything from wearing a mask as a baby, life after Michael's death, and how kids at her new school whisper behind her back.
We can't begin to imagine what life must be like to be the late King of Pop's daughter...
But at least Oprah's interview paints us a vague picture!
Aquaint yourself with Paris (above), but cue to 9:40 for specific bullying deets.
We are ever so curious to see what kind of adventures Paris will embark on in life!
