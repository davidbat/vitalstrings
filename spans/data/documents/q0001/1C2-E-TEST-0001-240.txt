In: Michael Jackson
Answer:
On June 25th 2009 police received a call at 12:30pm from Michael Jackson's Bel-Air mansion. Paramedics rushed to the scene and found Michael Jackson in a coma, not breathing. He was rushed to UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA.
"The King of Pop" died the same day, June 25th 2009 2:26pm, due to cardiac arrest (heart stoppage), at the age of 50.
Cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack; when you have a heart attack, your heart still beats, at least initially, sending blood/oxygen around the body. Blood flow to the heart itself is blocked, and this can damage the heart. A severe heart attack can cause a cardiac arrest. When you go into cardiac arrest, your heart stops completely. Most adults who are not resuscitated after around ten minutes will die due to lack of oxygen flow to the brain.
On August 28, 2009, the cause of Jackson's cardiac arrest was reported as a combination of the potent drugs propofol, lorazepam and midazolam. The death was classified as a homicide, and law enforcement officials were investigating the actions of his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray.
