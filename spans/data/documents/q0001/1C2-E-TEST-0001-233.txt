Moments after the tragic news broke on Thursday afternoon that Michael Jackson had died, erroneous reports surfaced that Goldblum had passed away too.
The fake report about Goldblum, which surfaced on the Internet, claimed that the new “Law & Order” star died in New Zealand.
Shortly after the Goldblum rumor hit the net, his rep released a statement confirming the actor is “fine.”
“Reports that Jeff Goldblum has passed away are completely untrue. He is fine and in Los Angeles,” the rep told Access Hollywood.
According to New Zealand’s Stuff news service, the Goldblum death rumor first started on the Internet in 1999. Police in the country confirmed on Thursday that they received several inquiries from the media about the hoax.
Other stars who have been hit by fake death rumors over the years include Winona Ryder, Courtney Love and Will Ferrell.
