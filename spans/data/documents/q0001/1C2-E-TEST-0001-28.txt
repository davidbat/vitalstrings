There are no Michael Jackson autopsy photos released to the public or leaked on the underground circuit (as far as we know). The only know photo of Michael Jackson dead is this picture taken while in the paramedics. According to the reports he was already dead by the time this picture was taken. Michael Jacksonâ€™s autopsy photos may be the most elusive and sought after photos in American history. We do know that many photos were taken during Michael death but getting our hands on them could be a little harder than we first thought. Famous celebrity autopsy, crime scene, or death pictures usually leak and are quickly pulled down. Once we receive more photos we will post them here in the meantime here is the only know published photo of Michael Jackson dead before the news announced his death.
