NEW YORK, NY – Has The King of Pop imitated The King by faking his own death?
In a 1994 issue of Weekly World News , it was predicted that superstar Michael Jackson was so heartsick with the nightmare his troubled life had become, he would fake his own death – just like Elvis!
“Michael Jackson, like Elvis, is sick and tired of being larger than life and wants to get a life,” said world-renowned psychic and metaphysician Dr. Andy Reiss at the time.
“The superstar trip has trapped Michael in Neverland. Also there’s a very good chance he could end up in prison if he’s convicted of child sex abuse.
“The only way out of this mess he’s in is to fake his death, cut his hair and go underground,” says Dr. Reiss, who specializes in celebrity predictions.
Dr. Reiss believes The Gloved One will try to escape his hellish existence by “dying” in Neverland, his remote amusement park retreat.
“The cover story will be that Michael Jackson suffered a fatal heart attack while riding his Ferris wheel. Jackson’s ‘remains’ will be cremated and his ‘ashes’ will be scattered on the grounds of his estate,” he explains.
“The only way for Michael to start a fresh new life is to end the grotesque  life he has now. He learned the trick from Elvis.”

While Jackson did not end his days at his beloved Neverland, he did indeed “die” of a heart attack this afternoon.
Did Jackson’s plans come to fruition? Is he still alive somewhere?
