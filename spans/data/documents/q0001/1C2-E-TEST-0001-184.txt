Michael Jackson 's death certificate has been published online â€“ showing in detail how it was amended to officially list the late singer's passing as homicide.
The County Of Los Angeles certificate, published by the News Of The World , originally listed the cause of death as "Deferred".
In a statement of corrections on the form "Acute Propofol intoxication", "Homicide" and "Intravenous injection by another" can be seen as having been added to the cause of death section. The news of the homicide amendment was reported last September.
Propofol is the drug that was administered to the singer prior to his death.
