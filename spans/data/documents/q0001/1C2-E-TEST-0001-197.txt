Dr Conrad Murray was sentenced to four years in country jail (not state prison) yesterday, for the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson.
On passing sentence Judge Michael Pastor said:
"Of everything I heard and saw during the course of  the trial, one aspect of the evidence stands out the most, and that is  the surreptitious recording of Michael Jackson by his trusted doctor.
I find that Dr  Murray abandoned his patient who was trusting him; his patient was  vulnerable under those circumstances, having been administrated  potentially dangerous drugs by his medical provider.
Dr Murray's course of conduct extended over a period of time, he  repeatedly lied and engaged in deceitful misconduct and endeavoured to  cover up his transgressions.
He violated the trust of the medical community, of his  colleagues and of his patient and he has absolutely no sense of  remorse, absolutely no sense of fault and remains dangerous.
It's easy to say, 'Oh well, Dr Murray is a medical doctor, he's a  smart sophisticated man, he doesn't have a criminal history, he may not  be licensed to practise medicine in the future - although that has  nothing to do with me, I have no authority over that.
The fact remains, Dr Murray is offended by that  patient dying and I don't have any idea what will prompt Dr Murray to do  or not do something in the future that may be dangerous to a patient if  he does practise medicine in the United States or even elsewhere."
It is likely, because of overcrowding, that Dr Murray will not serve the full term.
