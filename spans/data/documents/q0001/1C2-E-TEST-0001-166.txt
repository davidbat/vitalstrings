The black surgical mask Michael Jackson was often seen wearing when he was alive is up for auction, and already a hot commodity on the market board.
Contributed by Jackson’s former personal bodyguard, Eric Muhammad, who signed a certificate stating the pop icon wore it the day before he died, the item is being bid on through auctioneer Nate D. Sanders , and already has stacked up more than $21,000 through seven bidders alone. 
Described as “the mask that covered the singer's nose and mouth” during his final rehearsal for comeback tour, “This Is It,” the silk guise is said to have been tailored for Jackson and shows “visible traces of his makeup.” Additionally, the auction site notes, “a single dark strand of Jackson's hair accompanies the mask.”
Bidding for the musician’s relict ends April 30.
Sanders told TODAY.com he predicted the mask would sell for “at least $50,000,” and that Jackson’s estate would not receive profits from the trade.
The pop star passed away on June 25, 2009, and there have previously been other auctions and exhibitions showcasing his remaining artifacts. The Associated Press reported in December 2011 that furniture from the mansion Jackson was renting when he died, including beds, chairs, clocks, paintings, dishes and other objects, sold for nearly $1 million through Julien’s auctions, even though the singer didn’t own most of it. His mere touch was enough to raise the value exponentially.
According to AP, a kitchen chalkboard where Jackson's children wrote "I love daddy," went for $5,000, and an armoire upon which Jackson wrote a message to himself on the mirror fetched $25,750.
Julien also sold Jackson’s “Thriller” jacket for $1.8 million at a prior event.
As for the mask, Sanders’ site estimates it could tip the scales at $150,000.
