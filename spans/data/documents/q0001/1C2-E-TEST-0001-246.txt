Michael Jackson, 50
Died June 25, 2009
Michael Jackson, a 50-year-old black man, died Thursday, June 25, after he was given a surgical anesthetic, in combination with other medication, at his rented home in the 100 block of N. Carolwood in Holmby Hills, according to authorities.
Two months after Jackson died, Los Angeles County coroner's officials released their determination that his death was a homicide.
The following is an excerpt from Times' reporters Richard Winton and Harriet Ryan's Aug. 29, 2009 story on that decision:
The Los Angeles County coroner's office has officially ruled Michael Jackson's death a homicide and determined that a surgical anesthetic combined with other medication killed him.
In a one-page statement, officials listed the cause of Jackson's June 25 death as "acute propofol intoxication" with the additional factor of "benzodiazepine effect."
Three different sedatives that fall into the benzodiazepine drug class were in Jackson's system, but only the anti-anxiety medication lorazepam, often known by the brand name Ativan, was cited alongside propofol as "the primary drugs responsible for Mr. Jackson's death."
Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, has acknowledged administering both medications to Jackson in the hours leading up to his death, according to search warrant affidavits.
