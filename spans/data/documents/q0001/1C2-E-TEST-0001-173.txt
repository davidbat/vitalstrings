Well I never believed any of the stories the MJ raped those kids... Just a equally I don't believe he is dead. I think this is just a big cover up, I love MJ but I believe he got scared and cold feet for all his upcoming concerts and decided the best way to solve the problem was to fake his death. Think about it... with all the drugs... and being out of the music industry so long...and being 50 how the hell is he going to sing and dance like he use to???? on the other hand he would not want to let all his fans down by cancelling shows or pulling no shows because then he would never had any respect or dignity from the fans he had... so the next best thing... fake death... so I do believe he is alive... maybe he just wants a peaceful life... maybe he will get clean... away from all the drugs. Anyone remember March 2005 they suppossedly found MJ body buried at the Neverland mansion.. and they claimed the man living in the mansion was an imposter and had been living MJ's life for 15-20 years! Trust me people I love MJ but im telling you he took the easy way out... He's not dead... just scared and alone.

It doesn't matter what these jealous people say. MJ was loved, he was BRILLIANT no one can take that away. Dirty minded people who can't understand that someone could love kids without molesting them. I loved him, I could have watched him dance forever.MJ is at peace now, in a magical realm moonwalking...Violetmoon

The grieving would be so much

The grieving would be so much more elegant if done using decent spelling and grammar. Michael is gone, people. Now go work on your language skills. Who knows, some new iconic songs could be in the offing.
