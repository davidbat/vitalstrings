Was He Murdered?  Is He Even Dead?
As the Dr. Conrad Murray manslaughter trial continues in Los Angeles, the life of Michael Jackson seems more controversial than ever. More than 40 years ago, backed by his four brothers, a ten-year-old Michael Jackson stepped up to a microphone and sang lead vocal on the classic Jackson Five song, "I Want You Back." Today, millions of his fans across the world are saying the same thing about him... and wondering if he left at all.
Â 
In the year since Jackson's death, unanswered questions remain about what really happened to the King of Pop.
It took investigators eight months to sift through the evidence and bring charges of involuntary manslaughter against Dr. Conrad Murray, the personal physician with Jackson the morning his heart stopped beating. But some members of the pop icon's immediate family and his fiercest fans around the world claim that focusing solely on Murray was a mistake.
Jackson's siblings Jermaine LaToya are among those who allege that his death was the tragic culmination of a conspiracy to kill the star and that Murray didn't commit the crime alone. Others say Jackson moonwalks on, having faked his death Elvis-style to escape the media spotlight that hounded him.
