Only a fool would believe MJ told Murray what other drugs he was taking. The celebs on Dr Drews show lie to his face all the time about what they've been up to. Dr Klein has been RXing MJ his drugs forever using aliases.

I also think MJ killed himself by accident. I watched some of the trial and he was also taking other drugs that the doctor did not know about. He looks like he is sleeping in that picture....

One day, all of you will die, I bet you will have wanted all people and your family to see pics of you dead on a gurney. This is sick if people can argue about a dead person and make fun of him. I wish you and your family the same.

He shoulda layed off the drugs. Why are they blaming this doctor who did not make him an addict and who probably just tried to help him.
