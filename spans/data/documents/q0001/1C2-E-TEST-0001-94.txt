Death hoax
Does everyone here really think MJ is dead? I hate to sound like a nut- but after viewing the Michael Jackson death hoax videos on youtube, I do not think He is dead. Please- before you judge me-check out the videos from Jonellstar. There are alot of videos, but she is my favorite. Michael has been crucified by the Media, for years-this would be a great payback!
