Interest Tutorial
This site uses a Java applet (in a separate window) to display a graph showing how simple or compound interest can make your money grow. The site will also introduce you to the concept of continuously compounded interest. To obtain a graph: Click on the Interest Simulation button to start the applet. Choose the number of years for your graph by clicking on the arrow buttons. Click on one of the color choices. Choose the type of compounding by clicking on simp (simple interest), comp (compound interest), or cont (continuously compounded interest). Choose the balance, which is the amount of the initial deposit. Choose the interest rate as a percent. If you chose compound interest, choose the number of intervals per year. For annual compounding, use one interval. For monthly compounding, use 12 intervals. By using several colors in the graph, you can easily compare the results of different kinds of interest.
