it doesn't say how long it's going to be compounded
2. Relevant equations
i found this one on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest :
A = P(1 + (r/n)) ^ (nt)
P = principal amount (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = number of years
A = amount after time t
and then i found this one...
A = P(1 + r)^t
