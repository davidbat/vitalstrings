ANSWER: 
You       must enter values in 3 out of the 4 textboxes.
If you get NaN       in the answer box , check your input values.  F should be more       than P .  Interest rate should be between 0 and 1.  Years can       be partial years i.e. 1 and a half years = 1.5
Annuities or       Amortization
The present       value P and the rent  R of a decreasing annuity of n  payments (rent) compounded       at a rate i  per interest period.
Also called       amortization when the payments are equal and at a regular time interval.       (car loans and home mortgages )
 
James buys a house for $90,000.  He puts $10,000 down and then finances the rest at 9% interest compounded monthly for 25 years.
Find his monthly payments
This is a Present Value of     an Annuity problem. We need to find the Rent R
Formula from book where 
i = r ÷ t  and n = t × c
Note: n = 12(25) = 300 , i = .09/12 = .0075         and P = 90,000 - 10,000 = 80,000
The monthly payments are $671.36
Find the total amounts he pays for the house.
You pay $10,000 down and $671.36 a month for 25 years
10,000 + 671.36 × 12 × 25 = 10,000 + 201,408 = 211,408
You pay $211,408 for the house with interest.
Try the calculator       below.  Use P = present value = 80000
r = rate = .09, t =years = 25, c = compound periods =       12
Leave the F  blank.
