    r = interest rate (expressed as a fraction: eg. 0.06)
    n = # of times per year interest in compounded
    t = number of years invested
Simplified Compound Interest Equation
When interest is only compounded once per yer (n=1), the equation simplifies to:
P = C (1 + r) t
Continuous Compound Interest
When interest is compounded continually (i.e. n -->
), the compound interest equation takes the form:
P = C e rt
Demonstration of Various Compounding
The following table shows the final principal (P), after t = 1 year, of an account initally with C = $10000, at 6% interest rate, with the given compounding (n). As is shown, the method of compounding has little effect.
