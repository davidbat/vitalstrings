The answer here is wrong, you wont get 5 million dollars, you will get over 10 million
2 to power of 30 is
1,073,741,824
divided by 100 (a dollar)
10,737,418.24
The mistake he made is he is only counting the last payment of 5 million and change, he is forgetting about the other 29 payments that were made to you. So you aren’t getting 4 million dollars more than the one time million dollar payment, you are getting almost 10 million more than the million dollar payment.

In my youth I would have been tempted to go for the “million dollars” option.  But, back then I didn’t understand compound interest.  Compound interest can be effective, but it does depend on so many variables, e.g. the rate of inflation, interest rates, the amount saved and over how long. Unfortunately the answer is never black and white.

It’s amazing! It is a great illusion, assuming you understand the full meaning of the word illusion. First of all, that table that you have shown has nothing to do with compound interest, or by extension, the power of compounding! The power of compounding, on the other hand, is the greatest of all the illusions ever invented by human kind. I can see that your intentions are good. And the idea of encouraging people to save for a better future are indeed honorable! But, why use examples that are sub real? Why bring names of people like Albert Einstein into the equation? I also read somewhere that he said “…the power of compounding was said to be deemed the eight wonder of the world…” If that is true, the question then would be: why did he use the verbs in its past tense? Is it because he realized towards the end of his life that the power of compounding was an incredible illusion and not REAL? An illusion when it is used to your advantage, but REAL when it is used against you? What is then that the power of compounding really is? It is just the perfect formula for the PRESERVATION of POWER by the elite! It ain’t gonna help any poor guy! If in 1950 you had put aside a $1 000 000.00 compounded at about 3% annually, after effects of inflation you would have now arround $1 800 000.00 Not even 2 million dollars! Of course, you would still be a millionaire today…but then again, you were already a millionaire back then! So, where is the holly grail here? What about the averages Joes, as you said, those Joes that don’t need to know the theory of relativity…let see. If a nurse was able to make about $200.00 a month, or a teacher was able to make arround $400.00 montly, and a factory worker could make $160.00 a month, for these people the idea of putting money aside was way beyond their means. The same applies today, my friend. However, let’s pretend that these people knew the power of compounding and were able to put aside $1000.00 compounded at 3%, just as the millionaire did. How much money would they have today after the effects of inflation? They would have about $1 800.00 to $2 000.00! Big deal!!! So…what would be their status today? THE SAME! Who doesn’t have $2 000.00 now? Furtheremore, how many years were these people invested? A LIFE TIME OF 60 YEARS! Finally, let me conclude with this: If you were rich yesterday, the power of compounding will keep you rich today, and if you were poor yesterday, the power of compounding has the potential to keep you poorer today. Could you please, I beg you, show to me in your reply how wrong am I? Assuming you will reply. And as I said at the beginning, it is AMAZING isn’t it?
