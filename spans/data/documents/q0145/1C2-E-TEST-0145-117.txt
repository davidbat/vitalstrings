Total                 Return
$163,665
The difference now, given just 5 extra years, is a staggering $123,665.           In other words, David has multiplied his initial investment 16 times           by re-investing his interest income, as opposed to only 4 times by           electing to have it paid back to him.
And           herein lies the key and power to compound interest. Anyone in our           prosperous nation can become financially free with sufficient time           – and given 3 keys:
That               you learn to live on less than you earn, and invest what disposable income               you have (George S. Clason in his book
The Richest Man in Babylon suggests you should set aside and invest a minimum of 10% of your               income)
That               you invest at a reasonably good interest rate (i.e. well above the               rate of inflation)
That               you start as soon as possible to put time on your side
 
If           a 20yr old starts investing just $100 per month ($23 p/w) at a return of 15% pa, by the time they retire at age 60 they           will have accumulated a sum of $2,455,144.63.
If           you're a 20yr old reading this, I urge you to start doing this now.           Don't put it off – the key to compounding is time. If you wait           until you're 30 to start doing this, you'll only have $599,948.30 by age 60 instead of $2,455,144.63.
If           you're 40 or 50 and you're reading this, don't be discouraged. You're obviously not going to be able to derive the same           benefit from compounding compared to a 20yr old, but start now           anyway – the sooner you start, the better off you'll be.
The           final question you may be asking is: where can I get a 15% return in           these low interest rate times? Well obviously, you won't get it by           putting your money into a term deposit at the bank. It's not my           place to provide financial advice - you should speak to a certified           financial planner for this. But I should say that 15% is not too           difficult to achieve even with limited financial know how.
The           Australian accumulated All Ordinaries index has historically achieved           close to this. Although the past cannot be taken as an indication of           the future, an equities index fund could be considered, such as an           ASX300 accumulation fund. This type of fund will give you a little           piece of all of the top 300 shares on the Australian market,           minimising your exposure  to a downturn by any one company or market            sector.
Alternatively,           it's quite easy to find Australian blue chip shares that are paying           5% fully franked dividends at the moment – this equates to 7% or so           with franking credits thrown in. Add to that capital growth of another           7% or so per annum, and you'll be well on your way to achieving a           15% return with dividend reinvestment.
For           more sophisticated investors, it's not too difficult to achieve even           higher returns (such as, for example, selling call options over a            portfolio of blue-chip shares), but this           will require some time and effort to learn and is an active form of           investing as opposed to passive.
Finally,           once you've chosen your passive investment fund and have determined           the regular monthly amount you will be investing, put it on           auto-pilot. Set-up a periodical payment so that the amount is taken           from your bank account automatically every month and invested into           your fund. Try to start with 10% of your income as a regular           investment.
Stay           disciplined and don't dip into your funds for any reason short of           major crisis. Your funds should only be accessed once you've           accumulated a large enough sum that you no longer need to work.
