Simple Interest
Simple interest is calculated by multiplying the loan amount (e.g.            $1000) by the interest rate (e.g. 5%) by the number of payment periods            over the life of the loan (e.g. 24 months). The thing to keep in mind            here is that the interest rate may be expressed in terms of an annual            rate, e.g. 5% per annum, whereas the payment periods might be expressed            in months, e.g. 24 months. To ensure your calculation of simple interest            is accurate, you need to ensure that both the interest rate and the            payment periods are expressed in the same manner, say annually or monthly.            For example, using the figures above, our $1000 loan would be at 5%            per annum, and taken out over just 2 years (as opposed to 24 months).            So here the calculation would be 1000 x 0.05 x 2 (loan x interest x            term) = 100. So, the amount of simple interest that we would pay on            this loan over the two year term would be $100. Interest rates are seldom            calculated using the simple interest rate formula however, and are more            likely to be calculated using the compound interest formula.
Compound Interest
Compound interest relates to charges the borrower must pay not just            on the principal amount borrowed, as in simple interest, but also on            any interest outstanding at that point in time. To illustrate the difference            between compounding interest and simple interest, consider the following            very simplified scenario of a $1000 loan taken out at 10% over 2 years            (assuming no payments are made until the end of the loan):
Example of Simple vs Compound Interest
Simple Interest:
First year: $1,000 x 1 year x 10% = $100 in interest
Second year: $1,000 x 1 year x 10% = $100 in interest
Total Interest: $200
Total of the principal amount plus interest = $1,200
In this scenario, the total amount of interest paid over the life of            the loan would be $200
Compound Interest:
First year: $1,000 x 1 year x 10% = $100 in interest
Second year: $1,100 x 1 year x 10% = $110 in interest
Total Interest: $210
Total of the principal amount plus interest = $1,210
In this scenario, with interest compounded annually, the total amount            of interest paid is $210
Now keep in mind that this is a somewhat simplified example, but it            should be enough to highlight the workings of compound interest. In            reality you’ll be expected to make payments on your loan at regular            intervals for the life of the loan, and therefore the effects of paying            interest on your interest will be different from the above example.            For the most part however, any loans you take out will, or should, have            regular fixed payments. At the beginning, these payments will go primarily            to paying off the interest on the loan, with a smaller percentage going            to paying off the principal. Over time, this ratio changes to more of            the principal being paid off with each installment.
