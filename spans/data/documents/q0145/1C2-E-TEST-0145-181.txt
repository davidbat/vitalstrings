$1648.66$
The added savings from earning interest on interest is perhaps not quite as much as you'd hope.
For example, in one year you'd earn an additional $\,\$1051.27 - \$1050 = \$1.27\,$ over simple annual interest, by adding in interest daily.
In ten years, you'd earn an additional $\,\$1648.66 - \$1628.89 = \$19.77\,$ over simple annual interest, by adding in interest daily.
As the length of time and the amount of money invested increase, though, the savings do go upÂ—and every little bit helps!
DERIVATION OF THE COMPOUND INTEREST FORMULA
The compound interest formula results from using variables to represent a general investing situation,
writing down several computations, and seeing a pattern emerge.
In a nutshell, you're going to invest $\,P\,$ dollars at annual interest rate $\,r\,$,
add in interest $\,n\,$ times per year, and see how much you have after $\,t\,$ years.
Here are the details:
You are investing [beautiful math coming... please be patient] $\,P\,$ dollars.
You will start the clock at the moment you make this initial investment;
i.e., let $\,t=0\,$ correspond to the initial investment time.
Let $\,r\,$ denote the (simple) annual interest rate for this investment.
Express $\,r\,$ as a decimal. For example,  $\,5\%\,$ corresponds to $\,r=0.05\,$.
Assume that interest is added in at regular intervals, $\,n\,$ times per year.
For monthly compounding, $\,n=12\,$.
For weekly compounding, $\,n=52\,$.
For daily compounding, $\,n=365\,$.
Thus, $\,n\,$ represents the number of compounding periods per year.
Let $\,A\,$ represent the total amount of money (principal plus interest) after $\,t\,$ years.
The table below shows the accumulations after various numbers of compounding periods:
after this time...
you'll have this much money...
NOTE:
$1\,$ compounding period
[beautiful math coming... please be patient] $P+\frac{r}{n}\cdot P=P(1+\frac{r}{n})=P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^1$
factor out $\,P\,$
$2\,$ compounding periods
[beautiful math coming... please be patient] $P(1+\frac{r}{n})+\frac{r}{n}\cdot P(1+\frac{r}{n})=P(1+\frac{r}{n})(1+\frac{r}{n}) =P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^2$
factor out $\,P(1+\frac{r}{n})$
$3\,$ compounding periods
[beautiful math coming... please be patient] $P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^2+\frac{r}{n}\cdot P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^2 =P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^2(1+\frac{r}{n}) =P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^3$
factor out $\,P{(1+\frac{r}{n})}^2$
