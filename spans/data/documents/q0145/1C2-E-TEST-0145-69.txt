A(t) is the amount after t years
t is the time, in years
P is the principal, or initial amount
r is the interest rate, in decimal form
n is the number of times interest is compounded each year
2  Examples
NOTE!
To work some of the following examples the use of logarithms is required.  If necessary, refer to the Logarithms chapter for help.
The following examples exist only in "Math World."  Do not expect to see interest rates this nice in the real world!
2.1  Finding Amount
As a high school graduation present, Alice has just been given $500 to put in an interest bearing account for the next 4 years.  She goes to her local bank and asks what options she has.  She is told the following three options are available:
A:  interest rate of 6% compounded monthly
B:  interest rate of 5.75% compounded weekly
C:  interest rate of 6.25% compounded quarterly
Into which account should Alice place her money?  And, how much money will she have at the end of the 4 years?
2.1.1  Work
For any of the options, we know that the following are in place:
A(4) is what we are trying to find.
P = 500, since our starting, or initial, amount is $500.
t = 4, since we are looking for the amount in the account after 4 years.
Option A
Additionally, we know that:
r = 0.06, since our interest rate is 6% (and to get from a percent to a decimal equivalent, we divide by 100)
n = 12, since interest is compounded monthly and there are 12 months in one year.
   
Option B
Additionally, we know that:
r = 0.0575, since our interest rate is 5.75% (and to get from a percent to a decimal equivalent, we divide by 100)
n = 52, since interest is compounded weekly and there are 52 weeks in one year.
   
Option C
Additionally, we know that:
r = 0.0625, since our interest rate is 6.25% (and to get from a percent to a decimal equivalent, we divide by 100)
n = 4, since interest is compounded quarterly and there are 4 quarters in one year.
   
2.1.2  Solution
Thus, it is clear that Alice should choose account C, which will have a value of $640.77 in 4 years.

2.2  Finding Time (and doubling time)
Bob has $800 to invest in an interest bearing account that will compound interest monthly at a 6% interest rate.  How long will Bob have to leave his money invested for it to double?
2.2.1  Work
What do we know?
A(t) = 1600, since we are looking for the time it takes for our initial amount to double.
P = 800 is the initial amount Bob has to invest.
r = 0.06, since the interest rate is 6% (and to get from a percent to a decimal equivalent, we divide by 100)
n = 12, since interest is compounded monthly and there are 12 months in a year.
t is what we are trying to find.
Plugging these values into the compound interest formula and solving for t yields:
   
2.2.2  Solution
So, it will take Bob 11.58 years (about 11 years and 7 months) for his money to double in this account.  Note that we can use natural logarithms to get the same answer.

2.3  Finding Principal
Sam is willing to invest money into an interest bearing account that compounds interest quarterly at 8%.  After 5 years, he would like to buy a nice new car valued at $23,000.  How much money does Sam need to invest to meet this goal?
2.3.1  Work
A(5) = 23000, since we want to have $23,000 in 5 years.
P is the initial amount we are trying to find.
r = 0.08, since the interest rate is 8% (and to get from a percent to a decimal equivalent, we divide by 100)
n = 4, since interest is compounded quarterly and there are 4 quarters in a year.
t = 5, since we want to have our money in 5 years.
Plugging these values into the compound interest formula and solving for P yields:
