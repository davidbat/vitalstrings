Home Insurance and Pipes that Go ‘Pop’ in the Night
Personal Finance Tip: Base your  long-term plan on your current career prospects. A common financial  planning mistake people make is to expect the future  to do all the heavy lifting in their savings plans--the future when  they are suddenly making far more money, etc. Instead, base your  plan on modest increases from where your income is now, and if you  make it big, there's always room to upgrade your plan.
