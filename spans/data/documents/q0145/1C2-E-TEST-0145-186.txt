Find the amount of compound interest earned in an account that opens with $27,000, earns 4.6% interest compounded daily, and is held for 25 years. Assume 360 days in a year. (Round your answer to the nearest cent.) I came up with $85,264.94 is this correct if not I need help!!!

If it's simple interest and the rate is 5% yearly, then -- 5,000 * 0.05 = 250 250 * 5 = 1,250 5,000 + 1,250 = 6,250 The answer would be different if you charged compound interest.

The formula for compound interest is: Final amount or future value, A = PR^n where P = principal R = rate of interest per period, for example, 8% p.a. is 2/3% per month. R is expressed as 1+rate, so for monthly compounding, R for 8% is 1+8/1200=1.00666667 n = number of periods...

I need help with this problem... A 1.208 g sample of a compound containing C, H, and O was burned to produce 2.561 g CO2 and 0.3930 g H2O. Calculate the empirical formula of the compound. I always get stuck when it comes to finding the subscript for this compound.

So far i have not compleatly worked it out.but compound E is NOT NH3. it is NH2OH, which you can tell only by its titation information. compound D is N2O2H4 in some order. compound A is likely Nitric Acid.

CH2 is not a stable compound. C2H4 is a stable compound, ethylene. It is a gaseous Organic compound that reacts with Cl2 to yield. HCl (Hydrochloric acid) and Carbon.
