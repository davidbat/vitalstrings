Value of investment after t years:
S = Pert
Where e is the transcendental number 2.7182818285...
Notice that the output, S, is an exponential function of t. That is, if we consider the final  value of the investment as a function of the length of time for the investment, then t, the length of time for  the investment, is in the exponent position, and this makes S an exponential function of t.
Example calculation
If $4000 is invested at an annual rate of 6.0% compounded continuously, what will be the final  value of the investment after 10 years?
S = Pert
