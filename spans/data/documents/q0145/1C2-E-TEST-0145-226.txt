I have been told by seasoned educators not to "re-invent the wheel" when coming up with ideas for lessons. So true!! Lesson Planet has a wealth of sources and ideas from some of the greatest teaching minds that are out there...what a blessing to have a resource such as Lesson Planet, to turn to. I am even planning to contribute a lesson or two myself. My daughter is in a teacher education program and I have introduced her to the "Planet". We're spreading the news!
