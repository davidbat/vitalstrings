My math professor suggested I use your Algebrator  product to help me learn the quadratic equations, and non-linear inequalities, since I just could not follow what he was teaching.  I was very skeptical at first, but when I started to understand how to enter the equations, I was amazed with the solution process your software provides. I tell everyone in my class that has problems to purchase your product.

This version of algebra help is awesome! Better interface, better helps and easier to work with. In fact, I have improved my algebra from failing to pass since I started using it.
