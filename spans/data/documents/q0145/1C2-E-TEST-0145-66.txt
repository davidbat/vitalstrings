Formula:
Total Amount = Principal + CI (Compound Interest)
a. Formula for Interest Compounded Annually
         Total Amount = P(1+(R/100))n
b. Formula for Interest Compounded Half Yearly
         Total Amount = P(1+(R/200))2n
c. Formulae for Interest Compounded Quarterly
         Total Amount = P(1+(R/400))4n
d. Formulae for Interest Compounded Annually with fractional years (e.g 2.5 years)
         Total Amount = P(1+(R/100))a×(1+(bR/100))
         here if year is 2.5 then a =2 and b=0.5
e. With different interest rates for different years
Say x% for year 1, y% for year2, z% for year3
         Total Amount = P(1+(x/100))*(1+(y/100))*(1+(z/100))
where CI = Compound Interest, P = Principal or Sum of amount, R = % Rate per annum, n = Time Span in years
Online Compound Interest Calculation. Calculating Compound Interest, Principal, different Rate of Interest for annual, half yearly, quartely and for fractional years are made much easier.
