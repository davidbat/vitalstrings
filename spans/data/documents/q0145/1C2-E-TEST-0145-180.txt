Compound interest is when interest is     calculated on principal and any previously earned interest.
Let's     consider an example.  You invest $500 at a 5% annual interest     rate.   After the first year, the account would earn     interest of:
I = Prt = 500 * .05 * 1 = $25
If     you re-invest this $25 in earned interest, then at the beginning of     the 2nd year, the account would have $525 as principal.  During     the 2nd year, the account would earn interest of:
I = Prt = 525 * .05 * 1 = $26.25
which     is $1.25 more than what was earned in the first year.  Compound     interest has the property that earned interest is automatically     reinvested to earn additional interest.
The     formula for calculating the accumulated value via compound interest     is as follows:
A = P(1 + r/m)n
where A is     the accumulated value, P is Principal, r is the annual interest rate, m is compounding frequency, and n is the total number of periods.
Example 1  Calculate the interest earned from a $4,500 loan compounded     quarterly at 5% for     6 years.
Here,     P = $4,500, r = 5% = .05, and m = 4 (quarterly).  Over 6-years,     there are n = 4*6 = 24 quarters.  The accumulated value is:
A = (4500)[1 + .05/4]24 = 6063.08
I = A - P =     6063.08 - 4500 = 1563.08
Example 2  A savings account pays 4% interest and is compounded daily (365     days).  When will the accumulated value be twice the original     principal?
We     are solving for n:
2P = P( 1 + .04/365 )n
log 2     = n log (1 + .04/365)
n =     log 2 / log (1 + .04/365) = 6325.32
n is the number of periods which for     this example, is in days.  It will take 6325 days to double the     principal, which is roughly 6325/365 = 17.32 years.
