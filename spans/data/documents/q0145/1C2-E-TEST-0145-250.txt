Defining Variables
Define your own variables to get the most out of Encalc. You can type "M" in the first box and "12 grams" in the second box to define "M=12 grams". From there, you only have to refer to M in your formulas.
Physical Constants
Encalc has a database of hundreds of physical constants. "The speed of light" and "c" would both be equal to 299800000 m / s. Try other constants - there's a good chance it's in the database. To turn off the database, click Preferences. This is useful when you want to use a constant as a variable in algebra, e.g. "(a+b+c)^2" without using c = the speed of light.
