This calculator can solve for any one of these 4 numbers.   Simply click on the button you don't know, input the other 3 numbers, then  click on "CALCULATE" to get your answer.
For example, you've just deposited $5,000 (principal) at 9% interest (rate) and now you are  waiting for it to "grow" into $10,000 (total). How  long (years) will it take?
Since you don't know the years, click on that button.  Now enter the 3 numbers  that you do know.  Click on "CALCULATE" and your answer will be 8.0432 years.
When inputting, do NOT use the dollar sign ($), commas or the per cent sign (%).
