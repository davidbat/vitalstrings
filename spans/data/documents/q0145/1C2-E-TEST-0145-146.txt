The compound interest formula is given below:
Where:   
A is the total amount of             money (including interest) after n years
P is the             principal (the amount money borrowed             or invested)
r is             the interest rate (per year or             per annum)
n is             the loan or investment duration in             years

HOW TO CALCULATE COMPOUND INTEREST  PART 1  00:00:03.230 In this example, we will learn how to calculate compound interest.  00:00:09.230 Consider a loan of $2000 with the compound interest rate of 20% and the duration of the loan is 3 years.  00:00:19.200 Find the total amount of money that we need to pay back, after 3 years.  00:00:26.040 Now, we start with the compound interest formula, A=P(1+r)^n  00:00:34.030 Where, 'A' is the total amount. 'P' is the loan amount, or principal. 'R' is the interest rate. And 'N' is the loan duration.  00:00:48.030 Here's how we calculate compound interest. Since the principal is given as $2000. We can substitute P, with 2000.  00:00:55.190 Now, the interest rate is given as 20%. Hence, we can substitute 'R', with 20%.    00:01:06.040 The loan duration is given as 3 years. Therefore, we can substitute 'N' with 3..  00:01:14.130 Note that, before we can calculate compound interest, we need to convert 20% to a decimal.  00:01:21.160 We can do so, by dividing 20%, with 100. This gives 0.2.  00:01:33.220 Adding 1, with 0.2, gives 1.2.  00:01:39.110 Next, 1.2 to the power of 3 is the same as, 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2. This gives 1.728. Let’s write this down here.  00:01:55.150 2000 multiply with 1.728 gives, $3456.  00:02:03.130 Hence, the total amount of money that we need to pay back after 3 years is, $3456.  00:02:14.000 That is all for this example on  calculate compound interest.   PART 2  00:00:04.070 After learning how to calculate compound interst, we will now see how we can find the principal of a loan, using the compound interest formula.  00:00:12.210 Consider a loan with the compound interest rate of 10%. The duration of the loan is 2 years. And the total amount of money that we need to pay back after 2 years is $1210.  00:00:28.020 Find the loan amount (principal), P.  00:00:32.020 Now, we start with the compound interest formula, A=P(1+R)^n.  00:00:40.130 Since the total amount of money that we need to pay back is given as $1210, we can substitute 'A' with 1210.  00:00:51.220 The interest rate is given as 10%. Hence, we can substitute 'R' with 10%.  00:01:01.130 Next, the loan duration is given as 2 years. Hence, we can substitute 'N' with 2.  00:01:11.080 Now, before we can calculate, we need to change 10% into a decimal.  00:01:17.170 To do so, we divide 10% with 100. This gives 0.1.  00:01:27.090 Let's calculate. Adding 1 with 0.10, gives 1.1.  00:01:35.200 Next, 1.1 square is the same as, 1.1 multiply with 1.1. This gives 1.21.  00:01:47.020 Let's write this down.  00:01:50.100 Now we have, 1.21 = $1210.  00:01:58.190 Let's rewrite this equation, so that it looks neater.  00:02:03.160 To find 'P', we need to remove 1.21.  We can do so, by dividing both sides of the equation with 1.21.  00:02:15.090 By doing so, we have, P=1210/1.21.  00:02:24.170 1210, divided by 1.21, gives $1000.  00:02:32.140 Hence, the principal of this loan, P, is $1000.  00:02:40.040 That is all for this example.   PART 3  00:00:04.170 In this example, we will learn how to find the interest rate of a loan, using the compound interest formula.  00:00:13.040 Consider a loan of $1200. After 2 years, the total amount of money that we need to pay back is $1452.  00:00:24.190 Find the interest rate, r.  00:00:28.170 Now, we start with the compound interest formula, A=P(1+r)^n.  00:00:38.100 Since the total amount is given as $1452, we can substitute 'A' with 1452.  00:00:48.020 Since the principal is given as $1200, we can substitute 'P' with 1200.  00:00:56.230 The duration of the loan is 2 years. Therefore, we can substitute 'N' with 2.  00:01:04.130 Let's solve for 'R'. First, we need to remove 1200.  To do so, we divide both sides of the equation, with 1200.  00:01:19.090 This gives. 1452/1200 = (1+r)^2.  00:01:30.140 1452 two divided by 1200, gives 1.21.  00:01:38.230 Now we have, (1+r)^2 = 1.21. Let's rewrite it here.  00:01:49.220 Next, we need to remove this 'square'. To do so, we square root both sides of the equation.  00:01:58.190 By doing so, we get, 1 + R = 1.121.  00:02:09.050 Square root of 1.21, gives 1.1.  00:02:15.010 Now, we have 1 + r = 1.1. Let's rewrite it here.  00:02:24.120 Finally, to get 'r', we need to remove 1. We can do so, by adding both sides of the equation with -1.  00:02:36.050 By doing so, we have, r = 1.1 -1.  00:02:44.040 1.1 minus 1, gives 0.1.  00:02:49.070 Now, we need to convert this decimal, 0.1, to percent.  00:02:55.110 To do so, we simply multiply 0.1, with 100. This gives 10%.  00:03:07.060 Hence, the interest rate of this loan, 'r', is 10%.  00:03:15.020 That is all for this example.  --END OF TRANSCRIPT ON HOW TO CALCULATE COMPOUND INTEREST--
