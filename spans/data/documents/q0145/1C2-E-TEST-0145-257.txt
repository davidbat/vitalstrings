Students compute and collect interest payments in the form of M&M candies. In this mathematics lesson, students work in small groups to compute either simple or compound interest. They compare the growth of their accounts after six cycles. A recommendation to "pay" the students in M&M candies is made to make the lesson more interesting for the students.
