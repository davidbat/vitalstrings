Compound Interest
Just getting everyone together for a meal is a challenge for most families today, so bringing together three generations for weeks at a time—year after year—is surely the result of a very special occasion.
For the Walsh family, summer on the Vineyard is the only occasion they need.
Mason and Marigil Walsh have had a home on Martha’s Vineyard for decades, but as their children grew and started having families of their own, their Chilmark cottage went from cozy to, well, slightly claustrophobic.
Rather than sell their house, the Walshes turned it over to their children, then bought the empty lot that stood in front of it. Years earlier, the couple had collaborated with architect Joe Dick and builder Bill Dreyer on a renovation. Now, recalling the success of that venture, they enlisted Dick and Dreyer again to build the home where they would start the next chapter of their lives. “We all sat down and worked together as a team and birthed the house out of the ground,” says Marigil.
