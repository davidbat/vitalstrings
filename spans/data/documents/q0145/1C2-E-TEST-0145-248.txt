P is the principal (the money you start with,         your first deposit)
r is the annual rate of interest as a decimal (5% means r =         0.05)
n is the number of years you leave it on deposit
A is how much money you've accumulated after n years, including         interest.
If the interest is compounded once a year:
A = P(1 + r)n
If the interest is compounded q times a year:
A = P(1 + r/q)nq
