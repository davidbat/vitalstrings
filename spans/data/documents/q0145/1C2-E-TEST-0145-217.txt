I = 4000× 0.08 × 4
I = 1280 dollars
However, coumpound interest is the interest earned not only on the original principal, but also on all interests earned previously
In other words, at the end of each year, the interest earned is added to the original amount and the money is reinvested
If we use compound interest for the situation above, the interest will be computed as follow:
Interest at the end of the first year:
I = 4000× 0.08 × 1
Your new principal per say is now 4000 + 320 = 4320
Interest at the end of the second year:
I = 4320× 0.08 × 1
Your new principal is now 4320 + 345.6 = 4665.6
Interest at the end of the third year:
I = 4665.6× 0.08 × 1
Your new principal is now 4665.6 + 373.248 = 5038.848
Interest at the end of the fourth year:
I = 5038.848 × 0.08 × 1
Your new principal is now 5038.848 + 403.10784 = 5441.95584
Total interest earned = 5441.95584 − 4000 = 1441.95584
The difference in money between coumpond interest and simple interest is 1441.96 - 1280 = 161.96
As you can see, compound interest yield better result, so you make more money.
Therefore, before investing your money, you should double check with your local bank if coumpound interest will be used.
Having said that if you have a credit card and you owe money on it, you will pay less interest if the credit card company uses  simple interest. However, they will never do something so foolish!
I hope simple vs compound interest is well understood now!
