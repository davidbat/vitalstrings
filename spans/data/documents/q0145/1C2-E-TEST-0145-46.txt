You may like to read about Compound Interest first.
You can  skip straight down to Periodic Compounding .
Quick Explanation of Compound Interest
With Compound Interest , you work out the interest for the first period, add it to the total, and then calculate the interest for the next period, and so on ..., like this:
But adding 10% interest is the same as multiplying by 1.10
(explained here )
So it also works like this:
In fact we can go from the Start to Year 5 if we multiply 5 times using Exponents (or Powers) :
The Formula
We have been using a real example, but let's be more general by using letters instead of numbers, like this:
Examples
So $1,000 invested at 10% for 5 Years would become:
... and what if the interest rate was only 6%?
Periodic Compounding (Within The Year)
But sometimes interest is charged Yearly ...
... with several  compoundings within the Year.
Compoundings Within The Year
Let's see what happens if there are two compoundings per year
Example: "10%, Compounded Semiannually"
Semiannual means twice a year. So the 10% is split into two:
5% halfway through the year,
and another 5%  at the end of the year,
but each time it is compounded (meaning the interest is added to the total):
10%, Compounded Semiannually
This results in $1,102.50, which is equal to 10.25%, not 10%
Two Annual Interest Rates?
Yes, there are two annual interest rates:
