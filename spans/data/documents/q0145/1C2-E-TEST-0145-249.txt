Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. - Albert Einstein
      Money Invested is the amount invested in the beginning.
Interest is the amount of appreciation or gain each year.
Years equals the number of years you are investing.
Example:  Let's say you invest $1,000 when you're 20 years old and completely forget about it until you are 50.                 In that time your investment grew 10% each year.  Your investment would be worth $17,449.40.
Years: 30
Money Invested: $1,000.00
What is compounding?
You don't have to be Einstein to put the power of compound interest to work for you.  Compounding is the process by which an investment increases in value over time.   The stock market has its ups and down.  But if you invested $1,000.00 in the S&P 500 on December 29, 1976, as of December 29, 2006, your investment would be worth $13,397.87.  That means that in only 30 years, the investment went up by over 13 times!  Averaged out year to year, that is equivalent to an average annual return of around 8.65%.

Why You Should Consider Inflation
In 1900, you could buy a first class stamp for 2 cents.  Today, it costs 39 cents.  As time goes on, things cost more.             Because things will probably cost more when you retire, you must take advantage of compounding to counteract this effect.              Let’s say you have $1000 today and you put it into a shoe box to save for retirement.  Assuming you retire 30 years from              now and inflation averages 3% per year, your $1000 will only be worth around $400 in today’s dollars.
But don’t despair.  You can use the principle of compounding to counteract the effects of inflation.              To do so, you must invest.  Let’s say that instead of putting your $1000 in a shoe box, you put it             into a bank’s “certificate of deposit” paying 5% per year.  Assuming 3% inflation and 5% return per year,             your investment will be worth $4,322 after 30 years.  But because of inflation, $4,322 will only buy what             $1,811 buys today.  Note that even with the effect of inflation, investing in the 5% CD (yielding $1,811             inflation adjusted) outperforms placing the money in a shoe box (yielding $400 inflation adjusted) by a factor of 4.5!!
