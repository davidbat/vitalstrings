S = P + Pr = P(1 + i)
Amount at the start of this period
Amount of interest earned during this period on the starting amount of this period
Final value at end of this period
After 2 periods:
S = P(1 + i) + P(1 + i)i = P(1 + i)(1 + i) = P(1 + i)2
Amount at the start of this period, i.e., the final value at the end of the last   period
Amount of interest earned during this period on the starting amount of this period
Final value at end of this period
After 3 periods:
S = P(1 + i)2 + P(1 + i)2i = P(1 + i)2(1   + i) = P(1 + i)3
Amount at the start of this period, i.e., the final value at the end of the last   period
Amount of interest earned during this period on the starting amount of this period
Final value at end of this period
After n periods:
S = P(1 + i)n
Often the interest per period, i, is expressed in terms of the annual percentage rate (APR),  r, and the number of interest periods per year, k.
Under these conditions the interest per period is equal to the annual percentage rate divided  by the number of interest periods per year, as in:
i = r / k
This would make the above formula for the final value of an investment after n interest periods  look like this:
S = P(1 + r/k)n
Notice that the output, S, is an exponential function of n. That is, if we consider the final  value of the investment as a function of the length of time for the investment, then n, the length of time for  the investment, is in the exponent position, and this makes S an exponential function of n.
Example calculation
If $4000 is invested at an annual rate of 6.0% compounded monthly, what will be the final value  of the investment after 10 years?
Since the interest is compounded monthly, there are 12 periods per year, so, k = 12.
Since the investment is for 10 years, or 120 months, there are 120 investment periods, so, n  = 120.
S = P(1 + r/k)n
