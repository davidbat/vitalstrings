The shorter the duration between compounding the more interest you earn or are charged.
Shorter compounding good when investing, shorter compounding bad when borrowing.
Credit cards are usually computed on a daily basis but only credit you for your payment once a month.  What that means is that your balance is being charged interest daily, but your payment is only being credited once a month.  If they are really mean and nastey, as many are, they will charge you interest daily on your average daily balance.  That means that if you started the month with a $1000.00 balance and made no other charges that month, however during the middle of the month you paid it off in full; you are looking at an interest charged on roughly $750.00 AVERAGE daily balance.  It is very conceivable that the next month you will have a balance owed in the amount of your interest charged on your average daily balance, even if the account balance was zero.  Can you say credit cards bad?
Conversely, many bank savings accounts will pay you on your average daily balance.  If you start with $0.00 and deposit $1000.00 they may compute your average daily balance as being $750.00 and only pay you the interest rate on the average daily balance.  Even though they pay interest compounded monthly, many still use the average daily balance method for computing interest payments.  Somehow that just seems wrong.
