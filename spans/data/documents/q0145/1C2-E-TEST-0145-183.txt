P = principal amount                 (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of times the interest is                 compounded per year
t = number of years
A = amount after time t
 
 
Example Problem
An amount of $1,500.00 is deposited in a         bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded         quarterly. Find the balance after 6 years.
Solution
Use the regular compound         interest formula,
A = P ( 1 + r/n ) nt, with P = 1500, r = 4.3/100 = 0.043,
n = 4 ( not 1/4         ), t = 6. Therefore,
So, the balance after 6 years is         approximately $1,938.84.
