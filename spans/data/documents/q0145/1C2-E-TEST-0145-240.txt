When interest is added to the principal amount of deposit, and                 then subsequent periods of interest earnings are based on the principal                 and interest                 amounts for the prior period(s) combined there is said to                 be compound interest. This compounding raises the level of earnings                 over simple interest methods. The following are based on (1)                 year periods.
Daily compounding over a year=
Principal Deposit (1+ % interest rate/365)365
Monthly compounding over same =
Principal Deposit (1+ % interest rate/12)12
Quarterly compounding over ditto =
Principal                                 Deposit (1+ % interest rate/4)4
While the above are for single year                                 periods, the exponent changes when accounting                   for other periods. To illustrate this point, monthly compounding                   over a 3 year period at 3% per annum looks like:
Principal                                 Deposit (1.0025)36
Where the period number, 36, is gotten by: 3x12mo.'s                                 = 36
And the rate of interest arrived at by: 3/12                   = .25% = .0025
As you can see, the main variable is the period of compounding.                  Try for yourself and you will notice that the more often the                 periods of compounding occur, the increased the                 rates                 of return that                  go to the                 account holder. Although this much depends on the advertised                   rates from the bank, frequency of compounding  could                   potentially factor against the increase in the rate                   of return. It therefore deserves further analysis based on                   the rates and compounding cycles being offered.

Continuous compounding, used to describe                   compounding that is computed continuously over                   periods, generally goes to the benefit of the depositor, at                   least by itself in concept. On another  side of a                   coin, it might not be so advantageous for                   someone held to making loan payments.
