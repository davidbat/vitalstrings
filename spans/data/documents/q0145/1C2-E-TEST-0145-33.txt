Compound Interest - The Basics
First, we need to understand        how compound interest works.  It's how your money        grows!  Getting this will help you understand the        best way to save and invest.  Yes, it's math...  But, not the math of text books...  This is the        real stuff and it's very simple!
Let's invest $1.00 in an account that        pays 12% interest each year... and let's say that the        account is compounded yearly.
Compounded yearly means that, at the end of           each year they add the yearly interest           (12%) to your account.
(That's 12% of the amount in the account.)
What if we make the same        investment, but it's compounded semi-annually?
Compounded semi-annually (twice a year)           means that, at the end of June they add 6% of           the amount in your account...
and at the end           of December, they add another 6%.
 
Now, let's make it compounded        quarterly...
Compounded quarterly (four times a year)           means that, at the end of each quarter           (three months) they'll add 3% to your           account.  (Remember that this is 3% of           what's in the account at that time.)
Do you see that, the more times        the account is compounded, the more money we make?  Sure, it's only a really small increase, but if we        invest a million dollars...  It's going to        make a big difference!
