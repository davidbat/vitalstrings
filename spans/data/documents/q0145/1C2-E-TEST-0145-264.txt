Subject:  Calculus: Compound Interest
Question:  Hello,
I am taking a beginning calculus class and I have a questions concerning determining the annual % rate of interest that an investment, compounded continuously, would earn. The questions is as follows:
An investor buys shares of a stock for $3000 and sells them 5 years later for $5000. If interest is compounded continuously, determine the annual percentage rate of interest that the original $3000 investment earned, leaving your answer in logarithmic form.
The answer that I submitted turned up incorrect and I am having a hard time figuring out the correct answer. Can you please help me?
===================================================
The basic (business-school) formula for C.I. is:
A = P(1 + r/n)^yn, where:
P is the original principAL
A is the final amount
r is the A.P.R., where 5% would be 0.05
n is the number of compounding intervals in a year.  Quarterly would be n=4
y is the number of years.
Now what if we let  n -> infinity, for continuous compounding.  We use this fact:
lim  (1 + 1/k)^k = e, the base of natural logs.
k->inf
So lets work the  (1 + r/n)^yn  part into that form:
(1 + r/n)^yn
Let  1/k = r/n, then n = kr, and
(1 + r/n)^yn =
