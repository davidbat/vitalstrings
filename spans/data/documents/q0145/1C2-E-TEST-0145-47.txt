December 18, 2003: Peter invested a certain sum of money in a simple interest bond whose value grew to $300 at the end of 3 years and to $ 400 at the end of another 5 years. What was the rate of interest in which he invested his sum? Initial amount invested = $ X Amount at the end of year 3 = $ 300 Amount at the end of year 8 (another 5 years) = $ 400 Therefore, the interest earned for the 5 year period between the 3rd year and 8th year = $400 $300 = $100 As the simple interest earned for a period of 5 years is $ 100, interest earned per year = $20. Therefore, interest earned for 3 years = 3 * 20 = $ 60. Hence, initial amount invested X = Amount after 3 years – interest for 3 years = 300 – 60 = $ 240.
Rate of interest =
=
= 8.33%
January 20, 2004: Ann invested a certain sum of money in a bank that paid simple interest. The amount grew to $240 at the end of 2 years. She waited for another 3 years and got a final amount of $300. What was the principal amount that she invested at the beginning? The sum grew to $240 at the end of 2 years. At the end of another 3 years, the sum grew to $300. i.e. in 3 years, the sum grew by $60. Therefore, each year, it grew by $20. Sum at the end of 2 years = $240 Sum grew by $20 each year. Hence, in the first 2 years, sum grew by 2 * 20 = $40. Therefore, sum at the beginning of the period = Sum at the end of 2 years - $40= $240 - $40 = $200. March 29, 2004 : Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years and received $ 550 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $605 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Explanatory Answer Shawn received an extra amount of ($605 - $550) $55 on his compound interest paying bond as the interest that he received in the first year also earned interest in the second year. The extra interest earned on the compound interest bond = $55
The interest for the first year = $
= $275
Therefore, the rate of interest =
= 20% p.a
20% interest means that Shawn received 20% of the amount he invested in the bonds as interest If 20% of his investment in one of the bonds = $275, then his total investment in each of the bonds = = 1375
As he invested equal sums in both the bonds, his total savings before investing = 2*1375 = $2750.
