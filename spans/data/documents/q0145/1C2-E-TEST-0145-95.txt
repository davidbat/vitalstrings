Compound Interest
If the interest due on savings is added to the principal at given       intervals, then the interest is said to be compounded (or converted)       into principal and thereafter also earns interest. Consequently, the       principal increases periodically and the interest compounded into the       principal increases periodically throughout the term of the transaction.
The sum due at the end of the transaction is called the compound       amount and is denoted by A.
The difference between the compound amount and the original principal       is called the compound interest and is denoted by CI.
Consider an investment of $P at the percentage r per       annum.
First year of investment
Second year of investment
We, often write the formula for the accumulation of principal at       compound interest as:
This formula is also applied in problems dealing with population       growth. If there is a decrease instead of an increase, then r is negative.
Example 22
Calculate the compound interest on $6000 if it is invested for 3 years       at 7.5% per annum.
Solution:
