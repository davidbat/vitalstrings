When you deposit money in a savings account, your       money earns interest that is calculated every month or quarter, etc.       Because this is not money you need right away, the amount accrued can be       reinvested, thus boosting your interest so the next calculation would be       based on the original amount plus the new added value. This is the basis       of compound interest.
The compound interest can be       calculated monthly or quarterly, etc based on the original amount you       deposited, the interest rate, and the period you and the institution agreed       upon.

P = Principal
m = Number of Compounding Periods per Year
n = Total Number of Compounding Periods
A = Amount Earned After n periods
