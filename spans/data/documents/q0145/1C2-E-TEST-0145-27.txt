Unless simple interest is stated one   assumes interest is compounded.
 
When compound interest is used we must   always know how often the interest rate is calculated each year. Generally   the interest rate is quoted annually. e.g. 10% per annum.
 
Compound interest may involve calculations for more than once a year, each using  a new principal (interest + principal). The first term we must understand in  dealing with compound interest is conversion period. Conversion period refers to  how often the interest is calculated over the term of the loan or investment. It  must be determined for each year or fraction of a year.
 
e.g.: If the interest rate is compounded semiannually, then the number of  conversion periods per year would be two. If the loan or deposit was for five  years, then the number of conversion periods would be ten.
