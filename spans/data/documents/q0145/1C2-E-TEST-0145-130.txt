i = Interest Rate per Period n
n = Number of Periods
Compound Interest Calculations:
The basic calculation for this calculator  finds A, the final Investment Value,  using the basic compound interest formula: A = P(1 + i)n where P is the Principal amount of money to be invested at an Interest Rate i% per period for n Number of Time Periods.
Be sure to enter the interest rate per period. For example, if the stated annual rate is 5% and you are compounding monthly then the rate per period is 5% / 12 = 0.417% per period. (the effective interest rate is 5.12%)
