Simple           Interest
      Interest = Principal x Interest rate per period x Number of periods
Compound           Interest
      Interests for previous periods are added to principal for the           calculation of interest.
      Interest for the nth period 
          = (Principal +           Interest for period 1 +  .... + Interest for period n-1) x           Interest rate per period
