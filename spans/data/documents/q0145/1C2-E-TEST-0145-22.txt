be the number of years (the "term").  The interest rate per conversion  period is then
(1)
times at an annual  rate of
(where, for example, 10% corresponds  to
), then the effective rate over
the time (what an investor would earn  if he did not redeposit his interest after each compounding) is
(2)
The total amount of holdings
after a time
when interest is re-invested is then
(3)
Note that even if interest is compounded continuously, the return is still finite since
(4)
where e is the base of the natural logarithm .
The time required for a given principal to double (assuming
conversion  period ) is given by solving
(5)
or
(6)
where ln is the natural logarithm . This function can be approximated by the so-called rule  of 72 :
