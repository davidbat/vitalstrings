Simple Compounding Interest Calculator - What will the future value of an account will be?
Simple Compounding Interest  with Monthly Deposits - What will the future value of an account be if in addition to the compound interest, I deposit a set amount of money to it each month?
Advanced Compounding Interest  Calculator - This calculator allows you to solve for any of the variables  in the compounding interest formula.  The following types of questions  will be easily answered by this calculator:   I would like to earn $1000 in interest with a CD that last 3 years and has an APY of 6.44%, how much would I need to invest to accomplish this goal?  How long will it take to have my $2500 CD with an APY of 6.04% become $3700?  What APY will I need if I want to earn $600 interest in 1 year from my $5000 initial deposit?
Special Notes:  This calculators should give you a pretty good estimate of the value of your account at the end of the specified period, however, you should think of this as an estimate.  Some of the reasons that these should be used as an estimating tool only are:
    -Calculators assume each month has an equal number of days.
    -Leap years aren't taken into account.
    -The simple compounding interest with monthly deposits calculator assumes you deposit money at the beginning of each month,
      including the first month.
