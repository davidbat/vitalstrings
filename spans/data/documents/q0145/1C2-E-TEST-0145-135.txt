Compound Interest - Every Saver's Dream
Compound Interest - Every Saver's Dream
The beauty of compound interest is that, once it starts, it doesn't stop. You can turn pennies into 100's of dollars through this natural phenomenon.
Many of us have heard of compound interest, and some of us have actually seen it in action. Do you know how it really works? This article explores the marvel of compound interest in detail. Very simply, compound interest is the interest you earn on the interest you earned previously! Still not sure? Let's review some of the principles of compound interest and look at some examples.
Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
When you deposit money into a bank account or other investment product, you expect to earn interest or generate a return on that investment. The rate of return you receive will depend on many variables. For example, the rate of return on a savings account may be stated as 4%, and a long-term certificate of deposit may offer a stated rate of return of 8%. When these rates are converted into an annual percentage yield (APY), you will find that the APY, or effective interest rate, is several basis points higher than the stated rate (a basis point is one hundredth of a percent). This is because of compound interest. Since you are earning interest on your interest, your overall yield is actually increased.
The Value of Time
The most important element of compound interest is time. The longer your investment sits, the longer the interest earns interest. Let's look at an example. Let's say you save $80 a month and you've got it invested in a money market account that earns an average of 7% annually. What is the effect of time on this investment?
