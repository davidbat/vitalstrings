Step by Step SolutionÂ 
Step 1
Since the interest is compounding, we need to calculate the interest year by year. These are the information that we have:
P is the             loan amount or principal ($2000)
r is             the compound interest rate (10%)
The loan duration is 2 years
Step 2
After the 1st year, we can find the interest I, by multiplying P with r. Here's how:
Step 3
Therefore, the interest after the 1st year is $200. With this, the amount of money that we owe after the 1st year is:
Step 4
After the 2nd year, since the interest is compounding, the interest will be 10% of $2200. Here's how we calculate for the interest:
Step 5
The interest for the end of 2nd year is $220. Clearly, the answer is C.
