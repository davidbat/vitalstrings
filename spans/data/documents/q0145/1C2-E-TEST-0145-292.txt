How to Build Interest in Savings
There are two main types of interest, compound interest and simple interest. Compound interest factors in interest earned in the total interest calculation. Therefore, compound interest totals account for the additional interest on the interest earned. Compound interest calculations will result in a greater amount of interest earned over the same period as when using simple interest. For example, a small business deposits $100 in an account for 1 1/2 years. The interest rates is 6 percent per year. Interest compounded monthly will result in $9.40 of total interest. The investor by contrast would earn $9 in simple interest.
Step 1
Divide the interest rate by the number of times the loan compounds. In the example, 6 percent divided by 12 equals 0.005.
Step 2
Add 1 to the number calculated in Step 1. In the example, 1 plus 0.005 is 1.005.
Step 3
Multiply the number of times the loan compounds by the number of years you plan to keep the deposit. In the example, 1.5 times 12 equals 18.
Step 4
Raise the number calculated in Step 2 to the power of the number calculated in Step 3. In the example, 1.005 raised to the power of 18 is 1.09392894. This is the compound interest factor.
Step 5
Multiply the compound interest factor by the deposit amount. In the example, 1.09392894 times $100 equals $109.40. The small business will make $9.40 in interest. If computing simple interest, the formula would be $100 times 1.5 years times 6 percent, which equals $9 of interest earned.
