The above example leads to a general formula for computing the effects of compound interest. Suppose
we are given an interest rate of r% per year and
we compound the interest n times per year.
Then the year is divided into n equal time periods during which we earn r/n percent interest.  If you start one of these time periods with a balance of B dollars, you will end it with a balance of
(1 + r/n)
B
dollars, so if you leave your money in the bank for one year, your balance will grow to
(1 + r/n)n
B
dollars. If you leave the same money in for y years, then the number of compounding periods is n
y, so
If you deposit B dollars for y years at an interest rate of r compounded n times per year, then your ending balance is
(1 + r/n)(y
n)
times B dollars.
Example. Suppose you deposit $1000 in a bank which pays 5% interest compounded daily, meaning 365 times per year. How much more do you earn as opposed to simple interest of 5% if you leave your money in the bank for 1 year? For 5 years?
Solution. Referring to the formula above, the interest rate r is 5% or .05 and the number of equal time periods, n, is 365.  Thus at the end of 1 year your balance is
(1 + .05/365)365
$1000
, or (using a calculator) $1051.27.  The interest you earned is $51.27.  Simple interest would have paid $50 in interest, so you earn $1.27 more.
If you leave the money in the bank for 5 years, then the formula becomes
(1 + .05/365)5
365
$1000
, which works out to be $1284. This means you received $284 in interest. Simple interest would have paid .05
5
$1000 = $250 in interest, so your gain is $34.
Try it yourself!
The following is the same as the table from the page on simple interest, except we have added a column for compounding.  The number you select in this column determines how many times per year the interest is compounded.
You will be best off using your own calculator for this, but we have supplied a clumsy one which you can use as an aid.  To use it, type numbers into the first two slots, select an operation (addition (+), multiplication (X), division (/), or raising to a power (^)) and click on the "equals" button.  You can cut and paste results into the first two slots as needed.
