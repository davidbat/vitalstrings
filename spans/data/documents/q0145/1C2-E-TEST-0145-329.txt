Given values go here.
Note: Format the PV and FV cells as currency, the r cells as percentage, and the t and m cells as "general".
2. Now fill in the remaining three formulas in the "Calculated" column.
Let us now use the calculator to do Example 3 from the text:
3. Example You have $5000 to invest at 6% compounded monthly.
How long will it take for your investment to grow to $6000?
Solution
We are given PV = $5000, FV = $6000, r = 6%, and m = 12.
Enter these values in the "Entered" Column and read off the number of years from the "Calculated" column.
That is the answer!
4. Look at Example 2 from the text:
The Megabucks Corporation is issuing 10-year zero-coupon bonds.
How much would you pay for bonds with a maturity value of $10,000 if you wish to get a return of
6.5% compounded annually.
Solution
The maturity value is the future value, so FV = $10,000. So we enter t = 10, r = 6.5%, and m = 1
in the "Entered" column, and read off the present value (PV).
Now go to the "Excel Formulas" sheet to see how to set up a "time value of money" calculator using Excel formulas.
