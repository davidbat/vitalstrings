Continuously Compounded Interest
Interest that               is, hypothetically, computed and added               to the balance of an account every instant.               This is not actually possible, but continuous compounding is well-defined               nevertheless as the upper bound of "regular" compound               interest . The formula , given below, is sometimes called the shampoo             formula ( Pert® ).
Note: This same formula can be                 used for exponential growth and exponential                 decay .
