That's certainly depressing. After four monthly payments of $805, you've paid $3,220 total, but you've only paid down your loan by $222.65!
The only good part of this is that as time goes on, more and more of your payment goes to principal and less and less goes to interest. But most of your payment will still go to interest for a very long time. Here's what it looks like in graphical form, with a lower interest rate than the example above.
Percent of monthly payment that goes to interest, by year
30-year loan @ 7%
Notice that in year 15 when you're halfway through the term, 75% of each payment is just going to make the bank richer, and only one-fourth is actually paying down your balance and building equity. Ouch! You have to get all the way to year 22 before more of your payment goes towards principal than towards interest.
Here's the same concept, looked at from the other end.
Equity built by year
30-year loan @ 7%
After 15 years you don't own half your home. You own only about 25% of it. You don't own half of it until about year 22.
Is there any way to get a better deal? Yes, there are two ways. Getting a 15-year loan, or making prepayments. So, moving on....

15-year loans save a bunch of interest
One way to save on interest is to get a mortgage with a 15-year term instead of a 30-year term. Here's how the loan we first looked at above would work at 15 years.
