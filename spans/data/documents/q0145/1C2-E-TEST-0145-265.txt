Compound Interest Calculator
A  Compound Interest Calculator For Savers
The compound interest calculator is intended to show you how how much you'll  have saved after a given number of years.  You'll know how much of your final  balance is due to interest earnings, and you can use the compound interest  calculator to see how different interest  rates affect the outcome.
Instructions for using the compound interest calculator:
Put your original deposit amount into the box for "Principal"
Enter your APY in the "Rate" box
Finally, enter a time period into the "Years" box
Note that the compound interest calculator allows you to enter your time period  in months or years.  If you'd like to use months, use the table at the  right of the compound interest calculator.  For example, if you want to  calculate based on 7 months, enter ".58" in the "Years" box.
The compound interest calculator  shows how much a single deposit will be  worth in the future.  You can use it to compare accounts and determine  whether it is worth your efforts to switch for a better rate.
