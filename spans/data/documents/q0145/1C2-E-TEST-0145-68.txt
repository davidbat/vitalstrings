The Wealthy Person in You
How important is it to begin putting aside money for savings right now, as opposed to sometime later?
The following chart illustrates the effect of compound interest on savings over the course of 40-plus years. It shows that now is the time for saving.
The sooner you start to save, the greater the benefit of compound interest. Compound interest is the interest earned on reinvested interest, in addition to the original amount invested.
Here's an example: Two different individuals--Darryl and Cheryl, each 22 years old--have an extra $2,000 a year to invest or spend as they choose. Darryl opens an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to start saving. Cheryl chooses to spend her $2,000.
In this example, Darryl's IRA earns 12% per year. Darryl saves $2,000 per year for six years, then never puts another cent into his IRA.
Cheryl spends her $2,000 per year for six years. After that time, she invests $2,000 per year until she is 65 years old. Cheryl earns the same 12% interest per year that Darryl does.
The chart below shows the value of Darryl's and Cheryl's respective IRAs, from the time they are 22 years old all the way to 65. Keep in mind, Darryl's total investment is $12,000 ($2,000 per year for the first six years), while Cheryl's is $74,000 ($2,000 per year for the last 37 years).
