Compound Interest
Definition of Compound Interest
Compound Interest is the interest paid on both the principal and the interest you earned so far on       that principal.
Example of  Compound Interest
Suppose you invested $500 for       4 years in a bank and the bank pays 2% compound interest annually.
By the end of the first year, your  account balance would be
$500 + 2% of $500 = $500 + $10 =  $510.
For the second year, this $510 will be considered as the  principal and the interest will be worked out for this amount.
That means, the interest for the second year will be  calculated on the principal $500 and the interest $15.
The same process will continue for  4 years.
