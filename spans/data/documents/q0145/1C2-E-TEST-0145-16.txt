QUOTES
If you want to know how much an investment will grow over a set period of time, check out our compound interest calculator. It will ask you for the dollar amount of your investment, how long you plan to hold it, and an estimated return. We recommend using 7% for a conservative estimate. The calculator will tell you how much you'll have at the end of the time period.
