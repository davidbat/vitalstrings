The Rule of 72
Have you always wanted to be able to do compound interest problems in          your head? Well, let's be honest - probably not.
However, it's a very useful skill to          have because it gives you a lightning fast benchmark to determine how          good (or not so good) a potential mortgage note (or any investment) is          likely to be. And it's surprisingly easy to do in your head... once you          know how.
The rule says, that to find the number          of years required to double your money at a given interest rate, you simply          divide the interest rate into 72. That's why it's called the "Rule          of 72"!
For example, if you want to know how          long it will take to double your money at 8% interest, you would simply          divide 8 into 72 and you'll get 9 years. This is assuming the interest          is compounded annually.
As you can see, the "rule" is remarkably          accurate, as long as the interest rate is less than about 20%. At higher          interest rates the error starts to become significant.
Of course, you can also run it backwards.          For example if you want to double your money in 6 years, just divide 6          into 72 to find that it will require an interest rate of about 12%.
Quite easy! You don't need to be a "math-whiz"          to do it. Now, let's continue this fascination subject with some fun exercises.
Famous Compounding          History
The history of compounding computation goes          back thousands of years, at least to the Babylonians.
However, the most famous compounding          exercise of the all has to be the sale of the Island of Manhattan in NY          in 1626.
It was May 24, 1626 when Peter Minuit,          a director of the Dutch West India Trading Company, bartered sixty guilders          (about $24) worth of beads and trinkets to local Lenape Indians in exchange          for the island of Manhattan. There is some doubt that actual beads were          involved in the transaction, but that's another story.
It's too bad, but no deed or official          document of the island's sale to the Dutch from the Lenape Indians exists          today.
Now, an interesting investment question          arises...
Was this a good deal for Minuit          or not?
Let's look at the deal. What would be          the value of $24 if Minuit had invested it instead at 8% interest, compounded          annually for 374 years? (1626-2000)?
At first sight, this seems like the deal          of the century. Given today's real estate values in New York, this appears          to be a great deal for Minuit. But not so fast... remember, you always          have to do the numbers!
Also, keep in mind that Minuit bought          undeveloped land... not buildable lots with sewer, water, streets          etc.
Now, if you run the numbers, you'll discover          that the original $24 would have grown to a staggering...
$76 Trillion!
Yes, you read it right, not million, not billion, but trillion.
This is actually more that the estimated          value in today's dollars of all the real estate on this 31 square          mile island.
So which would have been the better investment?
The Magic of Compound          Interest
Let's continue for some more fun. Imagine          that back in 1930 your grandparents scrimped and saved and placed $100          in a trust fund where the money would accumulate for their grandchild          (you).
And imagine that the $100 remained in          this fund for some 70 years, until the year 2000, earning the average          rate of 12%. How much money would you think you would have today from          that initial $100 investment?
The answer, incredible as it may sound,          is...
$278,780!
Remember, we're only talking          about a single $100 investment, not $100 added per month          or per year!
Of course it might have been hard to          get 12% year-after-year, some years would have been a lot less. But then          again, remember the early 1980's, when it was not uncommon to get 15-18%          interest on your money.
Just imagine if your grandparents and          your parents had also added just small amounts of money every year to          your fund, how much money you would now have!

Here's How Compounding          Works
Compound interest pays interest not          only on the principal, but on the interest as well, increasing          the rate at which your money grows.
For example if the interest was compounded          yearly and you started with a $100 investment at a 10% interest rate,          you'd have earned $10 interest the first year, and would now have $110          at the end of the first year.
In the second year, you would earn interest          on $110, giving you $11 in interest in the second year, so at the end          of the second year you would now have $121, and so on. So after 20 years          you'd end up with $672.75!
Add Payments for Even          Greater Growth
Now, if you'd added additional money to          your savings every year your money would of course grow even faster.
For example, if you save $2,000 a year          at 10% interest, you'll have more than $35,000 after 10 years.
Not bad, but... if you keep at it another          10 years, (double the initial period) you'll have far more than $70,000,          (double the $35,000).
In fact you'll have $126,000!
Go for another 10 years and you'll accumulate          about $362,000. Another 10 - that would be 40 years or a typical "working''          lifetime - and you'll be... are you ready for this...
Almost a Millionaire - with $973,703.62!
Generally, any series of regular or steady          payments is called an annuity .

Now, you might wonder what does all this          have to do with mortgage notes?
Well, you have to wait until next time,          when I'll show you how you can actually lower the interest          rate on a note or a loan and still come out ahead...
Way Ahead!
