The wonder of compound interest
"The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest."
Albert Einstein
So what is compound interest?
It's  really just when you earn interest on your interest, but over time this  can make a huge difference to the value of your investment.
For  example, when an investment return is first calculated, interest is  paid on the original investment amount. The second time, interest is  paid on both the original investment and the previously earned  interest. So each time you earn a dividend, distribution or income  payment from your investment you just reinvest it by buying more units  or shares. Your original investment plus the additional investments  then have the potential to earn more distributions. You then reinvest  these earnings and so on.
The alternative to compound  interest would be 'simple interest' where interest is calculated just  on the original investment amount. This would happen where the  investment income payments aren't reinvested. For example, if they were  paid into your bank account and used for day to day expenses.
Example - Compound interest vs Simple interest
These  figures compare the difference in value between compound and simple  interest over 20 years on an initial investment of $10,000 and an  annual return of 8% after fees.
