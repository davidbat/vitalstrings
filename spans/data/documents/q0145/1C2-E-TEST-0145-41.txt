Choosing when interest is paid
Our compound interest calculators give you two options for calculating interest. With some savings accounts, interest can be calculated and paid in at the beginning of the following month    or year. However, to give you an idea of the amount you will have earned from your money in that set period, you may wish to leave it calculating and adding interest at the end of    the same month or year (end of month/year option). This appears to be the most common method of calculation with other online compound interest calculators.
What is compound interest?
Compound interest is the concept of adding accumulated interest back to the principal sum, so that interest is earned on interest from that moment on. The act of    declaring interest to be principal is called compounding. As an example, a loan may have its interest compounded every month: in this example,    a loan with $100 principal and 1% interest per month would have a balance of $101 at the end of the first month.
Daily compounding, monthly compounding, yearly compounding
The compound interest calculator allows you to compound the interest on either a daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis.
