Board a WWII-style amphibious landing vehicle, and get ready for a thrilling ride that's sure to make a splash with the little ones. Children of all ages will love learning about Beantown from a knowledgeable "ConDUCKtor." The tour covers historical sites of the city and then plunges into the Charles River for a unique view of Boston. Kids will especially enjoy quacking at passersby and may even get the chance to drive the DUCK.
