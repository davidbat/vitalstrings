about Boston Duck Tours:
Has everyone gone completely "quackers"? If they're on a Boston Duck Tour they probably have. The tour, unlike any other, takes riders on a wild 80-minute land and sea excursion around Boston. What's unique about the tour is how you'll be traveling; you'll ride in style in an authentic, renovated WWII amphibious landing vehicle. Kids will be entertained by drivers with names like Quack Cousteau and Quack a Dile Dundee, who encourage all aboard to quack their hearts out along the way.
The land part of the tour takes you by some of what you're supposed to see when you're in Boston - the State House , the
Boston Common, the Old North Church , the always fashionable Newbury Street, and lots more.
The ride gets really wild when you hit the water! Riders are treated to a waterside view of Boston via the Charles River. Skeptics will wonder how these huge trucks don't hit bottom. All we know is that you won't find another tour like this anywhere else. So what are you waiting for?
Boston Duck Tours has two convenient departure points: the Museum of Science and the Prudential Center (Huntington Avenue in front of Shaw's Supermarket).
