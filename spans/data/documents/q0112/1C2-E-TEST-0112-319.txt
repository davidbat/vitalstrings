Walking along Boston's historic Freedom         Trail and part of Boston's original coastline,         children will be able to see the historical sites that played         major roles in American independence such as Faneuil         Hall, the Old State House, and         the Old South Meeting House. Learning about         the Boston Massacre on the site on which it         happened brings a new dimension to learning American         history.

Stops also include the site of the first public school in         America and the oldest burial ground in Boston. This tour covers         ten sites in downtown Boston but is  shorter and faster-paced          than our Heart         of the Freedom Trail tour .
In addition to the historical sites, there are at                      least 8 animals, 3 kites, 3 brick patterns, a large                      steaming kettle, a girl jumping rope, and a couple of                      fights between skeletons and Father Time to be                      found along this tour.
