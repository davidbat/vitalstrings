Multi-terrain touring vehicles
Water is no barrier for a duck, why should it be for you? A Boston Duck Tour is a wonderful way to get a great look at Boston on land and water. See all the major landmarks and hear the history of the city as you tour Boston in a renovated World War II amphibious vehicle.
You've never toured Boston in anything that comes close to Boston Duck Tour! The fun begins as soon as you board your "DUCK", an authentic, renovated World War II amphibious landing vehicle. First, you'll be greeted by one of their legendary tour ConDUCKtors, who'll be narrating your tour. Then you're off on a journey like you've never had before.
You'll cruise by all the places that make Boston the birthplace of freedom and a city of firsts, from the golden-domed State House to Bunker Hill and the Fleet Center, Boston Common and Copley Square to the Big Dig, Government Center to fashionable Newbury Street, Quincy Market to the Prudential Tower, and more. And, as the best of Boston unfolds before your eyes, your ConDUCKtor will be giving you lots of little known facts and interesting insights about our unique and wonderful city.
And just when you think you've seen it all, there's more. It's time for "Splashdown" as your ConDUCKtor splashes your DUCK right into the Charles River for a breathtaking view of the Boston and Cambridge skylines, the kind of view you just won't get anywhere else.
So take the ride of your life. Hop on a Boston Duck Tour!
