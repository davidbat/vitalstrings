Boston Duck - John Oyston
Boston is famous for its role in the American Resolution. Boston Duck Tours provide an unusual way to see many popular attractions.
Boston Duck Tours offer visitors a novel way to see the city. Amphibious World War II landing craft tour the historic sites, with well informed con”duck”tors providing an entertaining commentary throughout the eighty minute trip. The trip is mainly on roads, but for about twenty minutes the boat takes to the water offering spectacular views of the city skyline from the Charles River. While afloat, the young, and young at heart, are offered the opportunity to take the controls.
The trip starts at the Prudential Center, which along with the adjacent Copley Square form Boston’s largest shopping center. The Prudential Tower is Boston’s second largest building with an observation floor.
The Duck Tour passes Christian Science Center, Trinity Church and the John Hancock Tower before entering Boston Public Gardens. The gardens, which are the oldest public botanical gardens in the country, are home to Swan Boats on the lake and the Make Way for Ducklings Statues by Nancy Schon.
Continuing up Beacon Hill, the tour passes the monument to Civil War hero Robert Gould Shaw and the State House where Samuel Adams and Paul Revere laid the cornerstone in 1795.
Sports fans then see the TD Banknorth Garden, home of Boston Celtic and Boston Bruins and pass the Museum of Science, which is an alternative starting point for this circular trip.
The bus then turns in to a boat, sailing up the Charles River before returning to dry land. The Bunker Hill Monument and the USS Constitution are the next landmarks passed, followed by the Old North Church where two lanterns were hung from the steeple on the night of Paul Revere’s ride.
