A Culinary Adventure Awaits You…
Close your eyes and imagine strolling down quaint and narrow streets while enjoying colorful sights, tantalizing aromas, and chaotic sounds as you get an ‘insider’s view’ of these ethnic communities, alive with colorful immigrant history and undiscovered “hidden gems”.
The secret of a cuisine is the high quality of ingredients, a sense of regional tradition and an understanding of the culture. For an outsider, finding the finest is not always easy. Join us on a culinary walking tour of Boston’s “Little Italy” (North End) and Chinatown and let us be your passport to unlocking the secrets of the world’s healthiest cuisines.
“It’s like visiting another country – passport not required!”
