Still one of my most favorite vacations EVER!!!  My favorite was renting a car for one day, driving to Maine for the beach, and driving on up and eating at the Lobster Shack at Two Lights right over looking the ocean.  AHhhhhhhh I want to to back sooo bad.  My kids fav was probably the Duck Tour!
This looks worth looking into! Thanks! http://www.goboston.com/
