So what else did we do on our trip to Boston ?  Well, I told you about the big CITGO sign , going to Cheers and walking up Bunker Hill Monument , but we did have time to do a few more things in our two day trip.
We jumped on Frog Pond Lily, to check out the Duck Boat Tours. The tour guides are interesting in a weird way.  The guy we had, wore a rubber ducky around his waist, and had elmo arm floaters.  There were others who were dressed a lot weirder, but they were all enjoyable to listen to.  And yea, they made us quake.
Speaking of ducks, we stayed right by Boston Commons and here is a duck from the park:
We also ventured to the USS Constitution, which was closed on Monday, but we were able to go into the museum there and play with the canons:
I don't have pictures of the science museum , but we did go there.  We saw an IMAX showing of Sea Monsters , I love IMAX. :)
I think is all or most of what we did in Boston.  We do actually plan on coming back for these short, two day (Sunday/Monday) vacations.  We would like to do some whale watching (I hear they are interesting to look at) and check out Sam Adams (we go way back) and a few more things we did not have time to do this trip.
