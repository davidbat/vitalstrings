Sightseeing on a Boston Duck Tour…Quack!
Posted on May 29, 2008 by buytours
Everybody has heard them quacking as they pass…it’s the Boston Duck Tour .  With great weather here to stay, there is no time like the present to get our and enjoy sightseeing in Boston, Massachusetts.
This tour provides a truly unique experience in Boston.  Not only will you cruise by all the places that make Boston famous, but you will also see the golden-domed State House , Bunker Hill , TD Banknorth Garden , Boston Common , Copley Square , Government Center , fashionable Newbury Street , Quincy Market , the Prudential Tower , and more.
We recently took this tour while visiting Boston and had a really nice time.  My 9-year-old daughter especially enjoyed when we splashed into the water.  We booked our tickets online and printed an e-ticket before we left.  It was very simple and we did not have to wait in line because we planned in advance.  We also took a dinner cruise that we booked through the same site and the food was exceptional.  We will be heading back to Boston in the near future.
