Gloucester's only narrated land & sea tour!
It's a 20 minute land tour, an exciting "splash" into
the water and 35 minute harbor tour.
"MOBY DUCK" is the only amphibious            sightseeing tour in the country, that takes you over a beach and right            into the ocean! It's a Whale of a Ride!
A fifty-five minute LAND AND SEA tour, with your personal            licensed Captain at the helm and narration by your "Duck Mate".            Your trip will provide spectacular panoramic views of beaches, islands,            lighthouses, famous shipyards and historical locations. You will view            the "Crow's Nest" so predominantly featured in the best selling            book and movie, "The Perfect Storm". The land portion precedes            an exciting "SPLASH" into the water. The water portion provides            a calm and relaxing inner harbor sight seeing tour. You will come along            side Gloucester's historic fishing fleet, the schooner
Adventure
and the famous "Man at the Wheel" statue. The tour is completely            narrated with the historical and cultural aspects that Gloucester is known for.

MOBY DUCKs ARE NOT THE OLD WORLD WAR II - DUKWs."
Our "MOBY DUCKs" are the newest, safest, integrally
designed U.S.C.G. certified amphibians in the country.
Again in 2004, "Moby Duck" will be the best value in            amphibious tours, in New England. Our prices are lower than any other            amphibious tour. We spend more time on the water and less time in traffic.

MOBY DUCK AMPHIBIOUS SIGHTSEEING
WILL NOT BE OFFERING TOURS IN 2005
The ongoing expense of our court battle            with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has precipitated this suspension            of service. For the past four years the Public Access Board in Massachusetts            has denied us PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE WATER in Salem, Massachusetts.
We won the first lawsuit in 2003 and expect            to prevail again in the current one. We expect to resume tours when            PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE WATER is restored.
