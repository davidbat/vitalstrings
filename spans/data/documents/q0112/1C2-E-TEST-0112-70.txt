The Boston Duck Tour is one of Boston's most unique and entertaining tours. During this 80-minute ride, you will hear many insights and fun anecdotes regarding the history of Boston, while passing by major points of the city, such as the Boston Common, Copley Square, Faneuil Hall, and more. 
What makes the Duck Tour so original and popular among tourists and locals, is the Ducks themselves. These are original World War II amphibious landing vehicles, which were originally built to unload cargo on beaches and played a key role during the invasion of Normandy, France, also known as D-day.
Thanks to these vehicles, half of the tour takes place on land while the other half is afloat the Charles River. During the latter, you not only have the great opportunity to capture one of the best views of the Back Bay, but you are also encouraged by the ConDUCKtor to drive the Duck!
These tours run seven days a week and leave from three sites: Prudential Center, Museum of Science, and New England Aquarium. Departure times and availability can be found on bostonducktours.com where tickets can be purchased. Also, graduation and party discounts are available. Checking availability ahead of time is strongly recommended since the tours sell out.
