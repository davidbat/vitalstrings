Boston Duck Tours is different from any other tour in Boston, or any place for that matter, in my opinion, because we go into the water.  We're going to go into the Charles River.  We're going to get a view of Boston unsurpassed.  These are World War II amphibious landing craft.  We do an hour and 20 minute tour around Boston.  Sometime it can be a little drive, we talk a lot about history for the kids but when they get up and drive, it's a great experience for them.
Are we floating?  Can I open my eyes?
Anybody willing to come up and take the wheel?  Ok, there you go, he's got it now.  Turn around and smile.
It was a lot of fun, it was very interesting.  It talks an awful lot about what Boston is and the tour guide was extremely knowledgeable.
