Sights of Game 7
BOSTON (CBS) – The Stanley Cup win means a celebratory victory lap around the Garden for Boston Duck Tour Conductor “Plucky Ruffles.”
He wears ruffles of light blue but the die-hard Bruins fan’s heart is black and gold and he can’t wait to have the champs on board.
“Driving through the tunnel I started crying thinking about having Cam Neely on board. Imagine, grown man in ruffles crying and people are going quack, quack,” said Plucky.

The Red Sox, Celtics and Patriots have all been on board ducks for their rolling rallies, and now it’s the Bruins turn. Players like Tim Thomas will fill the seat and Plucky is ready to be the B’s guide. He has his outfit planned and he’s getting signs and streamers ready to put all over his duck.
WBZ-TV’s Kathy Curran reports.
“We’re gonna have 18-20 ducks in the parade.. start at the Garden, come to copley square and snake their way through the city,” said Bob Schwartz, Marketing Director for Boston Duck Tours.
They’ll snake their way through a city that’s been thirsty for the cup. We’ve been to this party before but not with the B’s on board.

“It’s thrilling, absolutely thrilling. It’s a good time, a huge party.” She says she may just sit in her duck boat seat for two days to wait and see who shows up,” said Somerville Resident Tori Richmond.
Boston Duck Tours had to cancel about 2,000 pre-scheduled reservations so they could use their ducks for the rolling rally. The tours will resume at 3 p.m. on Saturday.
