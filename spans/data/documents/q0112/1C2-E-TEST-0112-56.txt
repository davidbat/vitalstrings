Ticket Information:
Tickets are sold inside the Prudential Center from 8:30 AM - 8 PM (except Sunday 8:30 AM - 6 PM).  Some tickets may be purchased up to five days in advance at ticket booths located in the Prudential Center, the Museum of Science, Faneuil Hall and/or over the internet via our website. Please note, if you purchase tickets over the internet, it is not necessary to go to the ticket booth. Go directly to the boarding area.  Tickets may not be purchased at the Duck boarding area.
If the advanced tickets on the internet are sold out, then the advanced tickets at the ticket booths are also sold out. We do not sell individual tickets over the phone, only for groups of 20 or more. The summer is our peak season, so if you are planning to come during this time, be sure to get here early. They often sell out by noon.
