"Fun with the Family"
This eighty-minute land-and-sea tour is offered on a “duck,” an amphibious World War II craft that travels both on land and in the Charles River. The rain-or-shine tour is lots of fun, and you will get many friendly stares as you wind your way through the streets of Boston (possibly because the driver will have you quacking!).
Once on the Charles River, the driver/narrator will ask for volunteers to pilot the duck. Both my daughter and her boarding-school roommate from Thailand found this to be the best part of the tour. This tour also is the one that seems to be the biggest hit with kids.
NOTE: A limited number of tickets are released five days prior but sell out by noon, purchased at the ticket counter or online (www.bostonducktours.com); there are no exchanges or refunds.
