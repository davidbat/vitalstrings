Originally owned by William Blackstone, who came to Boston in 1622, this Boston historic area is America's oldest public park. Situated on 44 acres of open land, it was used as a common pasture for grazing cattle owned by the townspeople of Boston. This Boston historic site later became a training field for the militia and was used as a British Army camp during the occupation of Boston. Over many generations, the Common has been the site of hangings, duels, public celebrations and spirited oratory. Now it hosts squirrels, pigeons, and plenty of neighborhood dogs from the fashionable addresses of Beacon Hill.
