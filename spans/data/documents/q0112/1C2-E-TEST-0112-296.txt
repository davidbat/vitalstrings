What do you get when you combine a cursed privateer, a pyromaniac circus ringleader, a demon spat out of the pits of Hades, a homicidal opera diva, and a deranged nanny? An experience unlike anything else in Boston!

There are so many of us that each time you take our tour, you’ll have a startling new experience. So join us again and again! You will never know with whom you will be trapped.

Walk atop Boston’s largest unmarked burying ground and hear tales of the tortures, punishments and executions that took place there.
