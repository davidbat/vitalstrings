Boston Duck Tours. It's not just a tour. It's an 80 minute  adventure!  You've never toured Boston in anything that comes close to  Boston Duck Tours. The fun begins as soon as you board your  "DUCK", an authentic, renovated World War II amphibious  landing vehicle, at the Prudential Center in Boston's  historic Back Bay. First, you'll be greeted by one of our  legendary tour conDUCKtors, who'll be narrating your tour.
