Make the Most of Your Trip: Boston Duck Tours
For those attendees who have never been to Boston before, taking a duck boat tour is a great way to see the city. Even if you have been to the city, duck tours are a new and unique way to see the sites and learn a few interesting things. Whether you enjoy the novelty of riding in a WWII-era landing craft that can travel on both land and water, or you’re just too lazy to walk the freedom trail, Boston Duck Tours are perfect for the family. Knowledgeable tour guides drive you around downtown and then navigate Boston’s waterways while talking about the landmarks and the history that make our city famous.
 
You can pick up tickets at the Prudential Center, Museum of Science, Faneuil Hall, or online. For Tickets and information, check out www.bostonducktours.com !
