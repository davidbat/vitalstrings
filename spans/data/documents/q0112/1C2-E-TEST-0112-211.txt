The 80-minute Boston Duck Tours take you by land and by sea. A strange-looking amphibious creature on the highway, the Duck is a re-conditioned World War II vehicle that takes you through Boston's historic Back Bay, onto elegant Newbury Street, the State House, the Boston Common, and more. Suddenly, your Duck spreads its wings and splashes into the Charles River for more fun. The tour encourages visitors to 'quack' at the locals.
