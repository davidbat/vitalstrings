The best tour to take in Boston is the "Duck Tour".  You ride in these military vehicles called Duck Boats.  They are actually trucks in the shape of boats that were used in WWII. They can go on land and float in the water.  This way the tour can allow you to see Boston by land and sea!  Each duck boat driver is dressed and plays a character that is reletive to Boston's History.
