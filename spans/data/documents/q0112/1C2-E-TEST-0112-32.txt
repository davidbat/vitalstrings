Duck Boat Tours in Boston
Two Duck Boat tour companies are among Boston's fleet of aquatic tours.
The city of Boston is between the Boston Harbor and Charles River. Getting out onto either body of water is a great way to observe and learn more about the city. Boston's two "Duck Boat" tour companies conduct tours with World War II-era amphibious vehicles that tour the city streets and plunge into the river and harbor for further exploration. A Boston walking tour also celebrates the city's connection with the famous children's book "Make Way For Ducklings."
