Boston Duck Tours
Today’s guest post comes from Mary Jo Manzanares, b5media’s Travel & Culture Channel Editor and travel blogger at Flyaway Cafe .
Boston Duck Tours are a fun, family-friendly way to see the city the Paul Revere way: by both land and water.
You board a renovated WWII amphibious craft decked out with a fun name and your own ConDUCKtor who doubles as driver and tour guide. After sightseeing in downtown Boston, you plop off a ramp into the Charles River to enjoy the Beantown and Cambridge skylines from the water. At this point, children are allowed to take the wheel and “pilot” the craft with the ConDUCKtor by their side, treats at the ready.
The entire tour takes about 90 minutes. The DUCK tour covers many of the historical locations of Boston (one sees how compact it really is), and leaves from both the Prudential Center (shopper friendly), and the Museum of Science (kid friendly). The parking at the Museum of Science is reasonable and solves the problem of where to leave your car downtown.
During the summer months, a steady flow of DUCK boats make their way through the city streets and waters, the drivers supply cheers for the DUCKS to holler out as they pass each other. The DUCK boats have caught on in a big way; plans are afoot to bring them to Manhattan.
