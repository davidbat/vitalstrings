 
For over 130 years, the Swan Boats have been a part of the Boston  experience.  As a welcome sign of Spring, they grace the waters of the  Boston Public Garden ,  the first botanical garden in the United States.  Famed in the stories  Make Way for Ducklings and The Trumpet of the Swan, the Swan Boats are  the only boats of their kind in the world.
To the delight of  the young and old for over 130 years, the Swan Boat tradition has been  preserved by the Paget Family to provide our residents and visitors with  a unique Boston memory to endure for generations.
