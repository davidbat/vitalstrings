About Duck Tours
Duck tours are named after the vehicle that they use: the DUKW, which was developed in WWII as a means to transport cargo from ship to shore. The land/water crafts drive on the roads like typical automobiles, but then can splash down from a ramp directly into water and then operate as a boat. [7]
