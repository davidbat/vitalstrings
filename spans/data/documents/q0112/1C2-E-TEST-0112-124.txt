Boston Duck Tour Photo Gallery
Boston Duck Tours are a fun way to see this historic city.
The two dozen World War II-era amphibious vehicles in the Boston Duck Tours flock all have clever names, like Faneuil Holly and Red Sox Nathan. Our butterscotch-colored Duck, Symphony Hal, was christened by Boston Pops maestro Keith Lockhart.
