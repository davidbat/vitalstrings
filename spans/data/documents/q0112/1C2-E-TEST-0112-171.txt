Duck tours
Boston's most famous tours, these by-land-and-by-sea trips around the city take place in brightly colored "Ducks," amphibious vehicles left over from WWII. If you see a Duck tour going by, quack loudly at them. They usually quack back. [ Duck tours Web site ]

Trolley tours
Various trolley tours pack most of the well-known Boston historical sites into a whirl-wind 100-minute tour, with stops at all the  major attractions. They can be a nice way to get a feel for the city.

Boston Harbor Cruises
Boston is a port city, and much of its history is tied to the sea. A cruise in the harbor offers a totally different and laid-back perspective of the city.
