Franklin Park Zoo, founded in 1913, is the 72-acre site nestled in Boston’s historic Franklin Park, long considered the “crown jewel” of Frederick Law Olmsted’s Emerald Necklace Park System. Highlights of Franklin Park Zoo’s collection include the African lions of the Kalahari Kingdom, Masai giraffe and Grevy’s zebra of the Giraffe Savannah, and western lowland gorillas of the Tropical Forest.
The Franklin Park Zoo, located in Boston, Massachusetts, is one of the oldest zoos in the U.S. It is operated by Zoo New England, which also operates the Stone Zoo in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The 72-acre zoo is located in the northeast portion of Franklin Park, Boston's largest park and the last component of the city's Emerald Necklace.
