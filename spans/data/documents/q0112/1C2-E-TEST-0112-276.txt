From Union Station we will waddle down to the mall where you’ll see the awe inspiring monuments and fabulous Smithsonian Museums. Then at the Potomac River you’ll splash down for a whole different look at the nation’s capital. From the land to the water, it’s ALL IN THE SAME VEHICLE!
Our "wise quacking" captains                                                       will entertain you with anecdotes, well researched                                                       historical facts and the corniest jokes you've                                                       ever heard!
