The Infamous Boston Duck Tour
by Amber on August 17, 2011
If you’re like any other Bostonian, you’ll come to find the Duck Tours a classic annoyance. They run slow, subsequently clogging streets. Awkward tourists always wave to you. You feel even more awkward not waving back. Honestly, the only thing I DO like about them is that I get to feel a little more entitled. I think to myself: “This is MY CITY. Get out of here, I’ve breathed Boston city exhaust for years, practically LIVED the history…don’t quack at me…”
Except I haven’t. And despite my years of U.S. History, I barely remember the facts. Which is what led me to vow to take a tour before the summer ends…You can’t complain about something until you’ve actually done it, right?
FYI: The Duck Boat fronts both land and water. Admittedly, I never made this connection until a couple weeks ago...
I know it’s weird to suggest something to put on a “Boston Bucket List” before actually having done it myself, but I’m going to do it anyway. Put this on your bucket list, kids. Buy yo tickets here .
