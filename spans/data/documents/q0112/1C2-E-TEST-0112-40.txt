Amphibious vehicle tours
Boston Duck Tours is a truly unique method of seeing the city. In a DUCK, or WWII type amphibious landing vehicle, you’ll jaunt through the city and then splash down into the Charles River where you can cruise along and get some great photos of the skyline.
The Boston Duck Tours are great fun for the whole family, all ages are welcome. You’ll see the Quincy Market, Boston Common, Copley Square and the Prudential Tower, just to name a few of the more popular sites around Boston. It’s definitely a great way to get out and about in the city.
