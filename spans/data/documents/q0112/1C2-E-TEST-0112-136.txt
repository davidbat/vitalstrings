Experience Boston from both land and water by traveling in an amphibious World War II-style landing vehicle called a "Duck." With a friendly and informative conDUCKtor behind the wheel, you'll cruise by all the places that make Boston the birthplace of freedom and a city of firsts, from the golden-domed State House to Bunker Hill and the TD Banknorth Garden arena, from Boston Common and Copley Square to the Big Dig, from Government Center to fashionable Newbury Street, from Quincy Market to the Prudential Tower, and much more. As the best of Boston passes before your eyes, you'll hear lots of little-known facts and interesting insights about this unique and wonderful city. Then, your conDUCKtor will drive the vehicle right into the Charles River for breathtaking views of the Boston and Cambridge skylines.
