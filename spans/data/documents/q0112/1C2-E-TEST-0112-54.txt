About Boston Duck Tours
You've never toured Boston in anything that comes close to Boston Duck  Tours. The fun begins as soon as you board your "DUCK", an authentic,  renovated World War II amphibious landing vehicle. First, you'll be greeted by one of our legendary tour ConDUCKtors, who'll be narrating your tour. Then you're off on a journey like you've never had before.  You'll cruise by all the places that make Boston the birthplace of  freedom and a city of firsts, from the golden-domed State House to Bunker Hill and the Fleet Center, Boston Common and Copley Square to the  Big Dig, Government Center to fashionable Newbury Street, Quincy Market  to the Prudential Tower, and more. And, as the best of Boston unfolds  before your eyes, your ConDUCKtor will be giving you lots of little  known facts and interesting insights about our unique and wonderful  city.
And just when you think you've seen it all, there's more. It's time for  "Splashdown" as your ConDUCKtor splashes your DUCK right into the  Charles River for a breathtaking view of the Boston and Cambridge  skylines, the kind of view you just won't get anywhere else.
