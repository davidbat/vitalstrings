boston travel
Boston Duck Tours are an unforgettable way to experience the city's history with a generous side dish of humor. Board a World War II-era amphibious craft for an all-ages Boston adventure on land and water. My Boston Duck Tour Photo Gallery will provide you with a preview of the Duck Tour experience. Come along as our ConDUCKtor points out famous Boston sights, plunges us into the Charles River and even lets my daughter take the wheel.
