A Duck’s Eye View of Boston ™
What better way to                    view Boston than through the eyes of Boston’s beloved duck.                    Duck’s are easily spotted thought-out this picturesque city.                    They can be found swimming on the Charles River, the waterfront                    and around the pond on the Public Gardens, you can find them just                    about anywhere. You can even let a “Duck” give you                    a tour of the city, by catching a ride on the popular Boston Duck                    Tours. If you need a break from the city, sit back, relax and                    enjoy a scenic cruise around the pond, in the Boston Public Garden                    on a majestic swan boat; not really a duck but close in relation.                    While in the Gardens, be sure to view the famous bronze sculpture                    of a happy family of ducks waddling by. Needless to say, the duck                    has become Boston’s unofficial Mascot.
Most of the photograph’s                  in this book capture Boston in an 180 degree perspective. This                  global view is our perception of how a duck sees the world. By                  photographing the city with our special lens we are not only able                  to frame more things in one shot but the end result is unusually                  creative. This artistic view of Boston truly remains a one-of-a                  kind “Duck’s eye view”.
