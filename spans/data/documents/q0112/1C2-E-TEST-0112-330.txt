Tour Bus Parking
The Tour Bus Parking Map is designed to help tour bus operators travel between destinations quickly and efficiently. Locations around Boston are identified on the map for tour bus drop-off/pick-up and for long-term (layover) bus parking. The map contains detailed information regarding tour bus regulations and contact information for tour bus operators. Tourist attractions and hotels are also indicated on this map. As a result of this public information, visitors and residents alike will be better directed throughout the streets of Boston as well as informed of the city's anti-idling enforcement activities.
The Tour Bus Parking Guidelines map is a product of the Tourism Transportation Task Force and was prepared by BTD.Â The Task Force, co- chaired by BTD and Move Massachusetts, consists of many members from both the tourism industry and from Boston's neighborhoods, working together to improve urban transportation for residents and visitors alike.
