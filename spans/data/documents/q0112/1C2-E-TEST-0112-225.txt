According to the official website, one must personally visit the ticket office at the Prudential Center to purchase tickets for same day tours.  A "limited number" of tickets are available for two days ahead.  Tickets cannot be purchased by phone (except for groups of 16 or more).   My husband and I weekend in Boston several times a year, and we've gone to the ticket booth many times without success.  This past weekend, we asked the concierge at our hotel (Le Meridien) for "insider tips".  We were advised that we could easily book through him with 24 hours notice and a credit card.  Voila!  We indicated our desired time and the following morning picked up a faxed confirmation for the next day.  Note that this is a fabulous tour!  Especially the "water" portion with the magnificent views of the Boston skyline from the river.
