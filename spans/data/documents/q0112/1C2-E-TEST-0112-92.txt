Freedom Trail Bike Tour
One of the highlights of Boston is the Freedom Trail, a series of spots that played an important role in the history of the American Revolution. There are many different ways to tour the Trail, but one of the most exhilarating is by bicycle. All visitors have to do is head over to Boston Common, where Boston Bike Tours rents bikes for tours and for those who simply want to take a ride. The guided Freedom Trail Bike Tour takes a group pedaling through the city with stops at places such as Paul Revereâ€™s House, the Old North Church where Revere looked to see how many lanterns were hanging, and several other points of interest.
In addition to seeing all of the historical sites, the tour is also a great way to get oriented to the layout of the city.
