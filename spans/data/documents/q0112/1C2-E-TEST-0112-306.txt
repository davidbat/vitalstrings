Unidentified           Employee #3: Good morning.
Unidentified           Woman #3: He's sharing my ticket.
Employee #3:           Does he have a ticket?
Woman #3:           Well, he's sharing.
ANDY:           (Voiceover) We take surveys now, and we find out where they're coming from. Are           they coming to Boston specifically to take us? And now that we have all this           information, then, you know, coming up with scientific ways or whatever to           quantify the economic impact, because I figure that the economic impact at the           Prudential Center had $20 million of economic impact by us being there. So if           you look at the whole economic impact that we have in the way we structure our           business has got to be twice or three times as much of all the incidental           spending of all these people who are coming into Boston to take in this           attraction. We're the number-one attraction in the state now.
"CAPTAIN           COURAGEOUS": Hey, Thomas. Quack, quack. Great. Good smile here. Thank you.
HATTIE:           You're perceived by the outsider as extraordinarily successful, which means you           must be rolling in dough.
ANDY: Well,           I'm not. I owe--before I start really participating in the equity of the           business, you know--the way the deal was structured was that I had to say, `I'm           gonna put everything at risk,' and that, you know, I'm deferring my position.           In other words, my position is subordinated to the investors until they get a           certain return. So basically, I've got to pay off another $4 million before I           just get past subsistence living. It's not all about money. I mean, it started           out about money, for me. I knew I could make this a successful business, but           then once you get into it and you start affecting people's lives--300,000           people is here taking it and getting off and are loving it, and the employees           enjoy working at the company. In my own way, I've helped change the world, I           think.
Make More Than Money--Make an           Impact
Lightbulb
HATTIE:           Money. It's what we need to get started, it's what we need to keep going, it's           what we need to grow, and it's how we keep score in business. Andy had none           when he started Duck Tours, and today, he is in deep debt. But he's on the path           to wealth. What is that path? How did he find it? His experience working in the           finance community taught him that venture capital is available, but you have to           know how to attract the right people. Andy did his research, put plans in           writing, prepared an offering memorandum, but money didn't fall from heaven. It           wasn't until he met Carrie McIndoe at Strategic Capital Resources that he was           able to go forward. She was the catalyst. She raised the funds needed, $1 1/4           million. How do you find your catalyst? You become like Indiana Jones in search           of the Holy Grail. You become like Andy Wilson, so focused, so enthusiastic, so           persistent, you will find the money or you'll change the business plan until           you have one that can be funded by outsiders. Venture capitalists don't want           little ideas. They want big ideas. Get a big idea, put it in writing, find some           people who've already done it to coach you, and be willing to go without for           months, maybe even years before you actually see any cash for yourself.
(Voiceover)           The tour is full of heart-stopping moments for all of us history buffs, but           Andy believes the most important person in American history has been           overlooked.
"CAPTAIN           COURAGEOUS": Now over here on the left-hand side, you're gonna see a statue of           Mary Dyer.
ANDY :           Mary Dyer gave the world the right to religious freedom ... Boston was           originally settled by the Puritans, and they passed a law that said if you did           not practice their puritanical beliefs, the penalty was death . And the worst           part was is they came to this country to escape religious persecution. Mary           Dyer said, `Hey, you know, you're hypocrites.' And she put them to test. They           found her guilty -- her only crime of being a Quaker -- and they hung her on           the Boston Common. As a result of that, her husband went back to the King of           England and proposed an experiment called the Lively Experiment. The king ...           signed a proclamation and made Rhode Island the first place on the face of the           earth where people could freely practice their religion.
(Voiceover)           That's a hundred years before this country became independent. Mary Dyer, she's           my hero. This woman ended her life to give the world the right to religious           freedom, which was the first acceptance of diversity in the world, and nobody           knows who she is.
Unidentified           Child #1: I learned that Benjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street.
Unidentified           Child #2: Well, I learned something.
HATTIE: Oh,           tell me, darling, what'd you learn?
Child #2: To           drive a boat.
HATTIE: You           learned how to drive a boat!
Get Some Rose-Colored Glasses
ANDY: There           was a defining moment the day--I was 19 years old when my dad dropped dead in           front of me, and then at that point--from that point forward, I was on my own           financially. And the world has never been the same for me again. And I always           got that sense that the world was against me. But the whole point is, if you           think that way, you know, you'll never go anywhere in life and you'll be a           miserable person. And so it's optimism, you know, and passion and that passion           has to be optimistic passion. You know, you have to be optimistic about the           world and about being able to do something. Otherwise, you'll never take any           action. And your life will never move forward.
My           grandmother taught me that everything fits into banking someplace, meaning that           as you get older, you accumulate more and more knowledge, deposits of           knowledge. And at some point in your life, you're gonna withdraw that knowledge           again. So everything fits into banking someplace. And so that's one thing I           learned along the way is that, you know, you always learn from your experiences           and, you know, don't let your experiences just go by without gleaning something           from it.
There's a lot           of knowledge you can never get in college. And, you know, the world is           a--that's what I'm saying: As you go through the world, you accumulate that           knowledge, and I think that's very important, as you accumulate it and try and           apply it. There's a reason why--you know, to become very philosophical, the Ten           Commandments say, `Respect thy elders.' If somebody does accumulate that           knowledge through their lives, they're gonna be a lot more powerful. Knowledge           is power. And so I believe that to be very important.
One of the           things--I'll tell you, when you have a business and after you've been through           the struggle and then it all of a sudden becomes so wildly successful from the           outside looking in and from, you know, even passing your expectations, part of           it is kind of, you know--your head gets a little bit swollen at first. And you           know, again, I thought I was ready to take on the whole world and expand the           duck business everywhere I could. All of a sudden I said, you know, `Do I want           to have 55 employees and 20 different locations around the world?' And the           answer was no. And so I feel very fortunate, again, that this has taken off,           and so I need to make sure that this business stays as a long-term, sustainable           business.
President,           Boston Chamber of Commerce: I am president and chief executive officer of the           Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. What Duck Tours has done is built upon the           culture and heritage of Boston and our whole region. In just four years, they           have become a role model for other businesses throughout our region.
USBA           Official: I'm the regional administrator for the US Small Business           Administration. Duck Tours is a great American success story. Entrepreneurs           have a unique heart and a unique drive, and Andy Wilson has that, personified.           When he finished his remarks at the awards banquet for the Small Businessperson           of the Year, you could have heard a pin drop. I mean, I think his last line           was, `God bless America. You couldn't do this, what I've done, anywhere else in           the world.'
ANDY: Once           you have a successful business, people look at you differently, which bothers           me. See, this is what bothers me is that before, people wouldn't listen to me.           You know, I was a no one, and now you have this kind of successful visible           business, and now all of a sudden people hang on my words more. And so I           realize I can do more with my life.
The world is           a difficult place; and there is a lot that's a sham; there is a lot of           drudgery, but it really is a beautiful place. And with that kind of           attitude, you can conquer the world.
Establish A Customer Referral           Program
Our           marketing expert, John Wargo, tells us how to get more good customers just like           the good customers we already have.
JOHN WARGO           (Marketing Expert): Do a profile of your existing customers and your best           customers and determine the demographics and the psychographics, if possible,           to determine why and how they purchase. And then there are lists available in           the marketplace that could match that profile. There are list brokers that are           available that will help you find a list of people who look like your best           customers. Then what you want to do is to take that list and mail to them           because they're similar to the customers that are buying from you.
That's one           way.
The second           way that is really unique is, a creative way to get new customers is go to your           existing customers and develop a referral program. Ask them if they have five           people that they know who might enjoy the same services, the same products that           they are. And then provide them an incentive and let them send those names in           to you. And then you can send them a letter and say, `You've been referred by           one of your friends as somebody that might be interested in this.' So the           friend of a friend referral program is a very creative way to have your best           customers help you find customers who act and behave like them. It really           works.
