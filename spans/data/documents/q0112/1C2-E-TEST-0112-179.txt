We offer a 90 minute fully narrated tour of Boston and Boston Harbor.  Tour Boston's Historic Waterfront first by land and then by sea. Our Super Ducks are custom built to provide the best and most comfortable touring experience available in Boston on both land and sea. Our vehicles are 12 feet tall and provide the best line of sight, state of the art sound, comfortable seating, open air viewing in good weather and enclosed heating during cooler days.
Our captains are licensed commercial Master Mariners and well versed in maritime history. Our mates are master storytellers and will not only look to your safety but entertain you on your excursion though Boston. Tickets are the same price whether purchased at our kiosks, web or at your hotel.
