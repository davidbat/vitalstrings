Ride the Green line, the original subway lines, twisting and turning as it goes underground. Using the T is the easiest way to get around Boston, including Cambridge. Purchase a CharlieCard, good for both the T and buses.
 
 
Harbor ferries – Ferries are an inexpensive way to take a boat ride and see Boston from the water. The Inner Harbor Ferry goes from Long Wharf (at the New England Aquarium) to Charlestown Navy Yard (and the USS Constitution). There are also commuter boats to Quincy and Hingham (children 11 and under are free). Pick up the ferries at Long Wharf or Rowes Wharf.
