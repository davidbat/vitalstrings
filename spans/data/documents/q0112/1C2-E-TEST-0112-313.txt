Trivia, movies, and good company make the bus ride fun.
Everything was well organized.
These guys do it right. Highly recommend for a family or a group of friends.

The game was awesome. The Vermont Sports Tours & Just Enjoy! Team were always there checking on us.
A trip with the Just Enjoy! Team is a definite MUST!
We will be traveling with them again!

I had an amazing time. We got gift bags and shirt right from the start.
The bus ride was enjoyable and comfortable. Our group of friends had time before and after the game to explore Fenway and Boston. Highly recommended, I will be going again!
