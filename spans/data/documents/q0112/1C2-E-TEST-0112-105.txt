If you want to get a decent overview of Boston in a short time, you can’t a better way than taking the “Duck Tour” that has been a fixture there since 1994.. “Duck” is a an authentic, renovated World War II amphibious landing vehicle that goes on land as well as in the water.
You can begin the Tour at the Museum of Science or the Prudential Center in Boston's Back Bay (On Huntington Avenue in front of Shaw's Supermarket. - closest train is Prudential on the Green E line, as well as Copley on the all the Green lines).
Each Duck Tour guide has its own personality with each r ConDUCKtors, in character and costume, such as Sven the Viking.. The guide gives you a bit of a history lesson on the sites and takes you past many of the major city attractions: Copley Square, Boston Common, Newbury Street, Quincy Market, and the Fleet Center to name a few. Then, you drive right into the Charles River and take a cruise along the banks of the city. The drivers really get into it, and likes to make riders quack like a duck as you’re driving along
The tickets are sold at the Prudential Center (Center Court) Huntington Avenue (metro : Prudential Center) from 8:30AM to 8:PM, 7 days a week.
The departure begins at 9:00AM , near the Prudential Center
