Breathtaking Boston Harbor views and waterfront history await you on this land and sea tour aboard the one-of-a-kind Super Duck amphibious vehicles. The 90-minute duck tour includes a full 45 minutes on land touring Boston's waterfront neighborhoods, and another 45 minutes at sea in Boston Harbor.
The unique tour takes place on a fun amphibious vehicle that can drive Boston’s historic streets and then plunge mightily into Boston Harbor for an exciting narrated look at the city.
Catch the free convenience shuttle from the corner of State Street and Atlantic Ave, near the New England Aquarium and Long Wharf. Taking you direct to the departure point at the Charlestown Navy Yard, you will soon be on your way.
At the end of the Boston Harbor duck tour, ride back downtown absolutely free on the return shuttle to State Street. The shuttles leave about half an hour prior to the Super Duck tour times, so just check your ticket and hop on board!
