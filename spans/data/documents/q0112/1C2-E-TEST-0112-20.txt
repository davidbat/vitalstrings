The original, world-famous Boston Duck Tours!
The Boston Duck Tours is a must-do for all visitors and a rite of passage for all Bostonians. Led by funky, fun-loving  conDUCKtors, like Major Tom Foolery and Colonel Duct Tape, a fleet of amphibious vehicles, like the classic “Beantown Betty” and the newer edition “Red Sox Nathan,” give passengers of all ages a unique view of both Cambridge, and Boston from the Charles River before climbing back on shore for a tidbit-filled cruise around the city’s most famous neighborhoods.
