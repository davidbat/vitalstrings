When Boston Duck Tours was founded years             ago, many Bostonians thought the founder             was nuts:
"Put tourists in an uncomfortable               military vehicle instead of               a plush air-conditioned motorcoach? You're               nuts!"
"Drive them around, rain               or shine, handing             out plastic ponchos if it starts to drizzle?             You're nuts!"
People loved it! Pretty             soon everyone, local or visitor, wanted             to take a Duck             Tour.
Today the noisy, ungainly, basic-comfort             vehicles are a common sight any day on Boston 's downtown streets...and cruising             in the Charles River for about 20 minutes of  their 80-minute             tours, which depart from both             the Prudential             Center and the Museum             of Science .
The tour guides (known             as "conducktors") are             knowledgeable and fun, pointing out landmarks             and city features along the way.
During the Charles River             cruise portion of the tour, guides have             even been known to allow children to steer               the craft for a minute or two.
Imitation being the sincerest form of             flattery, there is now a second Duck Tour             company in Boston: Super Duck Tours, with             amphibious craft launching from the Charlestown             Navy Yard, near the USS Constitution ("Old             Ironsides") and cruising in Boston Harbor.
What's the downside? Only that Duck Tours             are so popular they often sell             out in advance. Tickets are sold             for a particular tour departure time and             location on a particular day, and are non-refundable and non-exchangable. Reservations by phone             are accepted only for groups of 20 or more persons, so if you're             a couple, family or smaller party you'll             have to pin down your tickets another way.
Here's what to do to             assure that you get to "ride a duck:"
1. Consider buying a Go                 Boston Card
which             admits you to 65 different tours, attractions,             museums and historic sites in Boston, Lexington,             Concord, Cape Cod and Newport RI. A ticket             on a Boston Duck Tour is             included in the Go                 Boston Card
;             you can even reserve your place on a tour             up to 30 days in advance. If you're going             to see and do a lot in Boston and eastern             Massachusetts, the Go                 Boston Card
can                 save you money. Click here for             more info:

2. If you don't have a Go Boston Card,             Boston Duck Tour tickets go on sale online at             8:45 am Eastern Time 30 days before departure.             If you're able to plan your touring days             that far in advance, this is the             easiest way to guarantee the seats you             want on             the day and at the time you want. The only             negative is that you pay a $3.50-per-ticket "convenience charge" to buy your             tickets this way.
3. Unless all tickets have been pre-sold             on the Internet, tickets are made             available at Boston Duck Tour ticket booths next             to the Prudential Center, Faneuil Hall,             and the Museum of Science up to             five days in advance of tour departure.             If you can't plan farther ahead, this is             a good option: stop by one of the ticket             booths a few days before you want to take             your tour, and buy your tickets. A bonus:             no service charge!
4. If you can't buy your tickets in advance, a number of tickets are always             held for same-day sales. Go             to one of the ticket booths as soon as             possible after they open (8:30 am) and             buy them on the day you want to tour. On             many days, these same-day tickets are sold             out by 12 noon.
5. On weekdays, rainy days, and outside              the busy summer season,  you may find             it easier to buy tickets.  On cold or rainy             days, heavy transparent curtains shield             passengers from the weather, and the heat             is turned on.
Duck Tours are handicapped               accessible.             The             last tour departs about an hour             before sunset, which changes with             the seasons.
So schedule your tour now. Get quacking!
