I was extremely impressed by the tour. Who doesn't love riding in history as you learn about history?   DUKWs are amphibious vehicles, meaning they can be driven on land and water. These monsters were designed and built by women during WWII in 1942 to deliver men and supplies to European shores. DUKWs are better known as Ducks here in Boston and that's half of what makes this tour so unique. The other half is being able to Quack at kids on the street and get quacked at on the tour throughout Boston and the Charles River. Seriously though, the other half is that you learn so many new and unique historical facts about Boston. Our tour guide hardly took a breath on the hour (plus) tour.   Our guide was Mad Capt. and he was dressed like a pirate carrying a whale harpoon and had long braided hair. I was a little worried about taking this tour once I saw him but the longer we were on the boat the more I liked him. He had both caracter and knowledge of the city.   Getting tickets was very easy ($22 students, $25 adults) because you can take the T (subway) to the Prudential Mall (the T actually comes out in the mall). You can get them before hand, the day of, or online and the tour begins a block away.   What are you waiting for? This is one of the "musts" when you come to Boston. It's fun, silly, powerful, exciting, adventurous, and informative. We liked it so much we were sad when it ended and we're looking forward to having an excuse to go again. What more could you ask for in a tour?
