90 minutes of my life i wont get back
By A Yahoo! Contributor, 9/22/08
The driver was a mess who pretended to be funny making wise cracks at passers by and the other duck drivers .funny to a point of being offensive . He didnt even seem to get the message when people from one of the other boats on the river showed him the finger . Other people here seem to be raving about how the drivers know a lot about boston .if pointing to a building and saying here;s this building is all it takes then yeah the driver knows it all . If you really want to see bost take theolley tours .its  way more informative and at the end of it you could say youve seen boston
