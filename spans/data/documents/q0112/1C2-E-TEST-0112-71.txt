Boston Duck Tours
Boston Duck Tours’ conductors helm a fleet of restored World War II–era DUKWs . Originally used to usher soldiers and supplies from sea to land, the vehicles now enjoy a cheerier, award-winning career rumbling down the streets of Boston and slapping speeding tickets on mallard ducks in the Charles River. The amphibious vehicles hold up to 36 guests in their open-air back decks for 360-degree views of the cityscape.
