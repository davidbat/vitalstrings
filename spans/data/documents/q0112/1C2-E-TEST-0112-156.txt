At least once in your Boston adult life, you must go on a Duck Tour. People will quack at you. (Or you will quack at them.)  The idea of turning World War II amphibious landing vehicles into tour vehicles, like Lolly the Trolley, is a clever one. And the fact that each tour guide has a uniquely developed (sometimes over-the-top) personality certainly adds to the charm.   But really, at the end of the day, the best part of the tour isn't hearing all about historical Boston while you drive around in a giant duck. It isn't hearing all about nautical-historical Boston while you float on the Charles River. It isn't even the time when the tour guide who's dressed like a pirate lets the four-year-old child steer the boat. It's the magical time at red lights and intersections when people quack at you - everybody, or at least enough people, just know how to do this - that makes the Duck Tour worthwhile.
