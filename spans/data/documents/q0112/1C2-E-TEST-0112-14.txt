Great land/water tour of Boston. If you can?t decide between a water or land tour of Beantown, Boston?s World Famous Duck Tour is for you. The unique tours are conducted in World War II amphibious landing vehicles called ?ducks.? They are like boats with wheels that have funny names like Back Bay Bertha, Fenway Fannie and Tub of the Hub. The tour narrators, called ConDUCKtors, are hilarious. Guide Major Tom Foolery wears Superman pajamas while he drives; Cmdr. James Bernard Swampscott sets the ground rules by stating ?no smoking and no ballroom dancing? on board; and all drivers encourage passengers to quack at pedestrians during the ride. But the guides are even more knowledgeable than they are funny, continually delivering interesting facts about Boston?s history. The 80-minute tour hits all of Boston?s hotspots: the golden-domed State House; Bunker Hill; Boston Common; Copley Square; the Big Dig; Government Center; trendy Newbury Street; Quincy Market; Prudential Tower and more. Then comes the highlight as the duck drives straight into the Charles River for beautiful seaside views of Cambridge and Boston. The ConDUCKtors even let passengers steer the boat while it?s in the water. For a site-seeing trip you?ll never forget that will make you laugh while teaching you about the city, the Duck tour does not disappoint.â€¦
