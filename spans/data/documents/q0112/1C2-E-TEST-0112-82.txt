Before purchasing your Add-on-Adventure vouchers, please note the following:
Make sure you have a printer so that you can print your vouchers. They must be presented at the restaurant or attraction that you will be visiting to redeem your ticket or meal.
Some of our restaurants or attraction will offer you VIP seating if you call ahead of time. Please read all of your vouchers carefully so you know what you can do to reserve the best time for you to experience your meal or attraction. Most restaurants will offer any Add-on-Adventure holders priority seating so please let them know you have an Add-on-Adventure voucher when calling with your reservation.
Please ensure that you let your restaurant server know that you are an Add-on-Adventure voucher holder before ordering so that they may get you the correct pre-fixe menu.
