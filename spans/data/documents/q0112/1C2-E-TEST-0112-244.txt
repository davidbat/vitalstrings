READ THE TRANSCRIPT .
Reading the entire script of this episode of the show causes one to reflect on             key ideas in critical ways. You will find that you can easily bounce from the             transcript to the case study guide from that dialogue .
EXPLORE THE CASE STUDY . In the beginning             these case             study guides were prepared for the special broadcast by PBS into the             schools and universities throughout the USA. Since that time, Prenctice Hall             and Thomson Learning have include these case studies in their best-selling             business textbooks.
For These Days : "Mary Dyer gave the world             the right to religious freedom ...the Puritans found her guilty -- her only             crime was being a Quaker-- and hung her on the Boston Common. As a result of             that, her husband went back to the King of England and proposed an experiment             called the Lively Experiment. And the king bought into it and signed the             proclamation, which made Rhode             Island the first place on the face of the Earth where people could freely             practice their religion .

1500+ Questions and Answers             within SmallBusinessSchool . Within every show there are about 15             questions and answers. Within the school, there is a place to record your             answers to these questions. Your answers to the same questions that Hattie              has asked all the other business owners become part of your own secure             database where you have options to re-display your best answers within this             site as your own profile page (that is this page), essentially             an executive summary , a study             guide and/or a transcript .
Exit Strategy and Succession Planning .             70% of all businesses fail to pass the baton to the next generation. They fail             to reach sustainability beyond their personality. That business is called a             lifestyle business.
If you             want to be rewarded for all your hard work, by the time you hit 40 years of             age, you had better have some ideas about your own exit strategy and a             succession plan. By 50 years old, you should have the basic elements in place.             By 55, we all should be working on it. By 60, we need to be harvesting some of             our equity (ESOP - DPO - IPO). In the key point of the study guide just above,             review points 5 and 6 .
FIND YOUR             STEP AND CHART A COURSE TO THE NEXT . If you already have a business,             explore Steps 5 - 8 . If youÂ’re just getting             started, spend time going through Steps 1 -             4 . Three-dimensional business modelling is part of our research of critical             ratios.
FIRST PRINCIPLES : Starting a             business is the road to economic independence for most of us average people.             Read a little more to see why incorporating a business keeps the passion of             the American revolution alive!
MORE ABOUT FINANCES . We have a section             about money and it can be useful. BUT -- and this             is a big one -- we all need to know about RMA --The Risk Management             Association. This is real insiders information on your financials so take             note.
This organization is the banker's banker. They know more             about key critical ratios than anybody on earth. Over 3000 banks and 16000             other kinds of financial organizations contribute the essential financial data             from their loan inventory to RMA's "Annual Statement Studies" to calculate key             critical ratios for every major industry type (and for most subsets of business             vis-a-vis the SIC and NAICS ).             With over 150,000 loans per year, that is statistical relevancy.
Do you             know the average key ratios within your industry? We haven't learned ours yet             for the TV/Production Industry, so we all need to ask our banker. To             really make a study of it, keep an eye out for the next seminar by RMA in your             area. It'll be the best money you'll spend to understand the organic nature of             your business, and learn what it is that your banker so quickly knows about             your industry. For more, read online: RMA seminars , RMA history , and their small business scoring (i.e. used by the SBA             for their Low Docs).
