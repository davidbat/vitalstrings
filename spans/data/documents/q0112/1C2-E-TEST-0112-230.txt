To promote an appreciation for our state's history, The Bostonian Society and Boston Duck Tours sponsor an annual  essay contest for greater Boston-area school children in grades 5-8. Students  in grades 5-6 are invited to submit an essay of 300-500 words;  students in grades 7-8 are invited to submit an essay of 500-700 words. The First Place student in each grade group receives a free Duck Tour  and visit to the Old State House for his/her class (up to 36 people including  chaperones). Winning schools are responsible for providing transportation to  Boston for the Duck Tour and visit to the Old State House. The tour must be  booked for a date no later than May 31, 2012. 
2012 will mark the 100th anniversary of the ‘Bread and Roses’ strike in the Lawrence textile mills.
