When my Mom, sister and niece were coming to visit me in Boston, I was at a loss for what to do. What could possibly entertain a 5 year old, a 54 year old, 23 year old AND a 32 year old? Boston has many exciting things to do for children, but I wasn't really sure I knew what those things were. I bought three Go Boston Cards and the guide book suggested a few must-sees for families, the Duck Tour was one of these Must-Do Boston Attractions. We got on the Duck Tour at Hynes Convention Center near the Pru, I'd seen the Ducks around town but would never ride on them unless I was a tourist, but today I was a tourist whether I liked it or not.
The tour guide hammed it up for us from the start, laughing, jokes, quacking, annecdotes--this tour guide did it all. The guide took us all through the city in an open-air "Duck" which is aqueous as well as a large military vehicle dominating the Boston city Streets. Marybeth, my niece loved the quacking as well as the view from the Duck-like-bus--she also had no trouble pointing out the things she wanted to see and do--including a street performer as we passed Fanuiel Hall. The tour only lasted about an hour, but it was well worth it. My sister got a perfect overview of the city and my niece was never bored.
