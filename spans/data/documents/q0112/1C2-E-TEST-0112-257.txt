Boston Bruins , Bruins Parade , Duck Boats , Marc Savard , Stanley Cup , Zdeno Chara
BOSTON (CBS) – The duck boats are cleaned up, shined up, and gassed up for the Boston Bruins victory lap Saturday morning. In the last decade the Boston tourist vehicles have carried 7 championship teams on a Rolling Rally through the city.
Now it’s the Bruins turn.
Team Captain Zdeno Chara arrived at the TD Garden by bicycle Saturday morning around 8:30. He and his teammates will be honored in a ceremony outside the Garden at 10:30 a.m. before boarding a fleet of 18 duck boats.
The parade will wind the Stanley Cup champions from the TD Garden to Copley Square – a two mile tour that is expected to take about two hours.
Bruins fans began lining the parade route Friday night, to guarantee their spot right up front. About one million people are expected to line the two mile route to cheer on the Black and Gold.
