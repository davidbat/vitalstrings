When a bacteria or other single celled organism replicates its DNA and divides into equal halves, it's called binary fission.  When a cell in a tissue or multicellular organism divides into two equal halves it's called mitosis.  So really the only difference is where it takes place and whether or not the new cell is a self-sustaining organism.
