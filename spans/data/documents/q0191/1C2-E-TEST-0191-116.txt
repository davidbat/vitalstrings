High School teachers and students can find simple experiments that can be used in a Chemistry or Physics class. These experiments can be done in a classroom with inexpensive equipment.
At this site, students and teachers at all levels can learn about the objects that produce the known and identified mass of the Universe. The rest is made of Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are science mysteries and are described in other websites.
