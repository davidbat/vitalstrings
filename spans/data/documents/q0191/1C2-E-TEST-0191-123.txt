Play “Periodic Table Bingo.” Provide each student bingo chips (or other small objects) as well as with his/her own unique copy of the periodic table in which a number of elements have been randomly assigned as free spaces (see below). Call out elements. The first student to get either four in row in a period or four in a row in a group wins.  For more, visit the Periodic Table page. A customizable version of the Period Table Bingo is available in Microsoft Word to download.
