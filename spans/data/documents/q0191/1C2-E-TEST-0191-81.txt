Some nucleii are inherently unstable.such nucleii can be split into two or more fragments.For example Uranium-235.When a slow neuotron enters the nucleus it gets excited and unstable.Inside the nucleus two forces are competing.The attaractive nucleon forcesc and force of repulsion between the protons.In fission the repulsive force becomes more then nuclear force hence the breakdown occurres.It is called FISSION.
In fusion two different nucleous are brought closer by force so that they coelese into one.Simplest example is bringing two hydrogen atoms close to each other.Hydrogen nucleous is a proton so two protons will repel.If we imcrease the kinetic energy to such an extent that it overcomes the force of repulsion the two hydrogen nucleous will come very close and will be bound by attarective nuclear force.This is called FUSION.
FISSION and FUSION are opposit of each other.
Example of Fission:If uncontroled it Atom Bomb,Under control it is a Nuclear Reactor.
Example of Fusion is the thermonuclear fusion inside the stars.Uncontrolled fusion is Hydrogen Bomb.
