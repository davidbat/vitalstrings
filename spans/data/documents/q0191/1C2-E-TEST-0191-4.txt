What is the difference between fusion and fission?
In: General and Special Relativity [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
Fission is pulling molecules apart (used in power plants to produce heat, to make steam, to turn turbines), and fusion is putting molecules together, which is what the sun uses to produce heat. Currently it is very difficult and inefficient to use fusion on earth.
In a fission reaction, a very large and unstable element (generally Uranium-235) is split. When it is split, the particles scatter, and Protons collide with other atoms. This causes other atoms to split, all along releasing massive amounts of energy (equal to the mass times the speed of light squared, which is the famous E=MC2).Where C=3 multiplied by10 raised to 8. A fusion bomb takes two hydrogen atoms and rams them together using high pressure, velocity and heat. When combined, they form Helium. This releases more energy, forcing more hydrogen atoms to fuse. The Fusion bomb is actually detonated by small fission bombs set around and within it.
