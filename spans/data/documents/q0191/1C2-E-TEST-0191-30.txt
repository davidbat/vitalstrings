Fission is when a heavy nucleus is forced to split apart, such as hitting U235 with a neutron. This releases energy and fission products which are radioactive. Fission has been used for decades for generating electricity in land-based power plants. Also, in navy ships and subs for propulsion and electrical power. There are pros and cons for this application.
Fusion is when light nuclei are forced to join (fuse) together, such as slamming four protons together to make helium. This releases much more energy and the products are not radioactive. Fusion seems to be a better way to make energy. However, to force those protons to even get near each other takes a great deal of thermal energy, heat. So much heat that the walls of any container that we know of for this reactor would simply melt and vaporize away in a short time. Until we can come up with a viable containment for a fusion reactor, we'll just have to make do with nature's own fusion reactor, the sun.
If you want to become an instant hero and make billions, make a vessel that can withstand millions of degrees to contain and maintain a working fusion reactor. End of story - end of line.
