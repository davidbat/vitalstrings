Welcome to the board ~
I would agree with what your surgeon said about your back ultimately being strong after fusion, assuming everything goes well and there are not further complications.  And I suppose it depends on the extent of the fusion.  There have been some people on the board that did very well and recovered very quickly...but I think they are in the minority of patients who have lumbar fusion.
I was barely leaving the house at the end of 4 weeks.  I was on painkillers for the first eight weeks, and did not start driving until that week.  I started feeling better at 3 months and felt like I was feeling stronger a couple months later.  It took quite awhile to get my strength back, but I'm sure part of that is based on how long the patient has been dealing with the spine issues prior to surgery.
You will be able to sit up right away, but for limited times -- like 15 minutes at a time.  You will still have the rules regarding bending, twisting, lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk.  You would also be wise to avoid pushing, pulling, reaching overhead or to the side.
Maybe you had the hard work done first and now it will be easier.  Mine was the other way around--had the fusion first, and then a lami/foraminotomy a year later.  The second surgery was a breeze.  I was in overnight and had one pain pill the entire time.  I felt great and went home and baked brownies.  I am still dismayed at how easy it was, and my incision was as big as that for my fusion...which I never understood.
If you look at a variety of doctors' and spine clinics' websites, they almost all say to count on three months off for an open surgery.  Perhaps he is doing yours minimally invasivally??
Hopefully others who had it the other way around will chime in with their experiences.
In any case, try not to worry.  Surgical experiences are very rarely the same.
