They are both rather non-descript words and could mean either of the two main bomb methods used. These methods are of a pure fission reaction (like those used at the end of the second World War) or a fission-fusion-fission reaction (commonly called a H-bomb).
An atom bomb is where the power of the weapon is generated by nuclear reactions and the same definition goes for the nuclear bomb.
