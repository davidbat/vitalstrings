what is the difference between binary fission and budding?

Binary fission is a method of asexual reproduction . It is common in prokaryotes . A living cell divides into two cells. The two cells should be identical, but since mutation can occur, there might be slight differences. This process is basically when a prokaryotic organism divides into two parts (Each with a separate nucleus). the parent cell divides to give rise to two daughter cells, the daughter cells then each develop into individual parent cells and give rise to two more daughter cells EACH, and so on and so forth.
Budding is a form of asexual reproduction in which a new organism grows on another one. The new organism remains attached as it grows, separating from the parent organism only when it is mature. Since the reproduction is asexual, the newly created organism is a clone and is genetically identical to the parent organism.

Binary fission is an asexual method of reproduction in which a parent organism divides or splits to form new organisms in which the parent organism ceases to exist . Example- Amoeba,Leishmania
Budding is an asexual method of reproduction in which the bud develops from the parent plant as an outgrowth and when it matures it detaches from the parent plant and develops into a new organism... Example-Hydra

hi gunjan!
Budding
binary fission
.In it a small growth   appears and then develop into a new organism by detaching from it.
.In it the organism’s   nucleus divide into two parts and form two different organisms
It is a form of   vegetative propagation
.It is a type of   fission
It can be done   artificially
It can be only done   naturally
It is extensively used   in horticulture and agriculture
It has no such   commercial value
Ex-rose, yeast etc
