The Nucleus
The nucleus contains most of the mass of the atom. It is itself composed of neutrons and protons bound together by very strong nuclear forces, much greater than the electrical forces that bind the electrons to             the nucleus. The nucleus of an atom is described by these             characteristics:
The mass number "A" of a nucleus is the number of                 nucleons (protons and neutrons) it contains.
The atomic number "Z" is the number of positively charged protons. 
For example, the expression
U,  represents uranium with A=235 (number of nucleons) and Z=92                 (number of protons).
The binding energy of a nucleus is a measure of how tightly its             protons and neutrons are held together by the nuclear forces. 
The binding energy per nucleon, the energy required to remove one             neutron or proton from a nucleus, is a function of the mass number             A. 
The Nuclear Binding Energy
The total energy required to break up a nucleus into its             constituent protons and neutrons can be calculated from
,             called nuclear binding energy. 
If we divide the binding energy of a nucleus by the number of             protons and neutrons (number of nucleons), we get the binding energy             per nucleon. This is the common term used to describe nuclear             reactions because atomic numbers vary and total binding energy would             be a relative term dependent upon that. The following figure, called             the binding energy curve, shows a plot of nuclear binding energy as             a function of mass number. The peak is at iron (Fe) with mass number             equal to 56.
The binding energy per nucleon is a             function of the mass number
The curve of binding energy implies that if two light nuclei near             the left end 
of the curve coalesce to form a heavier nucleus (the process is called fusion), 
or if             a heavy nucleus at the far right splits into two lighter ones (the             process is 
called fission), more             tightly bound nuclei result, and energy will be released.
The rising of the binding energy curve at low mass numbers, tells us that energy will be released if two nuclides of small mass number combine to form a single middle-mass nuclide. This process is called nuclear fusion .
The eventual dropping of the binding energy curve at high mass numbers tells us on the other hand, that nucleons are more tightly bound when they are assembled into two  middle-mass nuclides rather than into a single high-mass nuclide. In other words, energy can be released by the nuclear fission , or splitting, of a single massive nucleus into two smaller fragments.
Nuclear Fusion
The binding energy curve shows that energy can be released if two             light nuclei combine to form a single larger nucleus. This process             is called nuclear fusion. The process is hindered by the electrical             repulsion that acts to prevent the two particles from getting close             enough to each other to be within range and "fusing."
To generate useful amounts of power, nuclear fusion must occur in             bulk matter. That is, many atoms need to fuse in order create a             significant amount of energy. The best hope for bringing this about             is to raise the temperature of the material so that the particles             have enough energy - due to their thermal motions alone - to penetrate             the electrical repulsion barrier. This process is known as             thermonuclear fusion. Calculations show that these temperatures need             to be close to the sun's temperature of 1.5 X 107K.
Nuclear energy, measured in millions of electron volts (MeV), is             released by the fusion of two light nuclei, as when two heavy             hydrogen nuclei, deuterons,             combine in the reaction
producing a helium-3 atom, a free neutron,             and 3.2 MeV (3.2x106eV). 
Although the energy release in the fusion process is less per             nuclear reaction than in fission, 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) of the lighter             material contains many more atoms; thus, the energy liberated from             0.5 kg (1.1 lb) of hydrogen-isotope fuel is equivalent to that of             about 29 kilotons of TNT, or almost three times as much as from             uranium. This estimate, however, is based on complete fusion of all             hydrogen atoms. Fusion reactions occur only at temperatures of             several millions of degrees, the rate increasing enormously with             increasing temperature; such reactions consequently are known as thermonuclear (heat-induced) reactions. Strictly speaking, the term             thermonuclear implies that the nuclei have a range (or distribution)             of energies characteristic of the temperature. This plays an             important role in making rapid fusion reactions possible by an             increase in temperature.
Development of the hydrogen bomb was impossible before the             perfection of A-bombs, for only the latter could yield that             tremendous heat necessary to achieve fusion of hydrogen atoms.             Atomic scientists regarded the A-bomb as the trigger of the             projected thermonuclear device.
Thermonuclear Fusion in the Sun and other Stars
The sun radiates energy at the rate of 3.9 X 1026 W (watts) and             has been doing so for several billion years. The sun burns hydrogen             in a "nuclear furnace." The fusion reaction in the sun is             a multi-step process in which hydrogen is burned into helium,             hydrogen being the "fuel" and helium the "ashes." Hydrogen burning             has been going on in the sun for about 5 billion years and             calculations show that there is enough hydrogen left to keep the sun             going for about the same length of time into the future. The burning of hydrogen in the sun's core is alchemy on a grand             scale in the sense that one element is turned into another. 
Fusion takes place when the nuclei of hydrogen atoms with one             proton each fuse together to form helium atoms with two protons. A             standard hydrogen atom has one proton in its nucleus. There are two             isotopes of hydrogen which also contain one proton, but contain             neutrons as well. Deuterium contains one neutron while Tritium             contains two. Deep within the star, A deuterium atom combines with a             tritium atom. This forms a helium atom and an extra neutron. In the             process, an incredible amount of energy is released. 
When the star's supply of hydrogen is used up, it begins to             convert helium into oxygen and carbon. As a star evolves and             becomes still hotter, other elements can be formed by other fusion             reactions. If the star is massive enough, it will continue until it             converts carbon and oxygen into neon, sodium, magnesium, sulfur and             silicon. Eventually, these elements are transformed into calcium,             iron, nickel, chromium, copper and others until iron is formed. When             the core becomes primarily iron, the star's nuclear reaction can no             longer continue. Eements more massive than those with atomic             number equal to 56 (iron) cannot be manufactured by further fusion             processes as atomic number equal to 56 makes the peak of the binding             energy curve. If nuclides were to fuse after that, then energy would             be consumed as opposed to produced. 
The inward pressure of gravity becomes stronger than the outward             pressure of the nuclear reaction. The star collapses in on itself.             What happens next depends on the star's mass.
Nuclear energy is also released when the fission of a heavy             nucleus such as
U is             induced by the absorption of a neutron as in
producing cesium-140, rubidium-93, three neutrons, and 200 MeV. 
A nuclear             fission reaction releases 10 million times as much energy as is             released in a typical chemical reaction. In practical             units, the fission of 1 kg (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 releases 18.7             million kilowatt-hours as heat. 
The fission process             initiated by the absorption of one neutron in uranium-235 releases             about 2.5 neutrons, on the average, from the split nuclei. The             neutrons released in this manner quickly cause the fission of two             more atoms, thereby releasing four or more additional neutrons and             initiating a self-sustaining series of nuclear fissions, or a chain             reaction, which results in continuous release of nuclear energy.
Using the binding energy curve , we can estimate the energy released in this fission process. From this curve, we see that for heavy nuclides (mass about 240u), the mean biding energy per nucleon is about 7.6MeV. For middle-mass nuclides (mass about 120), it is about 8.5 MeV. This difference in total binding energy between a single large nucleus and two fragments (assumed to be equal) into which it may be split is then close to 200MeV. This is a relatively large amount of released energy per fission event. When a chain reaction occurs, many atoms and nuclei are involved so lots of energy is released.
Fission in Nuclear Reactors
To make large-scale use of the energy released in fission, one fission event must trigger another, so that the process spreads throughout the nuclear fuel as in a set of dominos. The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed raises the possibility of a chain reaction. Such a reaction can be either rapid (as in an atomic bomb) or controlled (as in a reactor).

nuclear research reactor, Triga             II, while operating.
In a nuclear reactor, control rods made of cadmium or graphite or some other neutron-absorbing material are used to regulate the number of neutrons. The more exposed control rods, the less neutrons and vice versa. This also controls the multiplication factor k which is the ratio of the number of neutrons present at the beginning of a particular generation to the number present at the beginning of the next generation. For k=1, the operation of the reactor is said to be exactly critical, which is what we wish it to be for steady-power operation. Reactors are designed so that they are inherently supercritical (k>1); the multiplication factor is then adjusted to the critical operation by inserting the control rods.
An unavoidable feature of reactor operation is the accumulation of radioactive wastes, including both fission products and heavy "transuranic" nuclides such as plutonium and americium.
nuclear weapons
Nuclear Weapons
In the 20th century, the rapid advance of industry and modern technology             greatly increased both the destructive power             of armed forces and the capacity of societies both to resist and to             recover from an attack. Nuclear weapons carry the possibilities of             destruction to a new level and are able to inflict far greater             damage within a few hours than previously resulted from years of             warfare. This not only makes the consequences of war worse but also             raises new concerns about controlling such a destructive process.             Indeed, nuclear weapons have not been used in war since the first             two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan in 1945, but many countries,             including many Third World countries, now have nuclear weapons.
Nuclear Weapons are explosive devices designed             to release nuclear energy on a large scale for military reasons.  The first atomic bomb (or A-bomb), was             tested on July 16, 1945, at Alamogordo, New Mexico.
All explosives prior to                   that time derived their power from the rapid burning or                   decomposition of some chemical compound. Such chemical                   processes release only the energy of the outermost electrons                   in the atom. 
Nuclear explosives, on the other hand, involve energy sources                   within the nucleus of the atom. 
The A-bomb gained                   its power from the splitting (fission) of all the atomic                   nuclei in several kilograms of plutonium. A sphere about the                   size of a baseball produced an explosion equal to 20,000 tons                   of TNT.
Although nuclear bombs were originally developed as             strategic weapons to be carried by large bombers, nuclear weapons             are now available for a variety of both strategic and tactical             applications. Not only can they be delivered by different types of             aircraft, but rockets and guided missiles of many sizes can now             carry nuclear warheads and can be launched from the ground, the air,             or underwater. Large rockets can carry multiple warheads for             delivery to separate targets.

The Atom Bomb
The atomic bomb works by a physical phenomenon known as fission . In this case, particles, specifically nuclei, are split and great amounts of energy are released. This energy is expelled explosively and violently in the atomic bomb. The massive power behind the reaction in an atomic bomb arises from the forces that hold the atom together called the strong nuclear force. 
The element used in atomic bombs is Uranium-235. Uranium's atoms are unusually large, and henceforth, it is hard for them to hold together firmly. This makes Uranium-235 an exceptional candidate for nuclear fission. Uranium is a heavy metal and has many more neutrons than protons. This does not enhance their capacity to split, but it does have an important bearing on their capacity to facilitate an explosion.
Uranium is not the only material used for making atomic bombs. Another material is the element Plutonium, in its isotope Pu-239. However, Plutonium will not start a fast chain reaction by itself. The material is not fissionable in and of itself, but may act as a catalyst to the greater reaction. The bomb basically works with a detonating head starting off the explosive chain reaction.
The Chain Reaction
When a uranium or other suitable nucleus fissions, it breaks up             into a pair of nuclear fragments and releases energy. At the same             time, the nucleus emits very quickly a number of fast neutrons, the             same type of particle that initiated the fission of the uranium             nucleus. This makes it possible to achieve a self-sustaining series             of nuclear fissions; the neutrons that are emitted in fission             produce a chain reaction, with continuous release of energy.
Fission of uranium 235 nucleus. 
When a U-235 atom splits, it gives off energy in the form of heat and Gamma radiation, which is the most powerful form of radioactivity and the most lethal. When this reaction occurs, the split atom will also give off two or three of its "spare" neutrons, which are not needed to make either of the parts after splitting. These spare neutrons fly out with sufficient force to split other atoms they come in contact with. In theory, it is necessary to split only one U-235 atom, and the neutrons from this will split other atoms, which will split more...so on and so forth. This progression does not take place arithmetically, but geometrically. All of this will happen within a millionth of a second.
Critical Mass
A small sphere of pure fissile material, such as uranium-235,             about the size of a golf ball, would not sustain a chain reaction.             Too many neutrons escape through the surface area, which is             relatively large compared with its volume, and thus are lost to the             chain reaction. In a mass of uranium-235 about the size of a             baseball, however, the number of neutrons lost through the surface             is compensated for by the neutrons generated in additional fissions             taking place within the sphere. The minimum amount of fissile             material (of a given shape) required to maintain the chain reaction             is known as the critical mass. Increasing the size of the sphere             produces a supercritical assembly, in which the successive             generations of fissions increase very rapidly, leading to a possible             explosion as a result of the extremely rapid release of a large             amount of energy. 
In an atomic bomb, therefore, a mass of fissile             material greater than the critical mass must be assembled             instantaneously and held together for about a millionth of a second             to permit the chain reaction to propagate before the bomb explodes.             A heavy material, called a tamper, surrounds the fissile mass and             prevents its premature disruption. The tamper also reduces the             number of neutrons that escape.
If every atom in 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) of uranium were to split, the             energy produced would equal the explosive power of 9.9 kilotons of             TNT. In this hypothetical case, the efficiency of the process would             be 100 percent. In the first A-bomb tests, this kind of efficiency             was not approached. Moreover, a 0.5-kg (1.1-lb) mass is too small             for a critical assembly.
Detonation of Atomic Bombs
Various systems have been devised to detonate the atomic bomb.             The simplest system is the gun-type weapon, in which a projectile             made of fissile material is fired at a target of the same material             so that the two weld together into a supercritical assembly. The             atomic bomb exploded by the United States over Hiroshima, Japan, on             August 6, 1945, was a gun-type weapon. It had the energy of anywhere             between 12.5 and 15 kilotons of TNT. Three days later the United             States dropped a second atomic bomb over Nagasaki, Japan, with the             energy equivalent of about 20 kilotons of TNT.
On August 6, 1945, an American B-29 bomber named the                     Enola Gay, dropped atomic bomb on Hiroshima. 
The U-235 gun-type bomb, named Little Boy, exploded at                     8:16:02 a.m. In an instant 140,000 people were killed and                     100,000 more were seriously injured.
A more complex method, known as implosion, is used in a spherically             shaped weapon. The outer part of the sphere consists of a layer of             closely fitted and specially shaped devices, called lenses,             consisting of high explosive and designed to concentrate the blast             toward the center of the bomb. Each segment of the high explosive is             equipped with a detonator, which in turn is wired to all other             segments. An electrical impulse explodes all the chunks of high             explosive simultaneously, resulting in a detonation wave that             converges toward the core of the weapon. At the core is a sphere of             fissile material, which is compressed by the powerful, inwardly             directed pressure, or implosion. The density of the metal is             increased, and a supercritical assembly is produced. 
The Alamogordo             test bomb, as well as the one dropped by the United States on             Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, were of the implosion type. Each             was equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT.
On August 9, 1945, the American B-29                     bomber, Bock's Car dropped Fat Man, a plutonium                     implosion-type bomb on Nagasaki. 
Of the 286,00 people living in Nagasaki at the time of                     the blast, 74,000 were killed and another 75,000 sustained                     severe injuries.
Regardless of the method used to attain a supercritical assembly,             the chain reaction proceeds for about a millionth of a second,             liberating vast amounts of heat energy. The extremely fast release             of a very large amount of energy in a relatively small volume causes             the temperature to rise to tens of millions of degrees. The             resulting rapid expansion and vaporization of the bomb material             causes a powerful explosion.
The Hydrogen Bomb
The Hydrogen bomb works on a different physical principle known as nuclear fusion . In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms join together, or fuse to form a heavier             nucleus (specifically, nuclei of the isotopes of hydrogen combine to form             a heavier helium nucleus). This happens only under very hot conditions. The explosion of an atomic bomb attached to a hydrogen bomb provides the heat to start fusion. 
Fusion releases energy due to the overall loss in mass. The total of the masses of the particles which go into a fusion reaction is bigger than the total of  the masses of the particles which come out.  The "mass difference" takes the form of energy. 
The hydrogen bomb is thousands of times more powerful than an atomic bomb. There have not been any hydrogen bombs used in warfare, however there have been hydrogen bomb tests. Most of these tests are done underwater due to risk of destruction. 
The H-bomb is extremely powerful.  A common hydrogen bomb has the power of up to 10 megatons. This atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan which killed over 140,000 people had the power of 13 kilotons. All the explosions in World War II totaled "only" 2 megatons - 20%  of the power of ONE common hydrogen bomb.
Thermonuclear Tests
On             November 1, 1952, a full-scale, successful experiment was conducted             by the United States with a fusion-type device. This test, called Mike,             which was part of Operation Ivy, produced an explosion with power             equivalent to several million tons of TNT (that is, several             megatons). 
The first U.S. hydrogen bomb test, Mike, is                     shown in the Pacific at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands,                     November 1, 1952.

The Soviet Union detonated a thermonuclear weapon             on August 12, 1953 at the Semipalatinsk test range. Up to 400 kt             yield.
On March 1, 1954, the United States             exploded a fusion bomb with a power of 15 megatons. It created a             glowing fireball, more than 4.8 km (more than 3 mi) in diameter, and             a huge mushroom cloud, which quickly rose into the stratosphere.
The March 1954 explosion led to worldwide recognition of the nature             of radioactive fallout. The fallout of radioactive debris from the             huge bomb cloud also revealed much about the nature of the             thermonuclear bomb. Had the bomb been a weapon consisting of an             A-bomb trigger and a core of hydrogen isotopes, the only persistent             radioactivity from the explosion would have been the result of the             fission debris from the trigger and from the radioactivity induced             by neutrons in coral and seawater. Some of the radioactive debris,             however, fell on the Lucky Dragon, a Japanese vessel engaged in tuna             fishing about 160 km (about 100 mi) from the test site. This             radioactive dust was later analyzed by Japanese scientists. The             results demonstrated that the bomb that dusted the Lucky Dragon with             fallout was more than just an H-bomb.

Fission-Fusion-Fission Bomb 
The thermonuclear bomb exploded in 1954 was a three-stage weapon.             The first stage consisted of a big A-bomb, which acted as a trigger.             The second stage was the H-bomb phase resulting from the fusion of             deuterium and tritium within the bomb. In the process helium and             high-energy neutrons were formed. The third stage resulted from the             impact of these high-speed neutrons on the outer jacket of the bomb,             which consisted of natural uranium, or uranium-238. No chain             reaction was produced, but the fusion neutrons had sufficient energy             to cause fission of the uranium nuclei and thus added to the             explosive yield and also to the radioactivity of the bomb residues.
The Neutron Bomb - Clean H-Bomb
On the average, about 50 percent of the power of an H-bomb             results from thermonuclear-fusion reactions and the other 50 percent             from fission that occurs in the A-bomb trigger and in the uranium             jacket. A clean H-bomb is defined as one in which a significantly             smaller proportion than 50 percent of the energy arises from             fission. Because fusion does not produce any radioactive products             directly, the fallout from a clean weapon is less than that from a             normal or average H-bomb of the same total power. If an H-bomb were             made with no uranium jacket but with a fission trigger, it would be             relatively clean. Perhaps as little as 5 percent of the total             explosive force might result from fission; the weapon would thus be             95 percent clean. The enhanced-radiation fusion bomb, also called             the neutron bomb, which has been tested by the United States and             other nuclear powers, does not release long-lasting radioactive             fission products. However, the large number of neutrons released in             thermonuclear reactions is known to induce radioactivity in             materials, especially earth and water, within a relatively small             area around the explosion. 
Thus the neutron bomb is considered a             tactical weapon because it can do serious damage on the battlefield,             penetrating tanks and other armored vehicles and causing death or             serious injury to exposed individuals, without producing the             radioactive fallout that endangers people or structures miles away.
Effects of Nuclear Weapons
Nuclear             Explosions produce both immediate and delayed destructive             effects. Blast, thermal radiation, prompt ionizing radiation are produced and cause significant destruction within seconds or minutes             of a nuclear detonation. The delayed effects, such as radioactive             fallout and other possible environmental effects, inflict damage             over an extended period ranging from hours to years.
Destruction of a                     military target by a nuclear fission weapon is comprehended                     mainly by the effects of a powerful blast wave in air but                     the more distant military consequences of a nuclear                     explosion can be significantly augmented by the thermal                     (heat) radiations emitted by the fireball that emerges from                     the isothermal sphere. Furthermore, accurate anticipation of                     the thermal characteristics and physical behavior of an                     isothermal sphere as it endures and rises above a nuclear                     explosion can be useful as a basis to predict the military                     and environmental effects of radioactive fallout since most                     of the dangerous fission byproducts of an atomic bomb                     detonation are concentrated in the isothermal sphere.
The effects of nuclear weapons were carefully observed, both             after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and after many test             explosions in the 1950s and early 1960s. The basic effects of             nuclear explosion are:
