Solar XUV is identified as Bharat Radiation emission from radioisotopes produced by uranium fission

Uranium fission seems to take simultaneously at several places on the core of the Sun. The site of fission appears as Sun spot to a distance through satellites. During solar maximum number of these sun spots would be more and the number gradually falls during waning period until no spots are seen at solar minimum during 11 year solar cycle. Notably, the UV, VIS, and NIR radiations also result from fission fragments (radioisotopes) reaching the Earth, by Padmanabha Rao Effect. The raise in NIR radiation caused by hard γ and β emissions from long lived fission products such as 90Sr + 90Y may have to be taken into consideration in regards to warming the Earth's atmosphere. Besides the current wisdom that fusion powers Sun light, this alternative approach helps to examine whether Padmanabha Rao Effect really causes UV dominant Sun light from radioisotopes, produced by Uranium fission.
Measurements of certain wavelengths in solar spectrum reported since 1960s where gap is supposed to exist are now identified as Bharat wavelengths caused by γ, β or XRF energy, confirming solar Bharat wavelengths and EUV originate from radioisotopes produced by Uranium fission.
Solar tritium supports the view on uranium fission in Sun.
Solar neutrons support the view on Uranium fission taking place in Sun
