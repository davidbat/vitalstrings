The                           Purpose of  this Information
This information is                         being provided to you in order to prepare you to make                         decisions about your own health care. If you should ultimately                         decide that surgery is the best treatment option for                         you, this section will help you understand what happens                         during an anterior cervical discectomy and will                         help you prepare for your role in the healing and recovery                         process. Read it thoroughly and answer the questions before making                       your final decision about your treatment options.
The Health Care Team's Role
The duty of your health                         care team is to:
evaluate your condition;
present the various treatment options;
offer a specific treatment recommendation;
provide you with the information you need to make                           a decision; and then
support you in the decision you make.
The                           Patient's Responsibilities
You are the only one                           who can decide to have surgery. It is important                           that you take ownership of this decision, recognizing                           the limitations your particular physical condition                           places on the potential success of each of the treatment                           options.
If you choose to have surgery, your                         physical condition and your mental attitude will determine                         your body's ability to heal. You must approach your surgery                         with confidence, a positive attitude, and a thorough                         understanding of the anticipated outcome. You should                         have realistic goals - and work steadily to achieve those goals.
The decision to have or not to have                         surgery includes weighing the risks and benefits involved. You will                         make the final decision, so ask questions about                         anything you do not understand.
Since medical                             care is tailored to each person's needs and differences,                             not all information presented here will apply to                             the patient's treatment or its outcome. Seek the                             advice of your physician and other members of the                             health care team for specific information about the                       patient's medical condition.
Anatomy                           of the Back
The spinal column,                         or backbone, consists of 33 bones (vertebrae) and can                         be divided into five segments (Fig. 1A). The uppermost                         24 vertebrae are separated from one another by fibrous                         cartilage pads, called intervertebral discs (Fig.                         1B), which allow the spine to bend and act as shock                         absorbers during activity. In the lowest part of the                         spine, the vertebrae are naturally fused to form the                       sacrum and the coccyx (tail bone).
 
Protruding from the                         back of each block-like vertebral body is an arch of                         bone that helps to form the large, vertical spinal                         canal, which surrounds the spinal cord and nerve                         bundles (Fig. 1C, below). A fluid-filled protective                         membrane, the dura, covers the contents of the                         spinal canal from where the cord begins at the base of                         the brain to where it ends (in a bundle of nerve fibers                       known as the cauda equina).
 
A                         pair of spinal nerves branches at each vertebral level                         (one to the left and one to the right), providing sensation                         and movement to all parts of the body. Three large bone processes arise                         from the vertebrae's arch-one to each side (transverse)                         and one straight toward the back of the body (spinous).                         Strong ligaments and muscles attached to the vertebrae                         both support the spine and further protect the delicate                       spinal cord and nerves inside.
Anterior                           Cervical Discectomy
What is it?
Anterior cervical discectomy is an operation                           performed on the upper spine to relieve pressure on one                           or more nerve roots, or on the spinal cord. The procedure                           is explained by the words anterior (front), cervical                           (neck), and discectomy (cutting out the disc).
Why is it done?
Neck and arm pain, among other symptoms,                         may occur when an intervertebral disc herniates.                         This happens, either suddenly with injury or slowly over                         time, when some of the disc's jelly-like center (the                         nucleus pulposus) bulges or ruptures through its tough,                         fibrous outer ring (the annulus fibrosus) and presses                         on a nerve (Fig 1C, above).
When a disc ruptures                         in the cervical spine, it puts pressure on one or more                         nerve roots (often called nerve root compression) or                         on the spinal cord, as seen in (Figure 2). This                         pressure causes symptoms in the neck, arms, and even legs. Further pressure may be caused by rough edges of                         bone, called bone spurs, that naturally build                       up around some herniated discs.
In                         this operation, the cervical spine is reached through                         a small incision in the front of your neck. After the                         soft tissues of the neck are separated, the intervertebral                         disc and bone spurs are removed. The space left between                         the vertebrae may be left open or filled with a small                         piece of bone. In time the vertebrae may fuse, or join                         together.
If used,                         the pre-formed bone graft may be obtained from a bone                         bank. It will not be rejected by your body, because it                         is avascular (contains no blood cells). In some circumstances,                         or if your surgeon prefers, the bone graft might instead                         be removed from your own hip through a second incision.
What                           happens afterwards?
Successful recovery from anterior cervical                         discectomy requires that you approach the operation and                         recovery with confidence based on a thorough understanding                         of each process. Your surgeon has the training and expertise                         to correct physical defects by performing the operation;                         he and the rest of the health care team will support                         your body's efforts to heal its damaged tissues. Full                         recovery will also depend on you having a strong, positive                         attitude, setting small, realistic goals for improvement,                         and working steadily to accomplish each goal.
