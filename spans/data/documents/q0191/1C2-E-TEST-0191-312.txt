I've been meaning to look up the difference between sympathy and empathy for a while now, but apparently there isn't one. Answers.com lists empathy as a synonym for sympathy and vice versa.
If you ask Google , you'll most likely come across a site that contradicts itself when trying to point out the difference:
Empathy is entering into another's feelings. Sympathy is having a feeling together with someone.
...
Sympathy is when you feel bad for someone else. Empathy is when you feel bad with someone else.
Pay attention to the word "with" in those attempted explanations and you'll see the contradiction.
After finally looking into the matter, I've come to the conclusion that there really isn't any difference.  That's a good thing, though â€“ less work for my brain to do when coming up with the right words to say.
If you have your own idea of the difference between the two words, I'd love to hear.
