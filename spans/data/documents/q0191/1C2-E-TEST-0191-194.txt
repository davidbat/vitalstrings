Ameoba reproduces through binary fisiion (simply breaks into two cells during celldivision).
In Leishmania binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to a whip-like structure at one end of the cell.
Plasmodium repruduces through multiple fission( divides into many daughtercells during cell division.)
