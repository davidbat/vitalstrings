Hydro Energy
     Water, being a vital resource for all living beings, is also an important source of energy. Hydropower supplies 6% of the world's energy needs. Moving water is highly energized. A hand held into a fast flowing stream can feel the pressure of water trying to push the hand along.
Tidal Power
     The tides are formed due to the gravitational force of attraction between the earth, sun and moon. During high tides sea water is trapped in a reservoir, and released later to drive turbines, which in turn produces electricity. The block diagram given below illustrates the transformation of energy.
Hydroelectric Power Plants
     The electricity produced from flowing water is called Hydroelectric power. The world's first hydroelectric power plant was set up in 1882 in Wisconsin USA. It had a very small output, supplying power only for about 250 light bulbs. But from this small start the production of hydroelectricity has grown steadily, and today 6% of the world's need is met with hydroelectricity.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Hydroelectric Power Plants
     The demand for electricity varies at different times of a year. One big disadvantage is that the wind, waves and tides do not occur at all time and hence cannot guarantee steady production of electricity. Hydroelectric power stations can solve this problem. When the demand is low, excess power generated from other stations can be used to pump water back up into the high reservoir.
