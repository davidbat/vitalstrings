So you're going to ignore the comparison to the sun.  Ok but I won't.  The suns fusion reaction has no A bomb element yet if the gravity of the sun were to "go away" then the sun will nova.  I was simply equating the force of the fission reaction in a hydrogen bomb to the magnetic force of a fusion reactor to the gravitational force of the sun.  Remove the force and boom.
Compare? magnetic containment to gravitational containment, there are differences, sorta major differences

In the case of a hydrogen bomb the fission reaction produces the force required to sustain a fusion reaction where the fusion reaction is short lived since the fuel is completely converted before the outer walls of the bomb are even damaged.  Yet with the fuel completely spent the explosive force generated by the reaction remains and adds to the force of the fission reaction but not before over powering the opposing force from the fission reaction that got the fusion reaction going in the first place.
There was no opposing force from the fission re-action that got the Fusion reaction going as the fission reaction is a pulse that combines it's explosive force with the explosive force of the Fusion reaction's explosive force...

#1) Just because the fusion reaction stops doesn't mean the explosive force generated will fizzle out of existence. #2) That force still has to be relieved and with the containing force removed then there is nothing to stop the explosive force from exerting itself outward.
#1) It does in magnetic field containment #2) No because that force is generated by the magnetic filed and when that field collapses the force is gone, the fusion ceases .....cold
QUOTE (Precursor562+May 1 2007, 06:29 PM)
In the case of a fusion reactor the idea is to feed the fuel (deuterium and tritium) into the reactor where magnetic forces start, sustain and contain the fusion reaction where the exhaust (helium) is extracted along with radiation.  The fusion reaction in the reactor (as with in the sun or a hydrogen bomb) will produce explosive forces that will be contained by the magnetic fields.  Without those fields the explosive forces are released violently.
Not without the magnetic fields to contain them as they then cease to continue to occur, flat.
QUOTE (Precursor562+May 1 2007, 06:29 PM)
It's the same as a nuclear power plant.  The fission reaction taking place is the same as the one that takes place in a fission bomb.  The difference is control.  The bomb has no control and so the energy is released as an explosion.  In a nuclear power plant the energy is released gradually under control.  Lose the control and boom.  Well with a fusion reactor you have the same thing.  It's the same process that is found in a fusion bomb but is controlled.  Lose that control and boom.
No it is not the same as a Nuclear power plant, Chernobyl did not go BOOM! it went DRIP!

In this case they are very much the same.  The sun's gravity produces an inward force from every direction.  In a fusion reactor the magnetic field must do the same thing.  The idea with a fusion reactor is to have something that closely resembles a particle accelerator.  The deuterium/tritium mixture is put in and heated to the point of ionization (plasma).  This is just to allow the magnetic field to manipulate the gas.  The field(s) will manipulate it in such a way to cause it to flow in an elliptical path much like the particles in a particle accelerator.  This allows the gas to become uniform within the field.  The field (or perhaps a separate one) will produce the force much like that of gravity which will "squeeze" the gas mixture by applying an equal magnetic (as opposed to gravitational like the sun) force to the stream causing the hydrogen to fuse.  Now this will produce a tremendous amount of energy much like the energy found in the sun but on a smaller scale.  Much like the sun if the field fails the reaction doesn't instantly stop.  Once again there is a delay.  The field that causes the fusion to take place also controls the release of energy.  Without the control the release of energy is very rapid.  It's like the difference between a capacitor losing its charger across a resistor and one that loses its load through a direct contact.
On average or rather as a whole, gravity and magnetism differ in many way.  In some ways they share the same qualities.  It is these qualities that are being utilized and so within this application both the magnetic field of the reactor and the gravity of the sun are very much the same.

Next you'll tell me that the fuel of a fission device is not completely consumed prior to the container being consumed.
Fission device.  Very simple concept where shaped charges (in the implosion method) located all around the plutonium core are detonated at the same time.  The produces tremendous pressure inward causing the plutonium to increase in density.  The atoms now being closer together will allow the already fission reaction to spike in rate.  The fissionable material decays in microseconds instead of years releasing energy at a very fast rate.  Hence boom.  In a reactor the rate of decay is sped up but not as fast as in the bomb.  So when a nuclear power plant melts down it quite literally melts down.  Heat being the product of the decay increases can cause the temperature to rise to high for the cooling process to compensate.  The protective containment around the core can fail where radiation is released into the coolant and when that coolant is cycled the radiation escapes.  Hence no boom but drip instead.  What should happen is that fail safes should insert control rods all the way to slow the reaction.  The coolant is stopped and when the walls of the core melt they should (if working correctly) seal the core preventing the escape of radiation.
Fusion device.  Also a simple concept where you have a container of tritium (liquid) next to a fission (implosion) device.  The fission device goes off where the explosive force spreads out in all directions.  One of these directions is against the side of the container.  This tremendous force put pressure against the tritium causing it to fuse.  When the tritium fuses it too will release energy explosively.  This energy will be released in all directions.  One of these directions is opposite the direction of the force from the fission device.  Now needless to say that the force of the fusion reaction is stronger than the force from the fission reaction and will push it back the other way.  Where the over all force of the fusion reaction is considerably stronger than the fission reaction you simply end up with the fission reaction adding to the force of the fusion reaction.
Now in a fusion reactor you have the hydrogen fusing much like the hydrogen in the sun.  Both are plasma states and both fuse due to an inward pressure where the reactor is magnetic and the sun is gravitational.  This is the difference between a fission reactor and a fusion reactor.  Where if the containment on the fission reactor fails you get a radiation leak but if the fail safe fails then you get critical mass.  Well with a fusion reactor the containment field is also the fail safe.
What it comes down to is the difference on how the two reactors work.  A fusion reactor works very much like the sun just on a smaller scale.  A fission reactor is nothing like that of the sun.  Gravity fails on the sun and the sun explodes.  Same for the fusion reactor where you are essentially creating a miniature sun in a tube so if the magnetic fields (that simulate the same forces produced gravitationally with the sun) were to fail you get a miniature nova.  If containment fails on a fission reactor you get a leak except if the fail safe fails then you get critical mass.

It does in magnetic field containment
Here's the problem.  If the fusion were to stop but the fields were to remain then yes you force will fizzle out.  The problem is that the fusion stops because the fields are not remaining.  They are failing and so the force that would stay contained by the magnetic field will release in an explosion.

No because that force is generated by the magnetic filed and when that field collapses the force is gone, the fusion ceases .....cold
So I guess if the sun's gravity were to collapse then the sun would just fade away.  Fizzle out.  Also fusion bombs wouldn't work either.  After all the fusion reaction can only go as long as there is fuel and with the fuel consumed in a nanosecond then the force would just fizzle out.  All you would get is the 5kt explosion from the fission initiator and not the 30kt explosion from the fusion reaction.

Chernobyl was a loss of containment.  Where containment is only one type of control in a fission reactor.

Once again there is a difference between a fission reactor and a fusion reactor.

This seems to imply that by hydrogen you are referring to protium and that unless you separate the neutrons from the proton in tritium and deuterium they will not fission back into protium.  They will where the tritium will give up a neutron (the nucleus is fissioning) to become deuterium and deuterium will fission (decay) to become protium.
QUOTE

I see now that you were talking about helium.  Once the helium with neutrons is formed then yes it will not fission back into hydrogen isotopes.  I have stated that already which is way I believed you were talking about hydrogen isotopes.  However in the formation of the deuterium and tritium during the fusion process you end up with an isotope of helium having the atomic number of two meaning two protons.  Two protons is all you need in the nucleus to have a helium nucleus.  The number of neutrons will only give you different isotopes of the same element.  Such is basic chemistry.  So when two protium nuclei come together they form He-2 before one of the protons decays to become a neutron.  He-2 is highly unstable and would be more likely to fission back into protium nuclei but it can't because the forces that cause the protium to combine in the first place is still active and so the unstable He-2 must become stable by some other means and the only option is for one of the protons to decay into a neutron.
When two tritium nuclei come together they will form He-6 where He-6 is highly unstable much like He-2 but unlike He-2 if the force that initiated the fusion were to vanish at the precise moment of fusion the He-6 will not fission back because unlike the He-2 there is an easier way for the He-6 to become stable.  By giving up two of the neutrons resulting in a stable He-4.
It sorta follows the path of least resistance where it is easier for a nucleus to give up a neutron than it is to give up a proton.  It's easier for a nucleus to give up a proton then for a proton to decay into a neutron.  All just to become more stable.

Sorry but (I) have yet to read your long and rambling post, when fusion is initiated in a magnetic ring, the magnets are what provide the pressure required to initiate the reaction.
The heat is either laser added or RF addition so remove either of those two very needed components (Pressure and temperature) and, in absence of the TREMENDOUS AMOUNT more energy that gravity would be containing, stopping them causes only the reaction to cease.
Neutron Formation absorbs a tiny little bit of energy.

This is where you fail to understand.  Nuclear fusion is an exothermic reaction.  It's like applying a flame to a piece of paper.  Once the paper begins to burn then you don't need the flame any longer.  The reaction will generate its own heat.  Now the heating of the gas is just to reach an ionized state where the magnetic field can have influence on the gas.  The gravity of the sun is different where gravity can have an effect on a gas without the gas being in an ionized state.  However the fusion reaction in the sun produces enough heat to turn the gas into a plasma state anyway.  So in the reactor once the gas reaches an ionized state and the magnetic field applies the force to cause fusion to take place you no longer need to apply heat from an external source.  It generates its own heat to maintain the ionized state plus extra that can be used to convert water to steam and run the steam through turbines.  Once again if you needed to constantly apply both heat and pressure then you could never use it as an energy source.  H-bombs would also not work.
To have the gas flowing in a stream allows the gas to become uniform within the device and allows the field to act uniformly on the gas.  The gas can not touch the walls of the tube it is in or else the walls will corrode.  Plasma is very corrosive.
So what you end up with is a miniature sun in the shape of a loop.  Magnetic fields are used in place of gravity where the gas will not have enough mass to produce the necessary gravitational force to sustain and contain a reaction.  Good thing too.
Dropping the magnetic field on the reactor is the same as dropping the gravity of the sun.

Any fusion reaction will release energy.  The sun is massive and so if the gravity were to fail the sun would explode big.
What a nuclear fusion reactor is doing is creating the sun on a much smaller scale.  The sun is hydrogen plasma fusing to become helium plasma.  In the fusion reactor you have hydrogen plasma fusing to become helium plasma.  Exact same process just on a smaller scale.  The magnetic field of the reactor operates in the same way gravity operates with the sun.  So if you believe that the sun will nova if the gravity were to fail then you must also believe the reactor will explode if the magnetic field fails.
It's an equivalent external force causing the exact same process to take place generating the exact same kind of radiation (energy).  The only difference is scale.
What I have quoted there (what you have said) is a contradiction.  Since the process is the same (just scaled differently) then the same occurs in both so to rewrite what I have quoted without contradiction you get one of two ways.
1) "So when the Sun's gravity fails the HUGE amount of heat (Energy) that that gravity was also keeping (somewhat - by process) contained >> THEN EXPLODES MASSIVELY... in a Fusion reactor, when the magnetic fields fail the not so huge (compared to the sun but still quite large) amount of heat (Energy) that that magnetic field was also keeping (somewhat - by process) contained >> THEN EXPLODES AS WELL JUST AS IT DID WITH THE SUN."
The scale of the explosion would be different, that's all.  So the sun would wipe out the entire solar system and then some.  A power plant sized reactor would wipe out an area with a 5 mile radius.
The other way is...
2) "So when the Sun's gravity fails the reaction STOPS as there is no longer any pressure and the amount of heat that is there is TOO TINY TO CAUSE ANY REAL KIND OF EXPLOSION so only the inner planets and the asteroid belt would be destroyed...so in a Fusion reactor, when the magnetic fields fails the reactions STOPS as there is no longer any pressure and the amount of heat that is there is TOO TINY TO CAUSE ANY REAL KIND OF EXPLOSION"

As you can see, the two protium nuclei come together then one of the protons decays to become a neutron with the release of energy.  This process is a bit different than the one that would be found in a fusion reactor although it could be done in a fusion reactor.
Where here you have two protium come together then one proton decays to become a neutron.  This leaves you with deuterium.  The deuterium fuses with a protium to form an isotope of helium (He-3).  Two He-3 fuse to form an isotope of beryllium (Be-6) where two protons are released leaving you with He-4.
The process that will most likely be used is the fusion of deuterium/tritium where deuterium (H-2) will fuse with tritium (H-3) to form helium (He-5) where the isotope is unstable and will give up a neutron to form He-4.  A stable isotope of helium.

BTW NOT enough energy in a fusion reactors activity to cause any explosions as, as soon as the magnetic field drops-stops, the reactions stop! If in doubt of that, simply go look up the repulsive energies at work between two protons as that is what they will immediately do, repulse from (near) each other, it is the strong force, so it is a very short distance of repulsion, NO EXPLOSION!!
NONE!
The Sun is a Massive amount of contained-constrained energy, the constraint upon it is gravity, take away the fusion completely, (First) then take away the gravity and you will then have a Massively Huge explosion Because of the HEAT!

O.K. Smart guy, DO Fusion to Oxygen for me...right now!
Once He-4 has been established, two He-4 fuse to form Be-8 where Be-8 is extremely unstable and will fission back into He-4 but since the forces that cause the fusion to take place remain then Be-8 will fuse with another He-4 to form C-12.  The C-12 then fuses with another He-4 to get O-16.

BTW NOT enough energy in a fusion reactors activity to cause any explosions as, as soon as the magnetic field drops-stops, the reactions stop! If in doubt of that, simply go look up the repulsive energies at work between two protons as that is what they will immediately do, repulse from (near) each other, it is the strong force, so it is a very short distance of repulsion, NO EXPLOSION!!
NONE!
The Sun is a Massive amount of contained-constrained energy, the constraint upon it is gravity, take away the fusion completely, (First) then take away the gravity and you will then have a Massively Huge explosion Because of the HEAT! (A repulsing Force in atomic physics) Contained amongst all of that MATTER!
You can't say one will explode and not the other.  We are talking about the exact same gases in the exact same state undergoing the exact same process by an equivalent external force.  Remove the external force and the exact same thing will happen.  The only difference is the scale.  The sun is big so the explosion is big, where the reactor is small and the explosion is small.

Uhhmmm one of your quotes says TRANSMUTATED, that one is Correct, the one that says DECAYS - IS WRONG
Two protons fusing? you mean that they are overcoming the strong force and sticking together without any other force binding them....because if you are ....wrong again!
Try it this way, proton proton chains (ever heard of that?) when two protons come close enough in a plasma, they almost touch (They are not allowed to EVER Touch) such that they generate a slight cool-cold (relative to where it is occurring) spot in the plasma, the energy level of the cool spot is equivalent to the energy of an electron, that (the electron) jumps into one of the protons and it becomes a neutron.
Proceed from there.
BTW your Ascension to O is wrong as it is an internally ordered structuring that is occurring, simply adding (Alpha) particle numbers (Nuclei) is not how it goes.
EDIT BTW Again, an H bomb is gravitationally powered by the Fission Bomb that explodes it so scale does matter, force at use matters even more, the reactor has no force of such nature at work in it, so NO explosion

Protium has an atomic mass of
1.007822u
Deuterium has an atomic mass of
2.014102u
But 1.007822u * 2 = 2.015644
Deuterium is 0.001542u less than the combined protium which means that when the two protium fuse to form deuterium there is a release of mass in the form of energy.  This is one of the fundamentals of fusion.  An exothermic reactor where the mass of the product is less than the sum of the two masses being fused.
Once again if it was the other way it would be an endothermic reaction.
So you fail chemistry and physics.

Don't know where you got that garbage but you don't need a "gravity that pulses" to generate the explosion in an H-bomb.  All that is needed is heat and pressure.  Can the fission bomb create the heat needed?  Absolutely.
In the sun Gravity provided the pressures.  Compress a gas and you get heat so in the case of the sun all that is necessary is gravity.  Although a nebula (where stars are born) already contains gases in a plasma state but the hydrogen doesn't need to be in a plasma state to be affected by gravity.
In the reactor in is electromagnetic fields that provide the pressure.  These fields will not act upon the hydrogen gas unless it is ionized as it is in a plasma state.  The fields then simulate gravity.  The hydrogen begins to fuse releasing energy with heat being one of the major forms.  This heat is enough to maintain a plasma state so any external heat that has been used to heat the hydrogen gas to a plasma at the beginning is no longer necessary.
In the bomb it is the heat and pressure of a fission device that causes the liquid hydrogen to fuse.  When the hydrogen fuses, tremendous energy is released (much more than what is released from the fission device).  If the fusion process needed gravity then fusion bombs would not operate in space beyond the influence of the Earth's gravity.  Yet multiple H-bombs have been detonated in space at various distances from the Earth.  They operated successfully and normally under the various conditions.

So (I) wrote this up, before (I) read your last post....
So lets try it this way, an A Priori argument, Assume that the Neutron Is the gravitational Particle.
So When two Protons approach each other, the Field effects of the proton (Consider a sorta hard energetic field as 3D depth Shell) cause the rising of a Vortex of energy in the Plasma Field between the two outer Shell faces (Perpendicular to the Nearest Point to Point of the Shell surfaces) that, as the protons are repulsive of each other, the Face of the Protons' field shell will project suddenly with a columnar spout of energy, as to make the short sharp hard press away from the other proton, that columnar energy voids the Vortex of Center energy (a Cold Spot) and that causes the 'Vortical Field effect' to collapse upon the Spout, which is Now getting struck by the energy spout of the other proton (as one initiated the action with the other following, duplicating the same effect, in an exceedingly short time difference) such that it slightly Mushrooms the Spout head capturing the Energy Vortex and slamming it into the Protons Energetic Field Shell with enough force to cause it to penetrate it.
This is the transmutation of a Proton into a Neutron, once it Becomes a Neutron it is Now the Nuclear Candle, if it can remain stable....
Try to recall that it is thought to be a Neutron Star that collapses into a Black Hole, the Second and First greatest Gravitational Powerhouses known to exist.
Where does the Heat come from? as (I) said the Neutron is the gravitational Candle, it is the Item that Generates an Ambient Energy Pressure (AEP) field and is employing a gravitational Cyclic to recycle energy as to establish an area of Temperature or Ambient available energy, OH yes, and you Have increased the gravitational Pull Upon All of the Mass that surrounds it, by one more Neutron.
BTW the Gravitational Particle is (in your best 'Arnie' Voice) "The Moderator"
(I)'ll be back for some more after (I) examine what you have said...but my reference to the 'Pics' is that they are simply someones thougths drawn.

Mr. Robin Parsons
4th May 2007 - 05:32 PM
If we take the A Priori further, we look for the evidence that tells us that the Neutron is the Gravitational Particle, so we look at it's properties. remeber the ones about Neutron star and Black hole as they are Accessories to the evidence.
It is composed of An electron and a proton (Decomposition particles are Proton electron or anti-electron-Positron and neutrino energy, formerly known of as, or thought of as as Gamma radiation) we would know it is not unlike a tiny Earth, two poles - positive and negative - so we can infer that it is Magnetic. (There is proof)
They are known to exist in several species, Fast Neutrons, Slow Neutrons and Ultra Cold neutrons (UNC'S) with the UNC's experiencing almost complete reflectivity in a Magnetic bottle, and the de-compositional particles are known to be differentiated as to which, Positive (Positron) or negative (Electron) release, based upon the mass that it is releasing from, and the Overall charge state upon that mass.
So they are Thermal, and that is the force that opposes gravity - Heat, Expansion and contraction are the only two movements that an atom makes so, the expansive are heat energies and the Contractive are gravitational energy.
Neutrons experience no effects when passing through an in-homogeneous magnetic field, as they seem to be quite capable of ignoring magnetism...a potential problem in a Toroidal Fusion device inasmuch as if enough Neutrons are propagated and the amount of positive energy required to maintain their tug, diminishes enough, they could "act as one" and Pulse - gravitationally.
That is a point about gravity, and it's math. In gravitational math all additions add up to one as in, all of the Neutrons acting as gravitational Particles that are the comprising atoms that construct this planet, all act (together-sync) as One gravitational Device - body.
When a fission bomb explodes it first propagates neutrons, once the neutrons are spaced properly, the attempt to unite-bind as a gravitational Mass, they cannot sustain it though as there is no proper feed of Positive energy to sustain it - balance it, as such, so it Pulses instead, one good gravitational Bang and then it releases and out comes all of the heat that that pulse generated.
BTW did Physics and Chemistry (Bohr's atom) back in High School, that would have been when (I) was around 16 or 17 years of age...better then thirty years....
Being the particle of the gravitational Cyclic it would also be the one responsible for Atomic absorptions spectra, except for hydrogen as that one does it electromagnetically.
The neutrons, as gravitational Particles, are wave shifting particles, absorbing energy at one level and re-emitting it at another, higher, (Shifted) energy level.
You do not know how gravity works, then again why should you, no one has ever properly described it and it's Modus Operandi.
BTW Precursor562 Like your signature, demonstrates learning as a time effective skill, sorta how (I) passed Both of my parents in the Knowledge of physics when (I) was in my twenties, and they were both thirty years (+) my betters in age.

That makes absolutely no sense.  There is no "plasma field" between the two outer shell faces because the "plasma field" is comprised of the ionized gas.  What is between the individual nuclei of the ionized gas is space.  Space is not a plasma.  It can not ionize, it's comprised of nothing, literally.  As for energy released during the process.  What is released are particles and it is these particles that contain the energy in the form of velocity, spin, charge etc.

Ok a neutron star is names such because it's mass has increased its gravitational pull to prevent the escape of neutrons during the fusion process still taking place.  The star forms as a result of massive compression from the supernova that occurs where the center of the star doesn't play a factor in the explosion.  If the neutron star collects enough material over time adding to its mass then it will actually get smaller and smaller the more mass that is added until it finally develops into a black hole.
Now if you wish to think of gravity as a particle (as I do) then it is the graviton particle, not the neutron.  Where the graviton particle would be the smallest of particles.  Well, at least smaller than any other particle affected by gravity such as the photon.
It also make sense for gravity to be a particle.  After all you have the magnetic force which is EMR also called the photon.  You have the strong atomic force that is the gluon.  The weak force is comprised of the W and Z bosons.

Protium = One proton and no neutrons (without the electrons it is called a proton)
Deuterium = One proton and One neutron (hence the "Deu" meaning two as in two particles making up the nucleus)
Tritium = One proton and two neutrons (hence "Tri" meaning three as in three particles making up the nucleus)
As for existing in an ionized state. An element (and its isotopes) is defined by the nucleus.  A protium atom has one proton and no neutrons in the nucleus.  The orbiting electrons do not count.  You can have 1, 2, 3 or none as long as the nucleus is one proton and zero neutrons you have protium.
Now I have shown reference to various sites including wiki that all show a release of particles when the two protons come together.  After the release one of the protons is now a neutron.
One of the fundamental features of both the fission and fusion process is that after the process the resulting mass is less than the sum of the starting mass.  For fusion this includes the formation of deuterium from protium

Up, Charm, Top where each has a charge of +2/3
and is comprised of any two of the following....

A proton is comprised of any two of the first set and any one of the second set.  So that charge wise you get the following..
For a neutron;
For a proton
+2/3 + (+2/3) + (-1/3) = +1
Now an Up, Charm, Top have different masses where I have them in sequence of smallest mass to largest mass.  The same goes for Down, Strange and Bottom.
So you say that a proton has less mass than a neutron huh?  Well I say that depends entirely on the quarks they are comprised of.
If you have a proton comprised of two Tops and one Bottom it will have a greater mass than a neutron comprised of one Up and two Downs.
Now if I have a proton comprised of two Charm and one Down such a proton can decay where the Down will decay to become an Up and the two Charm can decay to become two Down.  Where one Up and two Down make up a neutron there you have a proton decaying to become a neutron.
What is happening in the pics is a proton comprised of one Up, one Charm and one down and has the Charm decay into a Down leaving you with a neutron comprised of one Up and two Down.  Where the neutron will have less mass than the proton.
What you are talking about is when the neutron is comprised of one Up and two Down and one the the Down decay into an Up.
The order of mass for the quarks from smallest to largest is as follows...
Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Bottom, Top.

OMG that is so wrong.  In a fission device the fuel is undergoing fission as a norm.  It's radio active as in releasing radiation.  How the bomb works is that the fuel is squeezed so its density increases.  One allows the fuel to fission as it does (non explosively) is the space between atoms.  By squeezing the fuel the atoms get closer together.  An over all increase in mass is the result hence the term "critical mass".  By bringing the atoms closer together the chain reaction that is already taking place speeds up to a point where the fuel is consumed (has undergone complete fission) in a matter of nanoseconds instead of millions of years.   It's a simple reaction where an atom splits and in the process releases neutrons.  Those neutrons contact neighboring nuclei causing them to split (whether they were about to naturally or not) where more neutrons are released and contact neighboring nuclei causing the process to continue until all the fissionable material is gone.
This has nothing to do with gravity.  It has to do with a combination of the weak force and the electro magnetic force (called the electroweak force) becoming stronger than the strong atomic force (often found in atoms that are unstable, where they are unstable because of this) and the atom will release particles or split out right or both.

Electrons do not contribute to the mass of an atom when dealing with the mass found on the Table of Elements.  Protium, deuterium, tritium are ALL hydrogen.  They are the names of the different isotopes.  Where an isotope depends on the number of neutrons found in the nucleus and nothing else.
This site (webelements) Atomic Weight of H = 1.00794 from the reference (I) made from WIKI previously, that is NOT the weight of One Proton....

Considering neutrons are not gravity particles then you are out to lunch.  Protons generate gravity as do electrons and neutrons. 
Prove that, or you owe Me Lunch, Big time Lunch!

That's the elementary school explanations.  They are really composed of quarks.  Both of them.  A neutron is comprised of one of the following three...
Uhmmm no it was in my University Text Book for Physics, they are the decomposition products of Neutron Decay.

So you say that a proton has less mass than a neutron huh?
So do the references.

OMG that is so wrong.  In a fission device the fuel is undergoing fission as a norm.  It's radio active as in releasing radiation.  How the bomb works is that the fuel is squeezed so its density increases.  One allows the fuel to fission as it does (non explosively) is the space between atoms.  By squeezing the fuel the atoms get closer together.  An over all increase in mass is the result hence the term "critical mass".  By bringing the atoms closer together the chain reaction that is already taking place speeds up to a point where the fuel is consumed (has undergone complete fission) in a matter of nanoseconds instead of millions of years.  It's a simple reaction where an atom splits and in the process releases neutrons.  Those neutrons contact neighboring nuclei causing them to split (whether they were about to naturally or not) where more neutrons are released and contact neighboring nuclei causing the process to continue until all the fissionable material is gone.
So lets try this, use a Slightly sub-critical mass and all it will do is burn, so all that is left is a very Hot piece of Metal, go simply slightly more over in the Neutrons availability (Supercritical Branching chain reaction mass) and it will, under exactly the exact same conditions EXPLODE MASSIVELY...so tell me why the Sudden Extreme change in energy output/result?
Me (I) say it is Because the Neutrons have acted as one and given a gravitational Pulse (Contraction) that causes all of the rest of the resultant energy to emerge.

This has nothing to do with gravity.  It has to do with a combination of the weak force and the electro magnetic force (called the electroweak force) becoming stronger than the strong atomic force (often found in atoms that are unstable, where they are unstable because of this) and the atom will release particles or split out right or both.
Or maybe because the gravity that was holding them together fell apart, but you don't know that....yet.....

Photons will interact with all three particles and not just the neutron.  I believe the primary particle is the electron where an electron will increase in energy level after absorbing a photon and decrease in energy level after releasing a photon.
Uhmm radio wave energy not just photons and photons interact with electrons Basically because they cannot penetrate the atoms shell structure.

You can try this too.... Proton Stability (Wiki)
QUOTE (Wikipedia(dot)org+)
The proton is observed to be stable. However, protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process of electron capture. This process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied.
The process is reversible: neutrons can convert back to protons through beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay.
Backs up what (I) have been saying relative to Neutron formation, composition and de-composition
And this page: Proton (WIKI) tells of a structuring of 2 u 1 d only.....
BTW your protium weight figure that you supplied is the weight of a Proton and an electron combined!
Keep trying.........
