Gillette Fusion ProGlide review
April 21, 2010 By Hans - the Shaving Detective 93 Comments
We have got our hands on the new Fusion ProGlide. Read our first impressions!
I have just tried the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide for the first time. It’s due to be released in the US on June 6, 2010. According to Gillette, the ProGlide should be much more comfortable than any of their previous models! Read on to see how my face is feeling right now!
And more importantly; Can my wife really feel the difference on my face between a “classic” Fusion shave and a Fusion ProGlide shave? Read on!
It is still a “Fusion”
But first, let’s talk a bit about the product itself.
Building on the Fusion technology, the ProGlide is a five blade shaver with an additional blade on the back for trimming. The new ProGlide cartridges will easily fit on your existing Gillette Fusion shaver. If you have an old Gillette Fusion shaver (Fusion Power or Fusion Manual), there is no (or little) need to buy the entire package. Buying a pack of replacement cartidges will work just as well.
The ProGlide does come with an improved handle compared to the old Fusion, but the real difference between the two version is to be found in the cartridges.
The leading blades have been made thinner, and the lubricating strip above the blades is significantly larger to improve the glide across your face.

As you can see on the image on the left, the blade is quite similar to the old Fusion blades. But a few, significant changes can be seen.
Gillette states that the leading blades are thinner compared to the old Fusion blades. That’s probably true. But it’s not a visible difference of course. We’re talking fractions here.
But it’s easy to see that the lamels before the blades have been reduces to just a few lamels. And a new “microcomb” has been added between the lamels and the shaving blades to straighten the hairs just before cutting.

The verdict
I can keep talking about technology, design and fancy marketing words… But in the end, it all comes down to one thing…
Is the Fusion ProGlide any better than the original Gillette Fusion???
Yes, indeed! First of all, I am impressed by the smooth sensation while I am shaving. There is no significant drag on my skin, and the blades glides easily across all parts of my face.
The Highest “Wife Acceptancy Factor”
But I never finished shaving my entire face with the ProGlide. Instead, I took this test a step further. Having finished shaving the left side of my face, I removed the ProGlide cartridge from the handle and inserted a brand new cartridge of the original Fusion type. I then carried on shaving the right hand side. As my wife returned from work, I asked her to compare the two sides, and tell me which side had the closest shave.
 
It took her less than 10 seconds to pronounce the Fusion ProGlide the winner! And I do the same!
