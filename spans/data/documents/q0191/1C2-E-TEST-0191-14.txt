Atomic Fission
Atomic fission is the process of splitting the nucleus of an atom apart. This is usually done mechanically by bombarding an atom with subatomic particles, which strike the atom and cause changes in its nucleus. The process of atomic fission involves splitting an atom into its constituents. A significant amount of energy is released as this occurs. Heat and light are two types of energy released when an atom is split.
Uses of Atomic Fission
There are two primary uses of nuclear fission, both of which harness the energy released when atoms are split apart. The first is nuclear power, in which the energy released is used to boil water. The boiling water turns into steam, which causes turbines to spin, generating electricity. The other primary use is in nuclear weapons. In this case, atoms are suddenly split, and the uncontrolled chain reaction of split atoms causes a massive and extremely destructive explosion.
Atomic Fusion
Atomic fusion is the counterpoint to atomic fission. While fission is the breaking apart of atoms, fusion is the connecting of the nuclei of two or more atoms to form a larger nucleus. Like fission, fusion also creates energy in the form of heat and light. Stars, such as the sun, constantly fuse hydrogen and helium atoms, producing the light and heat that warms the Earth.
Uses of Atomic Fusion
Controlled atomic fusion is still a science in the early stages of its development. In contrast to atomic fission, fusion creates less radioactive material. Nuclear fusion is, in theory, safer than fission and more efficient, since the energy produced lasts much longer, according to the United States Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab. Researchers in the United States and throughout the world are conducting research into controlling nuclear fusion for its use in energy production.
