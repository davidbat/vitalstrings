What is the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?
I have to make a Venn Diagram about both.  Definitions would be helpful to start off, and then compare certain details. Thanks!
Answer
Nuclear Fission is the is splitting of heavier elements to make lighter ones (Plutonium and Uranium turning into beryllium and hydrogen etc.) And Nuclear Fusion is the opposite, turning lighter elements into heavier ones. You have your comparison right there, one is lighter to heavier and the other is heavier to lighter. A similarity between the two (which you would need for your Venn Diagram) is that through the process of both Nuclear fission and fusion both are involved in exchanging enormous amounts of energy which is why they are used in power (mainly fission is used seeing as it releases more energy).

The information looks correct to me.

fission = splitting, usually resulting from collision with a neutron
fusion = creating a larger nucleus. requires a large amount of heat and energy. almost always occurs in stars.

fission is splitting an atom apart into two different atoms, fusion is putting them together into one.
fission was used in the atomic bombs(splitting uranium), and fusion is used in the sun to make heat and light(hydrogen getting slammed into hydrogen makes helium).
both make a lot of light energy and heat energy when they occur.
good luck, use pretty pictures
