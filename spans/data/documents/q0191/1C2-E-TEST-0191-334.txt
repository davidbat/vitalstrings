Interbody Fusion
Sutter Spine Services
When surgeons determine spinal fusion offers the best alternative, they may elect to perform posterior (from the back) or anterior (from the stomach) interbody (within the disc space) fusion to join the vertebrae. The difference between traditional spinal fusion and interbody fusion is that the surgeon replaces the disc with bone graft material (as in traditional spinal fusion) and a titanium interbody cage. In those patients for whom it is indicated, the interbody cage can offer advantages that include faster return to mobility. In patients with compressed discs, the interbody cage also allows surgeons to open the collapsed space between vertebrae, reducing pressure on the nerve and resulting pain.
In some cases, interbody fusion surgery can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.
