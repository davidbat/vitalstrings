and   fission fragment are dangerous.
Fusion   product is non-radioactive and is not dangerous environmentally acceptable   source.
2
There   will be total contamination of the surrounding medium due to radioactivity of   various products of fission.
No   fatal contamination of the surrounding medium.
3
A   bombarding particle (slow neutron) is necessary to initiate the fission.   There is no condition on the temperature of the fissible fuel. The fissible   isotopes are initially at rest.
No   bombarding particle is required. There is a threshold temperature. The   temperature should be of the order of 108 K to produce controlled   fusion reaction. The fusionable isotopes are with vigourous thermal motion.
4
Nature   of the ejected particle depends upon the type of thermonuclear reaction.
5
Probability   depends upon the nuclear cross-section for slow neutrons.
Probability   depends upon the temperature and density of plasma.
6
Fuel   is in either solid or liquid state.
Fuel   is in plasma state.
7
Fuel   can be stored for any length of time.
Fuels   cannot be stored so easily as no container can exist in solid state such very   high temperature. For that magnetic mirrors, by which the plasma is isolated   from its surroundings are employed.
8
Sum   of the masses of the fission products should be less than the mass of the   fissible isotope.
Sum   of the masses of the fusionable isotopes should be greater than the compound   nucleus formed on fusion. (m<50)
9
Fission   fuels are costly production and preparation of them are not so easy.
Fusion   fuels are available in plenty in nature. They are cheap and inexhaustible.
10
The   reaction can be made self sustained. Chain reaction is possible.
Chain   reaction is not possible under ordinary conditions. To sustain reaction   energy must be provided to fuel material continuously i.e., the temperature   of the fuel material must be maintained.
