Atomic Tweezers
Scientists from the University of Bonn have constructed         the world's smallest pair of tweezers which are capable         of moving atoms around one by one and might hold the key         to superfast "quantum computers" of the future.         In this week's Nature, Arno Rausc...
Questions
 
I'd like to know if putting lemon juice           on your hair really helps to bleach it, and if so, why?
The           answer to this is acid catalysed oxidation. If you add           oxygen and ultraviolet light to most things, like hair           or clothes, then they will bleach. If you're out in the           summer sun, there's oxygen in the air and sunlight, so           your hairs go blond. Adding lemon juice to your hair means           that you are adding an acid, and that just speeds up the           bleaching process.
 
Why is a chilli called a chilli when it's           hot?
We           couldn't answer this question last week, but I'm pleased           to tell you that Jose Fernandez in Mexico City has been           listening to us on the internet. He says that the name           comes from the Spanish word 'chile', which has its own           roots respectively in the Nahuatl language (the Aztecs           spoke a variant of this). So a chilli was originally called           chile in Nahuatl. The Spanish then took this into their           own language and the English language borrowed it from           them. So the fact it is called a chilli has nothing to           do with its temperature at all - it's just the word that           was originally used for it in another language.
 
Generally speaking, is the Sun really shrinking           at a speed people should be worried about?
It's           certainly shrinking because it's giving off matter into           space all the time. It's known as the solar wind. But           this is a tiny fraction of the mass of the Sun and it's           certainly not going to evaporate off into space before           it's used up all the fuel. One statistic I did hear is           that it sheds one million tonnes per second. The numbers           are so big that it's difficult to equate what they are,           but it's the equivalent of the mass of a reasonable sized           mountain per day.
 
Are we any closer to working out how geomagnetic           fluctuations in the Sun affect our climate?
We've           come a long way with this science recently. The reason           for this is that the Sun has a magnetic field and the           magnetic field goes out into space in the solar wind.           That affects planets with a magnetic field. If you put           two magnets together they will either repel or attract           depending on whether they are the same or opposite. If           the Sun's field in space is the opposite sign, those two           fields can join together and some of this very hot gas           can fall into the Earth's atmosphere. This is what is           known as a geomagnetic storm. If you are measuring the           Earth's magnetic field from the ground you start to see           your compass needle get a bit confused because the magnetic           field of the Earth is being moved about and altered by           being connected to the Sun's magnetic field.
 
What's the deal with fusion as a power source?           Is it ever going to be economically possible? Is cold           fusion the answer, or a pipe dream?
Well           let's start with cold fusion. This was reported fifteen           or more years ago as an interesting product where you           didn't need big magnetic fields but you had electric currents           passed into liquids. Somehow they suddenly gave energy           off. Whether this is really fusion or whether this is           just one of those funny things about electricity, I don't           think has been fully demonstrated yet. But if you want           to go to the more general idea of fusion as it is on the           Sun, I think you have to say that on Earth we've been           able to demonstrate fusion for a few fractions a second, a few milliseconds. We've never got electricity out of           it; we've always put a lot of electricity into it and           I think it's a very challenging thing that we haven't           cracked.
 
Sitting in my kitchen which faces west,           I can see the sun well up in the sky and I can also see           the moon. But the moon still had a shadow on it. Where           did the shadow come from if I can see the whole disk of           the moon?
The           reason for that is that the shadow you're seeing is the           edge of the Earth and so because one isn't completely           in line with the other, you don't see the whole disk.           The moon is 240 000 km away and from your vantage point           you can just peer round to the dark side. We're sat on           the sunward side of the planet and if you look across           at a planet that's more or less the same distance from           you, you can just peek around the dark side of it.
 
When I was training to be a nurse, it           was drummed into us that vitamin D comes from the sun.           If we're all neurotic about putting sunblocks on, will           we not have a lot of people suffering from SAD (seasonal           affective disorder)?
This           is a really interesting debate. There are some people           in the media who are saying that we need to get out in           the sun as much as possible. It's really difficult because           being exposed to too much sun, particularly burning, really           does increase your risk of developing skin cancer. We           know this from research and rates of skin cancer are set           to treble in the UK as a result of too much sun exposure.           But we do make vitamin D in our skin when sunlight hits           our skin and we can also get vitamin D in our diet. Vitamin           D is very important for building healthy bones and teeth           and things like that. Deficiency in vitamin D can cause           rickets and there's some evidence that it may help to           prevent against cancer. So it's a difficult message to           try and get across. Yes, it's important to be safe and           not to burn in the sun, but at the same time you should           try to be sensible about it. Don't go out in the middle           of the day when it's really hot, but you'll still get           enough sun to keep your levels of vitamin D healthy. SAD           is another point, and it causes some people to become           depressed if they don't get enough natural bright sunlight.           It's not the same as not getting enough vitamin D or over           exposure to the sun. It's a slightly different phenomenon.
 
I know that there is a wide range           of frequencies in the electromagnetic radiation that comes           from the sun. But exactly how many discrete frequencies           are there, and what determines the frequency radiated?
The           light that comes from the Sun would be in a continuous           spectrum and it's dictated by the temperature of the Sun.           The colour tells you what temperature it is. From the           Sun's photosphere, the rays of light go from x-rays through           visible light all the way up to radiowaves, but they peak           at around 550nm, which is red light. It peaks in the visible           part of the spectrum. That would be continuous were it           not for the fact that there are discrete energies that           are absorbed and emitted by the different atomic species           on the Sun. For example, the element helium was discovered           by astronomers noticing that there was a gap in the spectrum           that corresponded to an element that they previously didn't           know about. So they called it helium after the Greek god           Helios.
 
It's my understanding that you can send electricity           wirelessly. Although microwaves are apparently the best           way, even radio waves contain small traces of electricity.           So if the Sun emits a huge and powerful spectrum of radio           waves and other kinds of electromagnetic waves, would           it not be possible to pick up this free energy using a           big antenna?
I           wish it was! The total energy we get in every square metre           on the surface of the Earth from the Sun is about 1kW.           If we could turn all of that into electricity, that would           be marvellous. But I'm afraid the laws of thermodynamics           stop that. The temperature of the Sun isn't so great as           to turn it all into possible work, and antennae would           just pick up very faint signals like the old early radio           waves when you had a crystal set and got a weak signal.           I'm afraid it isn't going to be useful to turn that into           practical energy to power your house.
 
It           is indeed one of those mysteries! Light can travel through           a vacuum, so it doesn't require anything to push it forward           with. You can think of light as particles or photons,           that can travel down to their original energies.
 
Does the Sun move and what impact could the           movement of the Sun and changes in velocity have on things           like other planets?
The           Sun does move. We're orbiting our galaxy; we're on one           of the spiral arms of the galaxy. We go round about every           240 million years so our whole solar system is moving.           But relative to our solar system it sits at the centre           of the solar system and is so massive that it controls           the movement of the planets. It sets the orbits of the           planets.
 
Why do you sneeze when you look at the Sun?
This           is a reflex called the photic sneeze reflex and no-one's           exactly sure what underlies it. We know that it's genetic           and is passed on in families. About one person in four           or one person in five is affected. People used to think           that when you looked at the Sun, the bright light made           your eyes water, the water ran down into your nose, tickled           your nose and made you sneeze. This is not true because           it happens too fast. What scientists think is that there's           some sort of crossed wiring in the back of the brain where           the size of your pupil is controlled, and that's what           causes that to happen.
