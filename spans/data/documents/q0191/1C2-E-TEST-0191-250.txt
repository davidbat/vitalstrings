PhD student job opportunity: Influence of social network on fission-fusion dynamics and group cohesion in animals
Hiring Organization:
Department of Ecology, Physiology, Ethology; IPHC; UMR7178, CNRS-UDS, Strasbourg, France

Position Description:
Project's abstract: Interactions of individuals at the group or population level have important implications for the transmission of genes, diseases and information. More and more studies show that properties of complex systems may emerge from simple and local interactions, from schools of fishes to migration of ungulates, apparent social roles, and even traffic flow in human crowds. However, how simple rules at the individual level may explain both group processes and population structure remains unclear. In this project, we want to understand how a simple dynamic rule, based on physiological needs and social relationships, explains either collective movements in cohesive groups, fission-fusion dynamics or irreversible fusions and eventually group size distribution and population structure. Results from our dynamic model will be compared to data coming from Ovine and Primates. Needs of individuals and social relationships should influence the frequency of fissions but fissions should also act as a feedback loop on social relationships. According to the strength of their social relationships and the differences in their physiological needs, the members of a group would maintain a cohesive structure or having a fission-fusion dynamic. However, the group should irreversibly split if physiological needs of individuals cannot be satisfied. Our model will test these different assumptions. Our project will allow to bridge the gap between the individual and the population level, that is crucial to deeply understand how simple, local interactions may drive ecological systems.
After being selected by the PhD supervisor, the candidate should pass an oral competition to obtain the university fellowships (http://www-ed-sdvs.u-strasbg.fr/Anglais/financement/allocations.php).
Applications consisting of a cover letter stating research experience and interests, a detailed CV, and the names and e-mail addresses of two referees can be sent electronically to Dr. CÃ©dric Sueur (cedric.sueur@iphc.cnrs.fr)
Qualifications/Experience:
Thorough knowledge in bioinformatics, modeling and programming language
