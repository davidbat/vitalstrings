Nuclear fusion of hydrogen produces more energy than nuclear fission of uranium. A student claims that this means that fission–based power plants are safer, and we should not build fusion–based plants. Which most accurately disputes the student's argument? (2 points)  A) The most dangerous aspect of nuclear power is radioactive waste, which fusion does not produce.  B) Both nuclear fission and fusion produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.  C) Nuclear fusion produces far more ...

User: Nuclear fusion of hydrogen produces more energy than nuclear fission of uranium. A student claims that this means that fission–based power plants are safer, and we should not build fusion–based plants. Which most accurately disputes the student's argument? (2 points)  A) The most dangerous aspect of nuclear power is radioactive waste, which fusion does not produce.  B) Both nuclear fission and fusion produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.  C) Nuclear fusion produces far more dangerous chemicals than nuclear fission does.  D) The more energy a power plant produces, the safer it is.
Weegy: D) Fusion reactions are easier to control.
