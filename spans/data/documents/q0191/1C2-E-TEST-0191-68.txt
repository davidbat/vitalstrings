All atomic nuclei lighter than iron have a tendency to give up mass as energy when they fuse, while all atomic nuclei heavier than iron have a tendency to give up mass as energy when they split up.  The first kind of nuclear reaction is called "fusion", while the second kind of nuclear reaction is called "fission".  A typical thermonuclear bomb actually uses both processes, first using an uranium or plutonium fission reaction to produce sufficient temperatures and pressures to induce a fusion reaction inside a core containing hydrogen atom isotopes.
With iron nuclei, it's difficult to produce a nuclear reaction either way, which is why it's often considered the "final elemental end stage" in stellar nuclear synthesis.  We see a lot of free-floating iron in outer space.
