If it’s done well then it results in minimal greenhouse gases.
If it’s done the way people do most things then radioactive contamination, death and destruction.
Seriously, the main problem with nuclear power is that people are just too irresponsible to use it properly. Maybe in another 500 years?

nuclear fusion is a pipe dream as it has not been sustainably achieved (twice for about a second) It is, however, theoretically almost a perfect power source – it gives out no pollution or nuclear waste.
Fission is how nuclear power stations currently generate electicity, no greenhouse gasses given off but they do produce the nuclear waste.

The advantage(s) of nuclear fission is that we know not only how to do it – but a way of slowing the reaction enough so that it can be used to generate electricity.  (Fission, of course was first explored by way of a bomb.)  The almost singular disadvantage is that we have not yet figured out what to do with the remarkably small amount of waste material, which is inconveniently radioactive.
The disadvantage of fusion is that we have not yet mastered the preconditions for a controlled and sustained reaction.  The advantages (postulated) are that the fuel will be easier to come by (heavy water) and therefore we will be less dependent on other economies for our supply.  Also the end-product  will be a) less total mass and b) not as radioactive (if at all) and therefore easier to manage.
A further disadvantage to fusion is that the research has now left our shores and is taking place abroad…so we may end up having to buy the technology off some other country.
