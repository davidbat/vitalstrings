Re: difference between binary fission and mitosis?
well for a start, mitosis only occurs in eukaryokes, and binary fission in only in prokaryokes (and some eukaryotic cell organelles (mitochondria))
binary fission produces 2 daughter cells, mitosis 4 daughter cells.
look on wikipedia for more differences.
