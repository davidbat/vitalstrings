Activity in the field went underground and  certain aspects were the subject of intense study and investigation  in secret under the forced draft of military urgency and unlimited  support. It emerged on August 6, 1945, with the most destructive  explosion that has ever been produced by man. The same dra-  matic event answered affirmatively the outstanding question which  had engaged nuclear physicists previously : Is a self-sustaining nu-  clear chain reaction possible? The successful culmination of the  work of the Manhattan District in the explosion of the bombs  over Japan punctuated the end of the war and announced the  scientific fact that nuclear chain reactions could be brought about.   With the cessation of hostilities nuclear physicists have re-  turned from a wide variety of war research assignments to this,  their chosen field. The obvious first step in resuming programs of  fundamental research has been a review of the literature and a  taking of scientific stock in the light of available information. At  the University of Pennsylvania a series of seminars was conducted  by Dr. Stephens and the staff of the Department of Physics resi-  dent in the autumn of 1945, for the purpose of reviewing all freely  available information and reorienting the interests of the research  group. The extensive examination of all the pertinent literature  at their disposal and the careful study of its implications in the  light of present common scientific knowledge has been of great  value in the planning of a research program at the University of  Pennsylvania. It is in the hope that the efforts of this group may  serve a much broader purpose in assisting their scientific col-  leagues elsewhere to resume their research programs or enable  them to enter their field of fundamental investigation that these  seminar notes have been edited for publication.   Unfortunately this book perforce marks a departure from  traditional scientific publications, a departure which it is hoped  is only a temporary result of abnormal post-war conditions. The  authors of this book, in common with authors of reviews in other  branches of physical science, have dealt only with information that  is available to all. But unlike authors of pre-war treatises they  are aware that there exists a body of pertinent knowledge inaccess-  ible to them. To avoid any possible imputation of inadvertent     breach of security they have been at pains not to discuss these  topics with any persons in possession of classified knowledge con-  cerning them. Though a more complete book on the subject might  be written by men who have participated in the atomic bomb proj-  ect, such persons are at present legally precluded from such an  undertaking. The very ignorance of the authors of this book thus  enables them to contribute their special training to the writing of it  as a contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the best  scientific tradition. There is nothing herein tnat any physicist, be  he American, English, Russian, French, Indian or Chinese, could  not already know if he himself had taken the time to rework the  excellent report of Dr. H. D. Smyth and the recent literature of  physics with nuclear fission in mind.   Nuclear physics involves a considerable number of concepts  which are not familiar through common experience. This fact,  together with the necessarily mathematical nature of the theoreti-  cal analyses and the formulation of results, renders the subject a  peculiarly difficult one for persons untrained in this science. This  situation undoubtedly has led to much popular misunderstanding  in the matter of security and has contributed to loose and hasty  thinking about supposed secrets which Nature is thought to have  shared with this country alone. In a sense the fact that this book  could be written by physicists having access to no material not  freely available to scientists the world over makes it clear that  Nature is the only possible guardian of her own secrets.   A sincere effort is being made to bring about a popular clari-  fication of these matters in order that the advancement of knowl-  edge may not be legally interdicted in this country to the great  detriment of our national well being. The achievements of gen-  erations of free scientists, which chiefly differentiate our life from  that of the dark ages, are the best arguments for the preservation  of freedom of intellectual inquiry. This book documents the thesis  that the understanding of nafhral phenomena, of which nuclear  fission is no exceptional instance, can be gained by any trained and  inquiring mind. Nature will not be a party to man's attempt at  discrimination between nations, races or individuals. If the pub-  lication of this book contributes to the general appreciation of this fact it will have performed an important additional service in clear-  ing away erroneous conceptions and in promoting a wiser and  more constructive approach to current national problems.

HARNWELL   Chairman, Department of Physics,  University of Pennsylvania   viii     EDITOR'S PREFACE   THIS book originated in a series of seminars on nuclear fis-  sion held in the Physics Department of the University of Pennsyl-  vania in the fall of 1945. These seminars reviewed the known facts  of nuclear fission as published in the literature. The notes were  mimeographed from week to week and formed a record of the dis-  cussions. Because of the interest expressed by other physicists,  we have been persuaded to publish the material. We hope that  this book will enable physicists who, like most of the authors, are  not specialists in nuclear physics, to obtain a semiquantitative  understanding of the phenomena concerned.   The persons who presented the seminars and wrote the vari-  ous chapters have had no connection with the Manhattan District  project. All were on the staff of the University of Pennsylvania.

STEPHENS.     Owing to difficulties of publication, the appearance of this  book has been delayed far beyond the date originally hoped for.  Subsequent to the preparation of manuscript and its initial distri-  bution in mimeographed form, much information on details of the     fission process, fission products, and heavy nuclei was released and  published in scientific periodicals. However, the main ideas con-  tained in this book were not essentially changed thereby, although  some details need to be corrected and many details added. Con-  sequently, we have added a supplementary bibliography of publi-  cations that came to our attention after the manuscript was pre-  pared and before October, 1947.   November 15, 1947 W. E. S.     CHAPTER 1  DISCOVERY OF FISSION   The explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated to  the public for the first time that successful nuclear chain reactions  could be produced by man. The discovery of the fission of the  uranium and thorium nuclei in 1939 and the subsequent observa-  tions which showed that several secondary neutrons were emitted  in the process had given evidence that such a reaction might be  produced. The story of this discovery of fission and the recogni-  tion of the tremendous energy released in the process forms one  of the most fascinating chapters in physics.   It was the discovery of the neutron by Chadwick in 1932 that  prompted Fermi to search for transuranic elements in the products  of uranium and thorium bombarded by neutrons, thereby starting  the chain of events leading to the discovery of fission. The com-  plicated processes which occurred were not understood at first,  and the years which followed the publication of Fermi's original  paper found several groups of workers in different countries trying  to understand what had happened. This problem was finally re-  solved by the observation by Hahn and Strassmann of the exist-  ence of a light element among the products of uranium bombarded  by neutrons and by the insight of Meitner and Frisch into the tre-  mendous energy evolved in the process. The existence of fission  was immediately confirmed in the laboratories of several countries.   The years of confusion. In his paper in 1934, Fermi 1 re-  ported that uranium and thorium had been bombarded by neutrons  and suggested that elements of atomic number greater than 92 had  been produced. Because of the general instability of the heavy  nuclei it was hoped that bombarding them with neutrons might  give rise to successive transformations with the consequent produc-  tion of transuranic elements. The activities of irradiated uranium  and thorium were, of course, very complicated and the exact na-  ture of the processes involved was not evident. The first effort  to disentangle the half-life curves gave four activities for the prod-  ucts from uranium, and two from thorium. One of the activities  of uranium was attributed to element 93. The chemical separa-  tions for element 93 were based on the assumption that, since uran-   1 E. Fermi, Nature 133, 898 (1934).     2 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEXQT   ium is in group VI of the periodic table, element 93 would lie in  group VII and would be chemically similar to rhenium, masurium  and manganese. This, as we shall see later, was a misleading  assumption. By use of the radioactive isotopes 90 UX 2 , 91 UXi,  92 U, 88 MsThi and 89 MsTh 2 , Fermi showed that at least part  of the newly formed active elements did not behave like any of the  elements from 88 to 92. Since elements 86 (radon, a gas) and  87 (Eka Cs) could also be ruled out, he concluded that if any  known reaction had taken place the new element must lie near the  original uranium, but it must be on the other side of uranium. It  must be one of the looked for transuranic elements ! Noddack 2 in  1934 pointed out that the methods used did not disprove the possi-  ble existence of lighter elements among the bombardment products.  Unfortunately, this idea was not followed up.   In the four years after the work of Fermi, many papers ap-  peared which described the efforts of several groups to unravel the  mystery. A review of this work is included in Turner's 3 ar-  ticle on nuclear fission. Among the investigators in this field  were the group in Italy ; Hahn, Strassmann and Meitner in Berlin ;  a group in Paris; several workers in Zurich; and others in this  country. They separated the products chemically, measured the  half -lives of the activities and studied some of the radiations. It is  possible in retrospect to see how close several of these groups were  to the discovery of fission.   Curie and Savitch 4 (1937-38), in their experiments with  the products of neutron bombardment, used a copper absorber to  eliminate beta rays of energy less than 2 Mev. Several half-lives  were found, one of which a 3.5 hour activity resembled lantha-  num. The reason that this was not recognized as lanthanum is  explained in the following quotation from Turner 4 *. The "experi-  ment indicated that the 3.5 hr jstuff tended to concentrate in the  portion first precipitated (i.e., not with lanthanum). This result  prevented Curie and Savitch from being confronted with the per-  fect chemical identity of La and R 3 .6 hr. It may be that the pres-  ence of the recently discovered active yttrium, also a fission prod-  uct and also of a half-life of 3.5 hr, 5 was responsible for the  observed fractionation." Hahn and Meitner 6 had suggested that   I. Noddack, Zeits. f. Angew. Chimie 37, 653 (1934).  L. A. Turner, Rev. Mod. Phys. 12, 1 (1940).  Curie & Saviteh, J. de Phys.

D18COVEET OF FISSION 3   a short-lived activity in the products of thorium bombarded by  fast neutrons might be radium produced by an (n, a) reaction.  Braun, Preiswerk and Sherrer 7 used an ionization chamber and  a linear amplifier to look for these alpha particles, and reported  finding alpha particles with energies greater than 9 Mev. How*  ever, since they measured energy by range they were not able to  separate the fission fragments from the numerous natural alpha  particles because the ranges are comparable.   Von Droste 8 (1938), also tried this experiment with urani-  um and thorium. The use of thin foils to eliminate the natural  particles probably prevented him from getting the fission fragments  in the ionization chamber and observing the large bursts of ioniza-  tion that they produce.   The discovery of fission. At the end of 1938, Meitner left  Berlin because of the threatening storm cloud of Nazism, but she  took with her the information gained in the Berlin laboratory. The  indisputable evidence which was published by Hahn and Strass-  mann 9 in the first days of 1939 gave proof of the existence of an  isotope of barium among the products of uranium bombarded by  neutrons. This evidence was interpreted by Meitner and Frisch 10  to mean that the heavy uranium nucleus had divided into two light  elements which separated with kinetic energies of the order of mag-  nitude of 100 Mev. This was immediately and independently  established by the experimental work of Joliot and Frisch. The  evidence for the existence of barium was found in experiments ex-  tending the earlier work of the group in Berlin when Meitner was  there. In studying the products of neutron irradiated uranium,  four activities had been found that could be attributed only to  isotopes of radium or barium. Some of the separated product,  called Ra IV in the earlier work, was added to a solution con-  taining barium and a small amount of Th X or Ms Thi, both  being used as tracer isotopes of radium. By means of frac-  tional precipitations and crystallizations to separate radium iso-  topes from barium they found that Ra IV separated, not with  radium, but with barium and was consequently an isotope of bari-  um. The other three activities which had also been attributed to  isotopes of radium could be reasonably inferred to be isotopes of  barium, and the four daughter products which had been attributed  to 89 Ac would be really isotopes of lanthanum. The product form-   7 Braun, Preiswerk and Scherrer, Nature 140, 682 (1937).   8 G.

The "Ac IF' separated with  the lanthanum and not with the goMs Th2, thus giving additional  evidence of the presence of barium.   Bohr was informed of the fact that barium had been found  among the products of uranium bombarded with neutrons, and of  the calculation of Meitner and Frisch that the uranium nucleus fis-  sioned into two light nuclei with the release of about 200 Mev of  energy. Shortly afterward Bohr came to this country to spend  some time at Princeton. Immediately upon his arrival in this  country on January 16, 1939 he informed his former student, J. A.  Wheeler, of this idea; the news was spread by word of mouth to  other physicists, including Fermi who was at Columbia. Experi-  ments were undertaken at Columbia to find the fission fragments.   A discussion of the experimental results of Hahn and Strass-  mann and the hypothesis of uranium fission was given by Bohr  and Fermi before the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical  Physics on January 26, 1939. This created great excitement  among physicists and in the popular press. Before the meeting  adjourned on January 28, Roberts, Meyer and Hafstad 12 were  able to demonstrate the existence of fission by the large pulses of  ionization produced by the fragments in an ionization chamber.   Meanwhile Frisch 13 in Copenhagen had obtained physical  evidence in support of the hypothesis of fission by observing the  ionization produced by the recoil fragments. These observa-  tions were cabled to Bohr, then in this country, and were pub-  lished in Nature in a letter dated January 16. Frisch used a ura-  nium-lined ionization chamber connected to a linear amplifier.  When a radium-beryllium source of neutrons was placed near the  chamber, large pulses of ionization were observed. Surrounding  the neutron source with paraffin increased the number of pulses by  a factor of two. Experiments with thorium in place of uranium  gave similar results, except that paraffin did not enhance the eftect.   Joliot's 14 results, obtained independently and almost simul-  taneously, were published in the Comptes Rendus of January 30,  1939, and also reported the presence of the highly energetic recoil  particles which emerged from the irradiated uranium and collected  on a nearby plate. These were detected by their radioactivity.   Boberts, Meyer and Hafstad, Phys. Eev. 55, 416 (1939).   ** O. B. Frisch, Nature 143, 276 (1939).   14 F. Joliot, Comptes Ecndus 208, 341 (1939).     DISCOVERY OF FISSION 5   Dunning 15 and his co-workers at Columbia, who had been  told of the fission hypothesis before the Washington meeting, dem-  onstrated the existence of these high energy particles on January  2S, 16 after Fermi had left for Washington.   Other investigators who confirmed the fission hypothesis by  demonstrating the large pulses of ionization from the fission frag-  ments were Green and Alvarez 17 of California and Fowler and  Dodson 18 of Johns Hopkins.   An independent method of showing the fission of uranium  was used by Abelson, 19 who studied the X rays from a 72 hour  activity. By critical absorption measurements these were shown  to be the K X rays of iodine. The 72 hour period was shown to  be due to tellurium, and the daughter substance, which was sep-  arated quantitatively, was shown to be 2.5 hr iodine. Similar re-  sults were obtained independently by Feather and Bretscher. 20   The discovery of nuclear fission aroused so much interest  among physicists that almost 100 papers were published about the  subject within a year. In January 1940 the review article by L. A.  Turner 21 summarized the information and gave a bibliography  covering the work until almost the end of 1939.   The volume of published material on the subject of uranium  fission fell off in 1940. This, we learn from Smyth (3.2), 22 was  the result of a voluntary censorship system instituted by nuclear  physicists through the National Research Council. Not until  August 6, 1945 did the world know the outcome of the experi-  ments on nuclear chain reactions. Much of the dramatic story  of what went on behind the scenes has been told to us by Smyth.  We must wait for further publication for the complete picture of  what advances were made in nuclear physics and other branches  of physics related to the successful solution of the chain reaction  experiments.

CHAPTER 2   PRODUCTION OF FISSION   Although the early work on fission was done with neutrons,  it was soon realized that the disturbance of uranium and thorium  leading to fission might be produced by other nuclear agents. This  chapter describes the various methods by which fission was at-  tempted, the attendant success and, where possible, observed cross  sections and energy thresholds. Since experimental data for the  new nuclei, plutonium and neptunium, are unavailable, the prob-  lem of theoretically estimating the cross section for fission of these  nuclei is left to chapter 8. For the same reason, the fission prop-  erties of the rare isotopes of uranium, 234 and 233, also will have  to be estimated.   Slow neutrons. Since the 238 isotope of uranium is so abun-  dant, it is expected that most of the effects in uranium are due to  that isotope. Bohr and Wheeler 23 first pointed out that the slow  neutron effect in uranium probably should be ascribed to the rare  isotope U 235 . This was observed experimentally at Columbia 24  by the use of isolated uranium isotopes, separated by mass spec-  trometer methods. A value of 3X10 24 cm 2 is given for the  cross section for fission by slow neutrons on normal uranium. 25  Since the U 235 is present to only one part in 140 in normal Urani-  um, the cross section for slow neutron capture by the single isotope  would be about 420 X 10~ 24 cm 2 . Although no experimental data  are available, theoretical considerations (see page 114) indicate  that U 233 and Pu 239 will also fission with slow neutrons with sim-  ilar cross sections.   It is expected on theoretical grounds that this slow neutron  induced fission follows the \/v law and has no pronounced reson-  ances (see page 115). Experimentally this \/v dependence has  been verified by the Columbia group. 26   Fast neutrons. Probably most of the experimental work on  fission has been done with medium fast neutrons.

Photo neutrons  from the Be (Ra7, n) reaction and neutrons from the C(d,n) reac-  tion give about 1 Mev and 0.5 Mev neutrons, respectively. The  Li(d,w) reaction gives neutrons up to 17 Mev. By compar-  ing yields from these different sources (see table 3), crude thres-  holds and yield curves can often be determined. More elaborate  methods are necessary, however, for precise work.      Fig. 1. Experimental arrangement for using variable maximum  energy neutrons to observe fission thresholds. (Westinghouse  Research Laboratories.)   To determine threshold values of neutron energies necessary  for fission, neutrons from the Li(/>,w) reaction can be utilized.  Monochromatic protons of several million volts energy are directed  onto a thick target of lithium. Figure 1 shows an experimental  arrangement. The neutrons coming off the lithium target in the  forward direction have an energy EN determined by the (p,n)  threshold energy Et and the energy Ep of the protons.     E y =     E* for lithium has been measured 27 accurately to be  1.85 0.02 Mev. If a thick target of lithium is used there will  be only neutrons of lower energy. Consequently, if the energy  of the protons is increased until fission is observed, the value of  EN necessary for fission can be calculated. This gives a maximum   27 Haxby, Shoupp, Stephens and Wells, Phys. Eev. 58, 1035 (1940).      8 NVCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   value of the fission threshold since extrapolation is uncertain.  However, the thresholds seem quite definite. Such threshold  curves for fast neutron induced fission of thorium and uranium  are given in figures 2 and 3. The uranium curve has a back-  ground of neutron induced fission from U 235 even though the  number of slow neutrons was minimized by cadmium and boron  shields.   For measuring yield curves, this integral method is not suit-  able. By using thin targets of lithium, however, an essentially  monochromatic variable energy source of neutrons can be obtained.  Work along these lines was started at Westinghouse Research  Laboratory in 1940, and according to Smyth (12.44) this tech-      Mteimum Mtwtren energy.     ots as o.r uo   Calculated Maximum Ntvtron     Fig. 2.   ium.

The threshold values for fast neutron induced fission were  observed at Westinghouse 29 as 0.35 it 0.1 Mev for uranium and  1.1 0.1 Mev for thorium.

PRODUCTION OF FISSION 9   The cross section for fission of uranium by neutrons of inter-  mediate energies was given as 0.006 x 10~ 24 cm 2 at 0.5 Mey and  0.012 x 10 24 cm 2 at 1.0 Mev, by M. A. Tuve at the Princeton  meeting of the American Physical Society in 1939. These  values seem low compared to the value of 0.5 x 10~~ 24 cm 2  reported by the Princeton group for neutrons of 2.4 Mev  on uranium. 30 Ladenburg and his co-workers also give a  value of 0.1 x 10~~ 24 cm 2 for the cross section for fission of  thorium for the same D(d,n) neutrons of about 2.4 Mev. They  find these cross sections to be constant within 10 per cent between  2.1 and 3.1 Mev neutron energy. The Italian group 31 has  measured the cross section for higher energy neutrons and infers  that the uranium cross section remains roughly constant after 2  Mev until perhaps 8 Mev. It starts rising then, and reaches a  value about 40 per cent higher at about 10 Mev. Thorium be-  haves similarly. Figure 4 roughly indicates the yield curves as  interpolated between these observed values.     I     Fig. 4. Yield curves for fast neutron induced fission in uranium  and thorium.   Radioactive alpha particles make observation of fission re-  coils difficult in other cases. However, at Columbia it was found  that protactinium fissions with fast neutrons, with a cross section  about thirty times that of thorium. 32 Since protactinium fission  was not observed with Be(Ray,n) photo neutrons, but was ob-  served with D(d,n) neutrons, the threshold was estimated to be  about 1 Mev neutron energy.   Ionium has been reported to fission with neutrons. 83 The cross  section was about 2.7 times that for thorium 33a using Be(d,)  neutrons with a 6.7 Mev deuteron source.   * Ladenburg, Kanner, Barschall and Van Voorhis, Phys.

Roberts 34 and his collaborators, using fast neutrons,  found no fission in bismuth, rubidium, thallium, mercury, gold,  platinum, tungsten, tin or silver although they estimated they could  have detected one thousandth o$ the thorium effect.   Photo fission. The fission^; of uranium and thorium by gam-  ma rays, first observed at Westinghouse, 35 was considerably weak-  er than neutron induced fission. To eliminate the possibility that  the observed fission was caused by photoneutrons or (p,n) neu-  trons, the absorption curve of the fission producing radiation was  measured to be 0.53 per cm of lead, which agrees with that of the  6.3 Mev gamma ray used. Fission was observed with both the  F(/>,y) and Li(/?,y) gamma ray, whose energies are 6.3 Mev and  17 Mev, respectively. The cross sections for the 6.3 Mev gamma  ray were measured to be 3.5 x 10~ 27 for uranium and 1.7x 10~~ 27  cm 2 for thorium. 36 The errors were estimated at about 30 per cent.  The threshold values for photofission have been determined with  X rays from a betatron. 87 As electron energy is increased, the  maximum energy of the X rays is increased also until photofission  is observed. The values reported are 5.76:0.1 Mev and 6.21 db  0.15 Mev for U 288 and Th 232 , respectively. As the electron ener-  gy is increased, a peak is reached at 1.7 Mev above the threshold  where the yield from uranium is 1.8 times that of thorium. Above  this energy, the thorium yield remains roughly constant while the  uranium yield keeps rising until at 13 Mev it is 8.6 times that of  thorium. Using a 100 Mev betatron, the yields rise rapidly to  about 20 Mev and then drop off up to 100 Mev. In this range  the uranium yield is about twice that of thorium, giving a maxi-  mum of about 260 fissions per roentgen from a 4 mg/cm 2 layer  of uranium oxide. 38 No fission recoil fragments were observed  in a balanced ionization chamber lined with lead, thallium, bis-  muth, tungsten, gold or samarium, which was exposed to 20r of  100 Mev betatron X rays. An effect of one thousandth of that  produced in thorium could have been detected.   Charged particle induced fission.

Dessauer and Hafner 80 bombarded thick uranium and thorium  targets with 6.9 Mev protons from a cyclotron. They detected  fission by catching the recoil fission fragments on neighboring  plates. One plate collected fission fragments from the front sur-  face of the target, giving the proton induced fission yield plus any  neutron induced fission. A second catcher plate collected fission  fragments from the back of the target, measuring only the neutron  induced fission. The difference gave the true proton induced fis-  sion yield. The yields were similar for uranium and thorium.  The threshold was around 5.8 Mev. Gant found fission produced  by bombardment of uranium and thorium 40 with deuterons of over  8 Mev. Jacobsen and Lassen measured the yield curve and ob-  tained cross sections of 2.2 :0.lXlO~ 26 cm 2 and 1.5 0.7XlO- 20  cm 2 , for uranium and thorium, respectively, at 9 Mev deuteron  energy. 41 This ratio of uranium to thorium cross sections was  checked by Krishnan and Banks. 42   Table 1  FISSION THRESHOLDS     Compound  Nucleus    Threshold Energy  for exciting fission    Canae of  excitation    Target    90 Th 282    6.21 ^0.1 5 Mev    (1)    Y    Th 282    9oTh 283    1.1 *0.1    (2)    n    Th 282    91 Pa 232    ~ 1    (3)    n    Pa 281    9iPa 238 < 6.9    (4)    P    Th 282    9iPa 2M    ~ 8    (5)    d    Th 282    92 U 28 < o    (6)    slow n    U 285    92 U 288    5.76 *0.1    (1)    Y    U288    92 U 289    0.35 ^0.1    (7)    n    U288    9 8 N P 289 < 6.9    (4)    P    U288    68 Np 2 > ~ 8    (5)    d    U288     (1) H.

Various observations have been attributed  to natural fission in uranium and estimates of half-life have been  made. 44 The best estimate, however, seerns to be based on Sea-  borg's observation 45 that Pu 239 is found in a concentration of one  part in 10 14 in pitchblende. If this is in equilibrium then it must  be produced at the rate it is decaying. Its production can be esti-  mated by assuming with Seaborg that it is produced by the capture  in U 238 of secondary neutrons from the natural fission of U 236 .

This is  a lower limit since, depending on the impurities in the pitchblende,  fewer neutrons may be captured in uranium. We have also as-  sumed that the 235 isotope of uranium is the most unstable to-  wards natural fission. The theoretical estimate of the half-life of  this process (10 15 years) is discussed in chapter 8.     ** Fermi and Segre, Phys.

Experiments to measure this delay in fission have suc-  ceeded in putting an uppe;r limit of 5 x lO 13 sec on the half -life  of this compound nucleus.".   Feather 46 collected the recoiling fission fragments produced in  a thin uranium foil by fast neutrons. He observed 19 per cent  more recoil activity on the collector on the forward side (relative  to the neutron velocity) than on the backward side. He inter-  preted this as showing that the fission breakup occurred while the  uranium nucleus still had appreciable velocity of recoil left from  the initial neutron impact. Since the time estimated as necessary  for the struck uranium atom to lose its momentum is 5 x 10~" 18  seconds, this is an upper limit on the time in which the fission oc-  curred.   Since it is the compound nucleus which fissions, the bombard-  ing particle not only transfers its kinetic energy to the transmuta-  tion energy, but changes the target nucleus into the compound nu-  cleus. This adds to the excitation energy of the compound nucleus  the binding energy of the bombarding particle (with respect to the  target nucleus) and, consequently, the threshold energies measured  can be simply interpreted only in the case of photofission. In the  other cases the observed threshold energy must be added to the  binding energy and then applied to the compound nucleus. Table  1 summarizes some of these data. Binding energies and more  complete data are given in chapter 7.   The other results discussed in this chapter are summarized in  table 2 which gives the observed production of fission for various  nuclei and agents.   46 N. Feather, Nature 143, 1027 (1939).     CHAPTER 3   FISSION FRAGMENTS   Enormous energy of recoil fragments. Meitner and Frisch 47  realized that if fission of uranium were to occur, the energy re-  leased in the process would be large and should consequently give  rise to high energy recoil fragments. These are easy to detect,  and very soon Frisch, 48 and within a few days Joliot, 49 detected  these fission recoil particles.   A crude but simple picture accounts for the energy release.  At the instant of fission, two highly positively charged groups of  nuclear particles break apart. They have typical charge numbers of  Zi=-f"54 and Z 2 =+38, and are initially at a distance d, of  about 1.5 X 10' 12 cm apart (center to center). The energy of  mutual electrostatic coulomb repulsion, E, is simply   Z 1 Z 2 e*   E = 200 Mev.   d   This energy divided between the recoiling particles endows them  each with roughly 100 Mev. Not all this energy goes into kinetic  energy, and the uneven splitting makes one particle heavier than  the other, thus reducing its share of the energy. We shall see that  experimental observations are consistent with this picture.   This relatively great energy makes the recoil fragments easy  to detect and observe. The total ionization produced is more than  ten times that of the most energetic alpha particle. Consequently,  ionization chambers easily detect individual fission particles.  Cloud chambers show dense tracks when recoil particles pass.  Photographic plates also show recoil particle tracks. The recoil  obviously tears fission fragments loose from the uranium surface.  They can then be collected on a neighboring sheet and detected by  their radioactivity.   All these methods have been used to detect fission and to  measure the range, energy, energy loss and other characteristics  of the fission fragments.   47 Meitner and Frisch, Nature 143, 239 (1939).

Many early fission experiments  utilized the relatively simple method of collecting the recoil frag-  ments and observing their radioactivity. Joliot, 50 Thibaud 61  and McMillan 52 used this method to measure the range of the re-  coil fragments. McMillan stacked thin aluminum foils (0.57 mg/  cm 2 thick) and laid them on top of a uranium slab. On irradia-  tion with neutrons, the fission fragments recoiled into the stack of  foils. By measuring the radioactivity in each foil separately he  obtained a rough absorption curve. The activity curve dropped to  background activity at a depth in the stack corresponding to a  range of 22 0.2 cm air equivalent.   Joliot found a range of about 10 microns in UO 2 , whereas  Thibaud observed a range of about 5 microns in aluminum.   At Columbia 53 the range in air was measured by the use of a  flat, thin ionization chamber. The source of fission recoils was  fixed relative to the ionization chamber, but the pressure of the  air could be varied to get a curve showing the number of fragments  penetrating different equivalent thicknesses of standard air. They  found evidence for two groups of recoils of ranges 2.2 0.1 cm  and about 1.5 cm. Range values given by Haxel 54 are 1.8 0.24  and 1.5 0.2 cm.   Several investigators 55 observed cloud chamber tracks of  fission recoils soon after the discovery of fission. Corson and  Thornton estimated a range of about 3 cm. However, the most  accurate work has been done by the Danish group 56 in Bohr's lab-  oratory. They observed two groups of recoil tracks with ranges  of 2.5 0.2 cm and 1.9 0.2 cm.   These short ranges are obviously due to the high charge of  the fragments, which results in a large energy loss in passing  through matter. They also explain why fission fragments were  not detected in previous searches for high energy alpha particles  from the postulated reaction U (n,a). A thin absorber was or-  dinarily placed over the uranium to cut out the natural alpha parti-  cles, which have an energy of 4.13 Mev and a range of 2.37 cm in  air. This absorber automatically also cut out the fission fragments.   50 F. Joliot, Comptes Rendus 208, 341 (1939) ; J. de Phys.

The most direct way to measure  the energy released in the fission process is to measure the heat  produced in a calorimeter by a known number of fissions. Hen-  derson 68 did this by measuring simultaneously the rise in temp-  erature of a calorimeter filled with 13.36 gm of metallic uranium  and the number of fissions in an adjacent ionization chamber con-  taining a thin layer of uranium (54 micrograms) when the appara-  tus was exposed to neutrons. The "atomic powers" observed  were about 40 microwatts. After making appropriate corrections  and calculations, Henderson obtained a value of 177 it 2 Mev for  the energy per fission. This excludes energy emitted in the form  of hard gamma rays and neutrinos but includes soft radiation and  short-lived beta emission energy. Consequently, the kinetic energy  of the recoiling particles should be somewhat less than this.   A more direct method of measuring recoil energies is to ob-  serve the ionization produced by the recoils, which can be readily  compared to the ionization produced by alpha particles of known  energy. This has been done by many investigators and the follow-  ing results are apparently the most carefully measured :   Ej E} E   Haxel w 52 Mev 74 Mev   Booth, Dunning and Slack 80 50 80   Jentschke and Prankl 61 61 98 Kanner and Barschall * 65 97 159   The quantities 1 and 2 are ionization energies (assuming the  mean energy per ion pair is the same for fission recoil particles as  for alpha particles) of the most numerous particles in each of the  two groups of particles usually observed. Jentschke and Prankl's  values agree well with those of Kanner and Barschall, whose re-  sults seem quite reliable. Kanner and Barschall also measured  both recoils simultaneously and got a total ionization energy, E,  of 159 Mev. Since 12 Mev is a reasonable average energy ex-  pended in beta ray emission by the radioactivity recoil particles,  this total ionization energy plus reasonable beta ray energy is 171  Mev, which compares well with Henderson's calorimeter value of  177 Mev per fission.   51 Myssowsky and Idanoff, Nature 143, 794 (1939) ; Lark-Horovitz and   Miller, Phys.

FISSION FRAGMENTS     The half width of the peaks corresponding to the two groups of  recoils is about 18 Mev, so that the groups overlap. The half  width of the peak for total ionization is 30 Mev. This is not en-  tirely experimental error but is a result of the statistical fashion  in which the fission breakup occurs. However, the number of  particles in each group is the same, indicating that in each fission  one recoil is of one group while the other recoil is of the second  group. Consequently, we can calculate the masses of the most  probable fragments by assuming conservation of momentum and  by taking Kanner and BarschaH's values of EI and 2 . These  masses are 96 and 143, in agreement with the observed fission  product masses listed in table 4.   Lark-Horovitz 63 has investigated the fission recoils, using the  high energy neutrons from Li (d,n) in a cyclotron. His prelimin-  ary results suggest three groups of fragments with energies of 52,  86 and 110 Mev and some recoils with energies as high as 135 Mev.  Total energy measurements gave 172 Mev, with some values up to  200 Mev. These effects were interpreted by Lark-Horovitz as  evidence for (a) asymmetric fission, 52 and 110 Mev peaks, (b)  symmetric fission, 86 Mev peak, and (c) triple fission, total ener-  gies of 200 Mev. Other evidence in fission product identification  confirms the increasing probability of symmetric fission at higher  neutron energies.   Energy loss of recoil fragments.

The principal work has been  done in Bohr's laboratory 64 with a statistical analysis of their beau-  tiful cloud chamber pictures of fission recoil tracks (see figures 5  and 6).   The tracks are easily distinguishable from alpha particle  tracks by their heavy ionization and the number of heavily ionized  "branches' J due to collisions with gas nuclei. By counting the  branchings as a function of residual range and using appropriate  formulae, it is possible to show the existence of two groups of re-  coils and to calculate the range-energy curve near the end. This  curve can be extended to the initial conditions and an energy loss  curve deduced. Such curves are shown in figures 7 and 8.   An important consideration in interpreting the energy loss  is the effective nuclear charge of the fragment. The recoils are  not entirely stripped of their electrons; those electrons remain  whose binding energies exceed the kinetic energy of electrons in  the material relative to the recoiling nucleus. Lamb 66 estimated  the initial charge to be -\-\7e for the light fragment and +130  for the heavy one. A measurement of the radius of curvature of  fission recoils in a magnetic field has been made by Lassen. 66 He  identified the group to which the particles belong by their ioniza-  tion energy in the ionization chamber detector. The low energy  group of recoils contains the fragments of heavy mass. Since the  recoils have equal momenta, the Hp (magnetic field times the radi-  us of curvature) should be proportional to the reciprocal of the  effective charge. The low energy, heavy mass group was found to  have slightly lower Hp and consequently larger charge. But our  previous consideration indicated that the lighter mass had the  higher velocity and hence a larger charge. Lassen suggests that  the recoil particles were not in equilibrium with matter in the Hp  measurements. In any case, Lassen calculates the light group to  have a charge of -f-200 and the heavy group +220.   In connection with this question of charge Lamb 67 has sug-  gested that the difference in energy loss and consequent range of  the two groups of fragments might be primarily due to a difference   M Theoretical articles: N.

CHAPTER 4  FISSION PRODUCTS   When fission occurs in one of the heavier elements of the  periodic table the fragments into which it splits are atoms of the  elements occurring in the middle region of the table. These atoms  are at first highly unstable and change by radioactive disintegra-  tion into the stable nuclei observed in nature. It is the purpose  of this chapter to describe qualitatively some of the processes by  which these transformations occur and to indicate some of the  methods available for determining what nuclei are produced and  the probability of their production.   A variety of questions require information on the type of  nuclei produced by fission and on the radiations they emit. Be-  cause of the possibility that these products may absorb many of  the neutrons needed to produce fission, it might be difficult to  realize a chain reacting pile that could operate for a reasonable  period of time (see page 150). There is also the question of the  effects on personnel of the radioactivity of the products in chain  reacting piles. Information of this type would be needed to deter-  mine the duration and intensity of radiations in regions that have  experienced large scale exposure to fissioning materials and their  products. In the production and use of radioactive tracers de-  scribed on page 242 knowledge of the efficiency of production and  half-lives of the obtainable products would of course be necessary.  The distribution in mass of fission products is useful for checking  theories of the mechanism of fission as explained on page 89.   Immediately following the work of Hahn and Strassmann, 68  which definitely identified* fission as such, a large number of papers  appeared in the literature in which their observations were con-  firmed and more products identified. Seaborg compiled a table of  isotopes that includes all the products that had been observed prior  to June 1, 1944. 69 This table also includes the types of radio-  activity observed, their half-lives, energies and methods of meas-  urement; also given are the types of fission that produced these  products and a complete bibliography of references.

The previous chapter describes  the process of fission itself, and it will be discussed in more detail  in chapters 7 and 8. Immediately after the fissioning nucleus  breaks up, we have two particles flying apart with enormous ener-  gies of approximately 80 Mev each. The sum of the charges on these  fragments is probably equal to the charge on the original nucleus.  The sum of their masses is two or three mass units less than  the mass of the original owing to the instantaneous emission of  neutrons upon fission (see page 44). Initially, as we have seen  roughly 15 electrons are missing from the electron shell, but as the  particles slow down they acquire more electrons until they come  to rest and are complete atoms.   However, the nuclei of these new atoms are highly unstable.  The ratio of neutrons to protons in goU 235 is about 1.5, and it is  reasonable to expect that the direct products of fission would have  approximately the same ratio, not allowing for the instantaneous  neutrons emitted. In a typical reaction in which the protons split  40 to 52 we would get     The heaviest known stable isotope of zirconium is 4oZr 90 , and  for tellurium it is 5 2Te 130 . Perhaps a more realistic viewpoint,  anticipating the actual decay process, is to say that if a nucleus of  mass 97 is to be stable it must have at least 42 protons, and a  nucleus of mass 137 requires 56 protons. These nuclei would be  stable 42 Mo 97 and seBa 187 . In either case it is evident that the  neutron-proton ratio of the direct fission products must be re-  duced by some transformation until a stable nucleus is reached.  Two processes are available: beta emission and neutron emission.  Decay mechanisms. The most important decay mechanism is  the emission of beta rays, >tehen a neutron in the nucleus is con-  verted into a proton, and an electron is ejected. These electrons,  or beta rays, do not all have the same energy but may have any  energies from zero up to some maximum characteristic of the par-  ticular nucleus. An important feature of beta rays is that, like  other radioactive processes, their rate of decay follows an expo-  nential law. The half-life of this decay is a characteristic property  of the nucleus and may be measured to aid in identifying the prod-  uct. Evidently a beta ray emission decreases the number of neu-  Revised May 15, 1946.     24 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   trons by unity and increases the number of protons a like amount.   The second process is neutron emission. This is much less  frequent and occurs only about once for every 500 beta emissions.  Since this process is not used in identifying fission products, it is  merely mentioned here. It will be discussed in chapter 5.   Fission products would not be expected to disintegrate by  K-electron capture or positron emission, since both processes in-  crease the neutron-proton ratio rather than decrease it. Similarly,  alpha particles which would decrease the number of neutrons and  protons by equal amounts, and hence increase the ratio slightly,  have not been observed.   An effect observed to accompany most other types of radio-  active disintegration is the emission of gamma rays. This does  not change the neutron-proton ratio but is merely a mechanism by  which a nucleus can emit the excess energy resulting when a parti-  cle emission leaves the resultant nucleus in an excited state. The  gamma ray is usually observed so soon after the particle emission  that it appears as if it were part of the same process. Usually  the particle is ejected from the parent nucleus and the daughter  nucleus then emits the gamma ray. If the nuclear transition that  produces the gamma ray is strongly forbidden, the probability for  the emission will be small and a measurable half-life may be ob-  served. A nucleus that has a measurable half-life for this gamma  radiation is said to be in a metastable state. A nucleus in such a  state is said to be isomeric with respect to the ground state into  which it can fall by emitting a gamma ray. Hence, isomcrs are  nuclei that have the same number of neutrons and protons but dif-  ferent energy states. The transition that produces the gamma ray  is an isomeric transition. The fact that gamma rays have line  spectra of immeasurable line breadth is evidence of well-defined  nuclear energy levels.   Secondary effects due to the emission of gamma rays can also  be used to identify fission products. Frequently a gamma ray  leaving a nucleus ejects a photoelectron from one of the X ray  levels of the atom in which it originated. This process is called  internal conversion. Internally converted electrons have a discrete  energy spectrum, since they are produced from a definite energy  level in the atom by gamma rays of definite energy. A further  consequence of internal conversion is that when the vacancy in the  X ray level is filled, characteristic X rays are produced, and these  can be used to identify the element.

The disintegration  series shown are two that have actually been observed. This does  not necessarily mean that these series do result from the same fis-  sion process, but they have been observed and the numbers of neu-  trons and protons are such that it is a possible reaction. The iso-  merism of 54Xe 137 found in transmutation experiments 71 and in-  dicated in table 4 has not been reported among fission products.   Table 4 lists all the series of this type that have been reported,  including the latest values as given on Segre's chart. Isotopes of  a particular element occur in horizontal rows; radioactive series  of isobars of a particular mass appear in vertical columns. Each  square contains the half-life for beta ray emission and the maxi-  mum energy of these beta rays expressed in Mev. The squares  divided by a vertical line give information for two isomeric states  of the nucleus and the times indicated in squares marked by aster-  isks are the half-lives of gamma rays in the isomeric transitions.  The letters in the upper left corner of each square have the follow-  ing meanings :   A isotope certain (mass number and element certain)   B isotope probable, element certain   C one of few isotopes   D element certain   E element probable   F insufficient evidence   An M in a square indicates that the nucleus is believed to belong  to the series but that its activity has never been reported. The  stable nuclei are marked by S.   Early X ray identification. The identification of fission prod-  ucts first reported in this country was made by Abelson 72 using the  characteristic X rays produced by internal conversion as described  above. The X rays had been observed a year earlier coming from a  neutron-irradiated sample of uranium. Their absorption by cop-  per had been studied and yielded results that might be expected  from a transuranic element by internal conversion. The discrepan-  cy between expected and observed values was attributed to poor  geometry. However, after Hahn and Strassmann reported fission,  the experiment was repeated with a stronger sample and several  different absorbing materials were used. It was found that the   "E. P.

Figure 10 shows a schematic diagram of the absorp-  tion coefficients of indium (Z=49) and tin (Z=50), and super-  imposed on it are the iodine K a and K0 lines. It is seen that  the K a and K0 radiations would both be strongly absorbed in  indium, whereas only the K0 would be appreciably absorbed in tin.  This would produce just the effect observed, and so the X ray  emitting substance was identified as iodine. Using the same meth-  od Feather and Bretscher 73 arrived at the same conclusion inde-  pendently.   The complete process consists of emission of a beta ray of 77  hour half-life by a tellurium atom, changing it to iodine ; the iodine  nucleus then emits a gamma ray that is internally converted, thus  producing the X ray.     diogrmm of troy cAorcf*r/*fic     to ?///> ofctorpNort of MM 77*r. octMty from  Vronivm fiuton.

The procedures most widely used in identifying fission pro-  ducts involve various combinations of chemical separations and  measurements of radioactive constants. We shall describe the  processes and phenomena first and then proceed to indicate how  they are used to obtain the desired information.   Chemical separation methods. If a uranium compound is  irradiated with a beam of neutrons from a cyclotron for about an  hour the fissions will produce minute amounts (less than micro-  micrograms) of many products, each of which decays with a  characteristic half-life to some daughter product. We desire to  know which isotopes are present, from what isotopes they were   "Feather and Bretscher, Nature 143, 516 (1948).     FISSION PRODUCTS 31   produced and into what they will decay. There are three principal  desiderata to be considered for the chemical separations. Evident-  ly they must be specific for one element. We also desire that they  may be performed quickly, especially for investigation of short half-  lives of direct fission products. Lastly, the methods should be  semiquantitative, particularly for the determination of branching  ratios (see page 40).   The first requirement can be satisfied by fairly standard meth-  ods of oxidation and reduction, precipitation and extraction. By  reasonable compromise all three can be satisfied sufficiently for  many identifications. Details of methods used would take too much  space to include here, but they can be found in several papers on  fission products. 74 However, it is interesting to point out a few  methods that are particularly applicable to this work.   One common practice is the use of carriers. The separation  of such minute quantities of elements as are produced by fission is  not easily accomplished by ordinary chemical means. However,  added extra chemicals (generally additional quantities of the sub-  stance to be separated) will often "carry" the interesting small  amounts along with them in a reaction (see page 231).   The recoil that a nucleus experiences when disintegration or  radiation occurs provides a method of separating the different types  of disintegrating nuclei of the same element The nuclei to be sep-  arated are used in the preparation of a compound that can be sep-  arated by the Szilard-Chalmers method. 75 When one of the nuclei  to be separated ejects a photon or particle, the recoil is frequently  sufficient to break the chemical bond that holds the atom in the  compound. If the compound used is such that interchange among  the freed atoms and those still in compound cannot occur, the freed  atoms can then be separated and their disintegration characteristics  measured without interference from other products.   There are two methods of particular interest for studying  xenon and its parents and daughters. The first uses "emanating  samples" described by Langsdorf and Segre. 76 Iodine and bro-  mine are first distilled with carriers from the irradiated uranium  solution into a dilute sulphite solution. Iodine alone is oxidized  to the free state by adding ferric chloride and then extracted with  carbon tetrachloride. The iodine may then be transferred to an   74 P. Abelson, Phys.

The iodine produces xenon by beta decay, and this xenon,  emanating from the silica gel, can then be collected in another  chamber where its activity can be measured without contamination  due to other radiations. In the other method, 77 the radioactive  xenon is passed into or through a chamber consisting of a grounded  metal cylinder around a central electrode at a high negative po-  tential. When the xenon disintegrates by beta emission it becomes  a positively charged cesium ion which is attracted to the negative  electrode and deposited as cesium. This electrode can then be  removed quickly and the radiations from the cesium measured.  These methods are useful also for the study of krypton and its  genetically related isobars.   Radioactivity measurements. Standard procedures are known  for determining characteristics of disintegration processes and only  brief mention of a few of them will be made here. More complete  discussions can be found in several sources. 78   The beta particles emitted in radioactive decay are charged  particles of sufficient energy to produce ionization in the medium  through which they pass. One convenient method, of detecting  and measuring this ionization is by means of a gas-filled chamber,  in which an electric field is used to collect the ions produced. (This  chamber should have a suitable window for admitting the particles.)  The amount of charge collected on one insulated electrode in the  ionization chamber can be measured with an electrometer, or an  electronic circuit can be used to amplify the current. The amount  of ionization is a measure of the rate of occurrence of disintegra-  tions, which is called the activity of the source. Another method  is to expose a charged electroscope to the radiation whose intensity  is to be measured. 79 The rate of discharge is then a measure of the activity.   The energies of the particles can be measured by observing the  radii of curvature of their paths in a magnetic field, either by photo-  graphing their tracks in a Wilson cloud chamber or by using a  beta-ray spectrograph. 80   " Glasoe and Steigman, Phys.

FISSION PRODUCTS 33   Also useful are the results of beta-ray absorption experiments,  which are performed by inserting varying thicknesses of absorbers  between the source and the measuring device. The transmitted  intensity is plotted as a function of absorber thickness. The inci-  dent electrons have an energy distribution that would not be ex-  pected to give a simple result in such an experiment and since  electrons are so light, their scattering in matter is very compli-  cated. However, with the essential requirements of "good geo-  metry" these effects combine to give an almost exactly exponential  absorption up to a certain limit of thickness.   Elementary theory of beta disintegration. A theory of the  mechanism of beta disintegration, which accounts for the pheno-  mena observed when activity and energy measurements are made,  was developed by Fermi 81 and a summary of that theory will be  given here. The distribution in energy of beta particles is found to  be of the type shown in figure 11. Significant features of this curve  are: (1) a continuous distribution up to some maximum energy,  o, exists; (2) the most probable energy of a particle is approxi-  mately one-third of this maximum; and (3) the curve approaches  zero at high energies with a small slope.      Fig. 11. Typical beta ray spectrum.   The first of these facts leads to a postulation of the neutrino.  The parent and daughter nuclei involved in a beta disintegration  have discrete energy levels and yet the beta particles emitted give  a continuous spectrum. If we keep the law of conservation of en-  ergy we must postulate another particle, the neutrino, as yet un-  detected, which carries off some of the energy (and spin and angu-  lar momentum). Thus we can interrupt the emission of a beta  particle as a process in which one of the neutrons in the nucleus  is transformed into a proton, an electron and a neutrino, according   to the reaction   oM i ^^i+^+^o (2)   The sum of the energies of the electron and neutrino emitted is the  81 E. Fermi, Zeits. fur Phys. 88, 161 (1934).     34 NUCLEAR FISSION A&P ATOMIC ENERGY   maximum of the energy distribution, e . To solve the problem of  beta disintegration one must calculate the probability of this reac-  tion.   A new type of interaction was postulated by Fermi which  would produce the transformation indicated in equation 2 and the  probability calculation is analogous to the determination of optical  transition probabilities among electron levels of the atom. Inte-  grating a suitable combination of operators and wave functions 82  over the coordinates of the nucleus, we get the probability that the  transformation will occur, resulting in emission of a beta particle  with energy between e and e+de. This function is of the same  general nature as that shown in figure 11 except that the most  probable energy is l /2 e . Konopinski 83 has made a thorough an-  alysis of many experiments on beta emission and indicates that the  actual distribution is probably more nearly that given by Fermi's  function. He attributes the shape of the experimental curves to  the use of thick samples and other spurious effects. He concludes  that Fermi's original theory is to be preferred to the modifications  suggested by Konopinski and Uhlenbeck, 84 but that the Gamow-  Teller 85 selection rules give better agreement with experimentally  observed intensities than do the Fermi rules.   The third characteristic of the energy distribution curves re-  quires that the mass of the neutrino be very nearly zero ; for it can  be shown from the equations derived for transition probabilities  that if the mass of the neutrino is comparable with that of the elec-  tron the upper end of the energy distribution curve should approach  zero with a vertical tangent. As this is not usually observed, it is  concluded that the neutrino mass is small. In fact, from a meas-  urement of the C 13 (p,n) N 18 reaction threshold and the known  positron energy in the decay of N 18 to C 13 , Haxby, Shoupp, Steph-  ens and Wells 86 conclude that the neutrino mass is less than one-  tenth of the mass of the electron:   Decay curve characteristics. If the probability derived above  is integrated over all energies we get the total probability of decay  per unit time. This is frequently called the disintegration con-  stant, A. If there are N of these atoms, the rate of decay, or activity  will be simply \N.

This gives an  exponential curve for the activity which is exactly what is ob-  served if we start with a nucleus that decays by one beta emission  to a stable daughter substance.

Consider first the relatively simple case of  one nucleus that decays into a daughter substance, which in turn  disintegrates to a stable element. If the parent half -life (7\) is  very short compared to that of its daughter (T 2 ), the parent dis-  appears in a short time, producing the daughter substance which  then decays with its own half -life. Figure 12 shows the number  of atoms of each substance as a function of time and in figure 13  the logarithm of the activity is plotted against time. There would  be no difficulty in measuring each of these half-lives. However,  suppose 7\>T2, so that the daughter disintegrates almost as fast  as it is formed. The corresponding curves in this case are shown  in figures 14 and 15, from which it is seen that even in this simple  case only an estimate of the daughter activity can be obtained with-  out separating it from the parent.   To measure half-lives and establish parent-daughter relation-  ships in the complicated situations that could occur, it is evident  that special techniques must be employed. Actually, these tech-  niques are merely applications of partial knowledge already ob-  tained. To indicate how some of these determinations are made, a  brief account of a few of the actual early experiments will be given.  It will he helpful to our understanding of why certain procedures  were useful and necessary, to consult the table of activities, table 4,  although undoubtedly the original determination of these methods  resulted from a certain amount of trial and error.     FISSION PRODUCTS     37     Classification of activities. Abelson 87 used some interesting  methods in classifying 16 activities resulting from fission and we  shall discuss first the series     5 min.     77 hr.     2.4 hr.     54 Xe (stable).     It was found that if tellurium was separated a week after irradia-  tion of a uranium compound, curve I in figure 16 was obtained for  thfc activity. This is the type described in the preceding section  for which the daughter half-life is considerably shorter than that  of the parent. When iodine was separated from the tellurium  precipitates, the half-life measured was 2.4 hours with no contami-  nating activities appearing (curve II, figure 16). From the values  of the half-lives, table 5, we see that after one week only the 77-  hour, 32-day and 90-day tellurium activities would be present in  appreciable quantities. As the daughter product of the 90-day  tellurium is stable and none has been detected for the 32-day sub-  stance, we can understand the appearance of only the 2.4-hour ac-  tivity when the iodine was separated.   Meitner, Hahn and Strassmann 88 had reported 66 hours for  the half-life of the activity here reported as 77 hours. This result  could have arisen from the mixture of the 77-hour and 30-hour iso-  topes and a method of periodic separations of iodine was used to  clear up the confusion. The iodine separations were made at per-  iodic intervals after precipitation of the tellurium. The activity of  the 2.4-hour iodine was then measured immediately after each sep-  aration, and this activity was a measure of the amount of tellurium     1 Composite eurv* of 77 hr. ttlturium  and 24hr. iodin*.

The results confirmed the 77-hour value  (curve III, figure 16).   Abelson also proved the report of a 59-minute parent of the  77-hour tellurium to be in error. Tellurium precipitates from an  irradiated uranium sample were made at 10-minute intervals and  immediate determinations of the 77-hour activity were made by  measuring both the beta activity and the X ray intensity. The  results, in table 5, indicate a 5-minute parent, although it is not  necessarily antimony. The same decay characteristics would be  obtained if a 5-minute tin decayed to a very short-lived antimony,  which then went to tellurium.   The 2.4-hour iodine was thought to give stable xenon because  a fast iodine separation from the 77-hour tellurium gave a strictly  exponential decay. The half-life of any daughter would be less  than 1 minute or greater than 100 days. Thus we have a complete  account of the genetic relationships among the elements of this ra-  dioactive series. Unreported research has apparently confirmed  these observations, for mass number 136 has been assigned to the  series and the end product is given as 5 4 Xe 136 on Segre's chart.   Abelson's work on the series of mass number 129 is also inter-  esting as an illustration of the Szilard-Chalmers separation method  and of the value of comparing observations with those of nuclear  transmutation experiments. The series of isobars is short:   4.2 hr 72 min   51 Sb 12 ' > B2 Te 12 > 5sl 129   The upper isomer of Te 129 has not been reported among fission  products, although it does exist. The iodine nucleus is not ob-  served in nature, but its mode of decay has not been determined.   An irradiated sample of uranium was allowed to age for 6  hours, at which time antimony was precipitated. Consulting table  4, we see that this would give a mixture of isotopes of masses 127.     FISSION PRODUCTS 39   128 and 129, However, owing to the small percentage abundance  of mass 127 and its long half -life (see branching ratios, page 41  and table 4), its effect on the 4.2-hour activity would be negligible.  The effect of the 128 isotope is not negligible. However, the tellu-  rium in the 128 series is not radioactive, so that if tellurium is now  separated from the antimony precipitate, only the 72-minute activi-  ty of 52Te 129 is measured. This also permits an accurate determi-  nation of the 4.2-hour antimony half -life by a series of periodic sep-  arations of tellurium. Just as in the case illustrated in figure 16,  periodic separations of tellurium and measurements of the initial  activities give a measure of the rate of disintegration, hence of the  half -life of its parent antimony.   The determination of the mass number of the series as 129 re-  sulted from the fact that the 72-minute half-life observed for tellu-  rium was the same as that reported for the lower isomer of Te 120  produced by the reaction Te 128 (d,p) Te 129 . To confirm the iden-  tification, beta-ray absorption curves were taken of the activities.  The tellurium produced by the deuteron bombardment contained  both the upper and lower isomers of Te 129 . In order to measure  the 72-minute activity of the lower isomer it first had to be sepa-  rated from the mixture. This was accomplished by the Szilard-  Chalmers method described on page 31. The recoil produced by  the 0.1 Mev gamma ray was sufficient to release the lower isomer  from compound and appreciable intensity was attained. When  the resulting absorption curves from the two sources were com-  pared, they agreed over a factor of 100 in intensity and so the  mass number of the series is assigned as 129.   Products from various types of fission. Products of fission of  /235 by s i ow (i.e., thermal) neutrons are the most thor-  oughly investigated at present. The resulting series arrange them-  selves largely into two main groups ; the masses in the heavy group  range from about 127 to 147 and in the light group the range is  about 105 to 80. However, it is not expected that for each series  in the heavy group there is a corresponding series in the light group  such that the sum of their masses is constant. One reason for this  is the variation in the number of neutrons released at the time of  fission.   At the head of each column of table 4 the reaction that pro-  duced the observed series is indicated. 89 The notation U- refers  to thermal neutrons except for the series of masses 111 and 112.  These series resulted from bombarding uranium or thorium with   89 These data are taken from Seaborg, Rev. Mod. Phya. 16, 1 (1944).     40 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   neutrons of energies greater than 10 Mev, 90 and correspond to  symmetric fission in contrast to the asymmetric fission produced  by slow neutrons. Lark-Horovitz and Schreiber 91 used fast neu-  trons and obtained a peak in the curve of number of fissions versus  energy of fragments, which they attribute to symmetric fission.  They also noted that the asymmetric peaks extend to higher and  lower energies, indicating greater numbers of highly asymmetric  fissions.   Langer and Stephens 92 reported that the ratio of the initial  activities of strontium and barium produced by gamma ray fission  is the same as for slow neutron fission. Several iodine activities  have been reported from bombardment of uranium with alpha par-  ticles, but further search has apparently not been made. Identifi-  cation of the products from fission induced by protons and deuter-  ons have not yet been reported.   Branching ratios. In addition to knowing what isotopes are  produced, and the genetic relationships among them, it would be  desirable to know how much of each isotope is produced. This  would give more specific knowledge as to the intensity of certain  types of radiations and would also allow more accurate calculations  of the seriousness of poisoning caused by the products generated in  piles. Any theory of the fission mechanism will predict a general  trend in the distribution of products, and one useful check of its  xtelidity would be a comparison with quantitative measurements  of the type to be described. Anderson, Fermi and Grosse 93 started  a systematic study of this problem, but only one set of data on slow  neutron fission of uranium was reported.   The object is to determine the percentage of fissions that re-  sult in a particular radioactive series of the type discussed above.  This percentage is called the branching ratio of that series. It is  assumed that none of the radioactive series branches into others, on  the basis that disintegrations observed are almost exclusively by  beta emission. Then a determination of the percentage of fissions  producing any element in that series is its branching ratio, R. An  idealized way of determining this number is to irradiate uranium  for such a long time that eventually the numbers of atoms of all  members of the series become constant. Then the activities of  all the members would be equal, since the rate of production of any  member equals its rate of decay and this activity is just equal to  R times the rate of fission production. Thus a measurement of this   "Segre and Seaborg, Phys. Rev. 59, 212 (1941); Nishina, Yasaki, Kim-   ura and Ikawa, Phys. Rev. 59, 677 (1941).  w Lark-Horovitz and Schreiber, Phys. Rev. 60, 156 (1941).  Langer and Stephens, Phys. Rev. 58. 759 (1940).  "Anderson, Fermi and Grosse, Phys. Rev. 59, 52 (1941).     FISSION PRODUCTS 41   rate of fissioning and of any one activity in the series would give  the branching ratio. It is seen that in the actual experiment a cor-  rection will be necessary for the finite time of irradiation and that  this correction will involve knowing the half-lives of all elements  preceding the one on which the measurement is made. However,  if one of these half-lives is not known accurately, it is relatively  unimportant provided it is short and not preceded by any long-  lived ancestors. This means that the lack of precise information  on direct fission products is not too serious.   To determine the rate of fission production, the uranium solu-  tion used in the experiment was replaced by a solution of manga-  nese sulphate of such strength that the manganese atoms absorbed  approximately as many neutrons as the uranium. Then the activ-  ity of these manganese atoms was measured and multiplied by the  ratio of cross section for fission to cross section for capture by man-  ganese, to obtain the rate of fission production. Only one measure-  ment of this type was necessary for uranium solutions of the same  composition, for it could be used to calibrate a gold foil that was  then used to monitor the neutron intensity in subsequent irradia-  tions.   A further correction was required to account for the varia-  tion in absorption of different beta rays with energy. In most  activity measurements we desire only to know how a particular  activity varies with time, but here we must know the absolute mag-  nitude of the activity and hence allowance must be made for ab-  sorption in the counting arrangement used. This is sometimes  difficult to determine accurately because of the difficulty in separ-  ating the desired activity from that of its products and this ac-  counts for the doubtful figure indicated for the series with mass  number 135.   The results of this experiment are shown in the bottom row  of the table of fission products, table 4, where the value given is  the R for that series. The values for the series with masses of 131,  132, 133, 135 and 136 were determined from separations of iodine.  Procedures similar to that described on page 30 were used to  isolate each activity from the others. Columns 127 and 129 were  obtained by separation of antimony; columns 139 and 140 by meas-  urements of barium. The only series in the light group, mass  number 97, was determined from the zirconium.   It would be expected that the sums of the branching ratios in  each group, the heavy and light, would be approximately 100,  whereas the reported values total only about 50. Measurements  on other series will, of course, bring this value up, but Anderson,  Fermi and Grosse suggest that their measurement of the rate of     42 NUCLMAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   fission production may be in error. Smyth (8.17) reports that the  most abundant fission product constitutes a little less than 10 per  cent of the total, which probably means that the branching ratio for  that series is nearly 20. This is appreciably larger than the value  of 12 for the series of mass 132, which Anderson, Fermi and  Grosse found to have the largest branching ratio.     CHAPTER 5   SECONDARY NEUTRONS   The nuclei that result from the fission of uranium have an  excess of neutrons over the stable nuclei of the same atomic num-  ber. This excess may be relieved, as we have already seen, by the  emission of beta particles at each emission a neutron changing  into a proton and the nucleus increasing its atomic number by  unity. At the time of the discovery of fission, it occurred to many  physicists that the excess could also be relieved by the emission of  neutrons at the instant of fission or else by the emission of neu-  trons after a very short time from the highly excited fragment nu-  clei produced in fission. It was suggested also that a fragment  nucleus may have to go through several beta emissions before a  nucleus is reached that could reduce its energy by emitting a neu-  tron. The latter possibility would result in the delayed emission  of neutrons, the delay depending on the half -lives of the previous  beta decay periods. A nucleus that can emit a neutron probably  does so with such an extremely short half-life that this does not  contribute to the delay.   Delayed neutrons. The observation of the delayed emission  of neutrons accompanying fission was reported first. Roberts,  Meyer and Wang 94 exposed uranium to thermal neutrons from a  Li (d,n) source covered with paraffin. The source was then turned  off and the uranium placed in front of a boron-lined ionization  chamber surrounded by paraffin. Neutrons were observed to come  from the uranium for as long as 1V& minutes after the exposure.  The neutrons actually decayed with a half-life of 12. 5 3 seconds.  It was thought possible that the neutrons were produced by gam-  ma rays from the fission products and a hard gamma ray activity  of abotit the same half-life was observed. However, surrounding  activated uranium by more inert uranium did not increase the  number of secondary neutrons emitted, and exposing uranium to  gamma rays from the Li(/>,y) reaction did not produce uranium  that emitted delayed neutrons. Thus it was concluded that the  delayed neutrons resulted from the primary slow neutrons which   * Boberts, Meyer and Wang, Phys. Rev. 55, 510 (1939) ; Eoberts, Haf-  stad, Meyer and Wang, Phys. Rev. 65, 664 (1939).   43     44 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   produced fission in the uranium. From a calibration of the ioniz-  ation chamber with a standard source, the cross section for this  process was determined to be 4 x 10~~~ 26 cm 2 . A study of recoils  in a cloud chamber showed that the energy of the secondary neu-  trons did not exceed IMev. Delayed neutrons could also be pro-  duced by exposing uranium to fast neutrons, but no secondary  neutrons came from uranium exposed to the neutrons of intermedi-  ate energy from the C(d,n) reaction. It is to be recalled that fis-  sion is produced also by fast and slow neutrons but not by neu-  trons of this same intermediate energy. Delayed neutrons were  observed to come also from thorium activated by fast neutrons.   Booth, Dunning and Slack 95 found another half-life, 45 sec-  onds, for delayed neutrons from uranium. At equilibrium the to-  tal number of delayed neutrons emitted per minute was 1/60 of  the number of fissions per minute. If 3 x 10~ 24 cm 2 is taken as  the cross section for fission in natural uranium, the above result  indicates that the cross section for the production of delayed neu-  trons by thermal neutrons is 5 x 10~ 26 cm 2 , in good agreement  with the value given above.   B rostrum, Koch and Lauritsen 96 found delayed neutrons with  half-lives of 3 seconds and 0.1 - 0.3 seconds.   In 1942, Snell, Nedzel and Ibser 97 reexamined this phenome-  non. The method of investigation was similar to the method used  by Roberts, Meyer and Wang discussed at the beginning of this  section. Delayed neutron periods of 57 3 seconds, 24 2 sec-  onds, 7 seconds and 2.5 seconds were observed. The relative in-  tensities of these activities activated to saturation were respectively  0.135, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.2. Nt> activity period longer than 57 seconds  was observed. In a separate experiment it was noted that 1.0 it  0.2 per cent of the neutrons were delayed by at least 0.01 seconds  and that approximately 0.07 per cent were delayed by at least 1  minute.   Instantaneous neutrons. The emission of neutrons immedi-  ately accompanying the fission of uranium was reported by von  Halban, Joliot and Ko war ski. 98 Nothing in the experimental  procedure indicated directly that the observed neutrons were emit-  ted instantaneously. However, more than one neutron was ob-  served for each fission and neutron energies of at least 2 Mev  were observed, so it was assumed that these neutrons did not  come from the same source as the delayed neutrons that were pre-   w Booth, Dunning and Slack, Phys.

In the experiment a Ray Be source of neu-  trons was placed in a large vessel containing a 1.6-molar solution  of uranyl nitrate and the intensity / of neutrons at various dis-  tances r (along one radius) from the source was measured by de-  termining the activity induced in a dysprosium detector placed at r.  It was assumed that the neutron distribution was spherically sym-  metric. A plot was made of /r 2 vs. r as shown in figure 17. It  had been shown that the area under such a curve is proportional  to Qt" f where Q is the rate of production of neutrons and t is the  mean life of a neutron before capture. The experiment was then  repeated with the container filled with 1.6-molar solution of am-  monium nitrate; this solution differed only by 2 per cent in hy-  drogen concentration from the uranium solution. It was to be  expected that the area under the 7r* vs. r curve for the uranium  solution would be smaller than the area under the curve for the  ammonium-nitrate solution, since the mean life t for uranium is  smaller. This is because uranium has a greater total cross sec-  tion for the absorption of thermal neutrons and, more important, a  resonance for the capture of neutrons of 5 ev energy. The res-  onance would result in the capture of neutrons before they reached  thermal energies. However, the area under the uranium curve   * Amaldi and Fermi, Pfet/*.

Rev. 51, 896 (1937).     46 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   was 5 percent greater than area under the curve for the ammoni-  um nitrate solution. Frisch, von Halban and Koch 1 showed that  the introduction of hydrogen or nuclei that merely act to capture  neutrons changes the Ir 2 vs. r curve of a solution in such a way  that the new curve may be made to coincide with the original curve  by multiplying the ordinates by a suitable factor and the abscissae  by another factor ; this cannot be done for the two curves shown in  figure 17. Furthermore, the energy of the primary neutrons was  too small to produce an (n, 2n) reaction. Thus it was concluded  that the increased area was attributable to an increase of Q, that  is, to an increase in the rate of production of neutrons attributable  to the fission reaction. The number of secondary neutrons was cal-  culated to be 3.5 0.7 per fission.   A similar experiment with a better geometrical arrangement  was performed by Anderson, Fermi and Szilard. 2 Cylindrical  cans containing uranium oxide were placed around a central source  of photoneutrons in a cylindrical tank containing a 10 percent sol-  ution of manganese sulphate as shown in figure 18. A total mass  of about 200 kg. of uranium oxide was used. The average neu-  tron density in the solution was determined by first mixing the sol-  ution and then measuring the activity of the manganese in a small  sample. Alternate measurements were taken with the cans filled  with uranium oxide and with empty cans. The activity was 10  percent greater with the uranium oxide present than without it.  It was therefore concluded that more neutrons were produced by  uranium than were absorbed by uranium. A further experiment  determined that 1.5 neutrons were emitted per thermal neutron  absorbed in natural uranium.      A Photo -flitro wore*   8 Paraffin   C - Cd hildt   0-U.O.

SECONDARY NEUTRONS 47   Turner 3 reexamined the data from a similar experiment per-  formed by von Pfalban, Joliot, Kowarski and Perrin 4 and found  that the results indicated that 1.7 neutrons were emitted per ther-  mal neutron absorbed.   Zinn and Szilard 5 used a different technique to determine the  number of neutrons produced per fission. Their experimental set-  up is shown in figure 19. The helium-filled ionization chamber  is kept covered with the cadmium shield to keep thermal neutrons  out of the chamber. The lead block shields the chamber from  gamma rays from the photoneutron source. The cadmium shield  around the uranium oxide may be removed, thereby exposing the  uranium to thermal neutrons coming from the paraffin. Fifty  pulses per minute were observed when the oxide was exposed to  thermal neutrons and only five pulses per minute were observed  with the cadmium shield in place. Assuming the collision cross  section of helium for neutrons to be 3.5 X 10~~ 24 cm 2 and taking  into account the solid angle and the size and pressure of the ioniza-  tion chamber, they calculated the total number of neutrons coming  from the uranium oxide. In order to find the number of neutrons  produced per fission, the total number of fissions occurring in the  uranium oxide had to be determined; this was done with the aid  of a separate experiment. The uranium oxide was removed and  the helium ionization chamber was replaced by an ionization cham-  ber lined with a thick layer of uranium oxide. When exposed to  thermal neutrons the new chamber gave 45 fissions per minute.  From the range of fission fragments in uranium oxide, the mass  of uranium oxide producing the 45 fissions per minute was cal-  culated; this permitted the total number of fissions occurring in  the original mass of uranium oxide to be calculated. It was found  that about 2 neutrons were produced per fission. The neutrons  appeared in less than 1 second. The greatest error in the experi-  ment was introduced by the fact that the collision cross section for  helium has resonances. 6 The experiment was repeated with es-  sentially the same apparatus, except that hydrogen recoils were  used to determine the number of neutrons produced per fission.  This experiment gave 2.3 as the number of neutrons produced per  fission, or 1.4 neutrons for each thermal neutron absorbed, in good  agreement with the number 1.5 obtained by Anderson, Fermi and   8 L.

In an ingenious experi-  ment Dode, von Halban, Joliot and Kowarski 8 demonstrated that  secondary neutrons accompanied fission and also obtained a meas-  ure of the secondary neutron energy. In the experiment a Ray-  Be neutron source surrounded by crystallized uranium nitrate was  placed in a large flask containing carbon disulphide. If fast neu-  trons were produced in the uranium, they in turn would produce  radioactive phosphorus by the S 32 (n f p) P 32 reaction. The reac-  tion is endothermic by 0.9 Mev and requires neutrons of at least  2 Mev for a reasonable yield. The primary neutrons do not have  enough energy to produce the reaction. After six days, phosphor-  us was added as a carrier and the phosphorus was separated out  by distillation. The isolated phosphorus gave 32 counts per min-  ute, whereas a run without the uranium gave only 5 counts per  minute. Thus it was concluded that secondary neutrons of at least  2 Mev energy accompany the fission of uranium.      Fig. 20. The energy distribution of secondary neutrons accom-  panying uranium fission.

Using the arrangement shown in figure 19 Zinn and Szilard 9  determined the energy distribution of secondary neutrons by count-  ing the recoil helium nuclei projected in the helium-filled ioniza-  tion chamber.

The pulses  from the chamber were put on an oscilloscope screen along with  time markers. Delays greater than 0.001 second could have been  detected, but no delay was found.   Theoretical estimates place the time for the instantaneous  emission of neutrons at 10~ 14 second (see chapter 8).     CHAPTER 6   HEAVY NUCLEI   The production of new heavy nuclei. Until 1940 there were  elements known only up to atomic number 92 in the periodic table  of the elements and even among these there were several gaps be-  cause no naturally occurring isotopes had been found. Number 82,  lead and one isotope of 83, bismuth, were the heaviest stable ele-  ments. All the isotopes of the elements heavier than those were  naturally unstable and radioactive. Radioactive isotopes, which  filt in the gaps occurring at numbers 43, 61, 85 and 87, had also  been produced in the laboratory. Of the heavy radioactive elements  the most plentiful are the long-lived elements uranium and thori-  um. The isotope U 238 is the parent of the uranium series of na-  tural radioactive isotopes. In this series are found the well known  elements radium, radon and polonium. U 235 is the parent of an-  other radioactive series, called the actinium series, which contains  among the daughter products actinium and the rare element 91,  protactinium. The other naturally occurring series of radioactive  elements starts with thorium, o Th 232 .   In May 1940 the first element beyond the classical list was  found. This was element 93 239 found by McMillan and Abelson 11  at the University of California and called neptunium. This isotope  is formed by the beta decay of 92U 239 produced by radiative neu-  tron capture in o^U 238 as shown below :      23 min   Because of the complications introduced by the fission of uran-  ium and the unexpected chemical behavior of neptunium, this new  element had not been definitely recognized prior to McMillan's  work (see chapter 1).   11 McMillan and Abelson, Phys. Eev. 57, 1185 (1940).   50     HEAVY NUCLEI 51   It was later found 12 that this isotope of neptunium transformed  into plutonium, element 94, by beta decay. The Pu 239 then decays  by alpha emission as shown below :   93 N P 23 > - , 4 P U *+_/?,   2.3 d /  /   94 p u 239 - 92 U 285 +a .   2.4X1 4 yr   This important isotope of plutonium has been produced in  quantity in the piles. After the chemical properties of plutonium  had been established a search was made for plutonium in uranium-  bearing ores. Seaborg and Perlman 13 found an alpha activity that  they attributed to Pu 239 . They estimated that it occurs in pitch-  blende in an amount of 1 part in 10 14 . It is probably produced by  radiative capture by U 238 of neutrons emitted in the spontaneous  fission of uranium (see page 12). However, it was not the first  isotope of plutonium discovered or studied chemically. 94Pu 288  was the first isotope of this element to be discovered, and it was  produced by deuteron bombardment of uranium by Seaborg, Mc-  Millan, Wahl and Kennedy late in 1940. 13a This bombardment  led to the reactions below :     93 N P 238 -   2.0 d /   /   04 P U 238 - >92 Q234 +a 39 on air   SOyrs   This isotope was used for the first studies of the chemical  properties of plutonium, which were done on the ultramicrochemi-  cal scale at a time when only microgram amounts were available.  When the Hanford plutonium plant was later put in operation, a  step-up factor of 10 10 from these microchemical experiments to  quantity production was achieved. 14   Another isotope of neptunium, Np 237 , was discovered in 1942  by Wahl and Seaborg at the University of California.

Nishina, Yasaki, Kimura and Ikawa 19 reported the produc-  tion of UY by IS Mev neutrons on thorium as shown:   90 Th 232 + n 1 - WTh^+onW.   This 9<>Th 231 is UY, which is beta active with a 24.5 hour half-life.   Protactinium 232, with a 1.6 day half -life for beta emission,  has been reported. 20 This might possibly be produced by radia-  tive capture of neutrons by Pa 231 .   Seaborg 21 has reported the production of elements 95 and 96  as a result of the bombardment of U 238 and Pu 239 with very high  energy (40 Mev) helium ions by J. G. Hamilton and his group  at the University of California. (Element 95 is named "ameri-  cium" after the Americas or the New World and element 96 is   Niahina, Yasaki, Ezoe, Kimura and Ikawa, Phys.

Predictions 25 of the behavior of this series were correct in sev-  eral respects. However, the series does not decay through elements  85 and 87 as was suggested, but passes in general through new  isotopes of naturally occurring elements.   The missing heavy nuclei. The reason for the radioactivity  of heavy nuclei and the absence of many heavy nuclei in nature  has long been a problem confronting nuclear physicists. It has  been attributed to a decrease in stability due to the increasing coul-  omb repulsion of the protons, but its specific details require elab-  orate consideration. The limits for stability of nuclei against al-  pha emission and beta emission have been examined by Heisen-  berg. 26 The general aspects of his treatment give a reasonable ac-  count of the known radioactivities although quantitative agreement  is not achieved. The discovery of fission provides another mechan-  ism for instability and was discussed by Turner 27 as an explana-  tion of certain missing heavy elements. While these processes may  not explain every case, they provide a basis for the discussion of the  presence or absence in nature of the very heavy nuclei. The ab-  sence of the 4n+l chain in nature has been discussed by Turner.  His conclusions, together with the deductions that may be drawn  from the recent announcement by Seaborg of the production of ele-  ments 95 and 96, may suggest the reasons for the absence in nature  of this series. The elements that can be considered as starting  points for the series are Th 233 , U 237 , U 233 or Np 237 . Consideration  of the possibilities for their presence or absence in nature should  show why the other radioactive elements of the series are not found  today. The first possibility Th 233 might be produced by an alpha  active U 237 ; however, U 237 has been found to be beta active with  a very short half-life. Any other reaction of the natural radioac-  tive type seems to be equally impossible and therefore Th 283 prob-  ably never existed in nature.   We may next consider the possible parent for U 237 . A beta  active Pa 237 (produced by an alpha active Np 241 ) might give rise  to U 237 . However, since 9 3 Np 241 is probably beta active and not  alpha active, this possibility is also ruled out. An alpha decay  from Pu 241 to produce U 237 seems unlikely since we have already   15 L. A. Turner, Phys. Rev. 57, 950 (1940) ; L. Ponisovsky, Nature, 152,   187 (1943).  ** W.

The third possible parent of the chain to consider is U 233 .  Aside from the reaction given in the series this might be produced  by an alpha or positron emission by 94 Pu 237 or osNp 233 , respec-  tively. Turner's conclusion, however, as seen in table 5, is that  04 Pu 237 is a positron emitter and not an alpha emitter. If 94 Pu 237  is an alpha emitter the half-life might be very short by analogy  with o 4 Pu 238 . Thus there seems to be no long-lived possible par-  ent for U 233 that would produce it by these two reactions.   The last possibility to consider as a direct parent of the 4n + 1  series is 9 8 Np 237 , The reaction given for its production is the beta  decay of U 237 . However, we may consider the possibility of its     HEAVY NUCLEI 57   formation from Am 241 by alpha decay in competition with a rela-  tively high probability for spontaneous fission. The possible par-  ents for oaNp 237 by alpha decay would be     97245____> 9524i__ J( 08 Np2"  or     The half-lives for spontaneous fission for 96 245 would be relatively  short and for 97 245 so short as to assure that none of it would be  left in the rocks of the earth. Since the known plutonium half-  lives are 10 4 and 50 years for Pu 239 and Pu 238 , respectively, it is  possible that the alpha half-lives above may be much shorter than  those for uranium and thorium. The fact that Bi 209 , the end pro-  duct of the chain, does exist may help to support the above ideas  and the conjecture that 95 241 is beta stable and that 9 4 Pu 241 is beta  active. The fact that Bi 200 exists in only a small amount (0.01 per-  cent of Pb 207 ) may show that not much of the parent nonfission-  ing members of this series were originally produced and that they  must have had relatively short half-lives for alpha or beta decay.   The absence of 94 Pu 242 may be accounted for by a short alpha  hall-life or, since oiPu 241 is beta active, a short beta half-life. The  half-lives for spontaneous fission for 9 4 Pu 242 and o 4 Pu 241 are too  long to account for their absence. However, since the alpha half-  lives of Pu 239 and Pu 238 are short compared to what one would  expect for an extrapolation of the Heisenberg nuclear energy sur-  face (see figure 22) and the application of a generalized Geiger  Nuttall relation, it is possible that the other isotopes of plutonium  may have relatively short alpha half-lives. The half-lives for  spontaneous fission are given in table 6. These are taken from  Turner's calculations but corrected to an estimated value of 10 15  years for U 235 (see page 110).   The absence in nature of U 236 is another interesting problem.  If Pu 240 is beta stable, as suggested by Turner, but has a short  alpha half-life, it may originally have formed U 236 . Since the  estimated half-life for U 236 is < '10 7 years or as low as 10 5 years, it  may have disappeared if the age of the rocks of the earth is of the  order of 2 X 10 9 years.     58     NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     Table 6  HALF-LIVES FOR SPONTANEOUS FISSION     z    Element    A    Half-life    92    U    235    10 15 years    92    U    233    1.4 x 10 14 "    93    Np    237    7.6 x 10 13 "    94    Pu    244    6.8 x 10 16 "    94    Pu    242    7.7 x 10 14 "    94    Pu    241    8.0 x 10 13 "    94    Pu    239    1.3 x 10 12 "    94    Pu    238    1.6 x 10 U "    95       243    6.6 x 10 11 "    95       241    1.4 x 10 10 "     These half -lives are calculated from ratios given by Turner, Rev.

The energy predicted from the chart for 8 4Po 213 ,  the C' product of the bismuth chain (or should we call it the nep-  tunium chain?), would be about 8.4 Mev, which is a little low  compared to 9 Mev given by Segre.

CO     CHAPTER 7   THEORY Of FISSION   In this chapter and the next we shall discuss fission and other  nuclear processes in the light of our present ideas about nuclei.  Some parts of this discussion will be important for the later chap-  ters on piles and nuclear chain reactions. The most comprehen-  sive treatment of the various aspects of fission is that of Bohr and  Wheeler 29 which was published several months after the discov-  ery of fission. Although some work has appeared since then, 80  the general features described by Bohr and Wheeler are still be-  lieved to be valid and it is probable that the recent intensive work  on the military applications of nuclear energy has not greatly in-  creased our understanding of the fission phenomenon. In fact, it  is rather remarkable that the fission of heavy nuclei was not pre-  dicted in the two-year period before its discovery, for as we shall  see in chapter 8, the liquid drop model of the nucleus had already  provided a successful description of many nuclear properties.   The discussion will be divided into two main parts. In this  chapter, only energy aspects will be considered. These will in-  clude estimates of the energy necessary to produce fission and the  energies available from the fission of a nucleus. The following  chapter will take up the dynamics of the reaction, i.e., the rate at  which the various possible processes occur and the dependence of  the fission yield on the competition among these processes.   In order to maintain a certain degree of continuity and to  prepare for some of the more quantitative estimates that are es-  sential to the understanding of the experimental results, we include  some brief background of the necessary concepts about nuclei. For  a much more complete treatment of the properties of nuclei, refer-  ence should be made to general reviews of the subject. 31   This chapter will begin with a review of the fundamental ideas  concerning nuclear forces and nuclear radii and a discussion of  some methods of determining the latter. These ideas are applied   N. Bohr and J. A. Wheeler, Phys. Kev. 56, 426 (1939).   80 E.g., B. D. Present and J. N. Knipp, Phys. Rev. 57, 751, 1188 (1940).   81 H. A. Bethe and B. F.

A semiempirical expression for the total binding energy  enables us to calculate the various interesting energies that play a  role in fission. Among these are the fission threshold energies  and the energy released in fission. Finally, we will consider the  distribution in mass of the fragments and the symmetry of fis-  sioning.   Nuclei general description. The most obvious characteris-  tic of nuclei is that they have approximately equal numbers of pro-  tons and neutrons. The difference is largest in the heaviest nu-  clei and even there it is only about 25 percent of the total number  of particles. According to our present ideas, this is consistent with  the following statements :   (1) The specific nuclear forces (subtracting the Coulomb inter-  action between protons) are much larger than the electrostatic forces  acting on protons in the nucleus.   (2) These nuclear forces are approximately the same for neu-  trons as for protons.   The quantum states of motion and their energy levels should be  similar for both kinds of particle. Because of the Pauli exclu-  sion principle (and the fact that the particle spins are !/o #) only  two particles of each kind can occupy each of the lowest levels in  the nucleus. A nucleus with predominantly one kind of particle  would then have a much higher energy than those common in na-  ture and would not exist long (if at all) because of the possibility  of transformation to a nucleus of lower energy. The shift toward  larger fractions of neutrons in the heavy nuclei is caused by the  electrostatic repulsion energy of the protons, which begins to build  up rapidly toward the end of the periodic system (proportional to  Z 2 , the atomic number squared) compared with the slower varia-  tion of the nuclear binding energy.   Aside from the very light elements (especially D 2 ), all nuclei  have about the same density and, closely connected with that, they  also have nearly the same binding energy per particle, about 8  Mev. This situation is in marked contrast to the electron system  about an atom and shows clearly one essential difference in the  pictures we must use in describing atoms and nuclei. For exam*  pie, the Thomas-Fermi statistical method gives a Z 7/s behavior  for the total binding energy of the orbital electrons as compared  with the nearly linear behavior of nuclei. Similarly, if we define  the "size" of an atom as that which contains, say, 90 percent of  the electron charge, then the Thomas-Fermi method shows that  the "radius" of an atom decreases as 2T~~~ 1/3 . This decrease is a re-  sult of the long range Coulomb forces that permit the collective in-  teraction of all the other electron charges with any particular     THEORY OF FISSION 69   electron. The nucleus, on the other hand, seems to be like a liquid  droplet 32 (with a much smaller number of particles), which  does have the constant density and linear energy characteris-  tics mentioned above. The nuclear radius varies as A l/B , where A  is the number of particles in the nucleus.   By extending this sort of consideration, Heisenberg 33 con-  cluded that the specific nuclear forces are short-range attractive  forces similar to the familiar exchange interaction between hydro-  gen atoms in a hydrogen molecule. Two particles interact strong-  ly only when they are close together; and, since this will be true  for an appreciable fraction of the time only if the two are in the  same quantum state, it follows from the Pauli exclusion principle  (and the fact that neutrons and protons have spins of ^ %} that at  most two protons and two neutrons can comprise a strongly in-  teracting unit. This expresses the saturation character of the nu-  clear forces and therefore the linearity of the binding energy with  atomic weight. To a first approximation there is no tendency for  the neutrons and protons to crowd together, since a neutron (or  proton) affects only its closest neighbors.   The picture of the random type of motion of the individual  particles, with each particle jostling the next one and moving in a  rapidly fluctuating field of force, has important consequences in the  formal description of nuclei. It is obviously a poor approximation  to consider states of motion of one particle in some average field of  the others because of the rapid interchange of energy between the  particle and the "system." Instead we must consider collective  states of motion of the system as a whole, not unlike the modes of  motion of a solid lattice. Bethe 34 has emphasized how little prog-  ress has been made in the direct quantum mechanical description  of the nucleus. However, it is possible to exploit some of the an-  alogies with more familiar systems, such as the liquid droplet, and  get a phenomenological description of the heavier nuclei. We  shall discuss this more fully in the next chapter, which deals with  fission dynamics.   Nuclear radii Although the nuclear radius is much better  defined than an atomic radius, it still essentially lacks definition,  chiefly because of the finite range of nuclear forces. Feenberg 35  has estimated the range of the neutron-proton interaction from the  mass defects of deuteron and alpha particles and found it to be  2 x 1Q 13 cm. An interaction of about this range has also been   - N. Bohr, Nature 137, 344 (1936).   M W. Heisenberg, Zeits. fur Phys. 77, 1 (1932).   14 H. A. Bethe, Eev. Mod. Phys. 9, 69 (1937).   M E.

There is associated with this finite and nonabrupt range  an essential lack of definition of the surface of a nucleus. It fol-  lows that the value obtained for the radius of a nucleus, and also  the value used in any calculation, must refer to a particular method  of measurement and can change by appreciable amounts with the  method of definition, experimental or theoretical. Since we shall  have occasion to speak of the nuclear radius in at least two different  respects, it will be worth while to mention some of the methods  of measurement and the spread of values obtained.   Often the quantity r =RA l/3 , where A is the integral  atomic weight, is used instead of the nuclear radius R to charac-  terize the nucleus. r is a measure of the nuclear density and  changes only very little from one nucleus to another. It can also  be considered as the radius of the nuclear particles, since 2r is as  close as neutrons and protons approach each other even though  there is a large attractive potential between them (~ 28 Mev).  The main methods of determining R (or r ) are:   (a) By calculation from the natural alpha particle radioactivity of  heavy nuclei.   !b) Anomalous scattering of charged particles by nuclei,  c) Scattering of fast neutrons by nuclei.   (d) Fitting theoretical formulae for mass defects and binding en-  ergies to mass spectrograph values.   We shall discuss each method briefly below. It is expected 87  that the radius of a "constant density" nucleus as estimated by  method (d) will be smaller than the geometric radius determined  from scattering by about a/2 ~ 10~~ 13 cm, where a is the range of  the nuclear forces. Even for the heavier nuclei the different ways  of estimating r give values from 1.2 x 10~ 13 cm to 1.5 x 10~ 18 cm.  There is also a somewhat questionable estimate 38 that gives the  large value r = 2 x 10"~ 13 cm.   (a) ALPHA PARTICLE RADIOACTIVITY: The height of the  Coulomb potential barrier and the kinetic energy of the alpha par-  ticle determine the probability of escape, or the half-lives of alpha  radioactive elements. The height and thickness of the Coulomb  barrier are determined by the radius where, and the abruptness  with which, the specific nuclear forces become important. Gamow 89  and Bethe 40 estimated R for U 238 to be 8.9 x 10~ 13 cm and  12.3 x 10 13 cm, respectively, and obtained values of r for the  heavy nuclei of 1.48xlO~ 13 cm and 2.05xlO~ 18 cm, respectively.  Bethe's larger value results from an attempt to apply the many   * E. Sherr, Phys. Rev. 68, 240 (1945).   B. D. Present. Phys. Rev. 60, 28 (1941).   * H. A. Bethe, Rev. Mod.

THEORY OF FISSION 71   body description of the nucleus instead of the familiar potential  well picture previously used. According to Bethe, the probability  of escape of an alpha particle is the product of the probability of  two events : first, that an alpha particle unit will be separated from  the rest of the nuclear matter ; and second, that the alpha particle  will penetrate the potential barrier. In the older theory the first  probability was replaced approximately by the oscillation frequency  of the alpha particle in the nuclear potential well, v^lO 21 per sec-  ond. This is very much larger than Bethe's estimated separation  probability T/% ~ 10 15 per second. Bohr and Kalckar, 41 have  criticized Bethe's treatment on the grounds that the two events are  not so simply separated and it is probable that the value r = 1.48  x lO^ 13 cm is closer to the correct one.   (b) ANOMALOUS SCATTERING OF CHARGED PARTICLES:  Weisskopf and Ewing 42 considered the reverse penetration of the  potential barrier using a sharp cut-off potential to interpret the  experimental results. This potential is expected to give smaller  radii. They ascertained that r = 1.3 x 10~~ 13 cm fits best the ex-  perimental data on reactions initiated by charged particles in nu-  clei of medium atomic weight. This smaller value of r is in agree-  ment with the theoretical ideas of Present 43 arid Bethe, 44 which in-  dicate that the nuclear density should decrease about 30 percent  in going from the medium weight nuclei to the heaviest nuclei.  This decrease is related to the rise in the packing fraction curve  beyond the atomic weight 50.   (c) SCATTERING OF FAST NEUTRONS: Fast neutron scatter-  ing data are not easy to interpret because the effective wavelengths,  X(=\/2 ?r), of the neutrons are comparable with nuclear  radii. For example, X = 3 x 10 ~ 13 cm for 2.5 Mev neutrons.  Bethe 45 has shown that the effective radius for elastic scattering ex-  tends about 10~ 13 cm beyond the nuclear boundary, which when  added to the 10~~ 13 cm due to the range of the nuclear forces gives  an effective radius 2 x 10~ 13 cm greater than the "constant density"  radius. Using the data of Kikuchi, Aoki and Wakatuki, 46 Present 47  has calculated the constant density r :   Fe 56 ; R = 6.5 x lO 13 cm, r = 1.30 x 10~ 13 cm.  Pb 207 ; R = 10.2 x 1O- 13 cm, r = 1.48 x 10~ 13 cm.   41 Bohr and Kalckar, Danske Fid. Selsk. 14, 9 (1937).   ** Weisskopf and Ewing, Phys. Rev. 57, 472 (1940).   48 R. D. Present, Phys.

The values given here are the constant density values. The radii  have been corrected from the scattering cross sections by the  2 x 10~~ 13 cm mentioned above. Dunning et al 48 and Barschall  and Kanner 40 have measured the total "scattering" cross section  for fast neutrons on nuclei by transmission experiments. Although  the interpretation of such results is not direct, 50 the cross sections  followed an A 2/3 law over a wide range of atomic weights from  aluminum to lead. Recently Sherr 51 has published results of the  scattering of very fast neutrons, E ~25 Mev. There are no quan-  tum effects due to long wavelengths at this energy. The results  can be plotted in the form     giving a fairly good straight line from light to heavy elements with  b = 2.3 x 10- 13 cm and r = 1.25 x lO" 13 cm.   (d) FITTING THEORETICAL FORMULAE TO MASS DEFECTS:  This method will be discussed in the following section, which con-  siders the general variation of atomic mass over the periodic sys-  tem.   Nuclear masses and the semiempirical formula. It was shown  earlier that the short-range exchange forces, together with the  Pauli exclusion principle and spins of y 2 ft, produce a saturated ar-  rangement when two neutrons and two protons are strongly inter-  acting. This is, of course, the case of the alpha particle and also  of those nuclei in which the alpha particle can move as a sub-unit.  This is in agreement with the large binding energy of 2 He 4 (27  Mev), compared with iD 2 whose ground state is only 2.18 Mev  below dissociation. Likewise, the low atomic weight nuclei which  are multiples of iHe 4 , such as eC 12 and 8 O 16 , have lower packing  fractions than the nuclei near them. The concept of alpha particles  as sub-units of nuclei is not a precise one and meets with several  objections, especially in the heavier nuclei. Bethe 52 has given a  detailed discussion of the good and bad features of such a hypothe-  sis. Nevertheless, we may conclude that two particles must  be in similar quantum states in order to interact strongly. It is  admittedly not a good approximation to speak of single particle  quantum states, but the qualitative results are most easily obtained  by doing so.   As long as the Coulomb forces are not very large, protons  and neutrons move in very similar potential fields and can have   48 Dunning, Pegram, Fink and Mitchell, Phys.

As the  nuclear charge increases, the repulsive interaction between pro-  tons begins to raise the proton levels above the corresponding neu-  tron levels, so that more neutron states than proton states lie below  the dissociation energy. This condition is responsible for the shift  to larger percentages of neutrons in the heavier nuclei. Another  important consequence is that heavier nuclei tend to have an even  number of both neutrons and protons if possible, for then the neu-  trons and protons themselves can be paired in quantum states of  motion to give the strongest bonds. The effect of n-n and p-p  pairing is noticeable above 7 N 14 where there is no stable isotope of  even atomic weight and odd charge number. If, then, two nuclear  particles are added to an existing nucleus, say, 2zX 2M , the only  stable isotopes that can be produced are   2( s+i)Y a < Jr + 1 > and 2Z ^ 2(M ^ 1)   Not only does the Coulomb repulsion supply directly a positive  electrostatic energy, but it can also cause enough difference in the  wave functions of neutrons and protons to desaturate the neutron-  proton bonds which contribute an important part of the binding  energy of a nucleus. A third effect that works in the same direc-  tion is the netjncrease in the kinetic energy of the system associ-  ated with a shift from equal numbers of protons and neutrons.  This can be seen most simply by considering a mixture of two  Fermi gases in a container. If the total number of particles is  fixed, the zero-point kinetic energy is a minimum when the num-  bers of both types are equal. In nuclei, this increase in kinetic  energy is probably only about one-third as big as the increase in  potential energy due to the decrease in the number of n-p bonds.   There has not yet been any successful theory that describes  quantitatively the behavior of nuclear masses. However, statistic-  al descriptions 58 do give formulae that have all the qualitative fea-  tures described in the preceding paragraphs. The theory is un-  successful in the respect that any attempt to ascribe an indepen-  dent meaning to the constants appearing in it, and to determine  them in a rational way as something other than adjustable para-  meters, results in poor agreement with experiment. However,  the form of these expressions can be borrowed (and simplified) to  give a "semiempiricar formula whose constants can then be ad-  justed to fit the packing fraction curve. The total binding energy   M H. A. Bethe, Rev. Mod. Phy*. 9, 149 (1937).     74 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   of a nucleus of atomic number Z and atomic weight A (Z protons  and N neutrons) is given by:   E = NM n + ZM P M(Z,A)   ^ (3)   A ~ 41/8   ^T. / 0/J.   where M(Z,A) is the mass of the nucleus and M n and M p the neu-  tron and proton mass, respectively. The first term, aA, is the  largest term and expresses the approximate constancy of the pack-  ing fraction of nuclei. The second term takes care of the effect of  the n-p desaturation described above. The last term is the Coul-  omb energy, where Z(Z-l) has been replaced by Z 2 . The third  term on the right results from the desaturation of the nuclear forces  of the surface of the nucleus and is expressed in terms of a "sur-  face tension" O. The surface energy is a much larger fraction of  the total energy here than in a small liquid droplet because of the  large fraction of the total number of particles that are surface parti-  cles. The rapid drop in the ratio of surface area to volume at the  lower atomic weights is the cause of the steep slope of the packing  fraction curve there. The desaturation is unimportant for the shape  of the curve beyond, say, A =50, but even for the heaviest nuclei  it represents a sizable part of the total energy. It is instructive .to  see the relative contribution of all the terms of equation 3 in the  heavy nuclei. For U 238 :   aA ~ 3300 Mev   ~ 250 Mev   540 Mev   ^ 800 Mev   There have been several determinations of the constants in  equation 3 from the masses of the stable isotopes. The most reli-  able seems to be that of Feenberg, 54 whose results are used by Bohr  and Wheeler. 55 He adjusted the constants of the semiempirical  formula to fit Dempster's 50 packing fraction curve and found the  values :   47rr 2 O = 13.3 Mev   and R = 1.39 X lO" 13 ^ 1 / 3 cm,   for 100^ A ^ 238 .   Feenberg's procedure seems to be less arbitrary than the others,  which require the added assumption that certain nuclei are the  "most stable" ones.   * E. Feenberg, Phys. Rev. 55, 504 (1939).

Energy of U 239 fragments (Bohr and Wheeler). The  stable isotopes lie somewhat below the region of highest energy  release. The slope of the axis of the ellipsoid corresponds to the  neutron-proton ratio of U 239 . Also shown are the fragments  whose branching ratios have been measured (cf. chapter 4).  Their position agrees with the estimated average energy re-  leased in fission if the assigned energies are lowered by some-  what over 10 mev; and their neutron-proton ratio is almost that  of U 289 except for 40 Zr 96 (see text).     76 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   Equation 3 describes the average variation of the mass defect  with Z and A, but it does not give any information about the fluc-  tuations in the masses of neighboring isotopes which are evident  from the rather irregular distribution of the vacancies in the table  of stable isotopes (see figure 23). In general, an isotope will not  be stable if it is heavier than either of its neighboring isobars. If  it is heavier than its neighbor of higher charge, it can transform to  it by emitting an electron ; if its lower charge isobar is lighter, the  nucleus can transform sometimes by positron emission and always  by capture of a K electron. Most of the mass fluctuation is due  to the odd-even effect resulting from the large n-n and p-p forces.  If a particle, say, a neutron, is added to the nucleus 2zX 2Jf , it will  fall into an unoccupied quantum state. If still another neutron  is added, it will occupy the same state with opposite spin. How-  ever, not only will it interact just like the first neutron with the  rest of the system, but also the level will be depressed by the strong  interaction between the two neutrons. That this depression is sig-  nificant is shown by the fact that often the addition of either two  neutrons or two protons will produce a stable isotope, whereas most  of the time, if a single particle is to be added, it can be only one  or the other, depending on which quantum state is the lower. It  is seen that the binding energy of a particle in an even-even iso-  tope is larger in general than that of the odd particle in an odd  isotope (one with an odd total number of particles). Therefore,  the same semiempirical formula cannot describe both the odd and  even mass number isotopes. If it is adjusted to represent the odd  nuclei, it will give values for the binding energy that are too small  in the even-even isotopes and too large in the unstable odd-odd iso-  topes. It is reasonable to assume that the formula can be corrected  up or down by an amount SA to give the corrected values for the  even-even or odd-odd isotopes respectively. S A is expected to  vary only slowly with A and is a measure of how much the n-n or  p-p interaction depresses the energy levels. In the next section it  will be shown how $ A can be estimated just from the stability of  isobars of even nuclei.   Binding energies and the energies released in fission. The  semiempirical formula can be applied to estimate the energies in-  volved in fission, including the energy released in the fission pro-  cess, the energy available in the fission fragments for subsequent  beta decay or neutron emission and the neutron binding energy of  the fissioning nucleus. This last gives the excitation energy of  the compound nucleus after capture of a slow neutron. For differ-  ent isotopes we shall see that the neutron binding energy may be     THEORY OF FISSION 77   more or less than the minimum energy needed to produce fission.  This is the reason for the very different behavior of U 235 and U 288  when they capture slow neutrons. This treatment, and also many  of the numbers quoted are due to Bohr and Wheeler, 57 whom we  shall follow now that the preparatory discussion of nuclei is fin-  ished.   The energy released in the formation of the fragments M\ from  the fission of the nucleus M is given by the Einstein relation.   E = (M 2M,)c 2 , (4)   where M and Mi are, respectively, the rest masses of the unexcited  original nucleus and the product nuclei. The product nuclei have  in general an abnormally high neutron-proton ratio characteristic  of the original heavy nucleus, so that to obtain their mass for use  in equation 4 we must extrapolate from the masses of the stable  isotopes of the same mass number. The extrapolation will be de-  scribed here. If there were a universal expression for the mass  M (Z,A) of nuclei in terms of Z and A f then for a given value, A,  there would be a value Z A corresponding to the most stable isobar.  Z A is not necessarily an integer, but it will be near a stable isobar.  Consider the odd nuclei and assume that the semiempirical formula  holds. Then Z A can be found by setting the derivative of equation  3 equal to zero :   2/8   Z A e*/SR (M n M p ) :     A  A [/3+y 2 (M n M,)]     2 [/J+Vio  M(Z,A) will vary parabolically with Z in the neighborhood of Z A ,   M(Z,A) -M(Z A ,A) = i/ 2 B A (Z-Z A ) 2 .

(8)   Now ZA lies between two values, Z and Z+l, one or both of  which is the stable nucleus of number A, so that ZA is at most ^  unit from a stable isotope. Instead of using equation 5 Bohr and   91 N. Bohr and J. A. Wheeler, Phys. Kev. 56, 426 (1939).     78 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   Wheeler use the above property of Z A to estimate it directly. They  draw a smooth line through the table of stable, odd isotopes (Z  plotted against A) so as to pass within y 2 unit of each stable odd  isotope and use this line to define Z A . It turns out that the range  of possible lines is very small and, as might be expected, the ZA  line is above the integral value of Z as often as it is below it. Thus  the parameter ft has been replaced by Z A and equations 6 and 8  give the desired extrapolation. The value of r used is 1.48 x 10~ 18  cm, obtained from alpha particle radioactivity.   Similarly, the "most stable" mass, M(Z A ,A), may be obtained  directly from the average value, f A , of the packing fraction over a  small region of atomic weights.   M(Z A ,A) = A(l+f A ). (9)   In averaging j A , both the even and odd isotopes are included, be-  cause then the positive term l/ 2 B A (Z-Z A ) 2 is largely canceled by  the negative & A of the even isotopes.

From equa-  tion 10 it follows that the difference between the two beta ray ener-  gies is 4S Af so that 8 A =0.5 Mev.   Bohr and Wheeler have carried out these quantitative esti-  mates of the fragment masses as well as the beta ray energies re-  leased in the subsequent disintegration chains. Table 8 and fig-  ure 23, which have been reproduced from their paper, 58 show the  energies that can be released by fission into two fragment nuclei.  Figure 23 shows the energy released by division of the compound  nucleus U 239 into two fragments. It is seen that there is a large  range of masses of the fragments (a range of about 20 for the  heavier fragments) for which nearly the maximum possible energy  release is attained. On the other hand, there is only a narrow  range of charge numbers in this region, which is separated from the  stable isotopes by about three to five beta emissions. According  to the distribution of the fragments the average energy released by  the division alone (neglecting subsequent beta emission) should be  somewhat over 190 Mev.

On the other hand, calorimetric measure-  ments give 177 d: 2 Mev for the average total energy released  per fission (page 18), not counting that carried off by hard  gamma rays, neutrons and neutrinos, as well as by beta activity  with half-lives longer than several minutes. The neutrinos and  neutrons carry away over two-thirds of the total energy available  for the beta decay from the direct fission products to stable isotopes.  Table 8 shows that this total energy is about 30 Mev. Thus it  seems that there is a slight discrepancy between the actual and the  expected difference between the ionization and calorimetric meas-  urements. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the fragments plus  their excitation energy is only about 180 Mev, which is at least 10  Mev below the values assigned in figure 23. It is not improbable  that the estimates in figure 23 are in error by that amount.   The paired fragments expected to accompany a fission should  lie opposite each other along a line through the center in figure 23  and on the same energy contour. Except for Zr 97 , no branching  ratio measurements for the light fragments have been published.  The fragments shown in figure 23 are the first identified mem-  bers of rather long disintegration chains and it is probable that  they are close to the direct fission products. Their neutron-proton  ratios are approximately the same as that of U 239 , which is to be  expected from the liquid drop model. The exception, 4oZr 07 , is  possibly only an apparent one since only two members of its chain  of disintegrations have been detected.   The possibility of producing fission by neutron bombardment  depends on the degree of excitation of the compound nucleus re-  sulting from the capture of a neutron. This is determined by the  binding energy of the neutron in the compound state. In principle,  equation 10 can be used to calculate neutron binding energies.  However, it is more reliable to use the mass differences of neigh-  boring isotopes if these are available. For the heaviest nuclei it  is necessary to use the energy released in the various radioactive  transformations, since the isotope masses themselves have been  calculated from them. 59 As an example let us consider the U 238  sequence. The steps from U 238 to U 234 correspond to the removal  of either four neutrons or one alpha particle and two beta particles.  If /?.. is the average binding energy of the 4 neutrons for U 234 to  U 238 , the mass equation can be written   Uw=UM+4 on i_4 #.. u 234 +He 4 +6.5 Mev.   6.5 Mev is the total energy released in the transformation.

THEORY OF FISSION     81     The odd isotopes U 235 and U 237 have binding energies smaller  by B ^=0.5 Mev ; the even isotope binding energies are larger by 8 .  In a similar manner Bohr and Wheeler calculated the neutron  binding energy for some of the interesting compound nuclei. These  are included in table 9. The values for plutonium and neptuni-  um were estimated from the behavior of the second term of equa-  tion 10,   i/ 2 B A (Z Z A ) 2 .

For  example, the slight difference between U 239 and U 285 can be attri-  buted to this term. For both U 285 and Pu 239 that term is negligi-  ble and so the value 5.4 Mev was assigned to Pu 289 . The larger  neutron binding energy of U 236 compared to U 239 shows that cap-     82 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEOY   ture of neutrons by U 286 will produce a more highly excited com-  pound nucleus than capture by U 238 . ' This is a result of the odd-  even fluctuations. On the other hand, the critical energy for fis-  sion is probably a smoothly varying function of the atomic weight  and number.   Equation 13 can be used to estimate the neutron binding ener-  gies of the nuclei in the beta radioactive sequences that result from  most direct fission products. Likewise equation 11 will give the  maximum beta ray energies available. For reasons similar to those  of the preceding paragraph the values obtained can fluctuate over  several Mev, and there occur cases where the available beta ray  energy in going from nucleus A to nucleus B is appreciably larger  than the neutron binding energy of the resultant nucleus. This  fact, combined with the fair probability that the beta transition will  use only a small amount of the available energy, may explain the  delayed neutron emission (cf. chapter 5). The nucleus B may be  left with sufficient energy to emit a neutron with appreciable en-  ergy ; if so, the neutron emission will have no competition from trie  beta decay, although there might be some from gamma ray emis-  sion. If more complete data on fission branching ratios were  available, it might be possible to show that this mechanism accounts  for the number of delayed neutrons per fission.   The fission threshold energy. In this section only the ener-  gies required to produce fission will be discussed. We shall not  consider the manner in which the excitation energy of the fission-  ing nucleus is interchanged among the nuclear particles until finally  a configuration is reached which leads to fission. This energy in-  terchange belongs strictly to the dynamics of the fission process  and will be taken up in the next chapter. For our purpose it is  sufficient to assume that if enough energy is available to produce  fission (and no other processes compete in carrying off this energy)  the configuration leading to fission will eventually be reached. It  follows from this that we must consider every possible configura-  tion of the nucleus consistent with energy conservation.   The problem is simplified greatly by the statistical treatment  of the nucleus. The nucleus will be considered as a charged liquid  droplet with a surface tension calculated from the semiempirical  formula, equation 3. The configurations to be considered are the  possible distortions of this droplet. Because of the large energies  needed to compress nuclear matter, it will be sufficient to consider  only those distortions that leave the total volume unchanged. The  charge distribution is assumed to be uniform because of the large  n-p forces compared to the weaker Coulomb forces. Feenberg 60  E. Feenberg. Phys. Ecv. 59, 593 (1941).     THEORY OF FISSION 83   has made calculations indicating that the protons do tend to con-  centrate on the outside of the nucleus. This effect is associated  with the progressive change in the density of nuclei with increas-  ing atomic weight mentioned on page 71. However, this ten-  dency is not great and produces only a very small change in the  energy of the nucleus and so we shall use the simpler assumption  of constant charge density.   Meitner and Frisch 61 were the first to recognize the essential  aspects of fission : that the problem is nearly a classical one be-  cause of the large masses (~ one-half the uranium nucleus) that  are in motion ; and that for the heaviest nuclei the effect of the sur-  face tension in resisting distortions is almost neutralized by the  electrical forces. Bohr 62 discussed these ideas in more detail and  fitted them into his general theory of nuclear reactions.   Before the general problem is discussed, it is interesting to  find the limit of stability of nuclei against fission. This was de-  rived at almost the same time by several persons. 63 We wish to  know the values of Z and A for which the decrease of the electro-  static energy associated with an infinitesimal distortion exactly can-  cels the increase caused by the larger surface area. Feenberg,  Frenkel and Weizsacker considered spheroidal distortions. The  result of their calculations is that the electrostatic energy must  equal twice the surface energy, or that   Umiting = 10(4V3)r 3 0/e* (14)     From the values of the surface and electrostatic energy given on  page 74 it is seen that this ratio for normal U 238 is about 20 per-  cent below this limit.   The critical deformation energy is defined in the following  manner : any distortion of the nucleus requires a potential en-  ergy, say O. This energy can be plotted as a function of the co-  ordinates used to specify the deformation. The function O has  many minima ; one occurs, of course, when the nucleus is undeform-  ed and the others occur when it is broken into several separated  spherical fragment nuclei. Of all the ways of going from the undis-  torted nucleus to two separate fragments, one will require the least  energy. The value of this energy, E , is called the critical energy  for fission. According to our assumption at the beginning of this  section, it is also the minimum excitation necessary for fission (neg-  lecting quantum effects).

Fortunately, it is possible to  use some approximations because uranium and other nuclei ob-  served to fission are near the limiting value of (Z 2 /A) and because  at the limit the critical deformations are only slightly different from  simple shapes. For (Z 2 /A)~(Z 2 /A) Hm itin ff , the critical shape  is a slightly prolate spheroid; in the other limit of (Z 2 /A) very  small, the critical shape is two spheres connected by a small neck to  balance the weak electrostatic repulsion. Bohr and Wheeler carried  out the approximate calculations and obtained a function, /(#),  where 4irr 2 A 2/B f (JT) gives the value of E Cf and x is defined by     They considered only axially symmetric deformations and specified  the deformation by the coordinates , i, 2 . . - . where 's are  the coefficients in the expansion   r(G) = R [1 + o + i Pi (cos 0) + ---- ] ; (15)  r () is the radius corresponding to the colatitude ;F W is the w tb  spherical harmonic. For small E e , i.e., nuclei with x close to unity  the value E c is attained by deformations which are symmetric about  some center point. The calculations seemed to indicate that this  was also true for the critical deformation of uranium and thorium  and the function j(x) plotted in figure 24 was derived using this  assumption. Actually a smooth curve is drawn connecting the  pieces near x = and x = 1, which can be calculated by suitable  approximations. 64 By using the value of A 2/ * for U 235 and the  measured fission threshold energies 65 , E c can be assigned to the  curve and the values of x for the nuclei of interest can be deter-  mined. These values of x lie between about 0.70 and 0.80. Fig-  ure 24 shows the region of interest with the assigned values of E c  in Mev. This is a revision of the curve given by Bohr and Wheel-  er to agree with the more recent threshold measurements described  in chapter 2. The vertical lines through the points Th 232 and  U 238 give the probable errors of the most precise measurements  published to date.   Actually the value of x for a particular nucleus can be calcu-  lated from the value (Z 2 /A} uniting given by equation 14; how-  ever, this requires knowing the value of r and so it is better to get  x from the fission phenomenon itself. Incidentally, as was pointed  out by Bohr and Wheeler, this provides an independent determina-  tion of the value of r 0f namely, r = 1.46 x 10~ 1S cm.   * N. Bohr and J. A. Wheeler, Phy*.

THEORY OF FISSION     85     The curve in figure 24 was drawn through Th 282 because that  seems to give the best agreement with the results that have been  published (see chapter 2). The value of E c for U 238 is about 0.5  Mev high. Both this and the value for Th 232 were taken from the  photofission threshold measurements by Koch, 66 which give E e  directly. The thorium threshold agrees with the photofission re-  sults of Haxby, Shoupp, Stephens and Wells (see chapter 2), who  estimated E c ~ 6.1 Mev. This, however, was just an estimate  that seemed consistent with their cross section measurements and  so there are only the two precise direct measurements of E c  reported to date.

From table 10 the neu-  tron binding energies for U 239 and Th 233 are 5.1 and 5.2 Mev, re-  spectively. The measured fission threshold energies are, in order,  0.35 0.1 and 1.1 0.1 Mev. These add up to give E c (U 289 )  = 5.45 0.1 and E Th (233) = 6.3 0.1 Mev, which agree with  figure 24.   It is unlikely that the photofission threshold of U 238 was ob-  scured by the strong neutron or gamma ray competition (which     60 H. W. Koch, University of Illinois Thesis (1944).     86 NVCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   we shall discuss in the next chapter).* 7 The neutron binding en-  ergy is 6.1 Mev according to table 9. Even if this estimate were  0.3 Mev or more too high, which does not seem probable, the bind-  ing energy would still be larger than the fission critical energy pre-  dicted by the curve in figure 24. Thus no neutrons could be emit-  ted and only the emission of gamma rays could compete with fis-  sion. We should then be forced to the ad hoc assumption that ra-  diation is much more probable in the compound nucleus U 238 than  in the corresponding nuclei Th 232 , Th 238 and U 239 , where the ob-  served thresholds are self-consistent. It is more reasonable to at-  tribute the higher threshold in part to some specific quantum effect  such as will be described in the next chapter. Figure 24 was cal-  culated classically and cannot show such fluctuations. Some of the  0.5 Mev. discrepancy is still unaccountable. According to table 9  and figure 24, protactinium should fission with slow neutrons, since  the neutron binding energy of Pa 232 is 5.4 Mev and E e = 5.1 Mev.  However, this phenomenon has not been observed. It is possible  that the estimated neutron binding energy of Pa 232 is in error by  enough to explain this fact since there is no convenient radioactive  sequence such as there is for uranium from which mass defects can  be calculated accurately.   The important prediction of this theory is, of course, that the  rarer isotope U 235 will fission with slow neutrons. Bohr 68 was  the first to point out that the rare isotope was almost solely respon-  sible for the slow neutron fission cross section of natural uranium  and that this was a consequence of the odd-even fluctuations in neu-  tron binding energy described above. Plutonium would also be  expected to fission like U 235 for it is still more highly excited above  the fission threshold by capture of a thermal energy neutron :   E B E c ~ 6.4 - 3.7 = 2.7 Mev extra energy.   Similarly for U 233 and Np 239 .   The possibility of symmetric and asymmetric fission. A  look at the table of identified fragment nuclei in chapter 4 shows  that most of the splitting is into two unequal parts. To under-  stand this we must consider the distortions leading to fission in  somewhat more detail than in the preceding section.   The distortion potential energy can be plotted as a function  of the distortion coordinates, say, ( , i, 2 , . . .) of equation  15. This will give a "surface" in the hyperspace ( , i,a 2 . . . ,   87 If this competition were large, the fission yield would be very small for  energies near the threshold; and, in the nonlinear extrapolation back to  where the fissions first seem to appear, a higher value of E O might be  obtained.

This is drawn schematically in contour map fashion in figure  26, where a 2 is one coordinate and all the other coordinates are  drawn "perpendicular" to it. The contours of constant potential  energy O give the limits of the possible distortion of the nucleus  which has the excitation energy H. The coordinate <x 2 has been  assigned the special role because it represents that distortion that  elongates the nucleus in such a way as to decrease the electrostatic  potential energy compared to the increase in surface energy faster  than any other. Figure 25 shows the type of deformation corre-  sponding to 2, a s and 0:4.   The potential surface will have a pass, or saddle point, at the  place corresponding to the critical energy E c , because E c is the  maximum energy of distortion along the easiest path of deforma-  tion passing through that point (see figure 26) and is also by its  definition lower than the maximum for any neighboring path. At  the critical deformation the nucleus will be in unstable equilibrium  and may have developed a neck that weakens the restoring force of  the surface tension compared to the disrupting force of electrostatic  repulsion. If the nuclear charge is not large, (Z 2 /A) not close to  (Z 2 /A) uniting, the neck effect will be pronounced and the mathe-  matics of the distortion becomes complicated, and so there is the  possibility of more than one saddle point in some other "direction"  of fission. This is shown schematically in figure 26, where the one  pass, approximately in the 2 direction, corresponds to the sym-  metric distortion considered by Bohr and Wheeler and the other  pass corresponds to a strong additional contribution from the s  type of deformation (figure 25), which will evidently lead to a fis-  sion into unequal fragments. When there is more energy than E c  available there are many paths through the saddle and a variety of  fragments.   The possibility of a Iqwer asymmetric fission threshold was  suggested by Present and Knipp 69 , who investigated larger deform-  ations of the nucleus than did Bohr and Wheeler. They found two  interesting saddle points, the first a symmetric distortion (a 3 0)  and the second with o^O. They did not determine which dis-  tortion has the lower value of E c . The estimated ratio of fragment  masses for the asymmetric case is about 2/3, a value which is con-  sistent with the ionization measurements described on page 18,  as well as with the fission product results of chapter 4.   In line with this there is also further experimental evidence.  Lark-Horovitz and Schreiber 70 observed a change in the type of  ionization pulses produced by the fragments in going from slow   Present and Knipp, Phys. Kev. 57, 751, 1188 (1940).

For slow neutrons  they observed two different peaks in the number versus ionization  curve. For fast neutrons an additional group corresponding to ap-  proximately equal fragments was observed. Similarly, Segre and  Seaborg 71 and others detected fission products from symmetric fis-  sion for neutron energies above 10 Mev. The increase in the fis-  sion cross section of uranium for neutrons above 10 Mev observed  by Ageno et al 72 is possibly connected with the appearance of sym-  metric fission.   One possible explanation is that there are two fission thres-  holds, as suggested by Present and Knipp, the lower one leading  to asymmetric splitting and the other to approximately symmetric  splitting. The experiments just mentioned seem to indicate that  the latter threshold is at least many million volts above the asym-  metric fission threshold, although theoretical calculations 73 have not  yet established which is higher! However, it is probable that no  symmetric fission will be observed for energies near the threshold  for symmetric fission because of the strong competition from other  processes. As will be discussed in the next chapter, when a fis-  sionable nucleus is excited there are several competing processes,  neutron emission, fission and radiation, which try to carry away the  energy ; the outcome of this competition determines the fission yield  and, therefore, the fission cross section. Thus symmetric splitting  may not be detected until the excitation energy is much higher than  the threshold value. At these energies, because there are more  ways available for the nucleus to fission, one might expect some in-  crease in the relative yield of fissions compared with the neutron  emission and so an increase in cross section, as is observed.   Most of the observed increase in the neutron-induced fission  cross section of U 238 is probably due to another process suggested  by Bohr. 74 For sufficiently high excitation energy the U 239 nu-  cleus can emit a neutron and still have enough residual energy to  fission. Bohr has shown that this double process gives the proper  magnitude for the increase in the fission cross section. He has  shown also that a much larger relative increase in cross section  should result from bombarding thorium with high-energy neutrons.  In both cases the fission following the emission of a neutron is fav-  ored because the residual nuclei U 238 and Th 282 are even and have   71 Segre and Seaborg, Phys.

This double process might also be an alternative (or supple-  mentary) mechanism for symmetric fission. First let us assume  that the symmetric distortion threshold is the lowest and the only  one of interest. For a nucleus to break into equal parts it must  cross over the fission barrier in the vicinity of the saddle point, i.e.,  with energy not much higher than the critical energy for fission.  This is not improbable according to the theory of nuclear reactions.  If a nucleus has an excitation energy B f then it can be characterized  by a "temperature" T (in energy units), which is much lower than  E (see page 95). The probability that the nucleus will emit a  neutron of energy c is given by the Boltzmann law.   W(t)dt = ~ *~ C/T rfe. (16)   r 2   Consider, for example, an incident neutron of 10 Mev energy. It  will be captured, leaving the compound nucleus with about 16 Mev  excitation energy (6 Mev binding energy). The temperature cor-  responding to this excitation energy is about 2 Mev. Now let us  assume a reasonable value of 0.10 Mev for the necessary proximity  of the excitation energy of the nucleus to the critical energy, E C) to  produce nearly equal fragments. (This energy comes from the  quantum mechanical description to be discussed in chapter 8.  There are only a few states of motion of the nucleus with energy  near the critical energy that can produce fission. The lowest states  are separated by about the 0.10 Mev used here. We are assum-  ing then that at least the lowest state leads to symmetric fission.)  To leave the residual nucleus with just the energy E , a neutron  must escape with energy (10 E c } Mev. Substituting in equation  1 6 and using E e ~ 6 Mev vCe get   W(e)d ~ 2 percent,   which agrees fairly well with the observed fraction of fissions that  are symmetrical, as reported by Lark-Horovitz and Schreiber. It  would be interesting to do photofission experiments in which sym-  metrical fission is looked for as the gamma ray energy is increased  in the neighborhood of the fission threshold. A simpler experi-  ment is to examine the fission products from the 6.3 Mev F(/>,y)  gamma rays on thorium, whose threshold is 6.2 Mev.   The path of fission (as represented by the dotted lines in fig-  ure 26 showing successive distortions) may have a wide range of  directions after passing over the saddle point. This is especially  important when the nucleus passes over the fission barrier with     THEORY OF FISSION 91   energy in excess of E c . Therefore, the saddle point 1 does not  necessarily lead to symmetric fission or even to binary fission.  Present 76 has shown that it is possible to cross through the saddle  region at such an angle as to lead to division into three fragments  and the release of about 20 Mev more energy than in symmetric  fission. Apparently this is only probable at higher excitation ener-  gies, 75 although the threshold is the same as for binary fission.   n R. D. Present, Phys. Rev. 59, 466 (1941).     CHAPTER 8   DYNAMICS OF FISSION   In chapter 7 we discussed the possibility of the occurrence of  fission ; here we shall consider the probability of its occurring once  it is possible. Fission is like other nuclear processes in that it can  be described in terms of the initial formation of an excited com-  pound nucleus and the subsequent competition among the possible  modes of releasing the excitation energy. This description was  initiated by Bohr 76 and developed by many others. 77   Since the nucleus is a "dense** system, an impinging particle  quickly loses its energy, which is rapidly distributed among the nu-  clear particles. The energy of excitation is then dispersed over all  the nucleus, each nuclear particle having on the average a very  small fraction. The compound nucleus remains in this state of  excitation until, by chance, enough energy is concentrated on an  individual particle to permit its escape. If a particle of the inci-  dent type escapes, the process is inelastic scattering. If only a  gamma ray is emitted, the incident particle is "captured." Other  transmutations involve the ejection of a neutron, proton or alpha  particle from the compound nucleus with or without a subsequent  emission of radiation. In fission a mode of "surface tension*' os-  cillation is excited that leads to rupture of the heavy compound  nucleus.   For a quantitative discussion of the dynamics of the fission  process we must consider more closely the levels of the compound  nucleus. Consequently, we shall first discuss the many particle  model and nuclear energy levels in general. 78 Level widths and  competition among disintegration processes, the dispersion formu-  la and the statistical method of considering closely spaced levels  will be described. In later sections we shall apply these ideas to  the calculation of reaction rates for fission and compare them with  experiment following Bohr and Wheeler. 79   Many-particle model and nuclear energy levels. When a  heavy nucleus is bombarded by neutrons of, say, 1 Mev energy,   '* N. Bohr, Nature 137, 344, 351 (1936).   " E.g., H. A. Bethe, Rev. Mod. Phys. 9, pt.

Eev. 56, 426 (1939).   92     DYNAMICS OF FISSION 98   the most common process observed is scattering, both elastic and  inelastic. 80 The inelastic scattering is accompanied by the emis-  sion of gamma rays whose line breadths are fairly small, about  0.10 volt for 10 5 volt energy quanta. Since the neutron could  traverse the nucleus in a time r ~ 10~ 21 seconds, it is difficult  to see how in this short time the nucleus could radiate a sharp line  of frequency ~ 10 20 per second. In fact, the neutron must be in  the nucleus about one million times larger than r. Similar con-  siderations of the capture of charged particles in lighter nuclei and  the resonances observed in their transmutation 81 led Bohr 82 to  discard the former potential well description of the nucleus and to  propose the intermediate-state process described in the introduc-  tion. The formation of a compound nucleus for high-energy in-  cident particles may be simply described classically. The particle  reaching the surface of the nucleus suffers an inelastic impact with  the surface particles in its vicinity and may continue losing energy  by impact until it is no longer distinguishable from any other nu-  clear particle. This process is unlike ordinary atomic collisions,  which are mostly elastic and which are characterized by the col-  lective action of all the orbital electrons on the incident particle.  High-energy particles incident on a nucleus will almost always  form a compound nucleus. Low-energy particles need a wave  description, and a compound nucleus can be formed only if the  energy of the incident particle plus target nucleus coincides with an  energy level of the compound system. Such capture may then be  a highly selective process. This change in character of reactions  in going from low to high incident particle energies results from  the smearing out of the energy levels of the compound nucleus into  a continuum of closely spaced overlapping levels. One conse-  quence of this difference between a continuum and a discrete  level system has been pointed out by Kalckar, Oppenheimer and  Serber. 83 In a discrete level, the compound nucleus has a well-  defined probability for disintegration into its possible products,  which is independent of the way it was formed. In a continuum  the compound state consists of a combination of many neighboring  states, and their phase relationship can be characteristic of the mode  of formation ; if so, the disintegration probability may also depend   80 Dunning, Pegram, Fink and Mitchell, Phys. Rev. 48, 265 (1935). See also  a recent paper by Sherr, which summarizes the results of fast neutron  scattering: B. Sherr, Phys. Rev. 68, 240 (1945).   91 E.g., Hafstad, Heydenberg and Tuve, Phys.

In particular, the probability of re-  emission of the incident particle may be abnormally high. 84   The energy levels of a nucleus are states of collective motion  of all the particles. The analogy to the oscillations of a liquid  droplet or to the vibrations of a solid lattice has been mentioned  before (chapter 7). This analogy can be extended to give a  semi-quantitative description of the distribution of energy levels.  In a heavy nucleus there is such an enormous number of ways in  which energy can be distributed over the nuclear particles that the  energy level spacing decreases very rapidly with increasing excita-  tion energy. This spacing variation can be estimated on a purely  statistical basis with the droplet model. 85 The collective type of  motion of the nuclear particles is assumed to have fundamental  frequencies and "harmonics." If the energy of excitation E is ex-  pressed as a multiple of the quantum energy hv, then nhv can be  divided among the nuclear particles in />(n) ways. ff p(n)" is the  "partitio numerorum," or number of ways in which the integer n  can be written as the sum of integers smaller than itself. For large  n the asymptotic form of p(n) is      p(n) = e (17)   4V3n   In our case, n is the ratio E/hv, where E is the excitation energy.  hv can be estimated for heavy nuclei from gamma ray evidence and  the fine structure of alpha particle radioactivity ; 86 it is about 1 2x  10 5 ev. v can also be calculated from the frequency of surface os-  cillations in the liquid drop model. For heavy nuclei (A > 100)  this model gives a value of hv somewhat larger than 2 x 10 5 ev. 8T  If we use the value hv = 2 x 10 5 ev, then for an excitation energy  E = 8 Mev, n is 40 and />(40) is about 2 x 10 4 . This represents  the number of levels in the unit interval hv. Therefore, the level  spacing is about 10 volts. * 8 Mev corresponds approximately  to the excitation of a heavy nucleus by capture of a slow neutron.  The distance between levels for incident neutrons of 2.5 Mev en-  ergy is about 0.5 volts.   Although equation 17 is based on crude considerations, it  agrees with more elaborate derivations and with experimental ob-  servations on the capture of slow neutrons by heavy nuclei. These  experiments indicate a level spacing of about 10 or 20 volts for  neutron capture.   84 Bohr, Peierls and Placzek, Nature 144, 200 (1939).   85 Bohr and Kalckar, Dansle Vid.

DYNAMICS OF FISSION &5   If we make the basic assumption that all possible states of dis-  tribution of the energy E are equally probable, we have an analogue  of the different configurations of gas molecules in a container. Ac-  cordingly, we should be able to assign some temperature to a nu-  cleus of energy E just as we can to a quantity of gas of known en-  ergy. The nuclear "temperature" so defined is a very useful con-  cept for describing nuclear reactions. Moreover, this assumption  of thermal equilibrium among the particles is necessary for any  more refined calculation of the energy level distribution. Several  such calculations have been made. 88 The particular model used  determines the nuclear temperature T as a function of the excita-  tion energy. For example, if the nucleus is considered as a Fermi  gas, then   E = aT* or T = (/) 1/2   just as for the free electrons in a metal. Thus, the level density  p(E or T) can be obtained directly by first finding the entropy  S (T) and using the Boltzmann relation p ~ e 8(T) . As might  be expected, the liquid droplet model gives fair results for the heav-  ier nuclei but not for the light nuclei.   Our knowledge (both theoretical and experimental) of the  spacing of nuclear levels can be summarized briefly. For the light  nuclei, i.e., those of atomic weight about 15, both theory and ex-  periment give average level spacings of about 1 Mev for 10 Mev  excitation energy. The experimental evidence comes from the  distribution of the resonances of alpha particle and proton reac-  tions 89 as well as from the gamma rays emitted.   For somewhat heavier nuclei (A ~ 30) the spacing is about  0.5 Mev for the same excitation energy and decreases to the order  of 10 5 volts at about 15 Mev energy. This contrasts with the heavy  nuclei whose lowest excited states are some 10 5 volts above the  ground state and are spaced about 10 volts apart at the neutron  dissociation energy (between 6 and 7 Mev). The difference is due  to the much larger number ( ~ 200) of particles, which greatly  increases the number of ways of sharing the energy E. Slow neu-  trons can be captured only into compound levels whose angular  momentum / differs by no more than one-half from that of the  original nucleus. Thus the level spacing observed for neutron  capture in the heavy nuclei may be larger than the actual spacing.   w V. Weisskopf, Phys. Rev. 52, 245 (1937) 5 L. Landau, Zeit.

Like the excited states of atoms, the higher-energy states of a  nucleus are not stationary but decay with time by making transi-  tions to other levels with the emission of radiation or material par-  ticles. Because our assumed compound state is not an exact solu-  tion of the Schrodinger equation, it cannot correspond to a single  energy eigenvalue, and the state is taken to have an uncertainty in  its energy or a level width A. The uncertainty will be larger  the less correct the description of the compound state is, that is, the  more important the asymptotic behavior of the wave function  which corresponds to the emission of particles becomes. This  fact demonstrates the relationship between the level width and the  probability of disintegration of the compound state. The lifetime  of the state, A, is simply connected to A. If the initial amplitude  of the compound state is A t the subsequent behavior is A0~~ t/2 ^.  Then   A E = H/l =#<u (18) <*> is the transition probability per unit time. A denotes the half  width of the distribution in energy of the emitted particles. Equa-  tion 18 is just a statement of the Uncertainty Principle and is ex-  actly analogous to the case of optical transitions in atoms. In fact,  much of the formalism of nuclear theory is similar to the descrip-  tion of the optical phenomena of line breadth, 90 resonance and dis-  persion, the sole difference being the replacement of particles for  light quanta. There is a larger variety of final states in nuclear  transitions corresponding to the different possible product particles  as well as the energy levels of the final state of the nucleus.   It is customary to use the symbol T instead of A in equation  18; i.e.,   co z= T/n. (19)   T/1i is the total transition probability of the compound state; it  can be separated into contributions from all the possible final states  (all the ways in which compound nucleus can disintegrate) .   r = 2 TV (20)   gP   Tgp refers to the emission of the particle q, leaving the residual  nucleus in the state P. The partial transition probabilities are  proportional to the squared matrix elements of the Hamiltonian  taken with respect to the initial and final systems. The expression  for T q p is     I/VM 2 . (21)   See for example: Weisskopf and Wigner, Zeit. fur Phys. 65, 18 (1930).     DYNAMICS OF FISSION 97   H qP c is the matrix element referred to above, the superscript C  denoting the compound state. The initial and final states are nor-  malized to unity. p(E) is the density per unit energy of the  final states, which may be either free-particle states or states of  the radiation field.   The theoretical definition of F is of little help in calculating it  because of our incomplete knowledge of nuclear forces and our still  more meager knowledge of the states of motion under such forces.  Most of our information about level widths is deduced from direct  or indirect measurements of nuclear resonances and the relative  yield of the different reactions. We shall discuss the pertinent re-  sults in this section and make some estimates of the neutron width  T n . The neutron width is rather important, since it is the deter-  mining factor in most fission reactions.   Equation 21 is very useful in correlating experimental observa-  tions and in extending experimental results into regions of energy  not easily investigated. For example, equation 21 tells how the  particle widths vary with the energy of the particle emitted and  with its angular momentum. These considerations are also ap-  plicable to the capture process as well as to emission, and Y q p c /fi  plays the converse, though not quite so simple, role in the forma-  tion of the compound state C from the free particle q and initial  nucleus P. The variation of r with energy is responsible for the  well known "l/v law" for slow neutron capture. The first term  /o(), for material particles of mass m, energy E and wave vector  k (where E = H 2 k 2 /2m) 9 contained in a volume is   n   P(E} =     4rr 2       p(E) is proportional to the particle velocity. For gamma rays  p(E) is somewhat different, being     n      We therefore expect an essential difference between the variation  with energy of T y , the gamma ray width, and T ff the width for  emission of particle x. This is only an illustration; there are     98 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   more profound differences between particle and radiation widths.  For the present, in preparation for the "\/v law", we shall consider  only the particle width, F n . The terms H qP a in equation 21 is a  matrix element of the form     where \f/o is the wave function of the compound state, XP that of  the initial nucleus and & q the incident particle wave function, which  for simplicity we will take to be a plane wave. Thus, > ik-r     A plane wave corresponds to a uniform stream of incident particles  which can have all values of the angular momentum Ift with re-  spect to the nucleus P. In fact & q , and therefore H qP t can be  split into the sum of parts corresponding to particles with different  values of /. It is easy to show that the matrix element correspond-  ing to / = does not contain k f the matrix element corresponding  to / 1 contains k to the first power, etc. For slow neutrons the  wavelength is so large that only terms of / = are important.  Thus, the partial width r corresponding to emission of a slow parti-  cle will vary directly as the velocity of the particle.   An important consequence of this variation with velocity is  the large probability of capture compared to scattering of slow neu-  trons. If a heavy nucleus captures a slow neutron, the compound  nucleus has only two alternatives of appreciable probability. It  can either radiate a gamma ray and fall into state of lower energy,  or it can re-emit the slow neutron. The latter probability is small  for small velocities, so that radiative capture is the most probable  process. In general, the relative probability of the occurrence of  the process x in a compound state is   Ft =     where the total width F is also written as the sum of the partial  widths I\.   To summarize the information available on level widths :  (a) GAMMA RAY WIDTHS : The total gamma ray widths are  remarkably constant both with respect to different nuclei and to  energy of the compound state. From the resonance widths of  slow neutron capture in heavy nuclei the values of F 7 are   F 7 ~ 0.1 - 1 volt.  In this case, because of the small value of F n as mentioned above,     DYNAMICS OF FISSION 99   the total width of the capturing level is T=T y . For the lighter  nuclei at somewhat higher excitation energies T y is about 1 to 10  volts. The very small radiation probability (0.1 volt corresponds  to 10 14 sec" 1 ) peculiar to nuclei results from the approximately  uniform distribution of charge, which makes dipole radiation very  improbable. In fact, the dipole moments are of the order of 10~~ 3  times the nuclear radius. Most nuclear radiation is quadrupole  radiation, i.e., radiation emitted by a uniformly charged sphere  which is oscillating in ellipsoidal deformations. The total gamma  width T 7 includes the possibility of radiating many different fre-  quencies (~ 10 5 possible final levels in heavy nuclei). The par-  tial width for a single transition, F' 7 , probably increases with about  the fifth power of the frequency radiated; 91 similarly for the re-  verse probability that the nucleus will absorb a quantum.   (b) PARTICLE WIDTHS. For neutron emission the width F n  depends only on the probability that a fluctuation will occur in the  distribution of the excitation energy so as to concentrate enough  energy on the neutron to separate it from the rest of the nuclear  matter. In the case of charged particles this must also be multi-  plied by a penetration factor because of the coulomb barrier. This  makes charged particle emission very improbable for nuclei of me-  dium atomic weight. This effect is small for light nuclei, A<*~>15,  because the barrier for low Z is rather low.   Other things being equal, the probability of concentrating the  energy on a neutron should be about the same on the average as  for protons and alpha particles. Which will be the most probable  in a particular compound nucleus depends on the energy evolution.  For example, if the compound nucleus is a light one and contains  an integral number of alpha particles, then because of the low in-  ternal energy of the alpha particle its creation will leave the resi-  dual nucleus with a high excitation. This makes many residual  states available, and alpha emission should be predominant. This  observation is verified in the light nuclei transmutations   + H 1 -* (Be 8 ) - 2He 4 ,   + H 1 - (Ne 20 ) - O 16 + He 4 , etc.   In fact, since the energy of charged particles is easier to measure,  most of our information about particle widths in light nuclei  (^<30) is obtained from emitted alpha particles and protons.  The neutron widths should be comparable. The particle widths  for light nuclei are much larger than for heavy nuclei. For very  light elements r^^de is about 10 5 volts for 10 Mev excitation,     See for example, H. A. Bethe, Bev. Mod. Phya. 9, 227 (1937).     100 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   if the transition is not forbidden by any selection rule. This is the  case in the B 10 reaction, which is a sensitive detector of slow neu-  trons :   B 10 + n l - (B 11 ) -* Li 7 + He 4 .   In the next section it will be shown how the large value of F  makes the boron reaction useful for measuring neutron energies.  It shpuld be emphasized that the partial width F for light nuclei  refers to the emission of particles with only a small number of dif-  ferent energies (^2). In heavy nuclei such a F would be ex-  tremely small and the large neutron widths that are observed re-  sult from the increased number of possible final states. Primes  will be used to denote that the partial width refers to a single final  state; no prime indicates the total probability of emission of the  particle in question. Thus for gamma rays F 7 ~ 1 volt, but the  value obtained for a single transition is F' Y ~ 0.01 to 10"" 4 volts. 92  The partial width TV for neutron emission has been estimated  from the resonance absorption of slow neutrons. We have already  seen that T n 'ccE n l/2 . The constant of proportionality or reduced  partial width / is remarkably constant from element to element.  F n ' = j (E in Mev) x / 2 volts,   where / is between 0.1 and 1 volt. This is in agreement with the  large capture probability of slow neutrons, since for neutrons of  about ten volts energy   ~ 10-'.     IV corresponds to a transition that leaves the residual nucleus in  its ground state. Since the next highest level is some 200 kv above  the ground state, for neutron energies less than about 200 kv,  T n ' ~ F n . Above this energy more final levels are available and  T n increases more rapidly than E 1/2 . For excitation energies of  the compound nucleus about 5 Mev above the neutron threshold  F n ~ 10 4 Ty and radiation is negligible as a competing process  Neutron emission is already predominant at about % Mev above  the threshold. This means that the most common process in heavy  nuclei bombarded by fast neutrons is inelastic scattering. The  probability of elastic scattering is r n '/P n where r n ' refers to the  emission of a neutron with the same energy as the incident neutron.  This ratio decreases approximately inversely as the number of final  states available and is negligible for a bombarding energy of sev-  eral Mev. r n ' also measures the probability of formation of the  compound state by capture of the incident neutron.   n From the photo disintegration of light nuclei. See Kalckar, Oppenheim-  er and Berber, Phys. Rev. 52, 278 (1937).     DYNAMICS OF FISSION 101   In the next section we shall make some estimate of the total  neutron width T n and also of the energy spectrum of the neutrons  emitted. This latter is obviously of importance in any fast neutron  chain reaction. The total width r n will determine the effectiveness  of the neutron emission in limiting the fission yield. The relatively  low degree of concentration of energy associated with fission will  make the fission width F/ large.   The dispersion formula and the statistical method. The lev-  el system of a compound nucleus does not change in character when  the energy exceeds the binding energy of a neutron. Suppose the  distance between levels is still large compared to their widths in this  energy region. Then the compound states can be considered as  discrete, approximately stationary states of well-defined energy.  Because of the principle of energy conservation, an incident particle  cannot be captured by the original nucleus unless the total energy  (kinetic + internal) of the initial system coincides with an energy  level of the compound system. The capture of a neutron is there-  fore a very selective process at these energies. The process is ex-  actly analogous to the optical phenomenon of resonance absorption.   Most nuclear reactions are so-called double processes, i.e., they  proceed via an intermediate state. However, there can be some  direct transitions from the initial to the final state. This is the  case of potential scattering where the incident particle never enters  the nucleus but may interact with some sort of average field close  to the surface of the nucleus. For charged particles this average  field extends to great distances as a pure coulomb field and is re-  sponsible for most of the scattering at moderate energies. For  neutrons, on the other hand, the potential field is only effective at  the nuclear surface, and Bethe 93 has shown that its effect is similar  to that of a rigid sphere of the same radius. At sufficiently high  neutron energies the effective wavelength X is smaller than the  nuclear radius, and the total cross section presented by the nucleus  can be written as the sum of the potential scattering cross section  TT R 2 and the cross section for formation of a compound state. In  any case the distinction between the two types of processes is pure-  ly formal and becomes untenable at lower neutron energies, where  the two processes can interfere.   Let us consider reactions accompanied by the formation of a  compound state. For simplicity, only a single compound level of  angular momentum / will be considered important. Then the yield   w H. A.

T is the  total width for all ways of disintegration of the compound state.  E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle at "resonance/' X  is the effective wavelength of the incident particle in the reduced  mass system and S is its spin, equal to y 2 . i is the angular mo-  mentum of the initial nucleus and is probably zero if the nucleus  contains an even number of particles. A dispersion formula of this  type was first applied to nuclear reactions by Breit and Wigner. 94  Bethe and Placzek 95 extended the formula to the case where many  compound levels are important at the same time; they also took  into account the angular momentum of the system.   The competition between different processes is evident in equa-  tion 22; the ratio of the yields of particle x and y is just T 9 /T y .  If the width of the level T is small, the resonance is sharp and the  yields smaller for values of E off resonance. For low energies the  quantity r n ' depends on the energy of the captured neutron accord-  ing to equation 21, i.e., it is proportional to neutron velocity. In  general, for slow neutron capture r~r y or r/, depending on which  is larger where T f /H is the probability per unit time of fission.  Neither of these last two quantities will change with a small varia-  tion of the energy of the incident particle in the neighborhood of  zero energy. Thus for sufficiently small energies (for which E  E ~ ' ), equation 22 becomes   const.   or x = const.     v   which is the l/v law. In several cases this behavior extends to  neutron energies of many kilovolts. Substances that absorb neu-  trons by the l/v law can be used to determine the energy of neu-  trons that are responsible for some reaction when monochromatic  neutrons are not available. The absorption coefficient K(E) of  these reaction producing neutrons in the l/v absorber is com-   * Breit and Wigner, Phys. Rev. 49, 519 (1936).   * Bethe and Placzek, Phys.

DYNAMICS OF FISSION 108   pared with that for neutrons of known energy EI and the energy  calculated from     For example, the resonance energy for capture of neutrons by U 288  was measured in this way by Anderson, 96 who found it to be about  5 volts. Boron is commonly used for this purpose.   The \/v law always holds for sufficiently low energies. The  extent of its validity depends on how rapidly the resonance term  varies compared to the l/v term. Bethe 97 has shown the condi-  tions for the validity of the \/v law to be   E \E l  or   E r ,   whichever is larger, where E and F are the resonance energy and  width, respectively, of the level nearest to E = 0. For the com-  pound nucleus B 11 , both E and F are about 10 5 volts. On the oth-  er hand, the peculiar behavior of cadmium in the thermal energy  region results from a resonance level that lies at a fraction of a volt  neutron energy. The \/v law is not valid in cadmium until the  neutron energy is even lower than the average thermal energy at  room temperature.   For heavy nuclei, it is only to incident neutron energies near  zero that the one-level formula may be applicable, if at all. Even  for neutron energies of several hundred kilovolts the spacing of the  levels of the compound nucleus is of the order of 5 volts, which is  so small compared to the energy spread of the neutron energy that  any determination of cross sections, etc., measures the average of  that quantity taken over many neighboring states of the compound  system. If the energy levels are still discrete in the sense that the  one-level formula, equation 22, can be applied in the neighborhood  of each resonance, we may simply average many such terms over  an energy interval A, large compared to the distance between  levels. All characteristic resonance fluctuations in yield disappear  and are replaced by a smoothed out mean variation.

For our purpose it will be permissible to  apply equation 24 98 although the interference among the over-  lapping states comprising the compound state sometimes requires  special consideration."

Equation 22 describes a specific quant-  um phenomenon, and it is really rather arbitrary to separate it into  two factors, one for the rate of formation and the other for the rate  of disintegration. However, in equation 24 we can lump every-  thing but Tgs/T together and call it the cross section for formation  of a compound system. In the classical limit, Bohr's picture of  nuclear reactions would lead us to expect this cross section is irR 2 .  In other words, we expect the relationship     =2     (2/+l)r/' .

DYNAMICS OF FISSION 106   and disintegration of the compound nucleus. 1 Putting vR 2 in   equation 24 gives the very simple result   a. = /er./r , (26)   which needs no further interpretation.   The three formulae 22, 24, and 26 each have a well-defined  range of applicability. Equation 26 will be used to discuss the  fast neutron fission cross sections ; in the slow neutron region it  often cannot be said beforehand whether the conditions require the  one level formula 22 or the many level formula 24. Both must be  tried to see which gives the more consistent interpretation of the ob-  served fission cross sections.   By returning briefly to equation 25 we obtain some very useful  further information. The terms on the right represent the rate of  disintegration of the compound nucleus into a specified residual  nucleus (in this case the ground state). The left side really tells  the rate of the converse process, i.e., that a neutron of velocity  t/nz/i/mX will strike the surface of the initial nucleus, area 4wR 2 .  The equilibrium between the two rates is exactly the same as in  the theory of the rate of evaporation from a solid or a liquid sur-  face. In fact, Frenkel 2 proposed to calculate the probability of  neutron emission from a nucleus of temperature T (see page 95)  by the simple evaporation formula,     where A r2/3 is the number of surface neutrons, t is some character-  istic time of the order of 10~ 22 sec and EB is the neutron binding  energy. Weisskopf 3 has refined these ideas somewhat, and we  shall use his results to estimate the neutron width r n . T n includes  all values of the energy of the emitted neutron, whereas equation  25 pertains to only one. Therefore, > p '   n x lfl   (All possible final states),   = f P (E)T n 'dE .

It is seen by considering just the part of equation 29  from E to +A that the distribution in energy of the neu-  trons emitted is Maxwellian corresponding to the highest possi-  ble temperature of the residual nucleus, Tp(EaE B ). This fact  was used in chapter 7.   An estimate of the behavior of F n can be made by using the  two equations 25 and 30 and the fact that for low energies only one  final state is available so that r n =r n '=/ 1/2 . This last relation-  ship holds up to about 100 kv with /~0.001 volts 1 / 2 . Actually  this 1/2 law is valid for any particular F n ' until the outgoing neu-  tron has a wavelength tf comparable with the nuclear radius, i.e.,  E~0.25 Mev. Above this energy equation 25 shows that r n ' de-  pends linearly on energy and therefore r n varies roughly quadrati-  cally with E because of the increasing number of final states avail-  able. Above about 1 Mev, equation 30 can be applied. Figure 27     DYNAMICS OF FISSION     107     shows the estimated behavior for the heaviest nuclei of T n as a  function of the maximum neutron energy. For the entropy 5", or  rather for the level density, p, equation 17 was used. The con-  stant energy difference hv (see page 94) was chosen to give a  level spacing of 20 volts at the neutron dissociation energy. Fig-  ure 27 shows also the estimated level spacing and nuclear tempera-  ture in Mev.

In fact, the reuniting of the two fragments  (to say nothing of the extra neutrons) is more complicated to con-  sider than the splitting itself.

The total neutron width in volts is shown as a function  of the maximum kinetic energy of the escaping neutrons. An  attempt was made to take account of the odd-even effect which  makes the level spacing in an odd-even nuclei lower than an  even-even nuclei for the same excitation energy. (Bohr and  Wheeler, Phys. Rev. 56, 442 (1939)).   The surface tension oscillations of the excited nucleus can be  considered as a set of closely coupled oscillators which continually  exchange energy with each other until finally a large amount of the  energy accumulates in a mode of vibration that produces fission  (see figure 25). This energy interchange is complicated, but it  turns out to be unnecessary to discuss it in detail and a statistical  method can be used. In essence, we examine a large number of  identical compound nuclei whose excitation energy lies in the range   4 Following Bohr and Wheeler,, Phys. Rev. 56, 435 (1939).     108 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   E to E+dE, and we ask what fraction of them are in a state lead-  ing to fission at that instant. Referring to the potential energy  diagram, figure 26, those nuclei which are about to fission will  have their representative point in the vicinity of the fission barrier.  Actually, it is necessary to consider the quantum character of the  system because the zero point oscillations in the direction "perpen-  dicular" to fission have large energies of the order of 0.5 Mev.  This, of course, is a result of the Uncertainty Principle, which  makes meaningless the statement that the nucleus crosses over the  fission barrier at its lowest point.   We then ask how many quantum states of motion there are in  the vicinity of the fission barrier. The saddle point corresponds  to an unstable equilibrium deformation of the nucleus. A nucleus  can execute oscillations about the potential minimum, perpendicu-  lar to the fission direction, but if its kinetic energy in the fission  direction is sufficiently large, it moves across the barrier as a free  particle. The spectrum of the nonfission oscillations should not  be different from that of an ordinary heavy nucleus about equilib-  rium. Thus, the quantum states in the vicinity of the barrier will   correspond to continuum states with momentum p in the direc-  tion of fission and to discrete levels in the perpendicular direction  resembling the lowest states of a heavy nucleus. (The concept  of quantum states in the vicinity of the barrier can be clarified  somewhat. Because of the short wavelengths for even moderate  kinetic energies in the direction of fission we can construct wave  packets of similar states which define fairly well the normal dis-  tance of the representative state from the barrier. The discrete  states of motion in the nonfission direction are spaced about 50 to  100 kv apart so that no packets can be set up.) A given nucleus  with excitation energy E cfbsses the fission barrier with kinetic  energy K=EE*-E C , where E c is the critical energy for fis-  sion and E* is the energy of its nonfission quantum state. The  number of states available in a nucleus of energy E is obviously  just N* (), where N*(E) is the number of the nonfission states  with energy * less than the maximum available kinetic energy  EE . In our original ensemble of nuclei, it is reasonable to ex-  pect then that the fraction of nuclei in the energy range from E  to E+dE about to fission is proportional to N*(E). This frac-  tion is also inversely proportional to the total number of possible  levels p(E)dE between E and E+dE, where p(E) is the  level density of the compound nucleus with excitation energy E.     DYNAMICS Of FISSION 109     In fact, it can easily be shown that B  N* 1 d     (31)     It is obvious that we cannot make any precise estimate of Tf from  this equation. Figure 28 shows the estimated value of the ratio  Tf/d as a function of the excess energy E E c . Actually even  for E less than E c the fission yield is not zero because of the possi-  bility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the fission barrier.  This effect will be considered below. From equation 31, or from  the considerations leading up to it, it is apparent that near the  threshold energy the fission yield should show characteristic steps  as the first few values of N* are reached. It also seems that the  actual observed threshold should correspond to the lowest non-fis-  sion energy level rather than to the critical energy E . The fluctu-  ation in the position of this level with respect to E c was offered as  an explanation for part of the "inconsistency" in the observed  photo-fission thresholds on page 86. From equation 31 it is seen  that, when the fission threshold is reached, the fission width r/ is  much larger than the radiation width I\~0.1 volt, so that gamma  emission is never a serious competitor.   The question arises as to the half-lives for spontaneous fission  of the fissionable nuclei and whether these are comparable with  the half-lives of other radioactive decay. A crude estimate can be  made of the probability of fission by tunneling through the fission  barrier. Figure 29 shows a diagrammatic cross section through  the fission barrier. The energy level corresponds to, say, the  ground state of the oscillation n=2, which is most favorable to fis-  sion. If we consider U 235 , the barrier height is about 4.6 Mev.  The zero-point energy has been shown 6 to be &of/2<^0.4 Mev  where w/ is the frequency of the n=2 mode of oscillation. Thus,  we may approximate the penetration probability     *!   -\f   KJ     E d x     Pi   where Piand P 2 are the entrance and exits to the "tunnel" as shown  and r is the half-life.

It is probable that the measured critical energy for fission plotted  in figure 24 should be counted from the zero point energy so that  4.6 Mev should be used instead of the 4.2 Mev above. This changes       Fig. 28. (Bohr and Wheeler). The fission width divided by the  level spacing of the compound nucleus is plotted against the  energy in excess of the critical energy for fission.

However, the ex-  ponent \/2m(E c EO) <*/fa is a convenient quantity to compare  in different nuclei since the variations of all its terms are ap-  proximately known.

Mod. Phys. 17, 293 (1946).     DYNAMICS OF FISSION 111   Comparison with experiment and estimates of fission cross  section. It is well known now that the thermal neutron fission of  uranium is due mainly to the isotope U 235 of 0.7 percent abund-  ance. The rare isotope U 234 is present in such small quantities  that it never figures in any of our calculations. The resonance cap-  ture of slow neutrons is by the abundant isotope U 238 . Anderson 9  has measured an effective absorption cross section of 5X10"" 21 cm 2  and a resonance energy of 5 volts. If this were due to U 235 , the  cross section would have to be at least 139X5XlO~ 21 cm 2 , which  is much larger than the maximum possible value 7fX 2 =125XlO~" 21  cm 2 for 5 volt neutrons.   The cross section measured is not simply related to a, the  cross section at resonance, first because of the spread in energy of  the incident neutrons and second because of the Doppler broaden-  ing of the resonance width. The Doppler effect results from the  vibrational motion of the capturing nuclei, which produces a spread  in the relative kinetic energy of the neutron with respect to the  nucleus even if there is a monochromatic neutron beam. The  magnitude of this spread in kinetic energy can be estimated very  simply, v, the relative velocity of the neutron, is V plus the for-  ward velocity of the nucleus. If E is the relative kinetic energy,     The total broadening is twice this, i.e.   A = 2\/E kT/238 .   If the resonance width r is greater than A, we have the natural  line breadth, and the effective cross section is related to the cross  section at resonance <T O by 10 <*Eff = V^vo - (32)   If r is smaller than A then 11     (33)     0*0 = - -     For 5 volt neutrons, A is 0.06 volts, which is comparable but seems  somewhat smaller than the values of r, 0.1 to 1 volt, estimated from  the other heavy nuclei.

Choice (b) is conditioned by F< A so that at most  we can make F n ~0.05 volts.   These values can be used to estimate the capture cross section  in uranium at thermal neutron energies, which is important in slow  neutron chain reactions. The effective temperature of thermal  neutrons as measured by thin absorbers 12 is (ir/4)T, so that ET*=  irkT/4=Q.028 volt at room temperature.

Anderson and Fermi measured the production of the 23 minute  activity producing 93 Np 239 , so that possibly there is another mech-  anism of absorption.   With the numbers used here, both (a) and (b) give the same  value for the absorption cross section at resonance: <T O ~ 10- 20 cm 2 .   It seems justifiable to use the one level formula 22 because, as we  shall see below, the level spacing seems to be about 20 volts in the  slow neutron region, so that the other levels could contribute only  about one-tenth as much as the 5 volt resonance level to the cross  section at thermal energies.   The thermal neutron induced fission is due to U 23B , which has  an excitation energy above fission threshold of about 1.6 Mev (see  table 7 and figure 24) on capture of a slow neutron. The fission  width at this energy is about 100 volts (see figure 30), which is  much larger than the level spacing of the compound nucleus U 236 .  Therefore, the many level formula 22 must be applied. Slow neu-  trons can be captured only with zero orbital angular momentum,  so that the only values of / available in the compound nucleus are  i : y 2 , where tfi is the angular momentum of the original nucleus  U 235 . (If i is zero, only 7=1/2 is possible.) In U 236 , i is cer-  tainly not zero, and so equation 24 becomes in this case   (34)   This should follow the \fv law. A check has been made by An-  derson, et al., 15 by comparing the activity produced by thermal  (cadmium) neutrons with that produced by neutrons absorbed in  boron whose mean energy is several volts. They observed a mean  cross section for thermal neutrons in uranium of 2X1 0~~ 24 cm 2 .  Multiplying by 139, the cross section for U 235 is   a/ (Thermal) ~ 2.8XlO~ 22 cm 2 .

This should be about  the same as the spacing of the compound nucleus U 239 when U 238  captures a slow neutron because of the odd-even fluctuations men-  tioned in the last section.      Fig. 30.

T n /d is plotted in figure 30 against the  maximum kinetic energy of the neutron emitted. The details of  estimating T n /d were discussed on page 113. For the nuclear  radius we take the results of Sherr 16 from the scattering of high  energy neutrons on nuclei. The nuclear radius can be written in  the form     where r = 1 .25 X 10~ 13 cm  and fc==:2.3XlO 13 cm.  For t/ 238 , /e=10.15 X 10~ 13 cm,     Figure 31 shows the results of applying equation 35 and the values  in figures 28 and 30 to the compound nuclei U 236 , U 289 , Th 238 and  Pu 240 . The essential difference in these four nuclei is the shifting  of the zero on the abscissa E E c in figure 28 with respect to fig-  ure 30. The threshold values shown in figure 26 are the newest  published data. The plateaus in the cross sections of U 238 and  Th 232 were first calculated by Bohr and Wheeler. 17 They actually  got better agreement with the measurements of Ladenburg etc., 18  than is the case in figure 31. Ladenburg found little change  in the cross section of U 238 from 2 to 3 Mev neutron energy. The  U 238 cross section was 0.5XlO r ~" 24 it=25^ cm 2 , which is somewhat  smaller than our 0.7XlO~~ 24 cm 2 . Similarly, they measured Th 232  in the same region and obtained 0.1X10~~ 24 cm 2 as compared to  0.15X10 24 cm 2 in figure 31. However, Bohr and Wheeler used  values for the fission thresholds which are about 0.5 Mev high, so  that both the agreement they obtained and the approximate agree-  ment in figure 31 must be considered somewhat fortuitous.   The cross sections for U 235 and Pu 239 are more interesting.  Both decrease from very large values at thermal energies <r^3X  IQ 22 cm 2 un tii somewhere near E^0.25 Mev when X becomes  smaller than the nuclear radius. The further decrease, es-  pecially in U 235 , is caused by the competition from neutron  emission, which is negligible only below, say, .25 Mev. For  example, in U 235 the cross section is decreased by 4 per-  cent at neutron energies of 1 Mev. It is evident from   B. Sherr, Phys. Rev. 68, 240 (1945).  1T Bohr and Wheeler, Phys.

T n /d contains the kinetic energy E  times the level density, while F//rf contains only N*, the number of  available "nonfission" levels. The competition from neutron  emission is not so large in plutonium, so that its cross section will  be several percent higher than that of U 235 ; this may be of some  advantage in a chain reacting unit.     CHAPTER 9  EARLY WORK ON CHAIN REACTIONS   In chapter 5 we described the experiments of von Halban,  Joliot and Kowarski 19 which first conclusively established that more  than one neutron was emitted for each neutron absorbed in produc-  ing a fission in uranium. In the same paper these physicists sug-  gested that this phenomenon could, under suitable conditions, re-  sult in the propagation of a nuclear chain reaction in uranium.  They pointed out that a chain reaction would just continue if one  of the secondary neutrons produced a fission, and thus another  complement of neutrons, and if one of these in turn produced a  fission and so on. Since each fission results in the release of about  200 Mev of energy, the energy of reaction in a large mass of uran-  ium would be very large. This suggestion was followed by nu-  merous experiments and calculations to determine the conditions  necessary for the establishment of this revolutionary type of nuclear  reaction.   The possibility of using the chain reaction for the production  of power naturally excited great interest. But the reaction was  also intensively studied for its inherent scientific value because it  represented a new phenomenon in nuclear physics. In the past,  many nuclear reactions had been found in which individual reac-  tions produced a large net amount of energy, but these reactions  could not be used for the production of large quantities of energy,  because the efficiency of production of an individual reaction was  very poor, and once the reaction was produced neither enough en-  ergy was produced nor were the right particles emitted to give  further reactions. Thus fission opened a new field of nuclear  chemistry.   It is interesting to note that a fission chain reaction differs from  the more usual chemical chain reactions the former being depend-  ent on the production of new particles, whereas the latter proceeds  by the rearrangement of particles already present in the system.   It is our main purpose in this chapter to review the early work  that was done to establish the possibility of a fission chain reaction.  We shall see that many of the fundamental scientific considerations  that went into the design of the first successful nuclear chain re-   10 von Halban, Joliot and Kowarski, Nature 143, 470, 680 (1939).   117     118 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   action by the Manhattan District project were developed in this  early period.   Qualitative considerations. The essential problem in the pro-  duction of a fission chain reaction is to realize such conditions that,  after all competing processes have absorbed neutrons, there is one  neutron left over from each fission to produce another fission. In  any neutron processes involving ordinary uranium, there are four  mechanisms competing for the available neutrons.   (a) Fission capture of neutrons by the uranium. (This  could be caused either by the capture of thermal neutrons by U 285  or by the capture of fast neutrons by U 235 and U 238 .)   (b) Escape of neutrons from the system.   (c) Nonfission capture of neutrons by U 238 , leading ulti-  mately to the production of plutonium. This is a resonance pro-  cess whose peak occurs at about 5 ev.   (d) Capture of neutrons by other materials present, such  as impurities or deliberately added materials.   A chain reaction will ensue only if process (a) produces  enough neutrons to compensate for these losses, with at least one  neutron left over to continue the chain. Since a fission reaction  produces only a given number of neutrons, effort must be directed  toward minimizing the parasitic (neutron-consuming) processes  relative to the fission processes.   These considerations may be expressed quantitatively in terms  of a multiplication factor (or reproduction factor), k f for the sys-  tem, k is defined as the average number of new neutrons ultimate-  ly produced by each neutron in the system. For the chain reaction  to act, k must be greater than or at least equal to unity. The re-  action will proceed steadily if k is kept just equal to unity.   Critical size. The escape of neutrons from a chain reacting  system is a surface effect ~and varies as R 2 for a sphere, where R  is the radius of the sphere; on the other hand, capture processes  are volume effects and vary as R 3 . Thus the ratio of the rate of  escape of neutrons from the system to the rate of capture inside  the system varies as R" 1 and decreases with increasing size of the  system. Therefore, if a chain reaction is possible, it can take place  only in systems larger than a certain critical size for which the  rate of escape is small enough, compared to the rate of capture,  for the reaction to proceed. The first calculation of the minimum  mass of uranium oxide necessary for the production of a fast neu-  tron chain reaction was made by Perrin. 20 Similar calculations   80 F.

Following Adler, we consider a sphere of uranium oxide  (UaOg) of radius R in which the concentration N of fast neutrons  at any point at some time t is given by the diffusion equation   dN   - = D A *N + KN . (36)   9'   This is the usual diffusion equation with the extra term, KN, giv-  ing the net extra number of neutrons produced per unit volume  per second at any instant at a given point in the sphere.

The  diffusion coefficient D is given by :     Z?=(l/3) X*=(l/3) *>(AWi + AW)-i, (38)   where A is the mean free path of a neutron, cr t v is the total cross  section of uranium for a neutron and a 8 i is the scattering cross sec-  tion for neutrons of the other atoms. For diffusion theory to be  valid, the mean free path must be much smaller than the radius of  the sphere.   Neutrons at the surface of the sphere will escape rapidly, so  that the concentration at the surface will be very small ; for sim-  plicity we take the concentration at the surface to be zero at all  times. (Better boundary conditions will be considered in later  chapters.) The solution of equation 36 under these conditions is   oo A v vrrr ( K ^ 2 ir 2 D/R 2 )t .

MAELY WORK ON CHAIN REACTIONS 121   for an initial number Q of neutrons concentrated at the origin,  A w =Q v/2R*.   The concentration of neutrons at any point will increase ex-  ponentially in time if one of the coefficients (K v 2 7T 2 Z?/7? 2 ) is  positive. This gives us the two conditions that must be satisfied  if a chain reaction is to proceed :   (a) That K >0; this condition may be written as     - > 1 , (40)   Ji   which states that the number of neutrons produced per neutron  absorbed in the system must be greater than unity.     (b) That R>TT^D/K . (41)   From equations 37 and 38 this becomes     ^>(3[JV I7 ( M r-l)<r r -2Arcrai] [Ncaw + ZNvn] )   4 i     The radius R c 7r\/D/K is called the critical radius. If R<R C , the  concentration of neutrons at each point decreases with time; if  R=R C , the concentration approaches an asymptotic value; if  R>R C , the concentration increases exponentially with time, tend-  ing to produce an explosive reaction. Perrin 22 found 140 cm for  the critical radius for uranium oxide, for a fast neutron reaction.  This corresponds to 40 tons of uranium oxide. The mean free  path for a neutron is 10 cm, so that the use of diffusion theory is  approximately valid.   The concentration may be integrated over the volume of the  sphere to obtain the total number of neutrons within the sphere  at any time ; this function is plotted in figure 32 for the case of an  initial concentration of neutrons at the origin.   It should be noted that the effect of inelastic collisions has been  neglected in this calculation. These collisions rapidly reduce the  energy of the neutrons and change the values of v and the cross  sections. The effect of the impurities produced in the fission reac-  tion has also been neglected ; as the reaction proceeds, these impuri-  ties increase the value of %Ni&ai and tend to reduce K to a. value     less than zero, thereby halting the reaction. However, if the radius  is large enough, the mass will be blown apart before these effects  enter.   n F.

Substances  like carbon, beryllium and iron have large scattering cross sections  and negligible neutron absorption cross sections. Thus, if a chain-  reacting mass of uranium were surrounded by a layer of one of  these materials, the layer would act to reflect neutrons back into  the system which would ordinarily escape from the surface. This  has the effect of increasing the number of available neutrons for  the chain reaction, and thus the chain can be propagated in a sys-  tem of smaller size. Perrin calculated that a layer of iron 35 cm  thick surrounding a uranium-oxide system would reduce the criti-  cal mass of oxide from 40 tons to only 12 tons. We shall discuss  the effect of a reflecting layer or tamper in more detail in chapters  10 and 11.      Fig. 32.

The neutrons produced by fission have  energies ranging up to 3.5 Mev, but these energies are reduced to  thermal energies by a succession of elastic and inelastic collisions  with uranium. Upon reaching energies in the neighborhood of  5 ev the neutrons become subject to nonfission resonance capture  by the uranium. In the resonance region the absorption cross sec-  tion is very high (about 5000 x 10~~ 24 cm 2 ), so that very few neu-  trons get through to the thermal energy region where they may  cause slow-neutron-induced fissions.   It occurred to many physicists that the effect of resonance  capture could be reduced by mixing uranium with another sub-  stance which did not strongly absorb neutrons. Then, in slowing  down to thermal energies, the neutrons would collide with the mod-  erator instead of the uranium, and the probability of nonfission  capture would be reduced. Elements of low atomic weight are  particularly suited for this purpose since they cause large reduc-  tions in the kinetic energy of a neutron in each elastic collision.   The latter consideration makes water a natural first choice  for a moderator, since a neutron loses on the average half its kine-  tic energy in a head-on elastic collision with a hydrogen nucleus.  However, water possesses the disadvantage that its hydrogen ab-  sorbs slow neutrons by the reaction     Consequently, if too much water is added the hydrogen will absorb  appreciable numbers of thermal neutrons, thereby decreasing the  possibility of a chain reaction. Many experiments were performed  to determine if a slow neutron chain reaction could be propagated  in a mixture of uranium and water. Fermi and Szilard (see page  46) used cylindrical rods of uranium-oxide in water and con-  cluded that it was questionable whether a chain reaction could be  propagated in such a system. This was followed by a series of ex-  periments by von Halban, Joliot, Kowarski and Perrin, 24 using  various concentrations of uranium, uranium-oxide and water and  various geometrical arrangements, from which they concluded that  a chain reaction was possible in a uranium-water system. How-  ever, Turner 25 showed that the data had been incorrectly inter-  preted, and that they in fact indicated that a chain reaction was def-  initely impossible in a uranium-water system. However, Turner  stated that since about 1.5 neutrons were produced in uranium   * von Halban, Joliot, Kowarski and Perrin, J. de Phys, ser. 7, 10, 428   (1939).   * L. A. Turner, Phys. Rev. 57, 334 (1940).     EARLY WOEK ON CHAIN REACTIONS     125     for each thermal neutron absorbed, it was possible that a slow neu-  tron chain reaction would take place in a mixture of uranium and  some other moderator.   To be useful, a moderator must have a very small absorption  cross section for neutrons in addition to being an element of low  atomic number. The other substances which received early con-  sideration for use as moderators were heavy water, beryllium and  graphite, all of which have far lower absorption cross sections for  neutrons than ordinary hydrogen (see table 13). Heavy water  was seen to be best, but it was unobtainable in large quantities in  1940.   Isotope separation and plutonium fission. Thermal neutrons  produce fission only in the isotope of uranium of mass number 235  (see page 6). This isotope occurs in natural uranium in a con-  centration of one part in 140. The cross section for fission by  thermal neutrons in U 236 is about 400 x 10~ 24 cm 2 . It is the abun-  dant isotope U 238 that has the resonance absorption for neutrons of  5 ev energy.   When these facts became clear it was obvious that the likeli-  hood of producing a chain reaction could be increased by increasing  the relative amounts of U 238 to U 238 over the concentration ratio   Table 12   CROSS SECTIONS FOR FAST NEUTRONS (1) (IN UNITS OF 10~ 24   cm 2 )     Substance    Cross section <r t    iH    1.7    iH 2    1.7    8 Li    1.8    4Be    1.6    S B 10    1.6    c    1.6    T N    1.8    isAl    2.4     (1) H.

The enrichment of uranium with U 235 is  useful for slow neutron chain reactions with a moderator, because  the total amount of fissionable material is increased, thereby de-  creasing relatively the parasitic effect of the nonfission absorption  by the U 238 . Enrichment in U~ 35 (or the use of pure U 235 ) is  probably useful for fast neutron chain reactions because the fission  cross section of U 235 for fast neutrons is probably greater than the  corresponding cross section of U 238 .   As described in chapter 6, McMillan and Abelson 26 discov-  ered that the absorption of neutrons in U 238 resulted in the ulti-  mate formation of a transuranic element of atomic number 94 and  mass number 239, which we now call plutonium. The Bohr-  Wheeler theory of fission (see chapter 7) predicts that plutonium  239 has fission properties which are similar to the properties of  U 235 . In particular, plutonium should fission under the action of  slow neutrons. The production of plutonium in a slow neutron  chain reacting system would thus tend to compensate for the deple-  tion of the fission-producing U 235 .   It was realized that if plutonium could be separated from the  uranium of the system, the plutonium could be used instead of U 28a  for enrichment or, in its pure form, for fast neutron chain reacting  systems. This separation would be a chemical separation and  might be more practicable than the isotopic separation of U 235 from  natural uranium.   Use of a lattice. Smyth (2.11) reported that Fermi and  Szilard suggested the use of a moderator with lumps or rods of  uranium imbedded in it, rather than a homogeneous mixture of  moderator and uranium. The advantage of such a lattice struc-  ture, or "pile," over the homogeneous mixture lies in the shielding  that the surface of the uranium lump affords for the interior, in so   REFERENCES TO TABLE 13   (1) Scare's Chart, 1945, is the source of all these data except <r t for the  deuteron.   (2) H. A. Bethe, Eev. Mod. Phys. 9, 69 (1937) ; table on page 151.   (3) H. A. Bethe, loc. cit., points out that the scattering cross sections are  independent of energy for slow neutrons above the thermal range.   (4) H. A. Bethe, loc. cit., section 59, discusses the effect of chemical bind-  ing on the scattering cross section at thermal energies. In paraffin <j- g  is increased by a factor of 2.8 above the free hydrogen value. A simi-  lar argument applied to water (vibrational frequencies 3400, 3600  and 1500 cm- 1 ) yields a factor of 3.4, giving <r g =68 x 10-* cm 2 .  For heavy hydrogen in water a similar argument, assuming the same  vibrational frequencies, leads to a factor of 1.9 giving <r g =7.6 x 10-"  cm 2 . This adjustment is for thermal values only, the cross sections in  the region of a few electron volts remaining unchanged.   28 McMillan and Abelson, Phys. Rev. 57, 1185 (1940).     128 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   far as resonance absorption is concerned. If neutrons in the reso-  nance energy range strike the uranium surface, they penetrate it  on the average only to a depth of the order of the mean free path  for absorption of such neutrons in uranium. This mean free path  A is given by the formula   1   A = - , (42)     where NU is the atomic concentration of uranium and <r a is the ab-  sorption coefficient. As we shall see later (page 142), A is 0.0042 cm  for resonance energy neutrons. The shielding effect does not act  substantially for thermal and fast neutrons if the dimensions of  the lump are less than the mean penetration distance of thermal  and fast neutrons in uranium (3.8 cm and 43 cm, respectively).   This arrangement was utilized by Anderson, Fermi and Szil-  ard 27 in early experiments to determine the average number of neu-  trons produced per thermal neutron absorbed by uranium. This  experiment is described in chapter 5 (page 46). They used cyl-  indrical cans 5 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height, filled with ura-  nium-oxide (see figure 18). The ratio of the average atomic con-  centration of hydrogen to that of uranium was 17 to 1.   Control of a chain reaction. It is clear that the equilibrium  condition of a slow neutron chain reacting system can be varied  by changes in the amount of neutron-absorbing material in the  system. Insertion or withdrawal of a highly absorbent material  like cadmium or boron could thus be used to adjust the reaction  to a given stable condition. Such an adjustment would be difficult  if the system reacted very quickly to changes in the available neu-  tron density. Fortunately,, the propagation of the chain is depend-  ent on the production of delayed neutrons accompanying fission  (see chapter 5). Thus, if the neutron density is changed, there  will be a time delay before this change is reflected in the number  of secondary neutrons produced in the system. As a result, the  system will adjust itself slowly to changes in the total neutron ab-  sorption and the reaction can be controlled easily.   An interesting possible mechanism for self-stabilization of a  chain reaction in the presence of a cadmium absorber was suggested  by Adler and von Halban. 28 On page 121 we demonstrated that   2T Anderson, Fermi and Szilard, Phys.

EARLY WORK ON CHAIN REACTIONS 129   the necessary condition which must be satisfied if a chain reaction  is to proceed is   Nuorfp > 1. (43)     The absorption cross section of most substances for thermal  neutrons is proportional to the reciprocal of the neutron velocity,  that is, the probability that a neutron is captured is proportional to  the time it spends in the neighborhood of a nucleus. This is called  the 1/v - law of neutron absorption (see chapter 8). If all the  absorbers follow the \/v - law, equation 43 will be independent ot  v and thus independent of the temperature. However, if we in-  troduce an absorber such as cadmium, which does not obey the \fv  - law but has an approximately constant absorption cross section  for neutron energies ranging from the thermal energy region to  4 ev, then equation 43 may be written > 1 , (44)     -\~2NiVai-i-NcdVaCd V     where the primes denote that the l/v dependence has been factored  out; and cr a cd is constant in the thermal energy region. Now as  the reaction proceeds and the temperature increases, v will increase  and tend to reduce the quotient to unity, thereby slowing the reac-  tion. Thus the chain reaction will eventually stabilize itself at  some elevated temperature.   Other considerations. An obvious method of increasing the  probability of a chain reaction is to purify the materials used, thus  reducing the undesirable neutron absorptions. Smyth discusses  the problems which arose in securing adequate quantities of suffi-  ciently pure uranium and graphite for a pile system. One of the  troublesome impurities in both cases was boron (Smyth 4.42,  6.1 Off, 6.20), whose cross section for absorption of thermal neu-  trons is 160,000 times the corresponding cross section for carbon  (table 14), so that its presence to even a few parts per million adds  appreciably to the neutron absorption.   If a self-sustaining chain reaction is successfully established, its  maintenance results in changes which affect its further continuance.  Thus, the production of large amounts of energy would tend to heat  the system unless the energy is removed by some cooling system.  (A cooling system, however, adds to the parasitic neutron absorp-  tions.) Also, as the fission products build up they tend to poison     130     NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     fc          OJ     3     VO     r I Tj- IT)     w     H  U     Q  O     O   h-f  0}  C/5     W   a   o     fc  O   H  U  W  C/3       U     In .S ' S G   ~ -S g S   13 S 5 a? -S   *-* ^ rrt O     vO        2   CD     3 -     O\         o     1 1 1 ^ 1   1 1 1 ~4 1 <L> O     c^   C/3     pq     V)     .S> fc   II     ir> ro     OO ON  co co     EAMLY WORK ON CHAIN REACTIONS     131     10   CM     VO CM   o     Th ON vo rh 06 *-* -tf-  CM vo "tf- T-H CO CO     8 K'S     o o     ro ^- ro  t^OrO   g g     8 -     O   . _ CO   O CO ro vo  vo     CM CM CM CM     ro     J2 - , v  S co H     t i CM   *o 10     CM     00 ON O\ *-  ro to rj- 10     vo  co     10 CM     CM     oo     vo  CM     ro ^t- vo r>* CM to  vo *o to to vo \o     g     o   t-> O  , -^        132 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   the system by adding to the probability of nonfission capture of  neutrons. Depletion of the U 235 also would tend to halt the re-  action, although it is compensated partially by the production of  plutonium. These questions will be considered in more detail in  chapter 10.   Pertinent data. Before entering into a more detailed analysis  of chain-reacting systems, it is desirable to collect and summarize  the data about the processes and materials involved. Though the  fundamental data obtained during the war are not yet available,  enough in known from published material (or can be estimated  from basic physical considerations) to give us confidence in the  validity of the main details of our interpretations and conclusions.   The considerations outlined in the preceding chapter indicate  the type of data needed for a more detailed analysis. We need to  know the details of the fission processes average number of neu-  trons released, energy released, fission cross sections, etc., as well  as cross sections for all accompanying neutron processes, such as  scattering and absorption in uranium, in possible impurities, in  possible moderators and in the fission products. We need to know  the densities, atomic concentrations and neutron mean free paths,  for the moderator and the fissionable materials.   In his review article on nuclear fission, Turner 29 discusses  the experimental data available in 1939 concerning the nuclear  cross sections for uranium. Though some of the results were un-  certain and discrepancies existed among determinations by differ-  ent investigators, one can select reasonable values for the cross  sections with confidence that the precise data when available will  not seriously effect the conclusions derived from these values.   The data concerning the fission processes were analyzed in the  earlier chapters of this book, and references to the sources are giv-  en there. The principal sources of the other absorption and scat-  tering data are Bethe's 80 review article on nuclear physics and a  chart of nuclei from E. Segre, revised May 1945. Where these  sources overlap, Segre's chart has been given precedence.   * L. A. Turner, Rev. Mod. Phys. 12, 1 (1940).  10 H. A. Bethe, Rev. Mod. Phys. 9, 69 (1937).     CHAPTER 10   SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES   As Smyth points out in his report, the primary purpose of  developing the pile systems was the immediate production of plu-  tonium in large quantities. Other obvious uses of piles the pro-  duction of energy, of neutrons and of radioactive materials, were  of only incidental interest. This purpose naturally directed the  course of the development. For instance, the selection of materials  (ordinary uranium, with graphite moderator) was governed by  considerations of immediate availability, purity and general expedi-  ency, with little regard for cost, size and ultimate practicability for  peacetime uses. Since we shall use the information given in the  Smyth report as a guide in making our analysis and as a check on  the validity of our conclusions, we shall restrict the discussion in  the first part of the chapter to this type of pile (ordinary uranium  with graphite moderator). More general considerations of pile  design and application will be set up in the second part.  CARBON-URANIUM PILES   Considerations adjecting pile design. The general considera-  tions of the preceding chapter together with a survey of the Smyth  report indicate the possible analysis of the physical factors involved  in the development of piles. The following are the considerations  which we shall attempt to analyze in greater detail :   (1) The action of a moderator in reducing resonance absorption,  including the calculation of optimum proportions of moder-  ator and uranium.   (2) The shielding effect of lumps or rods of uranium and its  influence on the proportions of materials.   (3) The relationship of power production, plutonium production  and production of radioactive fission products.   (4) The effects of additional materials, such as impurities, cooling  system, fission products and control absorbers.   (5) The calculation of neutron lifetimes and neutron densities  in a pile.   (6) The determination of the critical size of a pile.   (7) The effect of a reflecting layer.   (8) The inertial effect of delayed neutrons.   138     134 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   We shall make use of the data given at the end of the preced-  ing chapter, in which, as already stated, there are a number of un-  certainties. It will be necessary also to make many simplifying  assumptions in our analysis. Though the data are not sufficiently  reliable to justify calculations to two significant figures we have  done so to preserve internal consistency in the calculations, and  the general pattern of the analysis should be valid.   Summary of pile data. We shall summarize the pertinent  data given in Smyth's report regarding the piles constructed dur-  ing the period 1940 to 1945.  FIRST COLUMBIA PILE   This was a graphite cube approximately 8 feet on an edge,  containing 7 tons of uranium oxide in iron containers which were  distributed at equal intervals through the graphite. It was unsuc-  cessful (&<1). A second larger pile gave k <X) =0.87. The urani-  um oxide contained 2 to 5 percent impurities, including a little  boron.  CHICAGO WEST STANDS PILE   This was the first self-sustaining pile. It contained 12,400  pounds of uranium metal, distributed in lumps in a graphite mod-  erator, and an unspecified amount of pressed uranium-oxide lumps.  It was an oblate spheroid in shape. Calculated values for for  the control metal lattice was 1 .07 ; for the two uranium oxide lat-  tices making up the bulk of the rest of the pile, , was 1 .04 and 1 .03  In operation the effective k was 1.006. The metallic uranium and  the oxide were very pure, the graphite having a neutron absorption  20 percent less than the standard commercial material. Cadmium  strips were used for control. The pile was first operated at a pow-  er level of 0.5 watt, and later this was increased to 200 watts. A  reconstructed version of this pile at Argonne was run at a few kil-  owatts.  CLINTON PILE   This was a cube of graphite with horizontal channels filled  with uranium; it was considerably larger than the West Stands  pile. The uranium was in the form of cylindrical rods encased in  gas-tight aluminum casings, space being left for air-cooling. It  eventually attained a power level greater than 1800 kw. The ef-  ficiency of separation of plutonium was increased from the initial  50 percent to about 80 or 90 percent. By February 1944, one-  third ton of uranium per day went from the pile to the separation  plant. During February several grams of plutonium were deliv-  ered.     SLOW NEUTEON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 185   HANFORD PILES   These are three water-cooled graphite-uranium piles, which  use uranium rods sealed in aluminum jackets. Aluminum pipes  are used in the cooling system. Smyth estimates, as an example,  that a production of 1 kg/day of plutonium corresponds to a power  production of 0.5 x 10 6 to 1.5 x 10 6 kw. He states that the rise in  temperature of the Columbia river is too small to affect fish life.  ARGON NE HEAVY WATER PILE   This pile, which used heavy water as a moderator, was small  compared to the uranium-graphite piles. It was run at 300 kw  and operated so successfully that some uranium had to be removed.  It took several hours to reach equilibrium and could not be shut  down as completely or as rapidly as the graphite piles because de-  layed gamma rays tended to produce additional neutrons from the  water. The neutron density at the center was high.   Collision theory for a moderator. From the elementary the-  ory of elastic collisions of spheres (or collisions of particles with  the distribution in angle isotropic in a coordinate system in which  the center of mass is at rest) 33 each collision of a neutron of mass m  with a nucleus of mass M reduces the neutron energy on the aver-  age (arithmetic mean) by a fraction   2mM  f = (45)   (M+m) 2   For heavy nuclei this reduces to 2m/M. The fractional loss has  equal probability of being anywhere from zero to twice the aver-  age value. The average losses per collision are given in table 12  for such elements as carbon (/c = 0.142) and uranium (/u =  0.0083). The results refer to elastic collisions only; for inelastic  collisions the energy losses amount to as much as 90 percent. 84   If we assume that in each collision a neutron loses exactly this  fraction / of its energy, then after q elastic collisions its energy is  reduced from an initial value E to a final value E, where   (!-/) = E/E (46)   Reducing the energy of a neutron from, say, 1 Mev to thermal en-  ergy (about 0.025 ev) by collisions in carbon would therefore re-  quire 115 collisions, while reducing its energy to 5 ev would re-  quire 80. Actually the first few collisions would be inelastic, but  this would not change greatly the number of required collisions.   In the next section we shall need to know the probability pi  that a neutron, initially at a high energy E , shall at some time have   " Condon and Breit, Phys. Rev. 49, 229 (1936).  84 H. A.

If we assume that the initial energy E is much great-  er than the resonance energy E r , that the probability distribution  of neutrons in the energy range near E r is uniform, and that the  neutrons suffer exactly the average fractional energy loss / in a  collision, then those neutrons which cross the resonance energy  value E r in a collision will have come from the region E r to r /(l /)  and will be uniformly distributed in the region E r (lf) to E r . The  probability that a neutron, in crossing the resonance value E r , will  be in a region of width w (the resonance width) is     This value is decreased because the probability distribution of neu-  trons increases with decreasing energy, and because the neutrons  crossing the resonance value E r spread out over a larger energy  region than fE r , viz., 2f E T . It is increased by the probability that  neutrons with energy greater than E r /(\-j} may drop into the  resonance region in one collision. A more exact calculation of pi  shows that   pi=Bw/E r (47)   where B varies from 1 for hydrogen to I// for heavy elements. For  carbon B turns out to be 6.3. For very heavy elements such as  uranium itself, where w is equal to or greater than / E r , the neutron  is certain to land in the resonance region and the probability pi  must be taken to be unity.   Let us consider the case of a neutron in a hydrogen medium.  After one collision its energy has equal probability of lying any-  where from to E . 36 The probability of its being in the energy  range E to E+dE, therefore, is p (E)dE, where   p (E) = l/E .   After a number of collisions the regions below E will have great-  er probability of having at some time contained the neutron. Let  p(E) be the ultimate probability distribution, that is, the proba-  bility that the range E to E-{-dE ever contains the neutron is  p(E)dE. Then, by considering the effect of collisions after the  first one,   dE 1      For simplicity E r is taken to be the "top" of the resonance region rath-  er than its center. Since the region is very narrow, this choice does not  affect the value of E f appreciably.   Condon and Breit, Phys. Eev. 49, 229 (1936).

(48)   The probability pi of the neutron's being at some time in the range  E r to E r w (where E r is the resonance energy and w is the width  of the resonance region) is, therefore,   E r ^   w   - (49)   E E r   E r W   if w E r .   Let us consider the problem of a neutron of energy in  some other medium of atomic mass M. After one collision its  energy has equal probability 37 of being anywhere from (l-2/)  to E , where   2mM   F   (M+w) 2   The probability of its being in the range E to E-\-dE, therefore, is  p (E)dE, where   1     2fE   = 0, <(! 2f).   Let the probability that the range E to E-\-dE ever contains  the neutron be p(E)dE.

It a  neutron has energy E between EI and i/(l-2/) the probability  of its crossing the value EI in its next collision is  /2jE. The condition becomes :   Ei     r r E,- (i-2/) ^i   / 1-2/ p(E) \ \*E =   J I 2/ J     1 (51)     This yields the value     B - - .

SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 189   Equation 50 can also be obtained from equation 51, if the  assumption is made that p(E) is independent of Ei/E and there-  fore does not contain EI explicitly. This may be seen by substi-  tution in equation 51 of E\u for E and q(Eiu) for EIU p(Eiu).   It may be noted that if B/E is multiplied by q\/v, where q  is the number of neutrons produced per second, A is the mean free  path and the neutron velocity v=\/2E/m, the result gives the  density of neutrons as a function of energy under conditions of  steady production of monochromatic neutrons. It then agrees with  the formula given by G. Placzek. 38   Proportion of carbon <and uranium. Given a pile of infinite  size consisting of a mixture of carbon and ordinary uranium, one  problem that concerns us is the determination of the multiplication  factor &oo, that is the average number of new neutrons ultimately  produced by each neutron in the system. We shall use the follow-  ing notation :   p, m number of neutrons released per fission  Nu = atomic concentration of uranium (atoms/cc)  N c = atomic concentration of carbon (atoms/cc)   P = ratio of atomic concentration of carbon to that of ura.nium  o- 8x = scattering cross section for element X  o-/ r = fission capture cross section for element X  o- ax = non-fission absorption cross section for element X  The superscripts th, res and fast, as in oyu**, refer to the thermal,  resonance and fast energy regions, respectively.  We shall need to determine the following quantities : &, = average number of new neutrons ultimately produced per   neutron in the system.  = average number of new fissions ultimately produced by the   /* neutrons produced in one fission.   Pf = probability that a fast neutron will be slowed down by col-  lisions to thermal energies and then be captured by the  uranium to produce fission.   P aU = probability that a fast neutron will ultimately undergo a  non-fission absorption in uranium, to cause the formation  of plutonium.  P aG = probability that a fast neutron will ultimately be absorbed   in carbon.   p = probability that during the slowing down process the neu-  tron will enter the resonance region near 5 ev and be  captured by the uranium.  3 G. Placzek, Phys. Eev. 55, 1130 (1939).     140 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   fa = probability that a thermal neutron will be absorbed in urani-  um to produce fission.  = probability that a thermal neutron will undergo non-fission   absorption in uranium to produce plutonium.  = probability that a thermal neutron will be absorbed in car-  bon.   Most of these quantities can immediately be expressed in terms of  cross sections and atomic concentrations. Thus, we have:     (54)  (55)     (56)     + A^u o-au'* +     (57)   (58)  (59)  ) (60)   The probability /> is the product of two probabilities, the prob-  ability pi that a neutron in being slowed down will enter the res-  onance region, and the probability p% that if it is in this resonance  region it will be captured by the uranium. The probability p 2 is  evidently given by     (61)  N c <T*c r8 + Afu a ou rw   if we assume that elastic collisions with carbon will always cause  a neutron's energy to fall below the resonance region, whereas  elastic collisions with uranium always leave it in the resonance re-  gion. A 5 volt neutron loses 0.142 X 5 = 0.720 ev on the aver-  age in a collision with carbon, whereas it loses 0.0083 X 5 = 0.042  ev on the average in a collision with uranium. The width w of  the resonance region has been taken to be 0.16 ev, so that the rela-  tive error for carbon is of the order (0.16 X y 2 )/(0.720 X 2) =  0.06.   The probability pi was calculated in the preceding section to  be Bw/Er for carbon and unity for uranium. For a mixture of  carbon and uranium an average probability must be used. In tak-  ing this average, allowance must be made for the fact that the ener-     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES     141     gy regions from which the neutron may cross into the resonance  region are proportional in extent to the respective values of the  average fractional energy losses /c (carbon) and fa (uranium).

We have also neglected the pro-  duction of fissions by fast neutrons, which would tend to enhance  slightly the number of neutrons reaching the lower energy regions  per fast neutron produced in the pile. We shall allow for this en-  hancement later (page 148).

From it we see that &oo is a maximum for a ratio p of atomic concentrations of about 20,  at which ratio k is 0.90. We also notice that the variation  of &oo with p is slight for p between 5 and 100.   For a value of p of 20, equations 54 to 62 yield the following  probabilities for the ultimate disposition of a neutron in the sys-  tem : Pf (fission) = 0.39; P a v (non-fission absorption in uranium)  = 0.59 (0.20 of this being absorption in the resonance region and  0.39 being thermal absorption) : and P aC (absorption in carbon)  = 0.012. For p = 100 the results are: P f = 0.38; P a v = 0.56  (0.18 in the resonance region) ; and P a c = 0.06.   Another way of stating the above results is to say that for  every 2.3 neutrons created in a fission, 0.90 lead to another fission,  1.36 are absorbed in uranium to cause the formation of plutonium  and 0.03 are absorbed in carbon, for p=20. A similar statement  holds for p=10Q.   Shielding effect of a lattice. As we indicated in the preced-  ing chapter, the advantage of using a lump or rod of uranium in a  moderator rather than a homogeneous mixture is that the surface  of the lump shields the interior from resonance absorption. This  is true if the dimensions of the lump are larger than the mean dis-  tance of penetration of neutrons in the resonance energy range.  At the same time the dimensions should not exceed the mean dis-  tance of penetration of thermal neutrons or the number of fissions  will be reduced.   The mean penetration distance L rcs for neutrons in the reson-  ance energy range may be taken to be A, where   1   A = - . (64)   N at   This is 0.0042 cm for ordinary uranium. For neutrons in the ther-  mal range the problem is complicated since a neutron makes several  elastic collisions before being absorbed. For a large number q of  such collisions, the mean penetration distance is then     ) (65)   The number q is given by <r 9 at   q . _ - + 1 = - (66)   a a + <*1 <r a + oy   For ordinary uranium q is 3.8.

We shall, therefore,  take the optimum radius of the lump or rod to be 2.4 cm in order  to provide optimum shielding of the uranium from neutrons in the  resonance region.   For a spherical lump the shielding effect will reduce the effec-  tive uranium atomic concentration NV for resonance absorption  in equations 61 and 62 in the ratio     4/3     3Z/< R     (67)      Fig. 33.

A graph of fe  versus p is shown in figure 33. From it we see the fc*. is a maxi-  mum for a ratio p of atomic concentrations of about 40, at which  ratio 00 is approximately 1 .09. We also notice that the variation  of &co with p is small for p between 10 and 100. We may compare  our results with the first Columbia pile, described briefly on page  134. From its dimensions (8 feet on an edge) and the fact that  it contained 7 tons of uranium oxide, the atomic ratio may be cal-  culated.

If it is in powder form (density 3.3 gm/cc, as  given in table 17) the ratio will be 100. For such large ratios the  oxygen absorption may be neglected, so that comparison with our  results for metal uranium is valid. Our optimum atomic ratio  was 40. The check is adequate, therefore, considering the slow  variation of k m with p and the inaccuracies in our data. Our cal-  culated value of p would be increased if the absorption cross sec-  tion at resonance were increased, if the breadth w of the resonance  region were taken to be larger, or if the shielding effect were less  pronounced. On the other hand, the increased extraneous absorp-  tion due to oxygen and impurities would reduce the calculated val-  ue of p somewhat. The fast fission enhancement effect would also  reduce the optimum p.   As we shall see, Smyth's value of 200 (Smyth 8.9) for the  number of collisions made by a neutron in carbon in a typical  graphite moderated pile, is also in better agreement with an atomic  ratio of 100 rather than 40. For this reason we shall use the value  p=lOO in our future discussion. For p=100, & is 1.06. In view  of these uncertainties, the agreement with the calculated value of  1 .07 for QO for the central metal lattice of the Chicago West Stands  pile (Smyth, Appendix 4) is fortuitous.   As on page 142, it is interesting to calculate the relative prob-  abilities of the various methods of disposal of a neutron in the in-  finite pile. For p 100, P,=0.46, P aU 0.47 (0.010 in the reson-  ance region and 0.46 in the thermal region), and P aC =0.069. If a  finite pile is used (together with control absorbers), so that k is  unity, then these figures would be reduced by the factor 1/1.06.  Therefore, for each 2.3 neutrons formed in a fission, 0.15 are ab-  sorbed in carbon, 1.02 are absorbed in uranium to form plutonium  (0.022 in the surface layer and 1.0 in the body of the lump), 1.0 is  available for further fissions, and 0.14 escape from the pile (or  are taken up by the control absorbers).   Though the probability of absorption by uranium of neutrons  in the resonance energy region is small, the effect is sufficient to  make the surface of the lump far richer in plutonium than the in-  terior. The ratio of body absorption to surface absorption is  1.0/0.022 or 45. However, the plutonium produced by the body  absorption is distributed over a volume which for spherical lumps  is larger than the volume of the surface layer by a factor J?/3L rc *  or 190 (for cylindrical lumps the factor is 290), and it may there-  fore be advisable to strip the surface layer from the lump before  separating out the plutonium. That this is done with the,Hanford  piles might be concluded from Smyth's statements that "only a     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 147   few grams of U-238 and of U-235 are used up per day per million  grams of uranium present" (Smyth 8.15), and "the problem then  is to make a chemical separation at the daily rate of, say, several  grams of plutonium from several thousand grams of uranium"  (Smyth 8.20). To illustrate, 1,000,000 gm of uranium contain  7,300 gm of U 235 . If, say, 3 gm of this U 235 are used up per day for  25 days (making a total consumption of U 285 of about 1 percent),  the plutonium production will be 75X1-02X239/235 or 78 gm  (3.1 gin/day), of which 1.7 gm (0.068 gm per day) are in the  surface layer. The 1.7 gm must then be separated from 10 6 /190,  or 5300 gm of uranium.   For a more valid application of our calculated results to the  Hanford piles, the calculations should be repeated using cylindrical  rods of uranium rather than spherical lumps. From equations 67  and 68 we see that the difference is to increase the shielding effect  by a factor of 3/2, thus increasing k*> slightly but reducing the frac-  tion of uranium that constitutes the surface layer.   With a lattice arrangement the fast neutrons produced in a  fission leave the uranium lump and traverse a region of pure car-  bon before entering a uranium lump again. It is interesting to  calculate the average number of collisions a neutron makes with  the carbon before entering the uranium. The number of collisions  it makes while at thermal energies may be calculated by compar-  ing the probability of absorption by carbon in the thermal region  (0.069/ / L06 here) with the probability p" of absorption while  traversing a mean free path (for elastic collisions) in carbon. The  latter probability is given by     P" =     which is 0.00093. Hence the number of collisions in the thermal  range is 0.065/0.00093, or 70. Adding this to the 115 collisions  we calculated on page 135 to be required for reduction of a neu-  tron's energy to the thermal range, we get a total of 185. This  may be compared with the value of "about 200" quoted by Smyth  (8.9) for a "typical" graphite moderated pile. An atomic concen-  tration ratio p for carbon to uranium of 40 would yield a lower  value of 143 collisions.   It is interesting also to recalculate k> for p=100, increasing  the absorption cross sections for carbon by 25 percent to allow for  impurities. It turns out to be, 1.04. This may be compared with  the value of 0.87 given for the second Columbia pile (Smyth 4.17),     148 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   in which the graphite had a neutron absorption 25 percent greater  than the graphite used later (Smyth 6.20). The agreement would  be much better if the thermal nonfission absorption were larger or  if the shielding effect were less pronounced.   We also should have made allowance in our calculations of k m  for the fissions by fast neutrons. As we pointed out on page 141,  the effect of these fissions is to enhance slightly the number of neu-  trons reaching the lower energy regions per fast neutron produced  in the pile. The enhancement factor e would be     e = 1 + -- (70)   Nu cr/t/ " + A^u <W a " + No cr c /as < where q is the average number of collisions that the neutron makes  in the region above the fast fission threshold (0.35 Mev). Since  inelastic collisions reduce the neutron's energy very rapidly, we  shall take q to be approximately 1. The data of chapter 9 then  yield   1.15   e=l+ - (71)   6.5 + 1.6p   For p=lOQ, this factor is 1.007. (Actually, this factor should have  been included in equation 69 in determining the optimum value of  p. It would have reduced p even further).   Power production and plutonium production. If each fission  produces 200 Mev of energy, we can easily calculate the relation-  ship between power production and plutonium production. Using  the results of page 146, in which we estimated that 1.02 atoms of  plutonium are formed per fission, we find that a production of  1 kg/day of plutonium corresponds to   10 8 gm Pu 1 mol ~6.03 X 10 23 atoms 1 fission   - X - X - X -  day 239 gm 1 mol 1 .02 atoms   200 Mev 1.6X10- 18 joules/sec 1 kw 1 day   X - X - X - X-     fission 1 Mev 1000 joules/sec 86400 sec   = 0.92 X 10 6 kw.   Smyth (6.32) states that 1 kg/day of plutonium corresponds to  between 0.5 X 10 6 kw and 1.5 X 10 6 kw.   A rate of production of plutonium of this magnitude would  require a very large pile. On page 147 we assumed that 10 6 gm  of uranium produce 3.1 gm of plutonium per day. A production     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 149   of kg/day/pile, as an example, would then require 1.1X10 8 gm  of uranium. (We are neglecting the differences involved in the  use of cylindrical rods of uranium rather than spherical lumps.)  An atomic ratio p of 100, corresponding to a mass ratio of 5.0,  leads to a total volume of   1.1 X 10 8 5.5 X 10 8   1 = 2.5Xl0 8 cc (72)   18.7 2.25   which is the volume of a cube of edge 630 cm or 21 feet.   To dissipate such large powers (as at Hanford, where pluton-  ium production was the primary objective) requires an extensive  cooling system. If we assume that water at 20 C is raised to  80 C, we find that 0.92 X 10 6 kw (0.31 X 10 6 kw/pile) corre-  sponds to   10 joules 60 sec 1 cal 1 cc   OQ? v \s \s \S  -7^ S\ A. /\ /A,   sec 1 min 4.2 joules 60 cal   1 cu. in. 1 gal. gal.

This may be compared with the capacity of the Columbia  River, whose mean flow at the Grand Coulee Dam is 211,000 cu.  ft/sec, or 95 X 10 6 gal/min. 41 It is of course considerably less  at Hanford. A power production of 0.92 X 10 6 kw would raise  the temperature of the river at the dam at mean flow by only  0.04C   A rough calculation may be made of the size of the cooling  system. If we assume a pile 630 an on an edge, containing a  mass of 1.1 X 10 8 gm of uranium in the form of rods 2.4 cm in ra-  dius, the number of tubes in the pile will be 520. With a total  water flow of 20,000 gal/min (per pile) each pipe must carry 38  gal/min, or 2300 cc/sec ; this is easily attainable. For example,  a clearance of 2 mm between the uranium rods and the pipe would  require a flow of 25 ft/sec, which could be obtained by maintain-  ing a pressure of about 12 lb/in 2 . 42 .

This would reduce the value of &> from  our previously determined value of 1.06 to about 1.05.   If we had assumed that the figure of 1 kg/day of plutonium  referred not to total production but to production in the surface  layers, the calculated volume of the pile, the power dissipated in  the pile and the temperature rise of the river would have been  multiplied by a factor of 45 for spherical lumps of uranium, or 70  for cylindrical lumps. (See page 143.)   Fission products. It is clear from Smyth's report (4.27, 6.36,  7.31, 7.35, 8.15) that neutron absorption by fission products is an  important factor in the operation of piles. Thus, in section 7.31,  Smyth states that "the gradual disappearance of the U 235 and the  appearance of fission products with large neutron absorption cross  sections tend to stop the reaction"; and, in section 8.15. "How-  ever, other fission products are being produced also. These con-  sist typically of unstable and relatively unfamiliar nuclei so that  it was originally impossible to predict how great an undesirable  effect they would have on the multiplication factor. Such deleteri-  ous effects are called poisoning."   There are four evident criteria for a fission product to have a  serious poisoning effect :   (a) It should have a very large cross section for absorption   of thermal neutrons.   (b) It should have a large branching ratio.   (c) It should have a mean life for radioactive decay long   compared to, or at least of the order of, the mean  life for decay by absorption of thermal neutrons.  This ensures that the effect of the fission product be  predominantly absorption of thermal neutrons.   (d) It should buiW up to its equilibrium concentration in   a time smaller than, or at most comparable with, the   time of operation of the pile.   We can compare the neutron absorption of the fission pro-  duct with that of the carbon moderator under equilibrium condi-  tions, if we adopt the values calculated on page 146. We found  there that each fission leads ultimately to 1.02 atoms of plutonium,  and that of the 2.3 neutrons emitted, 0.15 are absorbed in carbon.  But each fission produces b atoms of the fission product, where b  is called the branching ratio. These b atoms may be removed from  the system either through natural decay (if the product is unsta-  ble), or by absorption of neutrons. If the latter process is the  dominant one, then the ratio of neutron absorption by the fission     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN EEACTIONS PILES 161   product to that by carbon is &/0.15. This gives an upper limit  for the absorption by the fission product. We are here neglecting  the effect of the fission product absorption on the carbon absorp-  tion calculated previously.   Smyth (8.17) states that "About twenty different elements  are present in significant concentration. The most abundant of  these comprises slightly less than 10 per cent of the aggregate".  This implies a maximum branching ratio of about 20 percent. An-  derson and Fermi 43 list branching ratios as high as 12 percent,  and specify a number of fission products with relatively long half-  lives. If any of these have both large absorption cross sections  and large branching ratios, they will contribute a substantial  amount of poisoning.   A better estimate of the absorption may be obtained as follows :  since each fission produces about 200 Mev energy and releases  about 2.3 neutrons, operation of a pile at a power level of 0.31 XlO 6  kw (page 148) corresponds to (0.31Xl0 6 Xl0 10 ) - (200X1. 6X  10~ 6 ) or 0.97X10 18 fissions per second, with a release of 2.2X10 19  neutrons per second. If N is the number of atoms of the fission  product present when equilibrium is established, then, neglecting  neutron losses above the thermal range,   / No \  X2.2X10 19 (73)     where   a=production rate of the fission product   =0.97X10 19 b atoms per second  A=time constant of the radioactive decay, in sec"""" 1  0-= absorption cross section of the fission product for ther-  mal neutrons   Ni=number of atoms of any element present  o-i=absorption cross section of element i for thermal neu-  trons.  We may rewrite equation 73 in the form   a = XN+X'N, (73a)   where A 7 is the time constant (reciprocal mean lifetime in sec" 1 )  for the decay of the fission product by neutron absorption, and is  given by   cr(2.2Xl0 19 ) <r(2.2Xl0 39 )   A'= ~     48 See footnote 2, table 14.     152 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEQY   The contribution of the fission product Ncr to the denominator is   assumed to be negligible. The cross sections are given in chap-   ter 9. From equation 72 we see that   W u =UXl0 8 X6.03Xl0 2 V / 238 = 2.8X10 29  N C =:5.SX10*X6.03XI& 3 /12 = 2.8X10 31   This yields a relation between X' and the cross section a for absorp-   tion of thermal neutrons by the fission product, viz.,   A'=1.2X10 1S <7. (74)   Also the rate of absorption of neutrons by the fission product, \'N,   may be obtained from equation 73a   a 0.97X10 19 Z> I+CA/A')   The rate of absorption of neutrons by carbon is 0.97xl0 10 X0.15  atoms per second, since 0.15 are absorbed in carbon for every fis-  sion. Hence the ratio of absorption of neutrons by the fission  product to that by carbon is   6/0.15     1 + CA/A')   It is thus clear that for a large poisoning effect the branching ratio  b should be large (criterion (b)). Also the reciprocal mean life-  time A for radioactive decay should be smaller than, or at most  comparable with, the time constant A' for decay by absorption of  thermal neutrons (criterion (c)).   Equation 74 yields some interesting results. In the first  place, it leads to criterion (a), that the cross section a- of a highly  poisonous fission product for absorption of thermal neutrons must  be very large. If the fission product is to build up to the neighbor-  hood of its equilibrium ^concentration in less than, say, 25 days  (the time assumed for operation of the pile), (A-fA')  must be greater than 1/25x86,400 or 4.6X1Q- 7 sec- 1 . Since  criterion (c) requires that A' be at least of the order of magnitude  of A, A' would have to be at least about 2XlO~~ 7 sec"" 1 . Equation  74 would then require that <r be at least 17,OOOXlO~ 24 cm 2 .   A further consequence is that only long-lived fission products  are likely to give serious poisoning effects. For example if A' is  1.2X10""" 5 sec"" 1 (about 1 day 1 ) equation 74 gives a value of o- of  l,000,OOOXlO~ 24 cm 2 . Values of A' larger than this (correspond-  ing to a larger upper limit for A and hence a shorter mean life for  radioactive decay than 1 day) would require even larger values of  the cross-section cr. The quantum mechanical upper limit for a for     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN EE ACT IONS PILE 8 163   thermal neutrons is TTO? (where a is the reduced wave length given  by de Broglie's formula) and this limit has the value 26XlO~ 18  cm 2 .   A recalculation of k*> for a carbon uranium pile, increasing  the thermal neutron absorption by carbon by, say, 50 percent to  allow for poisoning reduces the value of 1.06 (page 146) to 1.02.  The absorption by the cooling system reduces it further to 1.01 and  the fast fission enhancement increases it to 1.02.   Neutron lifetime and neutron density. The lifetime r of a  neutron is the sum of the time TI that it spends in slowing down to  thermal energies and the time T% that it spends making collisions in  the thermal energy region before being absorbed. T% is given by   A. th  r z =q f =<7'V* (2M/E) , (75)   V   where q' is the number of collisions in the thermal range, m is  the neutron mass, and E is the thermal energy (0.025 ev at T =  300 A), v is 2.0X1 5 cm/sec. anc j T2 j s 1.25X10- 5 q' sec. On  the other hand, since the energy after i collisions is given by < = (I-/)* ,  the time TI may be calculated by evaluating the sum      -4/2   = Ao     /2m  = A. /     t(H)- 1/2 -iJ '     V E.   where A<> is the mean free path for elastic collisions at high energies.  We have assumed that this mean free path remains constant as the  energy decreases. Since it actually decreases and since inelastic  collisions serve to reduce the required time, our calculation gives  an upper limit to TI. If the total energy drop is large (1 /) */ 2  is very large compared to unity. Also E (1 /)* is the final ther-  mal energy E. Hence, finally, we obtain   (76)   v *- L(l~~j) ""I  In carbon, for neutrons with an initial energy of one Mev. n is  4.7 X 10"" 4 sec, which is equivalent to the time required for 38      154     NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     collisions in the thermal range.   On page 147, we found that an atomic concentration ratio of  100 implied 70 collisions in the thermal range, giving a total time  of 108 X 1.25 X 10~- 5 or 1.4 X 10~ 3 sec for the lifetime of a neu-  tron in the pile. This average lifetime enables us to make a rough  estimate of the neutron density in a pile operating at a power level  of, say, 0.31 XlO 6 kw (corresponding to a production of ^ kg per  day of plutonium as discussed on page 149). Each fission produces  about 200 Mev energy and releases about 2.3 neutrons, so that op-  eration at a power level of 0.31 X 10 6 kw corresponds to the pro-  duction of (0.31 X 10 6 X 10 10 X 2.3)~(200 X 1.6 X 10-) or  2.1 X 10 19 neutrons per second. Since each neutron lives approx-  imately 1.4 X 10~ 3 seconds, the number of neutrons present at any  time is 2.9 X 10 16 . For a pile of edge 630 cm (page 149) the  mean density is then     2.9X10 16     2.     = 1.2 XlO 8 neutrons/cc     If the distribution outward from the center of the pile varies rough-  ly as (sinTir/J?)/ '(irr/R), the density at the center is greater  than the average density by a factor     1 -7-     f     R   f sin *r/R) (R/-7rr)4^r 2 dr     R  Uw     dr     Hence it is 3.9 X 10 8 neutrons/cc at the center of the pile. Since  760 mm of mercury corresponds to 2.6 X 10 19 molecules/cc at  80C, this corresponds to a pressure of 1.1 X 10~~ 8 mm of mercury.

(79)     These results also apply to slow neutron chain reactions if the cross  sections are suitably averaged over the energy ranges occupied by  neutrons during their lifetime in the pile.   The use of the boundary condition that N vanishes at the sur-  face is adequate in this case because the mean free path A is very  small compared to the critical radius. (This point is discussed on  page 175.)   Since KN is the net extra number of neutrons produced per  unit volume per second, K is the time rate of production of extra  neutrons per neutron. It appears as e Kt in the time dependent part  of the expression for neutron concentration. Since each neutron  has a lifetime r, the number of extra neutrons produced per neutron  in the pile is KT. But this number is also k<x>~~\.   K=(k x -\)/r , (80)   or   * nz 1 + Kr .   Therefore the critical radius is     \VT   (81)     3 (*-!)   Since most of the collisions are in carbon and are due to  thermal neutrons, A and v may be taken to be the mean free path  and the velocity of thermal neutrons in carbon. If we take  *, = !. 06 (page 146) and r=1.4XlO- 8 seconds (page 154),  the critical radius R c turns out to be 170 cm or 5.6 ft. This result  would apply approximately to the Chicago West Stands pile which  consisted of lattices with values of k* of 1.01, 1.04 and 1.03.  (Smyth, appendix 4.)   The dominant term in equation 39 for the neutron concentra-  tion is   A l (K~<n*D/R*)t   (sinirr/R)e . (82)   r   Hence, the effect of a finite radius R is to reduce the effective value  of K to K' = K **D/R 2 , and of k*=l+Kr to *= l+XV.  If R is the critical radius, K' = and k = 1. If R is three times  the critical value, K' = 8K/9 and k l+SKt/9. A pile with  h* = 1.05, therefore, has an effective k of 1.04 if its radius is three  times the critical radius.     156 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   The reduction in K can be interpreted in terms of the mean  time required for escape of a neutron from the center of the pile.  If a neutron makes q collisions, it travels a radial distance of \/qk.  Hence the number of collisions made in traveling a distance R is  The time required for this passage is   q\ R 2 R 2   (83)     v Xv 3D   which is of the order of magnitude of the reciprocal of   Smyth (appendix 4) discussed the problem of extrapolation  to the critical size during the construction of a pile. The quantity  R 2 e ff/A is plotted against the number of layers, where R e /f is the  effective radius of the incomplete pile obtained from geometrical  considerations, and A is the activity of a neutron detector placed  at the center of the pile. The discussion may be clarified by in-  vestigating the diffusion of neutrons in a spherical pile in which  neutrons are produced at a constant rate 5* (by cosmic rays or oth-  er processes). The diffusion equation is then   = DV*N+KN+S . (84)     If we assume that N = at the surface, then the steady state solu-  tion for the spherical case K = (& = 1) is   S   N = - (T^-r 2 ) . (85)   6D   The activity A of any neutron detector placed at the center of the  pile is proportional then to R 2 , so that R*/A remains constant as  the size of the pile is increased. On the other hand, for K>0  (&*> > 1) the steady state solution of the diffusion equation is     K     R >iLi{\/ r^/ is r ) (86)     sin (\/K/DR)     The activity A at the center is the proportional to   s r     l r> (87)   K lsm(\SK/DR) J   which becomes infinite as R approaches the critical value R c (at  which sin \JK/D R vanishes). In this case, a plot of R*/A  against the number of layers approaches zero as R approaches the     SLOW NEUTEON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 167   critical size. The critical number of layers may thus be determined  by plotting R e1 ^/A against the number of layers and extrapolat-  ing the curve to the point where it crosses the abscissa (Smyth,  appendix 4).   Reflecting layer As we saw on page 155, the effect of a non-  infinite radius R is to reduce the effective value of K to K' = K  ir^D/R 2 and the neutron multiplication factor, k = 1 -f- Kr f to  k e ff = I+Kr. A reflecting layer will compensate partially for this  loss. If we consider a layer of inactive, nonabsorbing material or  infinite extent surrounding the spherical pile of radius R, the equa-  tions to be solved are     D V 2 N + KN , 0<r<R; (88)     = D 9 V 2 ^, R<r, ; (89)     subject to the boundary conditions   N = at r oo ;     N and D - continuous at r = R. (90)   Vr   The interesting solutions are those in which the neutron con-  centration is steady or increases with time. The dominant term  in the solution in these cases is     N = A/rsinare , r<R ; (91)   N = B/r e -* e & D/t , r>R ; (92)   where   p*D' = K * 2 D = 7T*D/R 2 c?D (93 )   and   D{a RcotaRl}= D' [J3R + 1} , (94)   where R c is the critical radius without the reflector. (If the re-  flecting layer were of finite extent with outer radius R', the ex-  ponential in equation 91 would have become sinh ft(R' r) and  the term fiR in equation 94 would have become fiR/tanh/3(R'-R).  However, the hyperbolic tangent is very close to unity for R' R  of the order of magnitude of R or greater and D' of the order of  magnitude of D so that equation 93 is not altered much.)     158     NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     Consider now a pile which is at the critical size without any  reflector, i.e. R = R c ; it will be much beyond critical if a reflector  is added. For simplicity, we take D' = D ; then equations 93 and  94 reduce to     sn a     1     R     (95)     This gives aR = 2.31 and pR c 2.\2, and the reflector thus  changes the steady state into one increasing exponentially with time  as   (2.12)8 Dt/R     This result is comparable with an infinite pile which should have  the time factor (neglecting fast neutron effects)   7T 2 Dt/R*   e   If the reflector had a lower diffusion coefficient than the pile  (say, a larger scattering cross section for thermal neutrons), aR c  would be smaller but @R C and (3 2 D r would be larger and the re-  flector more effective. Actually, such a general statement cannot  be made since the effect of different degrees of absorption in the re-  flector has not been considered.   Another special case is interesting; the effect of the reflector  when R is already greater than R c . For example, if R = 3 R c  and D' = D, the solution of equations 93 and 94 gives aR = 2.83  and pR = 8.99, corresponding to a value of K f of 0.91 K. In the  absence of a reflector, aR is TT and K' = 8/9 K 0.89 K. The  effect of the reflector is small because the density of neutrons at  the surface of a large pile is small compared to the density in the  interior.   It is interesting to calculate the reflection coefficient p at the  surface of a pile which has a reflector. This is defined to be the  ratio at the surface of the inward flow to the outward flow and is  given by 44     P = '     . . r = R (96)   " L. B.

This can be understood by consid-  ering the history of a particular neutron which has just left the sur-  face of the pile. Although it may ultimately progress far away  from the pile, the chance of doing so without once reentering the  pile is very small.   If there is no reflector the boundary condition is that the re-  flection coefficient is zero. That is,     D     tan a R     :R     Rv D     (98)     Since for a pile Rv D this is very nearly equivalent to the re-  quirement that aR = TT, that is, to the condition that the neutron  density N vanish at the boundary.   Effect of delayed neutrons. In solving the diffusion equation  on pages 120 and 157 we neglected the fact that about 1 per cent  of the neutrons are delayed. The diffusion equation is   where K is the time rate of production of extra neutrons per neu-  tron in the pile, and is related to &> by the relation   ^ = l + Kr (100) where r is the lifetime of a neutron in the pile. We found r to be  approximately 1.4 X 10~~ 3 seconds for a graphite-uranium pile  with an atomic concentration ratio p of 100.   The dominant term in the solution of equation 99 is     N(r,t) = sin (trr/R) e  r     (101)     160 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   so that the effect of a noninfinite radius is to reduce the effective  value of K to K' = K - ir*D/R 2 and the effective k to   k. ff = 1 + (K**D/R*) r . (102)   When K' is zero the system is in a steady state.   Now for simplicity let us assume that a small fraction e of the  neutrons are delayed by a time <> Then equation 99 becomes   *)   = D V 2 N(r,t) + K l N(r f t) + KJJ(r,t-t<>} (103)     where   K 2 r  - = e. (104)     The solution for the steady state (N(r,t) =N(r t *t-t ) ) is un-  altered if K is taken to be K\ -f- K%. Equation 104 may then be  solved to give   K* = e(l-Hr)/T = zk^/T . (105)   However, for a nonsteady state equation 99 has the solution whose  dominant term is   AT = (A/r) sin (*r/K) e at , (106)   where a satisfies the relation     a = Ki+K 2 e-*-^D/R 2 ; (107)   or, using equation 105,   a= (K ^D/R*)*kv/T(\e- at ) . (108)   This constitutes an implicit equation for a. The effect of the de-  lay is to reduce the effective time factor K' by an amount e&oo/V  X(l e ato ). If at is stnall this is approximately efe 00 (a^ / / r).  Actually the delayed neutrons are distributed in their delay times  with four main decay periods (Smyth appendix 3). Let the frac-  tion delayed by a time t to t +dt be F(t )dt , where     (109)     so that the total fraction delayed is   oo     _ f 4 Bi   -J F( tj )dt =^~     (110)     SLOW NEUTEON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 161   and the fraction delayed at least a time T is        f   = / F(     -w   e . (Ill)     From the values of bi and (Bi/b?) given in Smyth and the fact  that e .oi = 0.01 (Smyth appendix 3 ; also, chapter 5 of this book)  we find that the values of B t are 1.1X10" 8 , 3.7X10" 4 , 9.0X1O 5  and 5.0X10" 6 for bi = 0.28, 0.099, 0.029 and 0.012 sec- 1 respec-  tively; and the fraction e of delayed neutrons is 0.011.  Equation (100) then becomes     N(r,t-t )dt  (112)     where h is a proportionality factor to be evaluated.   The equation for the steady state is unaltered if we now interpret   Ktobe   oo bit   K Ki + b^f/ite dt = Ki + hz .(113)  i o   For this steady state case, just as in equation 104,      e = 0.011, (114)   l+Kr   and l+Kr=k ao . (115)   Hence   h = k*/r . (116)   In the nonstationary case, the dominant term in the solution is  again   A irr   JV(r,0 = sin e at , (117)   r R   where substitution into equation 112 gives  4 oo     T; r   Zw I  * 1 J     'o   R z     162 NVCLEAS FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   4     7T   = (1C -- ) - ah V      (118)     This equation must then be solved for . As in equation 80 the  effective multiplication factor then becomes   *,,,= ! + T . (119)   The relaxation time t r , defined as the time required for the neutron  concentration to double, is given by the relation   0.693   t r = - --- (120)   a   We thus see that the effect of the delay is to reduce the effective   4  time factor K' by an amount /*^#,/&i (&*+), and the effective   i=l   multiplication factor k by this factor times r. The relaxation time  is increased correspondingly.   To illustrate the delay effect let us use some of the data al-  ready calculated. If &< is 1.07 and r is 1.4 X 10~ 3 sec, then h is  760. Let the system be adjusted to the steady state so that  K' K - Tr 2 D/R 2 is zero. Suppose now that some sudden change  occurs in the system so that the neutron concentration starts to  build up with a relaxation time of one hour. From equation 117  o is 0.00019. From equation 115 the effective K' in the absence  of the delay effect would have been 0.00019(1 + 760 X 0.011} or  0.0018 sec"" 1 , and the relaxation time would have been decreased  from one hour to 6.5 minutes. Similarly, a relaxation time of 1  minute would have been decreased to 7.3 seconds in the absence of  the delay effect.   PILE SYSTEMS   The s,elj-re plenishing pile. As we remarked in the introduc-  tion, the carbon-natural uranium pile was designed for the specific  purpose of producing plutonium in large quantities as soon as pos-  sible for military purposes. In considering the possible types and  potentialities of pile systems many factors enter. The primary  considerations are the availability of the components, the size de-  sired and the purpose intended.     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 163   In connection with the availability of pile components, the con-  siderations of the normal uranium-carbon pile suggest an interest-  ing possibility. For the pile considered on page 146, for each 2.3  neutrons formed in a fission, 1.02 are absorbed in U 238 to form  plutonium. Since the plutonium itself is fissionable it can  serve to compensate for the depletion of the U 235 if it is not re-  moved from the pile. Such a pile, in which each fission results in  the ultimate production of at least one plutonium nucleus, will thus  preserve or increase the supply of fissionable material. In this  case U 238 becomes the principal source material. Such a pile  might be called a self -replenishing (or perhaps regenerative) pile.  It has the effect of increasing the available supply of atomic energy  by a factor of 140, since U 238 is the abundant isotope. In fact, a  further increase in available source material is immediately sug-  gested by using thorium plus an initial amount of U 235 or plutoni-  um. The capture of a neutron by thorium eventually forms U 238  by the reactions shown below. 45   r, Th 232 + n > ooTh 233 + y (a a t7l :=8.3X 10~ 24 cm 2 ; reson-   slow   ance at ^ 2 ev).  o Th 233 > oiPa 238 + _/?   25 min   91 p a 233 > 92 u2S3 _|_ _0(0.23 Mev) + y(0.3 Mev).   25 days   U 233 probably fissions like U 235 and consequently could serve to  keep the pile running. Such a thorium pile then increases the  available supply of atomic energy since thorium is present to twelve  parts per million in the earth's crust whereas uranium is only four  parts per million (Smyth 2.24).   This self-replenishing pile could also be made to run indefinite-  ly if the fission products were chemically removed periodically from  the fissionable material and more U 238 or thorium were added.   The steady state. A useful feature of many pile systems is  that during their operation the proportions of fissionable material  and source material (i.e., source of new fissionable material) tend  to approach a stable relationship. To illustrate, consider a pile  containing, say, a atoms of U 235 or plutonium to each atom of  U 238 . Let us suppose that it is imbedded in a moderator which  has negligible absorption for neutrons and which reduces the neu-  tron energies to thermal values so rapidly that the nonfission ab-  sorption in the resonance region may be neglected. The rate RI   45 Meitner, Strassmann and Hahn, Zeits. fur Phys. 109, 538 (1938) ; L.  Meitner, Phys. JRe<v. 60, 58 (1941).     164 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   of depletion of fissionable material due to fissions to the rate R 2 of  production of fissionable material by neutron absorption in the  thermal range is     = 140a (121)   with the data we are using. If the atomic ratio a is 1/140 the  supply of fissionable material will be maintained if source material  (U 238 ) is periodically added to the system to replace that used up.  If the ratio a is greater than 1/140 (it is 1/140 for normal ura-  nium), the depletion rate for the fissionable material exceeds the  production rate, and a will decrease. On the other hand, if a is  less than 1/140 the production rate will exceed the depletion rate,  and a will increase. Thus a stable ratio will tend to be set up if  the process continues long enough.   For such a system &, may easily be determined in terms of the  ratio . It is   2.3X420 a 180a 1   (122)     420 a +3 140 +1   When a is 1/140 this gives k* == 1.15. (This is the maximum  value k<x> may have for a self-replenishing system.) When a is  1/70 ao becomes 1.52, and it becomes still larger for larger pro-  portions of fissionable material.   The presence of some absorption by the moderator (and other  materials) will not affect the ratio of production to depletion rate,  but will reduce &> to the value   2.3x420 a   (123)     +3+ (T fl V   where p is the ratio of atomic concentration of moderator to that  of U 238 , and <r a ' is its absorption cross section for thermal neutrons  in units of 10~ 24 cm 2 .   The operation of the pile now results in the production of neu-  tron-absorbing fission products which tend to reduce the value of  fcoo to less than unity and thus stop the chain reaction. Also, if the  supply of source material is not replenished the atomic ratio a will  continue to maintain itself at 1/140 (or to adjust itself toward this  value if it is not originally so). The amount of both fissionable and  source material, however, will decrease, thereby increasing the rel-  ative effects of the neutron absorbers (moderator and fission prod-     SLOW NEUTRON CHAIN REACTIONS PILES 165   ucts) and reducing the effective k to below unity more rapidly. On  the other hand, if &> were originally made large enough to require  the use of extra control absorbers in the system which could be  withdrawn gradually, the system would continue to operate until  all the absorbers were removed. At that time, cleaning out the sys-  tem (chemical removal of the fission products) and perhaps replen-  ishment of the source material would permit reintroduction of con-  trol absorbers and further operation of the system.   The existence of a small amount of nonfission absorption of  neutrons in the resonance energy range will not effect the general  nature of the above discussions but will alter the stable ratio a  and the equations for ,. Enough absorption will increase the  ratio of the production to the depletion of fissionable material until  normal uranium is self-replenishing.   If thorium were used as the source material the fissionable  material which it ultimately produces is U 233 and the ratio  of the depletion rate of fissionable material to the production rate  would be     ** 420 a.     a (TU233   = 51* (124)     8.3   Hence, for a self-replenishing pile with negligible absorption by  the thorium of other than thermal neutrons, the ratio a of fission-  able material to source material must be less than 1/51. If it is  1/51, and if we assume the same value 2.3 neutrons per fission for  the ultimate product U 233 , then is 1.15 (or less if absorption of  neutrons by the moderator is taken into account).   Our discussion has been oriented toward the use of the pile  as a source of energy or of neutrons. By adjusting the pile so that  the production rate of fissionable material is greater than the de-  pletion rate and then gradually introducing more neutron absorbers  to keep the effective k equal to unity, it could be used to enrich the  system in fissionable material, which could later be removed.   Heavy water piles. Except for the problem of obtaining it in  sufficient quantities' heavy water is a better moderator than graph-  ite. The average fractional energy loss of a neutron in elastic col-  lisions with deuterium is 0.444 as contrasted with 0.142 for car-  bon (table 15) so that much less heavy water is needed and the  pile may be made smaller. Also the absorption of thermal neu-  trons is much less than for carbon (0.0045 for carbon, 0.0016 for  oxygen and 0.00065 for deuterium 46 , as given in table 13). Hence  the multiplication factor & may be made larger than for the car-  bon-uranium pile.     166 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   The neutron collision cross section of oxygen for energies  above the thermal range is not given by Bethe (see table 13)  but is probably very close to the corresponding cross section for  deuterium. Hence, when a neutron is slowed down in heavy water  from 1 Mev to thermal energy, it will make q collisions with oxy-  gen and 2q collisions with deuterium, where   (1-0.111)' ( 1-0.444) 2 ^0.025/10 6 (125)   The solution for q is 19. To slow the neutron down to 5 ev would  require q to be 13 (26 collisions with deuterium and 13 with  oxygen).   From equation 52 the numerical factor B needed for comput-  ing the probability pi that a neutron will be at some time in the  resonance region, turns out to be 1.4 for deuterium and 8.4 for oxy-  gen. If we let Af w represent the molecular concentration of heavy  water, equation 62 for this probability then becomes   I Aw 8Aw     E r /   , (126) <7 8D re8 / D + N w a s0 TG *fo N   where the quantities j, w, E r and a 8 are defined on page 136.  The other equations, 54 to 71, may be applied to the heavy water  case if in all of them NC&C is replaced by N w (20-D+oro) for the  appropriate cross sections, and p now signifies the ratio Nw/Nn.  We shall assume in this case that the probability p' of absorption  of a fast neutron before reaching the resonance region is negligible.  Equation 69 then becomes, for normal uranium homogeneously  distributed in heavy water,   i.is r - i /i + i.8 P \-|   k = - 4 1 ----- - I (127)   1 + 0.00048/> L 1 -f 0.00024p \ 1 + 27 P / j   We are again disregarding neutron losses in the higher energy  ranges. A graph of &> versus p is shown in figure 33. We see  that &oo has its maximum value 1.06 for a value of p of approxim-  ately 10, corresponding to a mass ratio of 0.83 and a volume ratio  of 14. This value of & varies very slightly for p between 1 and  50. Furthermore, for p = 10 we find that, of each 2.3 neutrons  produced in a fission, 0.01 on the average are absorbed in heavy  water, 1.22 are absorbed in uranium to form plutonium (1.06 in   ** A low capture cross section for deuterium was early predicted by L. I.  Scliiff on theoretical grounds. L. I. Schiff, Phys. Eev. 52, 242 (1937).     SLOW NEUTSON CHAIN EE ACTION 8 PILES 167   the thermal range and 0.16 in the resonance energy range) and 1.06  are available for further fissions. Use of a finite volume together  with added absorbers to reduce k to 1.0 would reduce the above  numbers to 0.01, 1.15, and 1.0 respectively, leaving 0.14 neutrons  to escape from the pile or to be taken up by the control absorbers  or other added materials. Such a pile would be self-replenishing.   The addition to the system of some other moderator having  very small neutron absorption but which is less efficient than heavy  water in getting a neutron safely past the resonance region (e.g.,  beryllium oxide, carbon, or carbon dioxide or materials of greater  atomic mass) would increase the amount of absorption in the re-  sonance region relative to the other processes and make the pile  self-replenishing for normal uranium.   Enriched piles. If the self-replenishing feature of the pile is  not required it is clear that the use of uranium enriched with an  additional amount of U 235 or plutonium would be an improvement  over the "normal" uranium pile. The moderator could be either  graphite or heavy water. Such a pile, having a very large value  of &QO, could be made quite small and still furnish large amounts of  energy and large neutron densities. As an extreme case let us  consider a pile consisting of pure U 235 , or plutonium, homogene-  ously distributed in a heavy water moderator. For such a system   2.3 N  V ~ Nv fV th +   2.3     1+0.0000069^   ES 2.3 (128)   Assuming a ratio of heavy water molecules to uranium atoms of  1,000, this should be sufficient to allow for neglect of the fast fis-  sion process in view of the tremendously greater density of thermal  neutrons in the pile.   As on page 147 and page 154, we can calculate the number of  collisions that are made by a neutron in the pile before it is ab-  sorbed and thereby obtain its average lifetime as well as the aver-  age neutron density in the pile. From equation 128, the probabili-  ty of absorption of a neutron by heavy water is 0.0069. If the neu-  tron makes on the average q r elastic collisions with oxygen in the  thermal range before being absorbed, then   #'D 2oD**  = , (129)   q'o <*>**     168 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   and   CTaD^ <TaO* h   q'D -- h q'o - = 0.0069 . (130)   **>'* *o th   Solving, we get q^ to be 10 and q&' to be 36. The time required  for these collisions is     v , (131)   which is 3.7 X 10~ 4 sec. To this must be added the time n re-  quired to slow the neutron down to thermal energies. We found  before that this requires 19 collisions with oxygen and 38 with deu-  terium. Neglecting the effect of the former we can apply equation  76, which yields 1.3 X 10~ 4 sec. The total lifetime T in the pile  is therefore 5.0 X lO" 4 sec.   By using equation 81, we may now make a rough estimate of  the critical size for a pile operating under the above conditions. If  A, v and D are calculated for thermal energies, R c turns out to be  20 cm, corresponding to a sphere of volume 1,700 cc containing  2,900 gm of U 235 and 1,300 gm of heavy water. If the pile were  operated at a power level of, say, 100 kw, then at 200 Mev per fis-  sion the time required to use up the U 235 is   2900 X 6.02 X 10 23 X 200 X 1.6 X I-*  - = 77 years .  235 X 3 X 10 5 X 10 7 X 86400 X 365   Application of the treatment mentioned on page 154, enables us to  make a rough estimate of the neutron density in such a pile operat-  ing at 100 kw. This corresponds to a production of 7.2 X 10 15  neutrons per second, each with an average lifetime of 5.0 X lO""" 4  sec. Hence the average neutron density is 7.2 X 10 15 X 5.0  XlO- 4 /1700, or 2.1 X 10 9 neutrons/cc; at the center of the pile it  is 7.0 X 10 9 neutrons/cc.   In actual practice such a pile would be built somewhat larger  than the critical size, and would contain some control absorbers  like cadmium or boron. It would also be surrounded by a reflect-  ing layer of a substance like beryllium or graphite to reduce the  neutron losses, as well as by a thick shield of concrete or some other  substance.   Conclusion. Table 18 summarizes the main types of possible  piles and their distinguishing characteristics. One additional pos-  sible type not mentioned above is the bismuth pile, in which bis-  muth is -used as a cooling fluid in order to permit operation of the  pile at much higher temperatures than water-cooled piles, thus giv-  ing more efficient power production.

( 1 ) We assumed that the cross sections and mean free paths  for various neutron processes remain constant in the energy ranges  considered (thermal, intermediate and fast). Actually they have  in general a rather complicated dependence on energy, as is illus-  trated in the discussion of the absorption cross section for cadmium  in chapter 9 (see figure 12).   (2) We neglected fission by fast neutrons except in so far  as it necessitated a substantial proportion of moderator to fission-  able material in order to reduce this effect.   (3) We applied rather crude statistical arguments in the  analysis of the shielding effect of a lattice arrangement, such as the  disregard of the actual spacing of lumps or rods in the lattice and  the use of approximate expressions for the distances of penetration  of neutrons into lumps .   (4) In calculating the critical size of a pile, we applied dif-  fusion theory to the lattice as though the uranium were homogene-  ously distributed through the system.   We have tried to present a semiquantitative treatment of some  of the fundamental physical considerations involved in controlled  slow-neutron-induced chain reaction processes and their applica-  tion to the design of piles. It should be stressed again that the  numerical values are based on inadequate data and that the analysis  is intended only to illustrate the possible type of treatment.     CHAPTER 11  FAST NEUTRON CHAIN REACTION   Possibility of a fast neutron chain reaction. Mathematical  theory. The use of a fast neutron chain reaction to produce large  neutron pulses and to release large amounts of energy in a short  time has many interesting applications. The feasibility of such  reactions can best be studied by considering the diffusion equation  first discussed on page 120.   While the mean free path of the neutrons is comparable with  the dimensions of fissionable material used, limiting the validity  of the calculation, nevertheless analysis will show what quantities  are important and will suggest their orders of magnitude.   The neutron density at any point will vary with time as a re-  sult of diffusion of the neutrons, and also because of absorption of  neutrons by capture and the production of new neutrons by fis-  sion. The appropriate differential equation for this variation is     = D V 2 N + KN (132)     These quantities have been previously defined on page 120,  but their dependence on other more physical quantities should be  recalled. The diffusion coefficient is   Xv   D = - (133)   3   where v is the velocity of the neutrons. The mean free path, A, of  the neutrons is given by   1   A = - , (134)  ^s A^u + (other scattering processes)   where <r s is the cross section for scattering and JVu the concentra-  tion of the main constituent of the reacting material.   K = vcrfNufa -1) (other processes which use up neu-  trons), (135)   where cr/ is the cross section for fission and p. the number of new  neutrons released per fission.   171     172 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   We will assume a sphere of radius R and investigate the so-  lution subject to the initial condition:   N(r$)=N ,  and the boundary condition   -dN  D h <*N = 0,     at r = R. This second equation provides for continuity in the  normal component of the neutron current at the surface of the  sphere, a is related to the rate at which neutrons leave the surface  per unit area per unit concentration.   The solution of this problem is given in Byerly 47 and may be  written as   1 oo I" Dx? 1 Xir   N(r,t) = S^iexp (A." ) Msin (136)   r i=0 [ R 2 | R   where x t is the i'th root of the equation   x   tan x = (137)   aR   1   D   If the concentration of neutrons is to increase with time, the  coefficient of the time in one of the exponentials must be positive.  If a- is the smallest root of equation 137, a chain reaction must  proceed when     - (138)   K   Before we can determine x we must find the value of a.   f -dN -\  Solving equation 96 for-^ D /N f- r=R we find that     0+/0   where p is the fraction of neutrons reflected back.

We have also as-  sumed that the velocity of all neutrons is the same and that the  cross sections are independent of neutron velocity.   Possibility of a fast neutron chain reaction. Calculations for  U* S5 . The equation for the critical radius expressed in terms of  measurable physical constants is   R c = - - - (142)     To get as small a critical radius as possible x<> should be as small  as possible and the other quantities as large as possible. The val-  ue of .TO can be decreased by use of a tamper which will reflect as  many neutrons as possible. To increase N\j the material should  be a pure isotope, such as U 235 or plutonium. /A is taken as 2.3  and assumed to be the same for all fissionable material. The value  of o- 8 for fast neutrons probably does not vary as much for various  nuclei as does o-f. However, when oy is large, & 8 will also be large  since as far as the diffusion equation is concerned, o> is the sum of  all processes which scatter neutrons. In fission, although one neu-  tron disappears and JJL new neutrons are actually produced, we re-  gard the process as consisting of the scattering of one neutron plus  the production of ft 1 new ones.   The ideal material for producing a chain reaction is one in  which every neutron entering the nucleus will produce a fission.  The existence of competitive processes, such as absorption and  gamma ray emission, decreases both ay and o-. An additional con-  tribution to the "scattering" cross section is inelastic scattering,  in which the neutron is absorbed and another neutron with a low-  er energy reemitted. As far as calculation of the critical size is  concerned it is not necessary to know the relative contribution of  the various scattering processes. Measurements of o for non-     174 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   fissioning heavy nuclei have been made by Dunning et al. 48 The  fact that reemission of a neutron after capture is far more likely  than a radiative transition, 49 simplified their measurements. <r 8  showed a regular increase proportional to A 2/3 and would be about  6 X 10~ 24 cm 2 for uranium and plutonium. In U 235 , fission re-  places neutron emission as the main process but as mentioned  above, this does not change the effective o>.   The average energy of the neutrons being considered is of the  order of 1 Mev, and for them oy is not simply the TT R 2 mentioned  on page 71. Their effective wave lengths are of the order A~10~ 12  cm which is comparable with the nuclear radius R as determined by  a particle scattering. Rabi 50 has shown that the measured cross  section may be several times larger than w R 2 , which accounts for  the large value of <J 8 .   The exact value of <r/ depends on the neutron energy. We  can estimate an approximate value of 3 X 10~ 24 cm 2 , or about  half the total scattering cross section for U 235 . A survey of the  published cross sections of heavy nonfissioning nuclei indicates  that potential scattering accounts for about half the total scatter-  ing. The other half of the fast neutron scattering cross section is  contributed by inelastic cross section effects, the most likely one  being fission in those nuclei which will fission with thermal neu-  trons. This was discussed on page 111.   Inaccuracies in the values of <r/ and cr s seriously change our  estimate of the critical mass because of the rapid change in mass  with radius. Smyth's description (12.32) of the extensive fast  neutron cross section measurements at Los Alamos emphasizes  the importance of these cross sections. The calculation presented  here should be considered as tentative since in a report to the Na-  tional Academy in November 1941 (Smyth 4.99) the critical mass  could only be fixed at between 2 and 220 pounds, mainly on ac-  count of the uncertainties in the cross sections.   In the following calculations p. is taken as 2.3 neutrons per  fission and   N a 19 gm cm- 8 X6Xl0 23 atom (gm mol)" 1     M 235 gm (gm mol)   = 4.8X1 O* 2 gm cm- 3     48 Dunning, Pegram, Fink and Mitchell, Phys.

FAST NEUTRON CHAIN REACTION 175   If all the neutrons reaching the surface escape, the reflection coeffi-  cient is zero and X Q is 2.10. It should be noted that Adler's 51 cal-  culation assumed that the concentration at the surface of the sphere  was zero and for this case the value of JT O is TT. This assumption  is good in systems which are so large that A R. In our system  A ~ R f and the fact that we use the more exact calculation results  in a reduction in the critical mass by a factor of 3.4.   The critical radius with no tamper is R c 5.15 cm which  corresponds to a mass of about 23 pounds of U 235 . The mean free  path is given by   1   A = -     and for U 235 , it is 3.4 cm. This value is comparable with the crit-  ical size; therefore our use of the diffusion theory might lead to  considerable error. If we compare the solution for the one dimen-  sional random walk problem 52 with the diffusion equation solu-  tion, it appears that the probability of escape is different from that  calculated for diffusion. This simple consideration indicates that  replacing the diffusion theory calculation by a more accurate sta-  tistical treatment of the neutron paths would give a different esti-  mate of the critical radius.   Effect of a tamper'. The critical size may be somewhat re-  duced by the use of a tamper. A value for the reflection coefficient  can be found by solving the differential equation for two concen-  tric spherical media. The inner sphere of U 235 has the values of  K and D discussed above. The second sphere is the tamper with  about the same value of D, but with K =. O. The region sur-  rounding it consists of empty space. Since a detailed calculation  (see page 158) is hardly worth while at this point, a value for  the reflection coefficient will be estimated very crudely.   In our approximation the value of the reflection coefficient p  for a tamper of given thickness cannot be calculated until the crit-  ical size is known. Consequently a preliminary value of p will  be used to get a preliminary value of R c . This value of R c will  be used to redetermine p and to calculate a more accurate value of  R c . For a tamper of high density the mean free path in the tamp-  er will be about the same as that in the fissionable material, 3.4 cm,  since the fast neutron scattering cross sections of materials of large  atomic number are about the same. We assume tentatively that   n M. F. Adler, Comptes Rendus 209, 301 (1939).  K 8. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).     176 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   this is of the same order as the radius of the fissionable material.  If neutrons leave the core perpendicularly as shown in figure 34,  then on the average they will suffer a collision at a distance A from  the surface of the sphere, and will be scattered in all directions.  The mean probability of being scattered into the solid angle <u  subtended by the core is o>/4 ?r, where   1 R   -- (1 cos0), and (sin 0) &ve = - . Therefore, p   4rr 2 R+X   is roughly given by     p = - (143)   2   This estimate neglects all multiple scattering processes. However  these effects tend to compensate, since the neutrons which eventu-  ally return to the core after several scatterings would increase the  coefficient, while neutrons which are scattered into the solid angle <D may be scattered out of it before reentering the core. This would  decrease p. Of course, all the neutrons do not leave the surface  of the core normally, as we have assumed, but this complication  does not change the order of magnitude of the reflection coefficient  and it is neglected here.      Fig. 34. Diagram of core of fissionable material showing the co-  ordinates pertinent to the reflection of neutrons by tamper.   For the preliminary critical radius, R c 5.15 cm and the re-  flection coefficient p is 0.10. The new critical radius is R = 4.65  cm, corresponding to a mass of 16 pounds. The consistency of the  calculations could be improved by repeating the calculation for a  new value of the reflection coefficient based on the new critical  radius.   A more indirect method of estimating the critical size can be  made by using remarks in the Smyth report (6.39). The the-  oretical studies of Manley, Oppenheimer, Serber and Teller indi-     FAST NEVTEON CHAIN ENACTION 177   cated that the energy release in a fast neutron chain reaction could  be made greater than that estimated in the third report of the Na-  tional Academy. It was indicated there (Smyth 4.99) that be-  tween 1 and 5 per cent of the fission energy should be released at  a fission explosion.   A war department release stated that a typical fission explo-  sion contained the explosive equivalent of about 20,000 tons of  T.N.T. The fission of 8 pounds of U 235 will produce this amount  of energy. If the chain reaction has an efficiency of between 10  and 30 percent the total mass of U 285 lies between 24 and 80  pounds. It appears then that substantially more than the critical  amount of material was used in these explosions.   If the U 235 is not pure, the critical radius will be somewhat  larger because of the decrease in K. The fission cross section for  U 23 * is about one fifth that of U 286 , and neutron absorption will  use up some of the neutrons. In fact, pure uranium metal will not  produce a chain reaction, even for an infinite sphere (Smyth  12.10). The diffusion coefficient D will vary little with concentra-  tion. The percentage increase in the critical radius is probably  about half the percentage concentration of U 238 in U 235 . In the  same manner, the separation of Pu 239 from U 238 need not be taken  to completion. No estimate of the critical size for Pu 289 will be  made except to indicate that the value of a and o-/ are both proba-  bly a little larger than for U 235 , making the critical radius some-  what smaller. The energy release per fission may also be a little  larger since the electrostatic forces are increased.   We now make an estimate of the rate at which the neutron  density will build up in a spherical mass of fissionable material  which is larger than the critical size. From equation 136 the time  necessary for the neutron density to increase by a factor e = 2.718  is   1 1  T s* = (144)     R 2 R 2 l\ R c / J   If we let R = R c + A R, with A R RC, then   R G 1.7X 10- 9 7? sec   T = = , (145)   2K A 1? A R   since for 1 Mev neutrons in U 285 , K is of the order of 3 x 10 8  sec ~ 1 .     178 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   Production of controlled neutron pulses. If a large controlled  pulse of neutrons is desired for experimental purposes it can be  obtained by combining several pieces each of which is smaller  than the critical size, and disassembling then in a time comparable  with the time for the neutron density to double.   As the neutron density builds up a pressure will develop  which tends to blow the material apart. This pressure at the sur-  face of the sphere has two principal contributions, the gamma ra-  diation and the neutrons. The range of the beta rays and fission  products is so short that their kinetic energy is soon shared with  other nuclei. This energy is propagated as a shock wave at a vel-  ocity which is small in comparison with that of the neutrons and  gamma rays. We can make a crude estimate of the neutron pres-  sure P in terms of a gas composed of the 1 Mev neutrons and hav-  ing a density NO-   P 1/3 N E   where E is the neutron energy. This places an upper limit on the  pressure since the neutrons are not reflected at the boundary as in  a gas but travel several cm into the tamper before undergoing a  collision.   If the tamper will withstand a pressure wave of short dura-  tion of 10 4 atmosphere, we can tolerate a neutron density of 10 16  per cm 3 . If the original neutron density were of the order of  1 per cm 3 , the density would have to increase by a factor of e 37 in  order to reach a density of 10 16 per cm 3 . The total time required  is   Re Re   T* = log, 10 16 Xl.7XlO- 9 < - :=37xl. 7 X10~ 9 - sec     and if Rc/&R is of the order of 1000, the time becomes about  5 x 10~ 5 sec. If controlled neutron pulses are to be produced, a  mechanical motion of AR must be achieved within this time or the  reacting material could not be disassembled before an explosion  took place. For a radius of 5 cm the velocity of the moving parts  must be the order of 100 cm/sec if the critical radius is exceeded  by 0.1 percent. The velocity required of the moving parts varies  inversely as the square of the fraction by which the critical radius  is exceeded.   As mechanisms with parts moving near the speed of sound  are feasible, neutron pulses of several microseconds duration and  with an intensity of 10 24 neutrons per second, appear possible. The  existence of such pulses would allow the application of many of     FAST NEUTRON CHAIN REACTION 179   the timing techniques of the radar art to a large number of prob-  lems. However, the possibility of a mechanical failure while the  material is over critical is not attractive.   A rough estimate of gamma radiation pressure can be made  by assuming that a one Mev gamma ray is given off for every neu-  tron. The momentum of the gamma ray is roughly 1/50 that of a  neutron of the same energy, so their contribution to the pressure  is of secondary importance. The gamma radiation however,  reaches the tamper material first so it may be of importance in a  detailed calculation.   In the discussions in this chapter it is assumed that the neu-  trons are emitted instantaneously during a fission. It is also pos-  sible to construct assemblies which are overcrititcal for delayed  neutrons but undercritical for fast neutrons; hence the time con-  stant is considerably longer. Smyth (12.46) describes the exper-  iments of this type performed at Los Alamos.   Production of single pulses with maximum number of neu-  trons. If the material is over critical and is not intentionally dis-  assembled, the reaction will continue until the material is con-  sumed, the fission products "poison" the reaction by absorption  or the material is blown apart. In contrast to piles, there is  probably little "poisoning" by the fission products since their  most likely reaction with fast neutrons is scattering rather than  absorption. If the critical radius has been exceeded by an amount  A^? and there is no motion of the material or capture of the neu-  trons by the fission products, then the reaction will continue until  the concentration of U 235 has decreased by about twice AR/Rc.  In most cases the kinetic energy of the fission products will dis-  perse the material long before it has been consumed.   The number of neutrons required to produce fission products  of the same energy as 20,000 tons of TNT is of the order of 10 25  neutrons, or a density of the order of 10 22 neutrons per cm 8 . The  pressure developed by a neutron gas in which the average energy  of the neutron is of the order of 1 Mev may be about 10 10 atmos-  pheres. If pressures of a billion atmospheres are to be developed,  extremely short times for building up the neutron density are re-  quired in order that inertia can be used to hold the material to-  gether effectively. The time required for the neutron pressure to  build up from 10 4 to 10 10 atmospheres is   1.7X10- 9 (7? C /A#)X(2.3 log 10 6 ) seconds or about   sec.     180 NUCLEAB FISSION AND ATOMIC ENESOY   To get an idea of the order of magnitudes involved let us assume  that the tamper is 4 cm thick and composed of a dense material.  The time required to move it through a distance A/? under the  influence of a static pressure P is approximately      where p is the density of the tamper. For a pressure of a billion  atmospheres this time caculated for U 285 is approximately 10~~ 7  VA/?. Thus, if the time for the neutron density to build up is to  be less than that required to overcome inertial forces,     or A/? is approximately 1 cm. In other words, the critical radius  must be exceeded by 20 percent, and thus the total mass increased  from 16 to 28 pounds.     CHAPTER 12  SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES   Introduction**. In the preparation and use of fissionable ma-  terial it is desirable to obtain more or less pure samples of a par-  ticular isotope. The reason for this is that in the reactions of in-  terest (e.g., slow and fast neutron chain reactions) the isotopes  not entering into the reactions either poison or dilute them. Since  in nature elements usually occur as mixtures of various isotopes,  and since the isotopes of interest often have the smallest concen-  tration in the mixture, it is necessary to use rather complicated  separation methods in order to obtain the desired isotope in a  sufficiently pure form.   The main difficulty of the isotope separation methods is that  isotopes have identical nuclear charges and differ only in their nu-  clear mass. Consequently, they have but slightly different elec-  tronic structures. The most likely property of isotopes, therefore,  which can be used in their separation is only the difference in nu-  clear mass.   Since the kinetic energy of molecules in a gas or liquid de-  pends only on the temperature, the average velocity of two isotopes  will be inversely proportional to the square root of their mass.  This fact is used in the separation of isotopes by gaseous diffusion.  When isotopes are ionized and accelerated in an electric field, their  kinetic energies again depend only on the difference of potential  traversed (and the ionic charges). The resulting difference of  velocity of the isotopes can then be used to separate them by elec-  tromagnetic methods.   Isotopes can also be subjected to gravitational and thermal  fields. In the latter case, the motion of the molecules does not  depend only on the fields and the masses of the isotopes, but also  on inter-molecular forces which act differently on different iso-  topes. Separation effects of this kind are produced by centrifuge  and by thermal diffusion methods.   As was previously remarked, the electronic structures of iso-  topic molecules are so similar that their chemical properties, which  depend directly on the outer electron structure, are also much alike.   58 For a complete summary of isotope separation methods in use before  1939, see W. Walcher, Erg. d. exdkt. Naturwiss. 18, 155 (1939) ; H. C.  Urey, J. App. Phys. 12, 270 (1941).   181     182 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   However, the rates of chemical reactions differ slightly for different  isotopes since the molecular, kinetic and vibrational energies which  determine the reaction rates, depend on the nuclear mass. This  permits an isotope separation by "chemical exchange" reactions.   This chapter will discuss in detail the physical nature of some  of the isotope separation methods indicated above. Since the pres-  ent interest of isotope separation lies mainly in the large scale sep-  aration of U 235 and deuterium (in the form of heavy water), an  effort is made to obtain numerical values for some of the interest-  ing parameters occurring in the separation of these elements by var-  ious processes. It should always be borne in mind that the nu-  merical values of the parameters obtained indicate only orders of  magnitude.   Definitions. In this discussion we shall assume that the de-  sired isotope has to be separated or enriched from an initial mix-  ture of only two isotopes, which we shall call heavy (S) and light  (L). The molecular mass of the heavy isotope is denoted by Ma  and that of the light one by ML.   We assume that in the original mixture the mole fraction of  the heavy isotope is o- and that of the light isotope is AQ. The  ratio OO/AO, or its inverse ,is then called the mole ratio of the orig-  inal material. It is evident that   a + A =:l (146)   As we said in the introduction, the purpose of the isotope sep-  aration is to obtain one isotope in a more or less pure form with a  final mole ratio <TF/^F. Supposing for example, that starting with  ordinary water: o- (D)/X (H) = 1/5000, it is desired to  obtain 99 per cent pure heavy water. The final mole ratio of the  water has to be     = 99/1  and the original isotope has to be enriched   5 X 10 5 times.     If this enrichment were produced by one separation process, the  quantity     E = - (147)   OO/AO   would be called the overall enrichment factor (for the heavy iso-  tope).     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 183   In the case of uranium, it is desired to enrich the lighter iso-  tope. It is convenient therefore to define an overall enrichment  factor for the light isotope, called ', where     E' = - = (14S)   E     (In ordinary uranium Ao(U 235 )/<r (U 238 ) ^ 1/140.)   In an isotope separation it is desirable to obtain as large an  enrichment as possible. A particular separation apparatus though,  is usually characterized by a separation factor rather than by an  enrichment factor.   If a given amount of material is processed in a separation ap-  paratus, after a certain length of time there will appear at the two  ends of the apparatus (denoted by I and II), material, whose orig-  inal mole ratio has been changed from oo/X to <JI/AI and  on/An respectively. It is clear that if the material at end II is en-  riched in the heavy isotope (i.e., o-n/An>a /Ao) then the mate-  rial at end I must be enriched in the light isotope (i.e, a\/\i < OO/AO) since we have assumed that the total amount of material in  the apparatus was constant.  The ratio Q     n  Q = - (149)     or its inverse, whichever is greater than unity, is called the overall  separation factor of the apparatus for the heavy isotope. This  quantity Q is generally independent of the original mole ratio,  tfo/Ao, and is determined solely by the nature of the separation  apparatus. The overall separation factor for the light isotope,  Q',is   1   = -   Q   If the separation apparatus consists of several stages, it is  convenient to define single stage separation factors (greater than  unity)     q = - = - (151) <**/% q 9   where k and k+1 refer to two adjacent stages. In most multi-  stage apparatus q is the same for all stages.     184 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   From the remarks preceding equation 149 it should be clear  that in an apparatus processing a fixed quantity of material, the  enrichment factor is less than the separation factor. If the desired  enriched isotope (assumed heavy) appears at end II of the appar-  atus so that (TF=<TU and \F\ U are the mole fractions of the heavy  and light isotopes at that end, then     Q = - . > E = - (constant amount of material). (152)     In order to increase the enrichment of the heavy isotope, (i.e., to  increase crp/\p) one has to increase O-J/AI, since Q is constant for  a given apparatus. This is possible if, instead of processing only a  fixed quantity of material in the apparatus, one supplies at end I  a theoretically infinite amount of original material (mole ratio  tfo/X), so that even upon completion of the separation, the mole  ratio at end I is still the original mole ratio (i.e., ai/Ai^ob/X)-  It follows from equation 152 then that   crp/X F =Q ao/Ao   so that   E=Q (infinite supply). (153)   In every separation process the yield of the desired isotope is  evidently of great importance. In general a process with a high  separation factor has a low yield of the enriched isotope. In an  apparatus processing a fixed amount of material, the yield is the  total amount of material collected at the end of the apparatus at  which the desired isotope is enriched. In an apparatus with an in-  finite supply it is better to give the yield of the isotope in terms of  rate of production, (i.e., in terms of the rate at which the isotope  can be removed at the "enriched" end of the apparatus). This  removal of the enriched material causes a decrease in separation  factor, so that in an actual separation process a compromise be-  tween production and enrichment of the desired isotope has to be  made.   In most processes which separate isotopes by differences in  their average properties (statistical separation methods), the en-  richment of the desired isotope increases slowly until a steady con-  dition or equilibrium value is reached. (The previously used ex-  pression of separation factor (Q) and enrichment factor (E) refer  to equilibrium values of these quantities). Although the steady  condition is approached only in an asymptotic fashion, the approach  to equilibrium is characterized by what is known as start-up or  equilibrium time. This time can be defined in whatever manner is  most convenient to the process under consideration.     BEPAEAT10N OF ISOTOPES 186   The total amount of material being processed at a given time  in a separation apparatus is called its hold-up per stage. Hold-up  is most conveniently expressed in moles of material.   Individual separation processes ; mass spectrometer. Separa-  tion processes are most conveniently divided into those which de-  pend on the behavior of single molecules (individual separation  methods) and those which depend on the average statistical be-  havior of many molecules (statistical separation methods). There  are many more methods of the latter kind than of the former.  As examples of the individual separation method we shall  describe the mass spectrometer and the isotron (jSmyth 11.24).  Only the mass spectrometer has been used for the large scale pro-  duction of enriched U 235 (Smyth 11.1) but the isotron is of in-  terest since it has not been described elsewhere in detail.   The mass spectrometer is an "individual" separator since the  behavior of each ion is individually determined, within certain  limits, by the experimental conditions. Since the mass spectro-  meter is fundamentally a device which separates isotopes, it can  evidently be used for the production of isotopes, but is limited in  this by the small ion currents ordinarily obtained. In fact, the  usual ion current of 1 microampere is equivalent to a transport of  10~ 5 micromoles of singly charged ions per second. In ordinary  uranium (A(U 235 )/ / o-(U 238 ) = 1/140) this corresponds to about  \/ 16 microgram of U 235 per hour.   In order to use an increased ion current, the following prob-  lems must be solved :   1. Production of large quantities of gaseous ions.   2. Use of greatest number of ions in the ion beam.   3. Elimination of space charges in the magnet chamber.   A large ion current evidently should not entail too great a decrease  in enrichment due to defocussing by mutual repulsion of the ions,  so that this problem has to be investigated also. Furthermore, a  good yield depends on the ability to collect all the ions which ar-  rive at the collector. This might be quite difficult when ions enter  the collector in large quantity and with high velocities.   Prior to 1939 several attempts had been made to overcome  some of the above mentioned difficulties. Ion currents up to about  100 microamps were obtained, although not with uranium.   The successful large scale separation of uranium was first re-  ported by Smyth (11.1). Probably because of its simplicity, a  Dempster type mass spectrometer was used for this separation.     186     NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     The most important features of this spectrometer as well as paths  for heavy and light isotopes are indicated in figure 35.     Magnetic Field  perpendicular  to paper.      Ion  Source.   Fig. 35. Separation of isotopes by a Dempster type mass spec-  trometer. The ions (U 235 + and U 238 + ) leave the ion source  and after acceleration by a voltage V , enter a magnetic field H.  The ions are approximately focussed after a deflection of 180  by the magnetic field, the heavier ions further away from the  entrance slit than the lighter ions, and are collected by separate  collectors.   A very convenient ion source to use for uranium is an adap-  tation of a cyclotron arc type ion source ; (see figure 36 and Smyth  11.20). Such ion sources give currents up to several milliam-  peres 5 *. The use of line sources of this type would probably  enable the production of ion beam currents of over 10 milliamperes.  Smyth (11.1 and 11.5) reports that A. O. Nier used uranium bro-  mide vapor in the isotope separation of uranium and that E. O.  Lawrence found mostly U+ ions in the ion beam (not necessarily  using the same uranium salt vapor).     ** M. 8. Livingston, /. App. Phys. 15, 15 (1944) ; Alkazov, Mescheryakof  and Chromochenko, /. Phya. USSR 8, 56 (1944).     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES     187     One disadvantage of the arc type ion sources is the rather ap-  preciable variation in energy (often about one hundred volts) 65 of  the ions which enter the beam. This can produce a considerable  defocussing at the collector. Furthermore, these sources require  large pumps to retain a sufficently good vacuum in the magnet  chamber.

The salt vapor to be ionized flows down a capillary and is ion-  ized by the beam of electrons which traverses the same capillary.  At the opening of the capillary the mutual repulsion of the ion  pushes them out of the arc so that by suitable focussing shields  they can be drawn away from the source.   One of the previously mentioned difficulties connected with  large ion currents (i.e., the space charge in the magnet chamber)  can be overcome by ionization of the residual gas in the magnet  chamber (Smyth 11.5). It appears then that by proper construc-  tion of the ion source and accelerating system, a large number of  the ions produced can be brought into a beam of small angular  variation. On figure 35 this angular variation is denoted by 0.  In some mass spectrometers : ^ 5. If the angular variation  becomes less than this value, the intensity of the beam is noticeably  decreased, while a much greater value of 6 causes an appreciable  spread at the collector. In fact it is well known that an ion beam  (of one isotope) traversing a magnetic field H with a radius r, has  a spread at the collector due to the angular variation of   S~rO* (154)   where   \2rnV     T zzz      H     (155)     55 For example, Lamar, Buechner and Van de Graaff, J.

Let S\ be the width of the entrance  slit of the ion beam (at the accelerating system) and S v the spread  due to the fluctuations A V in the energy of the ions, where   AF   (156)     V   Then the total spread of the ion beam at the collector is approxi-  mately   . (157)     (This assumes that each of the spreads has a gaussian shape.)   In order to have an appreciable separation of two isotopes of  weights Ms and ML, it is necessary to have the dispersion A due  to the mass difference greater than the total spread S. Now   M a ML   A= - r , (158)   M   where M is the average mass of the two isotopes. For U 238 and   M s M L  U 235 , - ss 1/80, so that for a reasonable dispersion   M   (A ^2 cm) a radius r of at least 160 cm is necessary. With  the previously given angular variation 6 = 5, the spread due to  this variation (equation 154) becomes approximately Se = 1.4 cm.  With an energy fluctuation AF= 100 volts and an accelerating  voltage V 10 kilovolts, the total spread 5* (equation 157) is in-  creased to about 2.2 cm. With V = 40 kilovolts, the total spread  5* is reduced to less than 1.5 cm which is more desirable. (These  considerations neglect the entrance slit width Si which, if much  larger than 0.5 cm, will affect the total spread.) It might be noted  that according to equation 155, an accelerating voltage V = 40  kilovolts and a radius r = 160 cm require a magnetic field strength  H of approximately 3000 gauss.   Figure 37 indicates the number of ions collected per second  as a function of the distance from the entrance slit. The mass  dispersion A is about 2 cm and the width 5" of each peak is about  1.5 cm. In order to have an appreciable yield the collector en-  trance for U 286 should have a width of the order of S. If this  gives an insufficient separation, it may be necessary to run a given  sample of enriched U 235 through an electromagnetic separator sev-  eral times in order to achieve a sufficient purity.     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES     189     Smyth (11.37) mentions that it is advantageous to start with  enriched uranium. This is evidently in line with the above re-  marks. Furthermore, if the initial material is, for example, doubly  enriched in U 235 ( A ( U 235 )/cr (U a35 )=: 1/70), twice as much U 286  is produced at twice the purity since the total amount of U 238 col-  lected is roughly independent of the initial enrichment of U 235 (as  long as this is small) and depends on the total ion current. In  terms of figure 37, this means that the height of the U 238 peak de-  pends mainly on the ion current while the height of the U 235     38 +      3/8 320 322 cm.   Distance from Entrance Slit.     2r     Fig. 37. Ion current distribution near the collectors. Because  of the angular width of the ion beam at the entrance slit, the  ions are not focussed perfectly at the collectors, but each isotope  beam has a spread 5". The overlap of the ion beams makes a  perfect isotope separation impossible without a tremendous de-  crease in yield. For simplicity the distribution of the ion beams  is assumed to be approximately Gaussian.   peak is approximately equal to the product of the initial mole ratio  Xo(U 235 )/cTo(U 238 ) and the height of the U 238 peak (since the  peak widths are practically the same).   From the above remarks we can calculate the number of separ-  ators necessary to produce say 1 mole of 90 percent pure U 285 per  day, starting with material which is for example five times enriched  (A (U 285 )/a (U 238 )=l/22). Assuming an ion current of 10  milliamperes and a single run in each separator, the total number of  separators required is calculated as follows: 1 mole of 90% U 286  per day divided by 10 4 microamps per separator, divided by 10"" 11  moles of U per sec per microamp, divided by 8.8X10 4 sec per day,  multiplied by 22X0.9 moles of U per mole of 90% U 286 , which     190     NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     equals 2X1 s separators. (With double the ion current evidently  only one half of the separators are needed.) In order to build  such a large number of separators, it is advantageous to use many      200cm.

Ion sources  and collectors are placed along the long sides of a rectangular  pole gap of a magnet in order to utilize the magnetic field to the  best advantage and to have easy access to all parts. By proper  dimensioning of the apparatus it should be possible to use about  100 ion sources per magnet.   separators in one magnetic field (Smyth 11.15). An arrangement,  similar to the one shown in figure 38 with many separators along  each side of the pole gap of a rectangular magnet, is very conveni-  ent since it permits easy access to ion sources and collectors. If  100 separators can be used per magnet perhaps 20 magnets of the  above type might be sufficient to produce quite pure U 235 in appre-  ciable quantities per day.   Isotron. Smyth (1L24) reported a new isotope separator,  first suggested by R. R. Wilson of Princeton, which permits the  use of an extended ion source. This separator is based on the  same principle as a velocity modulated electron oscillator (klys-  tron). Ions from an extended source are first accelerated by trav-  elling through a constant high intensity electric field of total poten-  tial V, then further accelerated by a low intensity electric field vary-  ing at radio frequency (1/V) in a saw tooth manner with maxi-  mum total potential V. The result of the intense field is to give  the ions a high velocity v which is inversely proportional to the  square root of their mass m :     (159)     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 191   On the other hand, the saw tooth modulated field produces  small periodic variations in the velocity of the ions, varying the  velocities of the ions from v (equation 159) to a maximum velocity  t/:   v' = v(\+V'/V)* . (160)   Figure 39 shows, on a so-called Applegate diagram (distance  travelled by ions plotted as a function of time), the bunching which  results from the velocity modulation. It is easily shown that, for  the above conditions, bunching occurs a time t after the ions have  passed the modulator, where   t=r(2V/V). (161)   This equation assumes V'/V <&\. It is interesting to note  that with this approximation, t is independent of the mass of the  ions and furthermore that the saw tooth modulation gives perfect  bunching of each isotope. (An ion leaving at a time r(0^@^l)  receives a voltage modulation V so that the bunching time 9 =   2V  r - is independent of ).     If the bunching of the light ions takes place at a distance h  from the modulator, where   h = v t , (162)   then the heavy ions bunch a distance A A nearer to the modulator  where   Ah/h=y 2 (M a M L )/M , (163)   MS being the mass of the heavy ions, ML the mass of the light ions   A/* 1   and M their average mass. For U 235 and U 238 - ss - . In   h 160   order to collect only light ions, deflecting plates are placed at  h A A. The voltage on the deflecting plates is synchronized with  the modulator and is adjusted with a time delay so that at the mo-  ment when the light ions pass the point h, the heavy ions are  deflected out of the beam. (A time delay can be avoided if the  constants of the apparatus are so made that t = nr where n is an  integer.)   In order to give some reasonable values to the constants of  the apparatus we note that the spread in h f A A', with voltage fluc-  tuation A V of the ions coming off the ion source is given by   A *' 3 AF   - = -- .

The ions (U 235 + and U 238 *) from an extended ion source are  accelerated with a voltage V and velocity modulated with a "saw  tooth" voltage of maximum amplitude V 9 . The light ions  (U 235+ ) bunch at a distance h from the modulator and the heavy  ions (U 238+ ) at a distance h A&. At the latter point de-  flecting plates deflect the heavy ion bunches out of the ion beam  so that the isotopes can be collected in separate collectors.   quires V> 1200 volts in the case of uranium. Taking V = 1000  volts, V = 10 volts, r == 10~" 7 sec, the modulator to collector dis-  tance is approximately h = 60 cm and the mass dispersion A A =  .3 cm. To use convenient deflecting plates it is necessary to in-  crease the distance A h to 1 to 2 cm, so that h has to be increased  by decreasing the modulator frequency (1/V) or increasing the  voltage V .     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 193   Just as in the case of the mass spectrograph the yield of U 285  depends on the initial enrichment and on the total ion current.  Too large ion currents might cause debunching, due to space  charge, and make a good separation difficult.   Statistical separation processes; single stage Rayleigh pro-  cesses ; electrolysis. As we said in the introduction, statistical sep-  aration processes depend on the average behavior of molecules of  different mass. Since the behavior of individual molecules can  vary between wide limits, the separation factors obtainable in a  single operation will generally be much smaller than in the case  of the individual separation processes.   Two main classes of these separation processes are now in  use. These will be called Rayleigh processes and equilibrium pro-  cesses. In the Rayleigh processes, the mixtures of isotopes (one  of which is always enriched in the desired isotope) into which the  original material is divided by the isotope separation process, are  never allowed to be in contact for any length of time so that no  process opposing the dividing process has an appreciable chance  to develop. On the other hand in the equilibrium processes the  dividing process and the process opposing this are allowed to de-  velop sufficiently so that some kind of equilibrium state is reached.   A good illustration of the difference between a Rayleigh and  an equilibrium process is the process of evaporation from a liquid.  A vapor is said to be in equilibrium with a liquid when the rate of  molecules entering the liquid from the vapor is equal to the rate  of molecules going from the liquid to the vapor. This equilibrium  state is reached when the liquid is placed in a closed vessel. If the  liquid consists of two isotopes, the mole ratio of the isotopes in the  liquid ((<r/\.)uq) is different from the mole ratio of the isotopes  in the vapor ((<r/A) WO p). This is an example of an equilibrium  separation process which can be shown to have a separation factor     oL   (165)     P t oQ   where P is the vapor pressure of the pure isotope (5-heavy, L-  light). On the other hand, if the vapor molecules are removed so  rapidly from the liquid-vapor interface that no appreciable num-  ber of molecules returns to the liquid, then we have an example of  a Rayleigh process. This process can be shown to have an instan-     194 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   taneous separation factor (see page 195) :     POL M a   q = / , (166)   Poa\jM L   where M is the molecular weight of an isotope.   In general it is more convenient to put a certain physical pro-  cess, such as evaporation, into either a Rayleigh type process or an  equilibrium type process although often it is possible to use them  in both classes. This chapter describes only the conventional use  of some of the physical separation processes.   Both the Rayleigh and the equilibrium processes can be used  in a single stage and in multiple stages (cascade). A Rayleigh  type process can be put in cascade by using recycling while an equi-  librium process can be cascaded by using countercurrent flow.  This will be described later in more detail.   We shall now describe the Rayleigh process in a single stage,  stressing those methods which are particularly suited to separate  U 235 and deuterium. We shall illustrate this process by a descrip-  tion of electrolysis which has been used in Sweden, for example,  to produce large quantities of heavy water. (Another important  Rayleigh process is gas diffusion through a porous barrier which,  in cascade, was so successful in separating U 235 by the use of urani-  um hexafluoride or a similar gas (Smyth 10.1).)   It was first discovered by Washburn and Urey 56 that the elec-  trolysis of aqueous solution heavy water was enriched in the re-  maining solution.   In order to examine this effect let us consider a given volume  V of solution containing n ions of the element under investigation,  on ions of the heavy isotope and \n ions of the light isotope. The  rate at which ions of the isotopes are electrolysed at the electrodes  will be proportional to the number of ions of each kind present  and inversely proportional to the total volume V of the solution, so  that at any time t   d(crn) o-n d(\n) Xn   = ~ a anc j _ (167)   dt V dt V   In these equations a and b are constants depending on the mass of  the ions in a fashion to be explained later. These equations as-  sume that at all times the molecules in the volume V are perfectly  mixed so that no complicating concentration gradients occur.   56 E. W. Washburn and H. C. Urey, Proc. Nat. Acad. Amer. 18, 496  (1932).     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 195   It is convenient to define as the instantaneous separation factor  q for the heavy isotope, the ratio   vn/Xn b   q = = _ B (168)   d(an)/d(\n) a   This is the ratio of the mole ratio in the remaining solution to the  mole ratio of that part of the solution which is instantaneously re-  moved from it at any time t. As can be seen, q is independent of  time.   In order to obtain the overall separation and enrichment fac-  tors, we integrate equation 167 to obtain     /* ,**   dt Xn I   and In = -b \  V X n J     o- n I dt Xn I dt   In = -a   V  o o     It follows, using equation 168, that  Xn/X n = (<rn   where the index zero refers to the initial ions. In the case of  water, the remaining solution contains the desired enriched iso-  tope (deuterium) so that in accordance with equation 149 we can  call   cr = an, X =. AH and n = n n ,   so that from above   XK/Xo=(o ll /<r }(n ll /n o y-i . (169)   Since initially there were X n light ions and & n heavy ions,  the electrolysis must have removed   A tto - Aiittn SEE AI (n - n n ) (170)   light ions and   = <TI (n - n u ) (171)     heavy ions, where the index I refers to the total amount of gas  released during the electrolysis. Making use of equations 169,  170 and 171 and keeping in mind that <T + A = 1, it is possible     to work out the overall separation factor Q = - , and the   OX/AI   OII/AII  overall enrichment factor E = - , for this process. Both     196     NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENESGY     of these quantities are functions of the ratio nn/n and increase  with the decreasing ratio n\\/n . This can be seen from figure 40  which shows the variation of an and AH for the electrolysis of wa-  ter with the instantaneous separation factor q = 5. (Here <r =  mole fraction of deuterium and A. = mole fraction of hydrogen.)  For ordinary water cr (D)/A (H) = 1/5000. In order to  get heavy water which is 80 per cent enriched in deuterium, its  initial volume (proportional to n } has to be decreased approx-  imately 10 5 times which means that this process has a very low  yield for such high enrichment.      10 10* /o K? i<y   Reduction Factor of Initial Amount of MaUnal   Fig. 40. Isotope separation by electrolysis. The mole fraction  of the heavy isotope increases with decreasing volume of the  substance in the fashion shown. The case illustrated is for  water with q=5. (From W. Walcher, Erg. d. exakt. Naturwiss  18, 155 (1939).)   These considerations are quite general for any Rayleigh type  process, since this process is characterized by equation 167.  Equation 169 is known as the Rayleigh formula. Processes other  than electrolysis usually- have instantaneous separation factors  q which are not much larger than unity. In that case, equation  169 immediately yields the overall enrichment factor   (172)     If in addition (q-l) In  comes < 1 , the overall enrichment factor be-     E a 1-K9-1) In     (173)     In order to explain the difference between the coefficients a  and 6 in equation 165, we must consider the process of electrolysis  in some detail. The theory of this process is by no means in its     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 197   final form, 57 but it is known that the following phenomena could  be determining in the electrolysis of water :  1 . Mobility of the ions in the electrolyte.   2. Neutralization of the ions at the cathode.   3. Combination of atoms to form molecules and their libera-  tion from the cathode.   4. The exchange reaction   H 2 O + HD = HDD + H 2 .   The first process does not enter into the separation of isotopes  because the mobility of ions is determined primarily by their elec-  tronic configuration. It might be noted, though, that under high  electric fields the mobility of ions can serve to separate isotopes to  some extent (Smyth 9.31).   Of the processes 2 and 3, the slowest one will be most impor-  tant since it will determine the rate at which ions are transformed  into liberated molecules. It is generally believed that the neutral-  ization of ions at the cathode is this rate determining process. On  the cathode there appear to be more or less fixed layers of OH, H  and perhaps H 2 O (see figure 41) which form a barrier for any  H+H 2 O and D+H 2 O ions coming to be discharged. In order to  have neutralization, electrons from the metal have to effectively  overcome the so-called over voltage V which is the potential be-  tween the null point energy level of the hydrated ion and the Fermi  level in the metal. The rate of discharge of the heavy ions is there-  fore     where C is the same for different isotopes and depends mostly on  the current density and a takes care of the fact that right after  neutralization the atom (H or D) might still be at a different po-  tential for an electron in the neighborhood than the E^O molecule  it carried along. VB is the over voltage for the heavy ion and is  equal to a constant voltage plus the null point energy, EOS- Since  the null point energies of different isotopes are not similar, one  finds for the instantaneous separation factor     ( 08 E OL )/kT}, (174)   where EOL is the null point energy of the light isotope.   It is quite clear that the above picture is insufficient since q  actually depends on the electrode metal, the electrode surface, the   57 Eyring, Glasstone and Laidler, J. Oh.

In fact the equilibrium constant   [HDO]/[HaO]   K =   [HD]/[H 2 J   which is approximately equal to 3, is exactly the instantaneous  separation factor q as defined by equation 168. Therefore if the  gas (H 2 and HD) is retained long enough on the cathode for the  exchange equilibrium to set in, q has to be equal to K, as happens  in the case of poisoned cathodes.   In order to show that electrolysis probably cannot be used to  enrich uranium isotopes, the instantaneous separation factors q of  some known isotopes are given in table 18. It can be seen that  the separation factor decreases with the increasing mass of the iso-  topes.   Gas diffusion. The separation of isotopes by gaseous diffu-  sion through a porous wall was first suggested by Lindeman and  Aston. 58 In order to investigate the separation process in some  detail let us consider a cylinder filled with a mixture of two iso-  topes. One end of the cylinder is closed by a porous barrier of  area A and thickness L and the other end consists of a movable  piston. As the gas diffuses through the barrier, the pressure in-  side of the piston is kept at a constant value PI by moving the  piston while the pressure outside of the cylinder is kept at a much  lower constant value P** (by suitable pumping for example). The  flow of gas through the porous barrier can be calculated if we ideal-  ize the pores to be cylindrical tubes of length L and radius r and  assume that the pores are arranged in a square array over the area  A of the barrier and have touching sides. The number of pores  per square centimeter is then(l/2r) 2 .   If the radius r of the pores is of the order of one tenth or less  of the mean free path of the gas molecules at the pressure PI (at  atmospheric pressure the mean free path of molecules is approxi-  mately 10~ 5 cm) and if the length L of the pores is several orders  of magnitude larger than that mean free path, the flow through the  pores is almost purely diffusive (Smyth 10.14). 59 This means  that the molecules flowing down the pores collide only with the  pore walls arid do not interact among themselves. It has been  shown 60 that under these conditions the net rate of molecules flow-   58 F. A. Lindeman and F. W. Aston, Phil. Mag. 37, 523 (1919).   59 de Bethune and Present, Bun. Amer. Phys.

(176)   A dt   If the process described is to be a Rayleigh type process, there  must be no appreciable back diffusion (i.e., P^^Pi). If PI then  denotes the total pressure in the piston, the partial pressure of the  heavy isotope will be aPi and equation 175 must be rewritten for  the heavy isotope as     d(<m) \/2Tr H A r PI   -- A -an, (177)     dt 3 \/M B RTL n   where n is the total number of molecules in the piston at any time.  A similar equation obtains for the light isotope.

(179)   Equation 173 shows that by letting half the original number of  uranium hexafluoride molecules escape through a barrier, an en-  richment factor E = 1.003 is obtained.   Single stage equilibrium processes ; thermal diffusion. As we  mentioned previously, equilibrium processes are differentiated from     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 201   the Rayleigh processes by the fact that the process dividing the  original mixture of isotopes into two mixtures ( one of which is  enriched in the desired isotope) is allowed to come to equilibriuir  with the process opposing the division. In addition, in equilibri-  um processes the overall separation factor does not depend on the  total number of molecules present. It can be worked out directly  from physical considerations without going through a formula such  as the Rayleigh formula (equation 169).   The equilibrium processes which will be described here are  the thermal diffusion method and the chemical exchange method,  The former has been used to enrich liquid uranium hexafluoride in  U 235 F0 (Smyth 11.37) and the latter enters into the large scale  production of heavy water (Smyth 9.37). These methods are also  characteristic of two main classes of equilibrium processes : those  in which the two isotope mixtures mentioned are physically not  separated (i.e. are both gases or liquids) and those in which they  are physically separated (i.e. one is a gas and the other a liquid)  In the first class are thermal diffusion and centrifugation, while the  second class contains chemical exchange, distillation and similar  processes. The fundamental equations governing the processes in  each class are quite similar, but the scope of this chapter does not  permit a detailed presentation.   The mechanism of thermal diffusion. If a temperature gradi-  ent is initially established in a gas or liquid at a uniform tempera-  ture and concentration, a movement of molecules occurs along the  direction of the temperature gradient (neglecting any convection  currents). The theory of this effect has been worked out for gases  by Enskog and Chapman 61 and for liquids by Wirtz and Hiby. 62   Consider the simple one dimensional case of a gas or liquid  between two infinite, plane heat conducting walls. The fluid at a  uniform temperature is subjected to a temperature gradient pro-  ducing a flow of the light isotope in the fluid, which is perpendiculai  to the conducting walls. This can be expressed by   3A D T *dT   Xv L = -D + , (180)   3-r T *dx   where A = A (x, t) is the mole fraction of the light isotope at the  plane which is a distance x from the cold wall and at the time i  (t = O when the temperature gradient is established), VL is the  flow velocity of the light molecules, D is the coefficient of self dif-   ft For all pertinent references see W.

(The thermal diffusion coefficient is  sometimes defined in a different manner.)   When equilibrium is reached, the flow of molecules stops  (V L = O) and one obtains from equation 180     2>A D T   D - = -- (181)     In order to integrate this equation, the ratio DT/D must be known.

The numerical coefficient in equa-  tion 183 has been chosen semi-empirically by considering the iso-  tope molecules as hard spheres. Its value for very soft molecules,  such as UFe, may be much smaller than .35.

How the energy e varies  with mass and size of the isotopes is not known but thermal diffu-  sion has been used to enrich liquid uranium hexafluoride in U 238 F 6  (Smyth 11.40).

In the case of gases one generally chooses the distance a = 0.5  cm and, since D = 0.1 cm 2 /sec. the equilibrium time r d = 2 sec.  For liquids it is best to make a = 10~~ 2 cm and with D 10~~ 5  cm 2 / /sec, the equilibrium time T& = 10 sec. These results are of  course very rough and are only meant to indicate orders of magni-  tude of equilibrium time.   Chemical exchange. In the earlier discussion of electrolysis  (page 199) we stated that the exchange reaction   HD + H 2 O ^ H 2 + HDO   has an equilibrium constant K which is approximately equal to 3  at room temperature and which could serve to separate the hydro-  gen isotopes. In general, if an exchange reaction is of the form     , (192)   where L and S represent the light and heavy isotope respectively  and A and B any radicals, the equilibrium constant is defined by   [LB] [SA]   K = - => - , (193)   [LA] [SB]   where the square brackets denote concentration in moles* per liter.  If o- A denotes the mole fraction of the heavy isotope S combined  v/ith the A radical and AA the same for the light isotope (<TA+AA  1 ) then evidently   [SA] a A     [LA] A A     ' P. Debye, Ann. d. Physik 36, 284 (1934).     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 205   A similar relation holds for the B molecules, so that the equilibri-  um constant K can be written     K = - (194)     If now the A molecules and B molecules can be separated by phys-  ical means, the exchange reaction is effectively a separation process  with an overall separation factor Q   Q=K . (195)   It should be noted that if more than one atom of each ex-  changing isotope is involved in the exchange reaction the relation  195 no longer holds 68 and must be modified.   Physically, the difference of the equilibrium constant (K) of  exchange reactions from unity expresses a difference in reaction  rates of isotopes. This is due to a variation with mass of the num-  ber of collisions between molecules and to a variation in energy  required to form new molecules if a collision leads to such a forma-  tion. 69 Urey and Greiff 70 calculated equilibrium constants for vari-  ous exchange reactions by using the fact that the equilibrium con-  stant K for a reaction is given by the ratio of the product of the  partition functions, f , of the resultants to that of the reactants :   /LB * /SA   A" = ----- (196)   /LA ' /SB   Each partition function is given by   f=M*/ 2 2 (27r) 3 / 2 (&T) 5 /V(^W /2 ) , (197)   where M is the mass of the molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, T  is the absolute temperature, h is Planck's constant and A is Avoga-  dro's number.

Table 19 lists some of the calculated separation factors.  It should be noted that a system containing hydrogen and water  (with deuterium) generally does not have a simple expression for  a separation factor. 71 Table 19 shows a decreasing trend of the  separation factor with an increase in mass of the exchanging iso-  tope. A separation of uranium isotopes by this method for exam-  ple is highly unlikely.   The time of equilibrium of exchange reactions could be ob-  tained by a consideration of reaction kinetics but is outside the  scope of this presentation. It is worth while to remark, though,  that the time to equilibrium will be reduced by having large areas  of contact between reacting phases and by the use of catalysts.   Multiple stage recycling process; gas diffusion. With the  exception of electrolysis for hydrogen and centrifugation at very  low temperatures, the separation coefficients of the single stage  processes are all very close to unity. In order to increase the over-  all separation factors of the various methods it is necessary to put  the single stage processes in cascade.   In a cascade there is usually a continuous flow from one stage  to the next. Each stage divides the material it receives into two  parts, one of which is enriched in the desired isotope and serves to  feed the next higher stage while the other, although impoverished  in the desired isotope, is not removed (stripped), but serves to feed  the next lower stage. In this way a given quantity of material is  recycled many times, resulting in an increased extraction of the  desired isotope over what it would be in a single stage separation.   The theory of cascade operation is very complicated, especially  when one cascade serves to enrich an initially low mole ratio ma-  terial (e.g., AO/OO 1 if the light isotope is desired) to a final  high mole ratio material (e.g. Xp/vp > 1). This is because the  flow in the initial stages is determined primarily by the undesired  material (e.g., heavy isotope) while the flow in the final stages is  determined largely by the desired material (e.g. light isotope). To  obtain the most efficient flow of desired material the net flow must  be inversely proportional to the concentration of the desired ma-  terial. If the light isotope has a mole fraction A fc in the k th stage,  the net flow of material through that stage must be proportional to     Since Rayleigh type processes can be put in cascade by re-  cycling, it turns out that the above flow conditions can be arranged   r * Crist and Dalin, J.

In the case of equilibrium  processes, the cascading is accomplished by counter current flow  in which recycling occurs naturally. It is usually not possible to  proportion the flow conditions artificially as desired and, conse-  quently, a single counter current cascade cannot be used efficient-  ly to produce very large separations, although several single count-  er current cascades can be connected by artificial recycling to in-  crease their overall efficiency.   We shall first describe recycling processes, using gas diffu-  sion as an illustration since it has been actually used in the large  scale separation of U 235 from U 238 (Smyth 10.1).   The physical nature of gas diffusion has been described on  page 199. In order to put several single stages in cascade, an      4 Fot Pump  -4 Slow Pump  Porou Borrltr.     Fig. 42. Schematic diagram of a recycling cascade. As the gas  flows through any stage the light isotope diffuses preferentially  through the porous barrier and is fed to the next higher stage  while the heavy isotope flows preferentially to the next lower  stage. In actual practise there is a continuous supply of orig-  inal material available at the "heavy" end and the enriched light  isotope is removed at the "light" end, or vice versa.     arrangement such as that shown in figure 42 can be used. A typi-  cal stage k is shown enlarged in figure 43a and a possible actual  construction of such a stage is sketched in figure 43b.   It is evident that each stage consists of two compartments  which are separated by a porous wall (barrier). A pressure dif-  ference is established between the two compartments so that part  of the gas diffuses through the barrier as it travels along it. If we  denote by N&k the number of molecules per second flowing past  the point x in stage k, then o^ N m ,k will be the number of heavy  molecules per second flowing past the same point and X m ,u N m ,k the  number of light molecules per second.

In general the pressure P k is made  the same for all stages and is conveniently put at 1 atmosphere.

Equation 201 serves  to estimate the barrier area for each stage k.   The operation of the separation apparatus is such that the  cascade is initially filled with materials of mole ratio <TQ/\Q (=1/140  in the case of ordinary uranium hexafluoride) and each stage k sends  material enriched in the light isotope to the stage k-\-l and impov-  erished material to the stage k 1. No further separation of ma-  terial will occur when each stage k receives from the stage +1  the same number of each isotope as it transmits to that stage. In  terms of the notation of figure 43a, this means that at equilibrium &Djk+ i ND>JC+I = 0B>k NB,U and XD,TC+\ND,I&+I = ^B,i&NB,k (202)   This equation assumes that there is no "production" of the de-  sired (light) isotope (i.e., there is no net flow of light molecules  toward the light end). Calculations of separation factor with con-  tinuous production are too complicated to be considered here.

The most efficient flow seems to occur when /s^.5. (see text).   One consideration which so far has been ignored is the fact  that since the total number of molecules used in the apparatus (ex-  cluding the end volumes) is constant, there exists a relation be-  tween each A* and A . The number of molecules in each stage is  proportional to the volume of that stage which in turn depends on  the barrier area A k and therefore on the flow NIC through the stage  (see equation 201). The above mentioned relation therefore gives  an additional relation between the A/s and the N's which would  permit the solution of equations 203 and 206 for the N's. Since  the calculations indicated are complicated, we shall proceed from  assumed values for the N's and calculate back some of the inter-  esting constants of the apparatus.   The yield in light isotope of the apparatus can be expressed  very roughly by the quantity 8 AH NU, where 8 is the fraction  of material flowing into the light end of the apparatus which is  drawn off continuously. 8 generally can not be much larger than  1/1000 without decreasing greatly the overall separation factor Q',  which is a function of 8. Analogous to the derivation of equations  224 and 229, it can be shown that $=0 (<?'! ) where is called  the production factor. Curves of versus Q' for thermal diffusion  separation are shown in figure 46. The curves for gas diffusion  separation should be similar.     212 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   In order to get maximum enrichment of the lighter isotope,  we assume that there is an infinite supply of initial material (mole  ratio AO/<TO) so that AI = Ao and an = cr at all times.

In that case the  overall enrichment factor for the lighter isotope is   r l-( I-/)* -j* & = <?= -- (208)     and the yield of enriched material is   r i _(!_/)     (209)     The dependence of both these quantities on / is shown in figure 44  for the case of uranium hexafluoride (/*=!. 0043).   Suppose it is desirable to obtain 1 mole of 90 percent pure  U 235 F 6 per day starting from unenriched uranium hexafluoride  Then   0.9/0.1   = 1260 . (210)     1/140   Smyth (10.7) notes that f^^2 is an efficient arrangement, al-  though it is not known whether the stages were connected as  shown in figure 42. As marked on figure 44, /=^ gives ap-  proximately q'= 1.006 for the single stage separation factor and  therefore for the total number of stages   Z=1200 . (211)   In order to calculate the flow NI through the first stage we set  the square bracket in equation 209 equal to unity 72 and since  we want SAnA^i = 0.9 moles/day   we obtain for the flow JVi, if 8=1/1000 and ^=1/140,   #j=126000 mole/day . (212)   Now in the first 400 stages of the apparatus (=1 to 400) the in-  itial material (Xo/o- =l/140) is only enriched by a factor of ap-  proximately 10 (A4oo/cr4oo = 1/14) so that the flow N k through  these stages must be approximately the same as that given for  NI in equation 212. (In the rest of the stages the flow N k de-  creases as AH /A* until NnnzlOOO mole/ day). Equation 201  then requires a barrier area for each of the first 400 stages   A k = 3 X 10 cm, 2 k = 1 ..... 400 (213)   73 For most efficient flow, see page 208.     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 213   (while for the last stage, A u ^0.23 x 10 4 cm 2 ). The total bar-  rier area in the apparatus would then be approximately 3 acres,  which compares favorably with Smyth (10.13).   The actual variation of concentration at each stage with  time is very complicated. Calculations have been made by Sherr T8  for the case of Hertz pumps which can also be represented  by the schematic diagram shown in figure 43a, assuming the same  holdup and flow for each stage and assuming that only a small frac-  tion of the lighter isotopes is present all the time.   In general the concentration or mole fraction at any point in the  apparatus (such as the light end in our case) increases quite rap-  idly at first and then approaches its equilibrium value asympto-  tically. Huffmann and Urey 74 give a rather simple deriva-  tion for the characteristic time of equilibrium assuming that the  initial rapid increase in enrichment continues until the maximum  concentration ratio is reached. Urey's calculations are for frac-  tional distillation and assume what would be constant holdup and  flow in the present case. The results can be transposed though  and yield for the equilibrium time, assuming AO 1.

Fo=10 5 cm 3 assumes  that the barrier forms one wall of a channel of approximately 0.3  cm height. If the channel is made any smaller than this, one has to  consider the viscous flow of gas along the channel and the calcula-  tions have to be modified accordingly. 75   Counter current process; thermal diffusion. We have shown  that equilibrium single stage processes can be put in cascade by  countercurrent flow. As the word countercurrent signifies, in this  method the two mixtures into which the separation process di-  vides the initial mixture of isotopes are made to flow one against  the other. The flow is slow enough so that opposite parts of the  mixtures have time to come almost to equilibrium.   The theory of countercurrent flow for thermal diffusion in  gases has been worked out by Furry, Jones and Onsager 76  and for liquids it has been examined by Debye 77 . The theory  of the countercurrent centrifuge however does not appear to have  been published. The thermal diffusion method will be treated  here only in an approximate fashion in order to stress the  physical processes which occur. For more exact treatments the  reader is referred to the original sources.   Cohen 78 has written a paper describing countercurrent flow  in a fractionating tower, some results of which will be given  here. A fractionating tower can be used to put in countercurrent  any of the equilibrium processes similar to the heterogeneous  chemical exchange process. Sometimes several of these processes  are used together (Smyth 9.37 and 9.41).   When thermal diffusion is used in countercurrent, the sepa-  rator is placed in an upright position as shown in figue 45. Only  the plane separator will be considered here. From the previous  discussion (page 201) it is known that on applying a temperature  gradient, a flow of molecules will occur between the cold and hot  walls. In the present arrangement, the resulting difference in  density of the fluid at the two walls will cause a convection cur-  rent to flow up the hot wall and down the cold wall. The average  convection velocity v g is approximately   ft 9 P AT   a 2 , (215)     100 ^   " W. A. Nierenberg, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 21, 19 (Jan. 1946).  " Furry, Jones and Onsager, Phys.

Schematic diagram of a thermal diffusion column. The  fluid containing the two isotopes to be separated is placed be-  tween two plane heat conducting walls which serve to establish  a temperature gradient through the fluid. The direction of the  convection flow (v g } and the diffusion flow (%) is indicated.  The end volumes at the top and bottom of the column are not  shown.   where ft is the coefficient of cubical expansion of the fluid, g is  the acceleration due to gravity, p is the mean density of the fluid, >; is the mean coefficient of viscosity, &T=Tji T is the tempera-  ture difference and a is the distance between the walls. For op-  posite parts of the fluid to come to equilibrium, an approximate  time r<i is required. This is given by equation 191 as   a 2 a   r = = , (216)   D v d   v<i being the diffusion velocity of the molecules. On the other  hand, during this time opposite parts of the fluid will have moved  a distance A with respect to each other where     A = 2     v a = 2a     (217)     The separator may therefore be considered to consist of a series of  stages of length A, each having a separation factor for the light  isotope 5', which is the same as that for the single stage equilibri-  um process. From equations 186 and 196 we recall     =1 +     a     (218)     216 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   MB - M L  where for gases a = .35 , T = l /2 (T* + T ) and     for liquids = - , T = ^/T n T c , and A T = T h - T c .  kT   In these equations as well as in the ones following, it is al-  ways assumed that the initial concentration of the lighter isotope  (Ao) is much less than unity. If H is the overall length of the  separator, the overall separation factor for the light isotope, Q', is   Q' = ( 9 ') H/A . (219)   More exact calculations show that there is an optimum value  for the "stage length" A, in order to obtain the maximum separa-  tion factor Q'. In fact if the convection velocity v g is much larger  than the diffusion velocity v&, opposite parts of the liquid have no  time to come to equilibrium and the separation does not proceed  to its best value. If the convection velocity is much smaller than  the diffusion velocity, back diffusion of molecules in a direction op-  posite to convection takes place because of the concentration dif-  ference existing between the top and bottom of the separator. This  back diffusion decreases the overall separation factor Q'. It turns  out that maximum separation is obtained if the convection velo-  city v ff is equal to the diffusion velocity v d , so that   A = 2a (220)   and Q' = (q') H / 2 * (221)   Using equations 215 and 217, it is seen that this requires   100*7 D <p = - . (222)     For gaseous uranium hexafluoride one can assume Z?=1.4,  7;/p=*0.05 cm 2 /sec 79 ,j8 ^ 1/273, AT330 so that a^O.05 cm.  If //=100 cm, Q'^2.5 (see equation 187). It may be remarked  that this is for "no production" of isotope and neglects back dif-  fusion along the convection flow. More exact calculations give  as*0.13 cm for gaseous uranium hexafluoride. For lighter gases  as*0.5 cm.   For liquids, assuming Tj^lO"" 2 , D^10~ 5 cm 2 /sec, /te-10~ 3 ,  g sz 1Q3, peel, one finds fl 3 ss 10- 5 /AT, so that with AT =  100 C, a &L 0.005 cm.

SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES 217   topes, the lighter isotope will concentrate in the top reservoir of  the thermal diffusion apparatus and can be removed either continu-  ously or discontinuously. Just as in the case of gas diffusion, it  is often advantageous to use an infinite supply of the original  mixture so as to have maximum enrichment.   An exact discussion of the most efficient production of iso-  topes (i. e., whether continuous or discontinuous, whether practi-  cally at equilibrium or not), will be found in the references pre-  viously mentioned. The equilibrium time not for the entire sepa-  rator is approximately   H 2   rtot = , (223)   D   where H is the length of the separator and D the coefficient of self  diffusion of the isotope. For gases /JlOOcm and D^O.l  cirr/sec so that r to t^\ day and for liquids H^IO cm and  Ds^l cm/day so that Tf ^100 days. In general therefore one  operates the isotope separation for gases near equilibrium. In the.  case of liquids, however, this is not practical.   For a later comparison with the fractionating column it is  interesting to see how the separation factor, Q', is affected when  there is a continuous removal of light isotope from the top volume  of the reservoir. Supposing that N moles/sec of material flow  into the top reservoir, the amount of material which is removed  from the top reservoir has been shown by Furry, Jones and Onsa-  ger to be approximately (assuming A<,<1)   6 N(q' - 1) (224)   where   a* B pc/AT P   AT = _ (225)   720 yT M   and   q'l=a&T/T . (226)   N(q' 1), which is generally called the transport of material, is  determined by experimental conditions so that can be calculated  from the amount of material actually removed. We shall call 6  the production factor. N, the flow of material into the top reser-  voir, is roughly given by   a P   N ss v g - B moles/sec ,  2 M   where v g is the convection velocity of the material given by equa-  tion 215, a is the distance between the plates, B is the breadth of     218     NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     the separator (see figure 45) and M/p is the molar volume of the  gas. (In the case of gases the more exact calculation gives a dif-  ferent numerical factor in v g and requires the substitution of 1/T  for ft).   Furry, Jones and Onsager show that the overall separation  factor Q' (0) depends on the production factor in the following  way :   G'(0)   Q' (0)= - , (227)     where Q' (0) is given by equation 221. Figure 46 gives a plot  of equation 227. Evidently a low separation factor with no pro-  duction (Q'(0) ) is not much affected by production.     0(0)      Production Factor     Fig. 46. Separation factor versus production factor for a thermal  diffusion column. This is a plot of equation 227. The com-  promise which has to be made in practise between production  and enrichment is clearly indicated. It is assumed that the iso-  tope to be enriched is always present, is small concentration and  that the production is continuous. Practically the same figure is  obtained for the separation factor of a fractionating column, if  the desired isotope is removed in gaseous form from the top  reservoir. (K. Cohen, Jour. Chem. Phys. 8, 588 (1940).)   In order to get an idea of the order of magnitude of possible  production we apply equation 227 to the case of uranium hexa-  fluoride assuming a s* 0.1 cm. 5 = 10 cm. p/iy = 28 sec/cm 2 .  = 1.5 X 10~ 3 , AT/r = 1/1.5, M/p = 22X10 3 cm 3 . This  gives AT((7' l)s*10~~ 8 moles/day and the actual production would  be 0'10~~ 8 moles/day of Q (0) times enriched uranium hexafluor-  ide gas.   Fractionating column. A fractionating column is generally  used to put into countercurrent flow those equilibrium processes  which are similar to the heterogeneous chemical exchange meth-  od. Figure 47 gives a schematic diagram of a fractionating col-     SEPARATION OF ISOTOPES     219     umn. For fractional distillation, volume I is a condenser and vol-  ume II an evaporator. For chemical exchange volume I is a mix-  er for the gas and liquid, and volume II is a generator for the gas.  In the column itself the gas travels upwards and the liquid down-  wards. The column is packed with plates or glass balls etc., as  well as suitable catalysts, in order to have a large liquid-vapor in-  terface.

On the  left the end volumes and the interface between the two phases  in countercurrent flow are shown (K. Cohen, Jour. Chem. Phys.  8, 588 (1940).) The role of the end volumes depends on the  process for which the fractionating column is used. On the right  possible constructions of the column are sketched (W. Walcher,  Erg. d. exakt. Natunviss. 18, 155 (1939).)   Cohen's 80 theory of the fractionating column assumes constant  holdup per unit length for the gas and liquid, which implies that  back diffusion due to the pressure difference along the column is  neglected. If the column is built with Z plates it can be seen that  the overall separation factor Q for the heavy isotope is   Q = q z (228)   where q for fractional distillation is given by equation 165 and for  simple chemical exchange reactions by equation 195. In general,  however, the experimentally determined Z is only a fraction of the  actual number of plates. This is due mainly to the fact that the  liquid and vapor do not have sufficient time or contact to realize  complete equilibrium during their encounter on one plate. If the  fractionating column is packed with glass balls or the like, Z may   K. Cohen, J. Chem.

This will not be consid-  ered here. Generally Z ^ 100 and Q = 10 for most fractionat-  ing columns. In the exchange of deuterium between hydrogen gas  and water, though, much higher separation factors should be ex-  pected 81 .   It is interesting to consider the case of continuous production.  If TV moles/sec of gas stream up the tower and 8N moles/sec  are removed, then figure 46 also gives the approximate variation  of the separation factor Q(0) in terms of the production factor 9  (see equation 224)   8  6 .

If q = 1.01, 6 10- 1 requires 8 = 10~ 3 , which means that  a high separation factor in the present process is very sensitive to  production. This is quite similar to the thermal diffusion case.   The time to equilibrium has been calculated in a very simple  way by Huffmann and Urey 82 and is, if the original mole fraction  of the heavy constituent o\> 1,   n 1 1   r = In . (231)   Z f (Inq) ((/-I) N'* I-**   n is the total holdup of the column in moles of material (liquid),  N' is the flow of liquid down the column in moles/second and <rp  is the final mole fraction of the material. This equation assumes an  infinite supply of the unenriched material. If q ss 1 one can write  in the above equation In q = q - 1 . In general the equilibrium  time is of the order of days.   Summary. In this chapter various isotope separation meth-  ods were described with particular emphasis on methods which  could, or have, served to produce U 235 and deuterium.   The large scale separation of U 235 has actually been accom-  plished with the gas diffusion method (Smyth 10.1) and the mass   * Crist and Dalin, J. Chem. Phys. 2, 735 (1934).   82 J.

The most success-  ful preparation of deuterium is done in a fractionating tower and  makes use of chemical exchange, fractional distillation and elec-  trolysis (Smyth 9.37).   Disregarding these considerations, the separation methods can  be classified into individual separation methods in which the sep-  aration depends on the motion of each molecule in the separator  and into statistical separation processes in which the average be-  havior of many molecules determines the separation. There are  only a few individual separation methods.   In the case of statistical processes, each separation method  can be used in a single stage or in cascade. Also the separation  methods can be classified into non-equilibrium (Rayleigh type)  processes and equilibrium processes. This depends on the fact  that in a statistical separation the separation divides the original  mixture into two parts and the two parts are either not allowed  to come to equilibrium (this could be called unidirectional division)  or are allowed to come to equilibrium (in which case the process  opposing the division comes to equilibrium with that favoring it).  Any physical process is generally used only in one of the classes  just described, although the discussion of evaporation illustrates  the possibility of using one process in both the equilibrium and  non-equilibrium methods.   From the discussion of enrichment at the beginning of the  chapter it is clear that in statistical separation methods, a theoret-  ical infinite supply of unenriched material should be used in order  to obtain maximum enrichment. Furthermore, since the separa-  tion of most physical processes is not very large, the processes  should be put in cascade. This increases the overall separation  and permits a reasonable continuous or discontinuous production  of isotopes, either of which can be the most efficient depending on  the circumstances.     CHAPTER 13   CHEMICAL SEPARATION METHODS:  ISOLATION OF PLUTONIUM   In this section we shall mention briefly the principles upon  which common chemical separation methods depend and suggest  applications to the case of the separation of plutonium from urani-  um and its fission products. It should be emphasized here that  chemical separations depend upon the chemical properties of pluto-  nium. Until such properties are determined by actual experiment  with plutonium, specific separation procedures are to be regarded as  examples of the chemical approach to the problem rather than as  workable methods. The detailed chemical information upon which  useful methods could be based has not been released for publication,  and it is well known that separation procedures constructed in the  absence of such data are often modified in development. It is in-  teresting to note, however, that the Canadians have developed a  plutonium separation method even better than that used at Han-  ford. 8 *   The most popular chemical methods of separation depend upon  the difference in solubility existing between different compounds.  These differences are enormous in the more common cases and  result in separations far more clean-cut than are to be expected from  the physical methods described in the preceding chapter. It is be-  cause plutonium, being a different element than uranium, may be  expected to show different chemical properties and hence be capable  of separation by chemiral means that this element is of especial im-  portance.   In addition to differences in solubility, differences in volatility  or varying ability to form complex ions or to undergo oxidation  or reduction are characteristics extensively employed in chemical  separation work. Since all of these properties depend in varying  degrees upon the quantities generally grouped together under the  title of chemical properties, it will be necessary to make some esti-  mate of the chemical properties of plutonium before attempting  specific applications.   w Part 2, pages 281-282, Atomic Energy Hearings, U.

These rules are in turn expressions of the periodicity of electrically  similar states as atoms are built up from the simpler to the more  complicated arrangements. It is, for example, interesting to be  able to say whether a new element will have properties similar to  a typical metal or to a non-metal. An element is regarded as metal-  lic if it has a tendency to lose electrons and thus behave as a cation.

Periodic table of the elements with arrows showing direc-  tions of increasing metallic properties.   It is easy to see to a first approximation how this property will vary  with electronic configuration. Consider the effect of adding to lith-  ium, in the first period of the periodic system (see fig. 48), one  electron and one positive charge to give beryllium. The valence  electrons are now under the influence of an increased positive  charge so that their escape to yield the beryllium ion becomes more  difficult. The operation of the same principle renders the escape  of valence electrons progressively more difficult with rising group   84 Ephraim, "Inorganic Chemistry ' ', Gurney and Jackson, Edinburgh  (1934); Morgan and Barstall, "Inorganic Chemistry ' \ Heffer, Cam-  bridge (1936).     224 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   numbers in the periodic table, so that elements become less metal-  lic (i.e., less basic, from left to right in the table).   The situation is quite different when a comparison is made  between lithium and sodium, for example. This change involves  the addition of a complete shell of electrons below the single valence  electron. The net effect is to diminish the ability of the sodium  nucleus to hold electrons since the increased attraction of the nu-  clear charge is more than outweighed by the shielding effect of the  complete electron shell added. Sodium is correspondingly more  basic or more metallic than lithium and again this behavior can be  observed throughout the table. The net result of these two effects  is shown graphically in fig. 48 where the arrows show the di-  rections of increase of basicity, and the dotted arrow represents  their resultant or combined effect.   A consequence of these processes is that the metals tend to  occupy the lower left corner and the non-metals the upper right  corner of the periodic table, while the zone between is filled with  elements partaking of both properties frequently referred to as  semi-metals or metalloids. Arsenic and antimony are well  known examples of this class. A rather obvious, but sometimes  less appreciated corollary of these statements is the fact that posi-  tions in the table lying along lines at right angles to the dotted ar-  row of fig. 48 should exhibit a degree of chemical similarity. This  fact is well illustrated by the marked resemblance between, for ex-  ample, beryllium and aluminum, boron and silicon and vanadium  and molybdenum. Indeed this resemblance is sometimes more  pronounced than that between members of the same periodic group,  and its existence is often useful in predicting the behavior of a lit-  tle known element.   Closely related to this phenomena and especially interesting  for our purposes, is the relationship observed between locations in  the periodic system and the atomic volume. The atomic volume  of an element which is defined as   atomic weight     atomic volume =     density   is in a rough way a measure of the volume occupied by a single  atom. This property, like metallic properties, is periodic and de-  pends upon the electrical construction of the atom. Starting again  with lithium and proceeding to the right in the first period, the  atomic volume at first decreases due to the increased nuclear charge.  Near the middle of the first period an increase of volume due to the  mutual repulsion of valence electrons sets in and continues through     CHEMICAL SEPARATION METHODS     225     the remainder of the first period and through the zero group of the  second, reaching a maximum at sodium in the second period. If  the atomic volume is plotted as a function of atomic num-  ber, the result is a series of sharp maxima occupied by  the alkali metals with intervening broad minima made up of  elements near the middle of the periods. Figure 49 is a plot of  atomic volume vs. atomic number. 85 The five complete periods   _&_      4O 50   Atomic Numbtr.     Fig. 49.

Note especially the increasing vol-  ume of the alkali metals associated with increasing metallic proper-  ties. Estimates of atomic volume are useful because, other things  being equal, similar atomic volumes imply a degree of chemical  similarity.   Near the middle of the last complete long period, fig. 49  shows a peculiar nearly linear portion in the position occupied by  the so-called rare earths 5 7 La to 7iLu. These metals, which lie  in the third group, show such a similarity of properties that their  separation by chemical methods is exceedingly difficult and cum-  bersome methods of fractional precipitation have to be applied.  This resemblance is due to the fact that beyond lanthanum, the add-   M The data for this figure were taken partly from Ephraim, "Inorganic  Chemistry", and partly from the "Handbook of Chemistry and Phy-  sics", 28th Ed. The curve has been slightly smoothed in the first two  periods.     226 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   ed electrons do not enter the 6-shell (the valance shell), but the  4-shell, two shells below. For this reason the rare earths are iden-  tical in electron configuration so far as the two outer shells are  concerned and of course their chemical properties reflect this simi-  larity. It would be unreasonable to expect pronounced differences  in behavior of these elements in processes which involve the rela-  tively small energies usually entering chemical reactions. It is not  true, however, that the chemical properties in these elements are  precisely identical ; they show slight differences in basicity, which  decreases in the series from lanthanum to lutecium. The decrease  in basicity is related to the decrease in atomic volume and may be  pictured from an electrical point of view as arising from the fact  that the single electron added between each element in this series  is very strongly attracted by the nucleus because of its proximity  to the positive charge. Since the total nuclear charge in the series  is increasing, the net result is a decrease in volume. This decrease  in volume, it will be observed, is quite the reverse of the increase  usually found in progressing downward in a given group and is  distinguished by the title of "lanthanide contraction". 86 Some of  the separation methods employed for the rare earths depend upon  the slight differences in basicity accompanying the contraction. It  is worth noting that the effect of the lanthanide contraction extends  beyond the rare earths. Normally there is a regularity in atomic  volumes such that in any group the volume increases in descending  through the group. But, the interpolation of the lanthanide con-  traction interrupts this regularity and in fact reverses it, so that  elements following the rare earths have smaller atomic volumes  than they would have otherwise. Some of the striking similarities  between elements before and after the rare earths, are due to simi-  larities in atomic volume produced by this effect. The striking  chemical resemblances between zirconium and hafnium and between  colombium and tantalum are well known examples. For the same  reason, corresponding elements following the rare earths show  closer chemical relationships than do those preceding them.   86 If tlie shape of the atomic volume curve in the region containing the rare  earths is compared with the equivalent portion in the second long peri-  od, it may be thought at first sight that the volumes shown by the rare  earths are relatively larger than those of the corresponding elements in  the preceding period and the term contraction may appear a misnomer.  The confusion here arises from the custom of locating the rare earths,  in printed forms of the periodic table, in a position separated from the  third group in which they properly belong. If the rare earths are listed  in a vertical column below lanthanum in group III it becomes apparent,  according to the principles outlined above, that the atomic volume  curve should rise beyond lanthanum, and the term "lanthanide con-  traction ' ' becomes quite logical.     CHEMICAL SEPARATION METHODS 227   The chemical properties of plutonium. In the absence of ex-  perimental data, we must be content with such deductions as can  be made by the application of the rather qualitative principles  outlined above. The first problem obviously is that of locating plu-  tonium in the periodic table. This is made peculiarly difficult, as  Seaborg 87 has pointed out, by the fact that plutonium lies beyond  the confines of the hitherto known periodic system and thus re-  quires an extrapolation of properties rather than the interpolation  which can usually be made. The situation is complicated by the  existing uncertainty as to the relationships among plutonium's near  neighbors at the end of the known periodic system.   In 1941 Goeppert-Mayer 88 predicted, on the basis of calculated  energy levels, that a new rare earth series should begin near urani-  um; the last added electrons entering the 5f shell rather than 6d.  It was clearly recognized by Mayer, though, that these calculations  were not sufficiently precise to determine the exact point at which  the first electron would enter the 5f level. Smyth (6.35) implies  that the first 5f electron appears in neptunium which would make  uranium the first member of the series in the same sense that lan-  thanum is the first member of the first rare earth series. Chemi-  cally this would place neptunium and plutonium, 95 and 96 in the  sixth group, below uranium. More recently Seaborg 89 has sug-  gested that the new series begins with goAc, with the first 5f elec-  tron appearing in ooTh, and all the elements beyond actinium lying  in the third group. There appears to be no doubt that neptunium  and plutonium do not belong in groups seven and eight as would  be the case if they were not members of some rare earth-like group,  since they do not at all chemically resemble the corresponding  seventh and eighth group elements, rhenium and osmium. 90 The  alternative arrangements of Seaborg and Smyth for the last few  elements of the periodic system are shown in table 20.   It is not possible, on the basis of available evidence, to decide  between these schemes, and as a matter of fact the energies corres-  ponding to the different possible configurations are probably so  small that the decision, as Seaborg says, is largely academic. Nev-  ertheless it is interesting to compare the situation here with that  in the older rare earth series. In that series all the metals exhibit  a valence of +3 only*, with the exception of the second, cerium,  which has both -}-3 and -j-4. Evidently not more than one of the   * T G. T. Seaborg, Ind.

Seaborg infers that  more than one electron in 5f can be involved in chemical reactions,  but that the difficulty of removing these electrons becomes gradual-  ly greater with increasing atomic number, so that the +3 state  becomes the most stable toward the end of the series. An exam-     CHEMICAL SEPARATION METHODS 229   ination of the atomic volume curve shows a much greater slope in  the region thorium to uranium than that observed in the lanthanum  to lutecium region. This might be interpreted to mean that the  new rare earth series begins at uranium or later, but there is no  assurance that slopes in the two rare earth series need be similar.  From a chemical point of view it is fortunate that both Smyth and  Seaborg agree that the chemical properties of the transuranic ele-  ments are very similar to those of uranium. It seems reasonable  then, as a first approximation, to assign them to a position in the  sixth group. It cannot be too strongly emphasized, however, that  there is so much uncertainty here that the material which follows  must be regarded not as a set of data but as a description of a pos-  sible line of chemical reasoning. It is offered as illustrative of the  sort of outline that might serve as a guide for the study of some of  the chemical problems associated with these new elements.   Separation of plutonium from the fission products of uranium.  It is appropriate to summarize here the chemical "facts" dealing  with plutonium.   (a) Plutonium is primarily metallic in its properties. Wheth-  er placed in the "actinide series" of Seaborg, or in what might be  called the "uranide series" following Smyth, the position of pluto-  nium in the periodic table indicates that its properties will be chief-  ly metallic. If the third group position is chosen it is disturbing  to have to attribute to it properties very like uranium. For this  reason the sixth group position is more satisfactory from a chem-  ical point of view. To avoid excessive discussion where so little  can be known, the latter position is assumed in what follows.   (b) Plutonium has positive valences of +3, +4, -f~!5, and  +6. These valences would be expected on the basis of the Smyth  form of table 20 by analogy with other transition elements and  they are explicitly confirmed by him.   (c) Plutonium is somewhat less metallic than uranium. This  follows from the decrease of atomic volume consequent upon either  an "actinide" or "uranide' 'contraction.   (d) The atomic volume will be in the neighborhood of 12.  This value is arrived at by extrapolating the atomic volume curve  beyond uranium along a line parallel to that found for the first rare  earth series. If the actinide series is assumed, so that thorium is  part of the series, then the extrapolation would be carried out along  a much steeper line, through thorium and uranium. It would yield  an atomic volume of 7 or 8, appreciably lower than that of any  other element in this portion of the periodic system. The higher  value seems a more convenient choice.     230 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   (e) Plutonium will be in small concentration in the uranium  Smyth states that the present production methods are operated  to give guantities of the order of grams of plutonium in tons of  total mixture. This fact is of great importance in choosing a  separation method, since it makes the use of a carrier necessary.   The use of carriers in analytical procedures involving the sep-  aration of a small quantity of material from a much larger quantity,  is a familiar process in work with radioactive elements, and occurs  quite commonly in more ordinary types of analysis. For example,  when barium is precipitated as the chromate in its separation from  strontium, some strontium is partially precipitated along with the  barium ; the barium chromate thus acting as a carrier for strontium.  This coprecipitation occurs in spite of the fact that strontium chro-  mate is not precipitated under the conditions used for barium, if  barium is not present. Many other examples of this type are  known even where the chemical similarity of the metals concerned  it not nearly as great as in the case of barium and strontium. Al-  though the mechanisms entering here are not very well understood,  there is reason to believe that at least two steps are involved. The  first is probably an absorption of the carried substance on the car-  rier, followed by reaction in which the carried substance is actually  built into the lattice of the carrier. If this explanation is accepted  it follows that carrying will probably occur when the valence type  and atomic dimensions of the two elements are sufficiently similar  to make the latter step easy. A choice of suitable carrier might  well be. based upon these criteria, with perhaps less emphasis upon  chemical similarity.   In devising a specific separation method for plutonium we  have additional guidance from Smyth (8.23), who states that the  separation method considered actually employed the precipitation  of plutonium in the ~+4 state with a carrier, oxidation  of plutonium to the +6 condition and reprecipitation of the carrier.  By this means other elements not carried are separated in the first  step, while those which are carried are separated in the second.   The decision as to a specific carrier can be assisted by refer-  ence to fig. 49 where the horizontal dotted line marks the estimated  atomic volume of plutonium. The other elements, having approx-  imately the same atomic volume and lying in corresponding posi-  tions in the periodic system, are seen to fall into five groups ; one  for each of the periods of the systems: (1) lithium, (2) magnesi-  um and aluminum, (3) scandium and titanium, (4) zirconium,  columbium and molybdenum and (5) hafnium, tantalum and tung-     CHEMICAL SEPARATION METHODS 231   sten. Of these, scandium, columbium, and hafnium can perhaps  be eliminated for large scale purposes because of their rarity. Lith-  ium, magnesium, aluminum, scandium, Columbian and tantalum do  not show prominent valences of either +4 or +6, and might be  eliminated on that account leaving only zirconium, molybdenum  and tungsten to be considered. Of these, molybdenum and tung-  sten have valences of +4 and +6 ; zirconium having +4 only. Re-  membering that plutonium precipitated with the carrier will have  to be separated from it later, it appears simpler to choose an ele-  ment which will not be affected by the oxidation applied to the plu-  tonium. Zirconium then will be the carrier and the working out  of a separation scheme is now a matter of chemical detail ; select-  ing a set of chemical reactions which might possibly give the de-  sired separation, followed by trial and correction as defects in the  procedure become apparent.   It is comforting to note that in spite of this quite approximate  method of choice, the element picked as carrier lies above and to  the left of plutonium in the periodic table and thus should show a  degree of chemical kinship with it according to the general prin-  ciples outlined above.   The procedure given in table 21 is based on data from  Mellor, 91 Schoeller and Powell 92 and others. Unfortunately much  of it is conflicting and even if it were not, the fact that separation  is carried out while some of the elements are in a highly excited  condition, is known to alter the normal behavior. 93 Smyth (8.54)  notes that this condition of excitation necessitated some changes in  procedure although not very profound ones. The elements listed  at the left are those thought to be most prominent in the fission  products where separation is concerned. They have been selected from Segre's chart by the elimination of elements with rather short  half-lives and the elimination of all gases. Aluminum has been  added to the list on the supposition that it may be used as a con-  tainer for the uranium.   Even if this scheme should prove usable, it is quite probable  that the cycle would have to be performed more than once to pro-  duce the required purity. It is also likely that a different scheme  may have to be inserted somewhere in the process to deal with ele-  ments not efficiently handled by this procedure.     91 Mellor, "A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemis-  try," Longmans Green and Co., N.Y.

The similarity of pluto-  nium to uranium encourages the belief that the procedures which  have been worked out for uranium (Smyth 6.13) can also be used  for plutonium. Starting with the perplutonate, the following re-  actions might be used :   (a) K 2 Pu0 5 +2 Zn-t-10H+-Pu+ + +++2 Zn+++2K++5H 2 O   (b) Pu++ + + + 4 OH- - Pu0 2 +2 H 2   (c) Pu0 2 -f 4 HF-PuF 4 + 2 H 2   electrolysis   (d) PuF 4 > Pu + 2 F 2   Unconverted uranium remaining after the separation of plu-  tonium might be recovered by precipitation of U+ + + + as fluoride,  followed by electrolysis. If separation from aluminum is required  U+ + + + may be oxidized to U + ~ f + + + " f and dissolved in sodium  carbonate, leaving aluminum as hydroxide. Metallic uranium  would then be obtained by reduction of the uranate as in (a)  (above) followed by reactions parallel to (b) (c) and (d).   Chemistry of the other transuranic elements. All of these  elements will be very similar to uranium since they apparently form  part of a second rare earth series, although it seems that the chem-  ical properties in this series vary more than in the first. Seaborg  points out that the +3 valence becomes more important with in-  creasing atomic numbers but no positive statements about any of  the compounds of these metals have been forthcoming. Judging  from the decreasing atomic volume it seems possible that the later  elements may show an increased tendency to anion formation.   If the behavior of the first rare earth series is a reliable guide,  the physical properties of these elements should not differ much  from those of uranium. They should be dense metals (density  18+), resembling iron in appearance and readily tarnished in the  air, have melting points in the neighborhood of 11SOC 04 and boil-  ing points of the order of 3000 C.   * Smyth (2.27) gives the melting point of uranium metal as 1150 C in  contrast to the higher value usually quoted.     CHAPTER 14   POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES   Foreseeable uses. It is interesting to discuss the predictable  potentialities of our new knowledge. Just as fission it-  self is one of the unforeseen results of nuclear physics, so it can  be expected that the most important potentialities of fission are not  yet revealed. This is particularly true since the fundamental  knowledge of the present is not yet assembled or available. The  predictable uses, however, are so varied and important as to consti-  tute an immediate challenge for their earliest and widest utilization.   One way of looking at the currently useful techniques would  be to classify them according to their applicability to research, com-  merce and war. Our approach will be in this order of importance.  The uses in scientific research are the most immediate, the most  obvious and the most interesting. Commercial applications are  less certain and so strongly dependent upon economic and political  conditions that they are not amenable to simple evaluation. Much  recent development has been applied to war use, the results of  which are well known.   The primary achievement of nuclear engineers is the produc-  tion of enormous numbers of slow neutrons by the construction of  normal uranium piles. No less difficult, yet less spectacular, is the  ability to separate or concentrate isotopes on a large scale. We  shall first look into the potentialities of large scale isotope separa-  tion.   Increase of available nuclei. The ability to change the natural  relative concentration of isotopes of various elements increases the  number of nuclei available for study and use. Heretofore, nuclear  physicists have been limited to the approximately ninety-two natur-  ally occurring mixtures which make up the normal elements. With  the successful application of isotope concentration or separation  methods to these elements, we can expect a large number of the  known 274 stable isotopes to be made available in concentrated or  pure form. These isolated nuclei can be useful both as objects of  nuclear investigation and as stable isotope tracers. The methods  described in chapter 12 should also prove useful for concentrating  artificially produced nuclei when chemical methods do not suffice;  in some cases chemical compounds are most easily separated by  these methods.   234     POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 2a5   The magnetic separators or high intensity mass spectrome-  ters used at Oak Ridge can probably separate large quantities of  isotopes of elements which can be introduced into the ion source as  a gas. Presumably, the present arrangements are adapted to col-  lecting the lighter of several isotopes and have a resolving power  of the order of approximately one in eighty (since they must sep-  arate mass 235 from 238). It should also not be difficult to col-  lect the heavier of several isotopes. The problems of making trie  ions stick in the collector have been solved for substances like po- tassium, 95 rubidium and lithium and have, no doubt, been solved  for uranium. Consequently, the collecting problem may not be  serious. Under these assumptions, most isotopes can probably be  isolated in quantities sufficient for tracer work and nuclear re-  search. Chemical exchange reactions in a counter current flow  apparatus have been used to produce concentrations of the useful  isotopes C 13 , N 15 , O 18 and S 34 . 96 These methods yield about  one gram per day of the concentrated isotope and cost about fifteen  dollars per gram for labor and chemicals. Gaseous thermal diffu-  sion is conveniently used to concentrate C 13 at the rate of milli-  grams per day at an approximate cost of two hundred dollars per  gram according to Urey. A more recent large scale installation  produces C 13 at forty dollars per gram. 97 The large scale gaseous  diffusion method and liquid thermal diffusion method developed at  Oak Ridge for concentrating U 235 in uranium hexafluoride may  prove applicable to other isotopes. The liquid thermal diffusion  plant is described by Condon 98 as relatively expensive to run due  to the enormous consumption of steam for heating. The gas diffu-  sion method may be more promising and possibly can be used with-  out much adaptation for methane, oxygen, nitrogen and others.   The principal nuclear physics measurements on separated nu-  clei which should yield interesting information are: determination  of mass, spin and magnetic moment (where not yet determined  because of too small concentration), transmutation data such as  thresholds, reaction energies, resonance energies, yields and cross  sections both with charged particles and with neutrons and gamma  rays. Separated isotopes should reduce the complexity and diffi-  culty of interpreting nuclear experiments, especially those dealing  with heavier elements, and should increase the amount of data  available for theoretical interpretation. Particular nuclei should   95 Hemmindinger and Smythe, P/M/S. Rev. 51, 1052 (1937).  98 H. C. Urey, J. App. Phys. 12, 270 (1941).   97 Science News Letter, Jan. 12, 1946.   98 E. U. Condon, Westinghouse Engineer, November (1945).     236 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   be of especial interest for particular problems. Enrichment of  specific isotopes could increase the yields of the transmutations de-  rived therefrom. Enrichment of He 3 in ordinary helium would  provide a valuable primary nucleus for study and possibly for use  as a bombarding particle. The measurement of the magnetic mo-  ment of conjugate pairs of nuclei should be interesting. Values  for such a pair as He 3 and H 3 would aid theoretical investigations  according to Sachs (private communication).   Spectroscopic studies would be aided and simplified by use  of separated nuclei since the isotope shift would be eliminated.  Mass Spectroscopic examination of concentrated isotopes might re-  veal stable isotopes previously missed because of their rarity. The  existence of such stable isotopes as 2?Co 57 ,53l 129 and csCs 135 could  be checked in concentrated samples. The I and Cs isotopes should  be either long-lived products of fission chains, or stable and rare ;  the existence of Co 57 has been reported but not confirmed.   Stable isotope tracer production. The most important con-  tribution that nuclear physics has made to science in general is the  technique of "tracers." The course of a chosen element or mole-  cule can be traced through the most complicated chemical or physi-  ological reaction by the use of "spy" atoms which reveal their pres-  ence by their radioactivity or by their difference in mass. Radio-  active tracers have heretofore been the most popular. The detect*  ing apparatus for measuring radioactive radiations (Geiger count-  ers and recording circuits) is fairly simple and usually easy to use.  The dilutions allowable with radioactive tracers is quite large  since the detection is quite sensitive. But the major disadvantage  is that the ionizing radiation from the radioactive isotopes must be  kept below a level which disturbs the process investigated ; thus the  number of tracer atoms usable is often limited. Furthermore,  only radioactive isotopes of long half-life and appreciable energy  emission are convenient for practical use.   Stable isotopes have also been used for tracing. If the normal  ratio of isotopes in an element is altered by concentration or sep-  arafion of isotopes, this concentrated sample can be traced by the  use of a mass spectrometer as detector. Heretofore, the paucity  of supply and the few isotopes available has limited the use of stable  isotope tracers. If these conditions are remedied by the large scale  concentration of many isotopes, stable isotopes will take their place  with radioactive tracers as a powerful tool of research. Their ad-  vantages are obvious : The stable isotopes give off no radiations to  be guarded against. Because of their stability, the tracer experi-  ments do not have to be hurried or corrected for half-lives.

The main  disadvantage is that the allowable dilution is generally smaller than  for radioactive tracers. Dilutions from about 1000 to 100,000  are possible with present mass spectrometric accuracies. The di-  lution allowable is approximately the reciprocal of the product of  the relative accuracy of the mass spectrometer times the normal  abundance of the tracer isotope. This assumes that the tracer  isotope is initially separated completely. The measuring equip-  ment (mass spectrometer) is more expensive than a counter sys-  tem and the sample has to be in the form of a gas. Stable isotopes  are of particular importance when suitable radioactive tracers are  absent. The stable isotopes C 13 , O 18 , N 15 , D 2 and S 34 have already  been used as tracers." Table 22-23 is a list of possible stable iso-  tope tracers. The asterisks indicate that these elements have been  traced in actual experiments either by radioactive or stable isotopes.  Previous tracer work has, of course, been influenced by the avail-  ability of tracers and of detecting equipment, consequently, 'we can  expect many more elements to be used if the tracers become avail-  able. The wide range of problems which have already been at-     Applied Nuclear Physics Conference, J. App. Phys. 12, 259 (1941).     POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 239   tacked with tracers is indicated in the reports given at the Applied  Nuclear Physics Conference in 1941 , 1   Concentration of radioactive isotop.es. Long-lived radioactive  isotopes can also be concentrated or separated by isotope separation  methods. Concentration often can be accomplished by chemical  methods but usually only with carriers which yield a mixture of the  radioactive isotope with the normal isotopes of the element. Iso-  tope separation methods will provide concentrations sufficient for  determination of mass number and possibly for measurement of  other nuclear data such as spin, magnetic moment, transmutation,  absorption and scattering data. This should be of importance in  several current problems. The interpretation of beta decay would  be aided by a knowledge of the spin of the nucleus before and after  the beta emission. Precision mass spectrometers can almost sep-  arate isomers. H 3 is a radioactive element which is of interest  because of its simple composition ; its concentration should enable  it to be studied in appreciable detail. By concentration and mass  analysis, many transmutation schemes leading to stable isotopes  may be checked. Radioactive isotopes can also be detected or  analyzed in a mass spectrometer. This technique should be es-  pecially useful for low energy, long-lived activities and may rival  counters for detecting atoms such as H 3 , Be 10 , C 14 etc.   Enormous supply of neutrons. As we have mentioned be-  fore, the most striking achievement of nuclear engineering has been  the production of such enormous numbers of neutrons as exist in  piles. In order to utilize these neutron densities, it seems prefer-  able to construct small, enriched, heavy water piles (page 167).  Such a pile with its shielding can conveniently occupy a room of  ordinary size. Extra shielding would be provided if the pile were  buried, so that if it gets out of control protection will be afforded  from the extra intense burst of neutrons. The neutron exposures  can be made by lowering material into the pile to be irradiated or  by using a channel to pipe the neutrons out. The total production  of fast neutrons can be expected to be 10 16 neutrons per sec for a  100 kw pile whose critical size may be less than 1 cubic meter.  When these neutrons are slowed down, densities of 10 10 per cc per  second will be probable. Not all of these neutrons can be used,  however. Dependent on the self-replenishment of the pile and the  efficiency with which it runs (i.e. low losses to moderator, cooling,  escape, etc.), anywhere from 0.01 to V2 f ^ e neutrons will be  available (page 168). For short exposures, however, much higher  fractions can be utilized. If the pile is over-built, so that large  amounts of boron are needed to control it, the boron can be re-  1 J. App. Phys. 12, 296 (1941).     240 NUCLEAE FISSION AND ATOMIC ENEEGY   moved as an equivalent absorber is inserted. This control is made  easy by the lag due to the delayed neutrons.   In order to realize the enormity of these neutron intensities  we may compare them with the production of neutrons by cyclo-  trons. The Berkeley cyclotron, using 100 microamps of 16 Mev  deuterons on beryllium, gives a neutron production of about 10 12  neutrons per second. 2 In this comparison then, the pile produces  10,000 times as many neutrons as a cyclotron. The cyclotron pro-  duces a beam of fast neutrons approximately four times as intense  in the forward direction as the average value given above. The  fast neutron beam of a pile is a little harder to predict ; it certainly  has a smaller average neutron energy. In intensity, however, the  advantage is possibly still with the pile. In addition, piles are sim-  pler to construct, to operate and to maintain. Their reliability is  emphasized by Smyth (8.28).   Neutron beams. There are several fields of usefulness of in-  tense slow neutron beams from piles. In the first place they will  provide strong neutron sources for purely nuclear experiments,  such as neutron absorption, studies of nuclear resonances, study  of neutron induced radioactivities, measurements of nuclear scat-  tering of neutrons and measurement of the neutron magnetic mo-  ment. The large intensities will make it easy to carefully define  the beam geometrically and to select neutron velocities exactly by  a mechanical shutter and time of flight technique. The "cold" neu-  trons mentioned by Smyth (8.31) will afford a useful source of  longer wave length neutrons. Smyth (8.29) mentions that com-  parative neutron absorption measurements can be readily made by  observing the change in control bars (cadmium-iron) necessary to  compensate for the introduction into the pile of a fixed amount of  a particular substance.   Short pulses of neutrons produced by mechanically assembling  and disassembling two subcritical masses of U 235 or plutonium  (see page 178) should provide a means of achieving very high neu-  tron intensities. These pulses might also be useful in neutron ex-  periments utilizing "time of flight" techniques.   Neutron beams will be useful for study of crystal lattices by  transmission measurements. Order-disorder transitions, 8 crys-  tal structure transitions and possibly Curie transitions can be in-  vestigated by neutron scattering. Bloch 4 has suggested that  neutron beams will have two uses in the study of slow neutron scat-  tering in ferromagnetic substances. The first is in the determina-   2 J.

POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 241   tion of a "magnetic form factor" by the dependence of scattering  on angle and energy. This will aid in clarifying the role of valency  electrons in ferromagnetism. The second group of experiments  deal with the magnetic scattering near magnetic saturation. This  scattering should furnish information about the relation between  the details of the ferromagnetic substance and magnetic saturation.   Intense neutron or gamma radiation may also "catalyze" In-  dustrially important or interesting chemical reactions. These ra-  diations are known to cause changes in the electrical resistance,  elasticity and heat conductivity of various materials (Smyth 7.24).   Bethe 5 has stated that piles will provide powerful sources  of neutrons at a more constant rate than cyclotrons. He suggested  that these large intensities of neutrons might make it more likely to  detect neutrinos. He also pointed out the possibilities for research  of neutron diffraction experiments in view of such large intensities.  Using crystal diffraction, it may be possible to achieve monochro-  matic beams of neutrons, to investigate crystal structure, to locate  hydrogen atoms (or preferably deuterium atoms) in crystals and to  observe total reflection of neutrons by crystals.   Another important use for neutron beams is in cancer therapy  and the study of physiological effects of neutrons. Fast neutrons  have already been found to give encouraging results in cancer  treatment 6 and small "piles" should be entirely adequate for such  therapy. Slow neutron beams also have been considered. 7 Re-  cent advances in the technique of localization of lithiated dyes in  tumor tissue 8 hold promise of early clinical trial. The slow  neutrons are expected to be selectively absorbed by the lithium and  to release energy in the tumor region without appreciable effects  elsewhere.   Neutron produced radioactive tracers. One of the most im-  portant uses of piles is the production of new nuclei. This is, of  course, the chief use to which they have already been put i.e., the  production of plutonium. We shall treat the consequences of this  later. Here we wish to point out that this plutonium production is  accomplished by the absorption in U 238 of approximately one neu-  tron from every fission. If our purpose is to produce other nuclei  than plutonium we can, in theory, manufacture any other neutron     * H. A. Bethe, "Scientific Aspects of Nuclear Energy u , Bull. Am. Phys.

In  practice this yield is hard to reach unless the pile is specifically  designed for this single purpose. A multi-purpose pile will prob-  ably be close to self replenishing so that only about one hundredth  of the neutrons produced by fission will be available for capture by  added substances. One neutron goes to fission U 285 , U 233 or Pu  making the pile self sustaining, and one produces Pu or U 238 to  make the pile self perpetuating. The remaining 0.3 of a neutron  goes primarily into losses by absorption in cooler etc., leaving a  small fraction available for use. Even then the number of neu-  trons absorbed depends upon the density of pile neutrons (slow  neutrons considered primarily), the absorption coefficient and the  number of nuclei added. We may, however, estimate the order  of magnitude of yields by multiplying cyclotron yields by  10 4 (~10 ie /10 12 ) for a self sustaining but not self replenishing  pile of 100 kw, or by 10 2 for a self sustaining and self replenishing  pile or one used to make plutonium, also lOOkw. This is prob-  ably a good comparison for slow neutrons since the volume in  which slow neutrons are produced in a cyclotron is similar to the  volume of an enriched heavy water pile. The comparison for the  Hanford pile is probably of a similar order of magnitude for al-  though the total neutron production is much larger, the volume is  also larger.   Table 24 lists slow neutron produced radioactive nuclei of  long half-life suitable for tracers. The radioactive isotope is given in  the first column ; the second column gives the half-life. (Some half-  lives of a few hours are included for their interest.) The third  column gives the maximum energy radioactive particle emitted and  its energy. The fourth column lists the maximum gamma ray  energy emitted where known. The next column gives the slow  neutron capture cross section for the stable isotope of one less  mass number than the radioactive isotope, (except for C 14 which is  produced from N 14 by a (n,p) reaction and element 43, Rh 105 ,  I 181 , Ag m , Po 210 , Pa 238 and Np 239 which are derived from radio-  active elements in turn produced by neutron capture). Column  six gives a few reported yields per hour in millicuries from the  Berkeley cyclotron (one curie is an amount of radioactive sub-  stance which decays at a rate of 3.7 XlO 10 disintegrations per sec-  ond). The more important of these radioactive isotopes are prob-  ably C 14 , Na 24 , P 32 , K 42 , Br 82 and I 131 since they have already been  used in many tracer experiments. The variety of problems which     POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 248   can be investigated with tracer techniques, however, will eventu-  ally encompass all the available isotopes.   Yields of radioactive materials. In order to estimate the  yields which might be achieved by practical piles we shall make a  few arbitrary assumptions. Consider an enriched heavy water pile  with a size of approximately one cubic meter. If this is run at  100 kw from U 235 , Pu or U 233 so that it is not self replenishing,  then the neutrons available for capture to make radioactive sub-  stances will be approximately 10 16 neutrons per second or 10 10  neutrons per second per cc. If we insert 10 liters of the substance  to be irradiated into the pile without changing the neutron distribu-  tion then we can estimate the yields of radioactive material. The  dimensions of the containers in which the material is irradiated  must, of course, be less than the mean free path of the thermal neu-  trons for capture in the substance and the effects of resonances  should be included. Neglecting resonances, the yield Y in milli-  curies per hour is   G d   Y = 10 6 millicuries per hour ,   T A   where G is the cross section for thermal capture (in units of 10~~ 24  cm 2 ) times the relative isotope abundance, d is the density  (gms/cc), T is the half-life in hours and A is the effective atomic  weight in atomic weight units. The results of such a calculation  for some radioactive isotopes of interest are presented in table 25.  It can be seen that in some cases the mean free path is small enough  to result in appreciable shielding if we irradiate as much as 10  liters of material. In these cases the yields are too high. Where  we can compare these estimates with observed cyclotron yields we  get fair agreement (considering the fact that we do not know the  exact disposition of material irradiated in the case of cyclotron  yields). Bromine yields have been reported as 1 millicurie per  hour for a large cyclotron with 100 microampere beam. We esti-  mated that a non-self replenishing pile yield might be 10 4 times  this or 10,000 millicuries per hour. Table 25 lists 1300 millicu-  ries per hour which is quite a reasonable agreement. The inac-  curacies in our calculation involve not only neglect of possible re-  sonances but also neglect of possible destruction of the radioactive  isotope by neutron capture. Obviously, yields vary markedly from  isotope to isotope, but in many cases are quite large ; usually of the  order of millicuries per hour.     244     NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY     G J3 v< ^ "en '    i      u *^*1 & to      cd 4-* *^ ^>.

As examples of such uses and the  amounts of tracers needed we will describe a few interesting appli-  cations.   Autoradiographic tracing is an extremely simple technique.  With neutrons, the radioactive tracer can sometimes be produced  in place by irradiating the whole system and then sectioning and  placing on a photographic plate. Such a procedure was found  useful in finding the distribution of aluminum present to a fraction  of a percent in silicon. 10 The slab was irradiated with fast neutrons  to produce sodium 24 from the aluminum in a (n,oc ) reaction. All  neutron induced activities in silicon have short half -lives and die out  in a day. Then, an autoradiograph exhibits the presence and distri-  bution of the aluminum. (Figure 50 shows such an autoradio-  graph.) Other materials can be detected with slow neutron bom-  bardment. 11 According to Hamilton, 12 it takes about 2X10 beta  particles per square cm to affect a photographic plate. If the ma-  terial is left on the plate for a time of the order of the half -life T   1   of the radioactive material, then it will take at least mi-   2T(sec)   crocuries per cubic millimeter concentration to produce an auto-  radiograph. In such experiments care must be taken to avoid the  "Russell" effect 13 which is a darkening of the photographic plate  exposed to freshly etched or ground surfaces of most metals.   In an extensive series of measurements of the self-diffusion  of zinc in single and poly crystals, Miller and Banks 14 used a total  of 0.01 of a microcurie of Zn 65 .   E. D.

Less than a microcurie of the 45 day silver isotope  was used in his investigations.   The use of radioactive materials in therapeutics often involves  specific elements which will selectively deposit in particular regions  and irradiate neoplasms. The selective deposition is traced first  by radioactive tracers. Then, additional amounts of the suitable  radioactive element are used to give appreciable radiation doses to  the regions involved. Phosphorus has been found to be selectively  absorbed in the nucleo protein fraction of transmitted leukernic  cells and consequently P 32 has been used in the treatment of leuke-  mia. 16 Strontium has been found to deposit in the bones and Sr 89 has been considered for irradiation of the skeleton. 17 Both these  materials can be produced in piles in quantities of the order of milli-  curies. Evans 18 gives a formula for estimating the total tissue  dose r in roentgens of a beta ray emitter of maximum beta ray  energy E in Mev and half-life T in days when used in internal ther-  apy as   r = 0.027 C E T   where C is the concentration of the radioactive isotope in microcn-  ries per kilogram of tissue. (C has to be related to the total amount  to be used, by the results of previous tracer experiments). Since  therapeutic doses are of the order of 10,000 roentgens, quantities  of the order of 1 to 10 millicuries of the radioactive isotope are  needed per patient.   Since carbon is such an importan element in organic and  physiological chemistry, C 14 is an especially desired tracer. Yet  table 25 indicates that it is hard to produce under the conditions  assumed. We may further consider the possibilities 01 securing  appreciable quantities. Smyth (8.43) mentions that the Clinton  pile was run at 800 Jew with air cooling and operated at about  150C. Since it requires about 10 4 grams of air per second to  keep such a pile down to 150C, we may estimate the amount of  air in the pile to be perhaps twenty times as much. If the air is  recirculated and CO 2 is extracted, we can estimate a yield of C 14 .  If we accept our estimate of 10 10 neutrons per cc per second as  applicable to the Clinton pile, we can estimate the production of  C 14 as perhaps 0.4 me/hour. Since this isotope has such a long  half-life it will be usable many times.   1B A. Langer, J. Chem. Phys. 10, 321 (1942).   u J. H. Lmvrence, Erf and Tuttle, J. App. Phys. 12, 333 (1941).   17 C.

POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 251   Production of radioactive sources. Some of these radioactive  substances should be particularly important for special purposes  such as sources of gamma rays, electrons (monochromatic or con-  tinuous distribution in energy), positrons and alpha particles. The  producible quantities of these radioactive substances are so large  that these sources will constitute important and readily usable  tools for research.   Many of the radioactive substances listed in table 24 emit  gamma rays. While the intensities of these gamma rays are not  often given, they are sometimes as numerous as the beta rays.  Usually, when the energies are listed, the number of gamma rays  may be taken to be at least of the order of one tenth of the number  of disintegrations. The values of energy vary from 0.1 to 3.2  Mev. The highest energy Radium C gamma rays (the highest  energy "radium" rays), it may be recalled, are 1.76 and 2.2 Mev  and are 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, of the number of disintegrations.  Consequently, we can prepare radioactive sources of gamma rays  from the long-lived gamma emitters of table 24. The radioactive  isotopes Ag 108 , Sb 124 , Ta 182 and La 140 may be useful for this pur-  pose, but longer-lived substances would be more desirable and  may be found with further research. It seems possible to secure  curies of many of these isotopes "^equivalent to grams of radium).  Substitutes for radon as therapeutic gamma ray sources may be  found in Na 24 , K 42 and As 76 . It seems feasible to prepare these  in compact form by concentration with the Szilard-Chalmers meth-  od and perhaps plating on thin foils which are then wrapped up to  reduce size. Some of these radioactive isotopes may be used with  beryllium or deuterium to produce photo-neutrons of various en-  ergies. These should be useful as ready sources of monochromatic  neutrons. Monochromatic gamma ray sources of long life should  be useful as cheap and handy standard sources to calibrate count-  ers and other gamma ray detectors.   Beta ray sources should also have many uses. For example :  standards for calibrating ionization chambers, sources for demon-  strations, sources of positrons and sources of monochromatic in-  ternally converted electrons. Tl 206 in addition to Radium D+E  might prove useful as a calibrating standard source. Ge 71 is a  source of positrons which may have value in studies of positron  effects. The possibility of a system of positive and negative elec-  trons like the hydrogen atom may be studied with such sources 19  of positrons. Pool 20 gives a list of internally converted gamma   " A.

A curie of  electrons is almost 10~~ 8 amperes and might prove useful as a  source of electrons in scanning or transmission electron micro-  scopes, special electronic tubes, etc. The internal conversion co-  efficient has not been measured in many substances and conse-  quently more research will be necessary before it will be possible  to select suitable sources from tables of the radioactive substances.  It should also be possible to prepare sources of monochromatic  alpha particles. Polonium can be produced from bismuth by the  following reactions :   21     +1.17 Mev 22      5.298 Mev 23  +few gamma rays.   Polonium is a well known source of alpha rays without appreciable  gamma rays. It is used in calibrating ionization chambers, cloud  chambers and as a reference standard for range and Hp measure-  ments. It can also be used to produce neutrons by an (a, n) re-  action. A mixture of beryllium and polonium gives neutrons of 1 1  Mev maximum energy with many neutrons of less than 2 Mev. 24  One curie of radon mixed with beryllium produces about 2.5 XlO 4  neutrons per second and Be (Pooc, n) source gives somewhat less.  Production of Plutonium. The production of plutonium in  quantities of kilograms is the answer to the alchemists' fondest  dreams. It might be pointed out that this production is made  possible by the construction of enormous piles specifically designed  for plutonium production, and by the large resonance capture cross  section of uranium for neutrons initiating the series leading to the  Pu isotope. This enormous production of plutonium is at the ex-  pense of many otherwise desirable features. The pile obviously is  not self-replenishing and consequently produces plutonium at the  expense of both U 235 and U 238 . This process depletes the avail-  able supply of U 235 directly. Furthermore, the pile is water cooled  and consequently would be an inefficient source of the by-product   * Segre's chart.   83 B. D. Evans, p. 656, Medical Physics, ed. O.

Our sup-  ply of uranium has been estimated to last 200 years, but Smyth  (2.26) calls this optimistic. Other estimates are more pessimistic.  Katzin calculates that there is not enough uranium available to  supply all the power in the United States for one year. 25 Obvious-  ly, some policy of conservation and constructive use of available  supplies of uranium and thorium are imperative.   The production of radioactive fission products is one useful by-  product of the operation of a plutonium pile.

Table 26 lists a few long-lived  activities resulting from fission which might be useful as tracers  or sources of radiation.   In connection with the fast neutron chain reaction for which  plutonium has been used, some mention should be made of the pos-  sibility of enhancing the release of energy or, even further, of the  possibility that such a release of energy could not be controlled.  Since the temperatures and types of reactions involved are similar  to those occurring in the stars, we can utilize the considerations  summarized by Bethe. 26   The danger of an uncontrolled release of energy is primarily  due to the possibility of producing in the atmosphere a reaction  such as   7 N 14 +?N 14 >i 4 Si 28 4-y+29 mmu (milli mass units)   or >i 2 Mg++19 mmu   At a temperature reached by a fast neutron induced chain reaction,  the probability of such a reaction is estimated by Bethe's equation 7.  Assuming a temperature of T=50-10 6 A, 27 and a density of 10~~ 8  gm/cm 2 we can calculate the number of reactions per gram per  second. The particle reaction is more probable than the gamma  emission reaction and can be calculated to occur at the rate of 10~ 80  per gram per second. Even at a pressure of 10 atmospheres  which may accompany a shock wave in the atmosphere, the reac-  tion rate is still 10~ 74 . This gives an energy release of 10~ 78 ergs  /gin/sec which obviously won't propagate the reaction. Conse-  quently, it seems impossible to achieve a chain reaction in the at-  mosphere at the estimated temperature of SO'10 6 A. 28   However, on examining Bethe's Table V for more probable  reactions, the D(d,n) reaction stands out as quite probable. That  it does not occur in the energy cycle in the sun is attributed to the  rarity of deuterium there. The rarity of deuterium on the earth  would also eliminate this reaction in naturally occurring relative  abundances. However, if pure deuterium or heavy water were  added around the fissionable material in a fast neutron induced  chain reaction, we can calculate the probability of the reaction:   !D 2 +!D 2 iHe*+ n 1 +3.5 mmu   and its energy release. At a temperature of 50 million degrees   * H. A. Bethe, Phys. Bev. 55, 434 (1938).   w P. Morrison, Hearings before the Special Committee on Atomic Energy,  United States Senate, Part 2, page 236, Dec. 5 (1945), testified that  the explosion created a glowing ball one third of a mile across with a  temperature about one hundred million degrees fahrenheit in the center.     POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUES 26   and using the experimentally determined level width of 3-10 5 ev,  the probability comes out 1.5-10 28 reactions per gm per sec. This  seems adequate to propagate the chain reaction. The deuterium  would be used up in 10~ 5 sec if the reaction goes to completion at  the same rate. The release of all the available energy gives 10 17  ergs per gm for deuterium. This compares with 2-10 20 ergs per  gm released by a typical fission reaction. Consequently, (assum-  ing ten percent efficiency) forty pounds of deuterium would double  the energy release of the fast neutron induced chain reaction. The  details of use, such as tamper, efficiency, deuterium compound, etc.  require much more detailed consideration. However, it does seem  feasible to add to a neutron induced fission chain reaction by a  thermally induced chain reaction with deuterium.   The use of the fast neutron chain reaction seems primarily  limited to war. As an explosive, the magnitude of the minimum  energy release is so large and the attendant production of radio-  active material so enormous that its use seems inadvisable for most  purposes. The digging of a water level Panama Canal or melting  the Polar ice cap would seem to be a wasteful and inefficient use  of the precious fissionable material.   "Atomic" power production. One of the tempting commer-  cial applications of fission techniques is the production of power.  Since the Hanford piles produce power at the rate of the Grand  Coulee Dam (Smyth, 6.41), the use of piles as large central power  stations is indicated. However, such installations will be most de-  sirable for regions far from water, coal and oil.   The use of self replenishing piles which need U 235 , U 288 or  Pu only to start it and which then uses U 238 or Th is possibly the  most economical way to run the power pile. From page 149 we  can estimate that a large pile may contain twenty-five tons of  uranium costing about $150,000. 29   The energy produced by the Hanford pile could not be effici-  ently used since the temperature is not very high. A much more  efficient conversion of this power would be achieved by running  the pile at a higher temperature. Smyth (6.43) mentions the pos-  sibility of using bismuth as a coolant and heat interchanger. Since   28 H. A. Bethe, Hearings before the Special Committee on Atomic Energy,  United States Senate, Part 2, page 224, Dec. 5 (1945), testified that  no temperature would ' ' ignite ' ' the earth J s atmosphere and no achieva-  ble temperature would cause nuclear chain reactions in either the at-  mosphere or ocean.   Vj Improved methods of production have reduced the cost of metal uranium  to $3 a pound according to a pamphlet on Atomic Energy by Robert E.  Marshak, Eldred C. Nelson and Leonard I. Schiff, published by the  University of New Mexico Press, March, 1946.     f 56 NUCLEAR FISSION AND ATOMIC ENERGY   bismuth is a liquid between 271 and 1450C, the pile could be  operated at an elevated temperature and provide efficient conver-  sion of heat to mechanical power.   On page 252, polonium was described as a product of expos-  ing bismuth to neutrons. Estimating a minimum mass of bismuth  for cooling 10 6 kw as 10 8 gins/sec or 10 10 gms in the pile, we can  estimate the rate of production of Po 210 from a pile as 4-10 20  atoms per day or 0.1 gm. If this rate of production could be in-  creased (by increasing the amount of coolant, etc.), the polonium  itself could be used as an independent small power source. Since  polonium emits 5.3 Mev alpha particles, it supplies power at the  rate of 72 horse power per pound. Furthermore, since it does not  emit appreciable gamma rays, the shielding necessary to protect in-  dividuals is nominal. However, such a power source could not be  turned on or off and consequently would be useful only for contin-  uously used special purpose power plants. The polonium has a  half-life of 140 days and could therefore be separated from the end  product, lead, and used again. Undoubtedly, piles specially con-  structed for polonium production would yield adequate amounts of  polonium if its use proved desirable.   Considered purely as a fuel, uranium metal costing $20 a  pound compares favorably with. all other fuels for producing pow-  er. Costs of installation, upkeep and depreciation are difficult to  estimate, however, and much development is necessary for eco-  nomic use of fission as a power source.   Impress of fission on physics. The most important impress  on physics of fission work will be primarily in the number of phy-  sicists trained in nuclear techniques, the impetus and support given  to nuclear research and the large number of tools of research de-  veloped and commercially manufactured. Such developments as  mass spectroscopic analysis, leak hunting with a helium mass spec-  trometer, counting circuits which collect and record the electron  pulse from ionizing particles in an ionization chamber, convenient  vacuum gauges such as the Phillips ionization gauge, neutron  counters utilizing thin films of U 235 for slow neutrons and U 238 for  fast neutrons, and numerous other experimental and theoretical  techniques will be of considerable use in nuclear physics. The in-  creased medical knowledge of the dangers of radiations will also  be of the utmost importance to nuclear science when it is released.   Fission has not affected fundamental knowledge appreciably.  In fact, it may not long remain the most important field of nuclear  research. The swing to the ultra-nuclear field of 100 Mev energy  has already begun. The development of electron acceleration     POTENTIALITIES OF FISSION TECHNIQUE 257   techniques will certainly profit from physicists' acquaintance with  large scale and commercial development. Consequently, although  iission research may not have revealed the fundamentals of nuclear  forces, it may benefit the future of such research.   The impress of fission on the nation and the world is more  difficult to assess. The most important aspect concerning physi-  cists has been the universality with which the physicists, especially  the atomic physicists, have awakened to the serious failure of pol-  itical institutions to provide for the impact of newly discovered  scientific facts. It is the physicists' faith that it is good to discover  scientific facts. This is not yet the faith of our country nor the  world. This conflict can be only partially resolved by the activi-  ties of the newly formed Federation of American Scientists. Ob-  viously, we face a critical situation because of the threat of contin-  ued world conflict now made suicidal by the atom bomb. Conse-  quently, the major effort at present must be to achieve some stable  or developing world control for the atom bomb and, of course, for  all war.   However, physicists must still remember that they are prim-  arily scientists. If physicists believe that it is good to uncover  scientific fact, then they must strive to keep conditions under which  research is carried on as conducive as possible to intelligent action.  It is only if research is absolutely unhampered by any restriction  that it is truly scientific. It must not be the continuing responsi-  bility of physicists as scientists to provide for the moral and intelli-  gent use of scientific fact. It is the responsibility of physicists to  pursue research in as an intelligent and scientific fashion as possi-  ble and to support other scientific endeavors by the most wide-  spread and efficient dissemination of knowledge.
