Note : One gram of hydrogen releases 6.2 x 1010 J of energy where as one gram of coal produces 33 KJ of energy.
Nuclear fusion takes place at a very high temperature which is equal to 4 x 106 oC. Fusion is the combination of two like light nuclei and the nuclei must have sufficiently high kinetic energy to overcome the force of repulsion between the like nuclei. Therefore, for fusion reactions to occur, the two hydrogen nuclei have to collide at very high speeds, which is possible only at a very high temperature, equal to 4 x 106 oC. Hence a fusion reaction is also known as thermonuclear reaction.
Fusion releases more energy than fission because the mass lost during fusion is more than that lost during fission.
One of the practical application of nuclear fusion is hydrogen bomb.

The basic principle involved in the preparation of hydrogen bomb is nuclear fusion. A nuclear fission reaction initiates the fusion reaction. In a hydrogen bomb the set up for fission reaction is surrounded by a mixture of deuterium (21H) and lithium. The nuclear fission reaction liberates heat energy and neutrons. The heat energy released creates a temperature equal to 4 x 106 oC and the neutrons are used for converting 63Li to tritium. The reactions taking place in a hydrogen bomb is as follows:
