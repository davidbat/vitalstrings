The          workshop was aimed at evaluating whether special features          associated with flexible social organization, such as          fission-fusion societies, have been a major factor in the          evolution of advanced cognitive abilities. Such social          flexibility is due to community members having the option of          associating in subgroups of different size and composition.          In the extreme cases, individuals belonging to the same          community are rarely all together, but spend most of the          time in temporary subgroups that frequently merge (fusion)          and split (fission) again with different composition.          Although such flexible social organization is rare among          primates, it is characteristic of human societies and the          closely related chimpanzees and bonobos.
The          workshop was held immediately following the 20th Congress of          the International Primatological Society (Turin, Italy,          23-28 August 2004) in which we held a symposium on          "Fission-Fusion Societies". At the symposium, speakers gave          state-of-the-art reviews of key aspects of the          fission-fusion organization of various primate and          non-primate species contrasting them with species living in          more cohesive groups. This comparative perspective set the          stage for examining whether fission-fusion societies are          special with respect to a number of features. The          post-symposium workshop provided the ideal situation for a          well-structured follow-up discussion forum on various topics          raised at the symposium among 20 highly qualified          scientists.
The          format of the workshop was a combination of a roundtable          session, ad-hoc small-group discussion sessions, and plenary          reporting sessions. We started with a roundtable discussion          on definitions of fission-fusion social systems and the          scope of using such terminology. We then formed four small          groups of 4-6 individuals each. Each group focused on a          critical topic and integrated the relevant issues raised          during the symposium. The composition of the small groups          capitalized on the participants' variety of expertise and          encouraged a broad comparative perspective. Each small          discussion group focused on one of the following topics          contrasting flexible social systems with less fluid          systems:
-          Socio-ecological causes and consequences
-          The role of communication in the regulation of social          relationships
-          Cognitive implications at the proximate level
-          Cognitive evolution associated with fission-fusion          patterns.
The          plenary sessions allowed all participants to exchange views          on the topics previously discussed during the small-group          discussion sessions. A new round of small-group sessions          incorporated the various points made during the plenary          sessions, which were then summarized in working documents          and presented in a final plenary session.
One          main outcome of the workshop was the consensus for a broader          use of the term 'fission-fusion', not just as a label of a particular social organization, but as a characteristic of          social organization that varies along a complex continuum          from highly cohesive to highly fluid with stable or flexible          membership. We believe that the workshop was instrumental in          initiating new research programs for detailed investigations          on the degree of spatial and social fluidity in a variety of          species.
A          second main outcome was the emphasis on the importance of          research in the regulation of social relationships, which          can be particularly challenging in highly fluid groups and          impose specific cognitive demands. Apart from identifying          the need for research programs on the proximate cognitive          mechanisms to cope with such challenges, conference          participants agreed that the study of the differences and          similarities across species displaying different degrees of          flexible social organizations can elucidate the critical          factors underlying the evolutionary processes at the basis          of fission-fusion patterns, including those involving our          own ancestors.
A          third main outcome was the realization that a broad          perspective is needed for comparative tests of the relative          complexity and cognitive requirements of the strategies used          to deal with the challenges of high degree of spatial and          social fluidity. In this respect, the conference offered a          first opportunity to incorporate complementary knowledge          from primate and non-primate species for which the          similarities in social organization cannot be attributed to          common ancestry. The conference specifically contributed to          the current debate about potential cognitive differences between monkeys and apes, which is central to theories of          human cognitive evolution.
The          workshop was a great success. Everything ran smoothly,          thanks to the great local organization. Several participants          reported that it was the most successful conference of this          type they ever attended. The work stemming from the          small-group discussion sessions was so productive that it          was published as an article in Current Anthropology.
