What                the Difference between Asexual and Sexual Reproduction?
What            is asexual reproduction?
Asexual            reproduction is reproduction without sex. In this form of reproduction,            a single organism or cell makes a copy of itself. The genes of the original            and its copy will be the same, except for rare mutations. They are clones.            The main process of asexual reproduction is mitosis. This type of reproduction            is common among some single-cell organisms, for example, amoeba. Many            plants also reproduce asexually.
Types            of Asexual Reproduction
Binary fission
A cell            splitting and becoming two cells (overview)Some organisms like bacteria            reproduce using binary fission. They split in two, so one bacterium            becomes two bacteria. This always leads to daughter cells, and the offspring            will be identical to the parent.
 
Binary                  fission is a method of asexual reproduction. It is common in prokaryotes.                  A living cell divides into two cells. The two cells should be                  identical, but since mutation can occur, there might be slight                  differences. This process is basically when a prokaryotic organism                  divides into two parts. The parent cell divides to give rise to                  two daughter cells, the daughter cells then each develop into                  individual parent cells and give rise to two more daughter cells                  EACH, and so on and so forth.

Budding
Budding                is similar to binary fission, but it is used by plants and some                animals, which cannot simply split in half as bacteria can. It is                when a small part of a plant or animal breaks off and then, while                they are separated from their "mother", they start to grow until                both the "parent" and the "offspring" are the same size and both                are capable of budding again. This may happen many more times.
 
Spores
Fungi            (for example, mushrooms) produce spores, which may be asexual or sexual.            The asexual spores have the genetic material inside, which allows them            to make a whole new organism identical to its parent.
What            is sexual reproduction?
Sexual            reproduction is a way of reproduction of some animals and plants. Some            protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce            sexually have two different sexes: male and female.
Offspring            is made by a cell from the male and a cell of the female. Different            steps are involved in the process.
The            cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they            are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one            set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process            of cell division called meiosis. During meiosis, crossing over            occurs. This makes it possible to get recombination. This has various            consequences. It means, for example, that all the children of two parents            are not identical, except in the rare case where they developed from            the same fertilized egg.
The            second step is called fertilization. In it, the two cells merge into            one. This restores the diploid state.
Fertilization is what happens when a female's                  ovum (or "egg") joins together with a male's sperm and                  they form a zygote.
Fertilization is also called conception. In humans,                  biologists call a fertilized egg a zygote.

A zygote is the fertilized cell that will grow into a baby animal. When a female's            ovum and a male's sperm cell become one, this cell is called the zygote. The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an embryo. A zygote is the            cell that results from fertilization. A zygote is synthesized from the            union of two gametes, and constitutes the first stage in a organism's            development. Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid            cells, the ovum and the sperm cells, which make a diploid cell. Diploid            cells have copies of parent chromosome or DNA.
Some            animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby.            The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's birth is called            pregnancy. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but            lay an egg. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and the            baby animal hatches. The            fertilized egg now starts to divide and produce the embryo.
It is called an embryo from 3-8            weeks (the embryonic period.) Then after 8 weeks, it is called a fetus.            If it continues to grow normally it can eventually become a baby.
Terms
Gonads- specialized sex organs where gametes are formed. In the male, the            gonad is the testes, while in the female, the gonad is the ovaries.
Diploid            cells- (indicated by 2n) have two homologous copies of each chromosome,            usually one from the mother and one from the father.
Haploid cells -The haploid number (n) is the number of chromosomes in a            gamete.
Gametes -- specialized sex cells formed in gonads by gametogenesis. The male            gamete is the sperm, and the female is ovum(ova pl) or egg.
Zygote - produced by fertilization between two haploid cells, the ovum            and the sperm cells, which make a diploid cell.
