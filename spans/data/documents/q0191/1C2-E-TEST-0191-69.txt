Please tell me the difference between Nuclear Fission Reaction And Fusion Reation.
Thanks
ANSWER: In nuclear fission, an atom such as U-235 or PU-239, when hit by a neutron, splits into pieces.  The sum of the masses of the pieces is less than the mass of the original atom.  The difference in mass shows up as energy according to Einstein's equation, E = mc^2.  In nuclear fusion, atoms are combined to produce a new atom.  This is the process occuring in our sun which produces the energy we receive from the sun.  There, 4 hydrogen atoms combine to form 1 helium atom.  The mass of the helium atom is less than the mass of the 4 hydrogen atoms and this mass difference is converted into energy.  A nuclear reactor uses fission to produce heat energy that can be used to generate electricity.  Since the fusion reaction only occurs at temperatures of 100 million degrees, we have not been able to build a fusion reactor and may never be able to.

QUESTION: sorry sir, how mass differnece produce so much energy?
Please explain it.
Answer
That's just the way nature works.  When you burn a piece of wood to produce heat that's a chemical reaction combining carbon and oxygen.  No mass disappears there.  Nuclear reactions are different and can produce enormous amounts of energy.
Sorry if you can't understand Einstein's equation and realize that nuclear reactions can produce millions of times more energy than chemical reactions.  Since my average rating for over 1000 answers is 9.95, your rating isn't going to affect that much.
