Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction when the atom is splitinto smaller parts.
Like Binary Fission - this is when bacteria are split into 1then 2 then 4 then 8 then 16...etc...
Nuclear fusion is when two or more atomic nuclei fuse or join together, or "fuse", to form a single heavier nucleus. Hope this helps. ?
