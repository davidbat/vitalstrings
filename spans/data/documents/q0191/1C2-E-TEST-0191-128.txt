Early studies of radioactivity indicated that three different kinds of radiation were emitted, symbolized by the first three letters of the Greek alphabet
, �/i>, and
. With time, it became apparent that this classification scheme was much too simple. The emission of a negatively charged �/i>- particle, for example, is only one example of a family of radioactive transformations known as �/em>-decay. A fourth category, known as spontaneous fission, also had to be added to describe the process by which certain radioactive nuclides decompose into fragments of different weight.
Alpha decay is usually restricted to the heavier elements in the periodic table. (Only a handful of nuclides with atomic numbers less than 83 emit an
-particle.) The product of
-decay is easy to predict if we assume that both mass and charge are conserved in nuclear reactions. Alpha decay of the 238U "parent" nuclide, for example, produces 234Th as the "daughter" nuclide.
The sum of the mass numbers of the products (234 + 4) is equal to the mass number of the parent nuclide (238), and the sum of the charges on the products (90 + 2) is equal to the charge on the parent nuclide.
There are three different modes of beta decay:
electron (�/i>-) emission
electron capture
positron (�/i>+) emission
Electron (�/em>-) emission is literally the process in which an electron is ejected or emitted from the nucleus. When this happens, the charge on the nucleus increases by one. Electron (�/i>-) emitters are found throughout the periodic table, from the lightest elements (3H) to the heaviest (255Es). The product of �/i>--emission can be predicted by assuming that both mass number and charge are conserved in nuclear reactions. If 40K is a �/i>--emitter, for example, the product of this reaction must be 40Ca.
Once again the sum of the mass numbers of the products is equal to the mass number of the parent nuclide and the sum of the charge on the products is equal to the charge on the parent nuclide.
Nuclei can also decay by capturing one of the electrons that surround the nucleus. Electron capture leads to a decrease of one in the charge on the nucleus. The energy given off in this reaction is carried by an x-ray photon, which is represented by the symbol hv, where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency of the x-ray. The product of this reaction can be predicted, once again, by assuming that mass and charge are conserved.
The electron captured by the nucleus in this reaction is usually a 1s electron because electrons in this orbital are the closest to the nucleus.
A third form of beta decay is called positron (�sup>+) emission. The positron is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. It has the same mass as an electron, but the opposite charge. Positron (�/i>+) decay produces a daughter nuclide with one less positive charge on the nucleus than the parent.
Positrons have a very short life-time. They rapidly lose their kinetic energy as they pass through matter. As soon as they come to rest, they combine with an electron to form two
-ray photons in a matter-antimatter annihilation reaction.
Thus, although it is theoretically possible to observe a fourth mode of beta decay corresponding to the capture of a positron, this reaction does not occur in nature.
Note that in all three forms of �/i>-decay for the 40K nuclide the mass number of the parent and daughter nuclides are the same for electron emission, electron capture, and position emission. All three forms of �/i>-decay therefore interconvert isobars.
Gamma Emission
The daughter nuclides produced by
-decay or �/i>-decay are often obtained in an excited state. The excess energy associated with this excited state is released when the nucleus emits a photon in the
-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most of the time, the
-ray is emitted within 10-12 seconds after the
-particle or �/i>-particle. In some cases, gamma decay is delayed, and a short-lived, or metastable, nuclide is formed, which is identified by a small letter m written after the mass number. 60mCo, for example, is produced by the electron emission of 60Fe.
The metastable 60mCo nuclide has a half-life of 10.5 minutes. Since electromagnetic radiation carries neither charge nor mass, the product of
-ray emission by 60mCo is 60Co.
Spontaneous Fission
Nuclides with atomic numbers of 90 or more undergo a form of radioactive decay known as spontaneous fission in which the parent nucleus splits into a pair of smaller nuclei. The reaction is usually accompanied by the ejection of one or more neutrons.
For all but the very heaviest isotopes, spontaneous fission is a very slow reaction. Spontaneous fission of 238U, for example, is almost two million times slower than the rate at which this nuclide undergoes
-decay.

Neutron-Rich Versus Neutron-Poor Nuclides
In 1934 Enrico Fermi proposed a theory that explained the three forms of beta decay . He argued that a neutron could decay to form a proton by emitting an electron. A proton, on the other hand, could be transformed into a neutron by two pathways. It can capture an electron or it can emit a positron. Electron emission therefore leads to an increase in the atomic number of the nucleus.
Both electron capture and positron emission, on the other hand, result in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus.
A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for all of the stable naturally occurring isotopes is shown in the figure below. Several conclusions can be drawn from this plot.
A graph of the number of neutrons versus the number of     protons for all stable naturally occurring nuclei. Nuclei that lie to the right of this     band of stability are neutron poor; nuclei to the left of the band are     neutron-rich. The solid line represents a neutron to proton ratio of 1:1.
The stable nuclides lie in a very narrow band of       neutron-to-proton ratios.
The ratio of neutrons to protons in stable nuclides       gradually increases as the number of protons in the nucleus increases.
Light nuclides, such as 12C, contain about the       same number of neutrons and protons. Heavy nuclides, such as 238U, contain up       to 1.6 times as many neutrons as protons.
There are no stable nuclides with atomic numbers larger       than 83.
This narrow band of stable nuclei is surrounded by a sea of       instability.
Nuclei that lie above this line have too many neutrons and       are therefore neutron-rich.
Nuclei that lie below this line don't have enough neutrons       and are therefore neutron-poor.
The most likely mode of decay for a neutron-rich nucleus is one that converts a neutron into a proton. Every neutron-rich radioactive isotope with an atomic number smaller 83 decays by electron (�/i>-) emission. 14C, 32P, and 35S, for example, are all neutron-rich nuclei that decay by the emission of an electron.
Neutron-poor nuclides decay by modes that convert a proton into a neutron. Neutron-poor nuclides with atomic numbers less than 83 tend to decay by either electron capture or positron emission. Many of these nuclides decay by both routes, but positron emission is more often observed in the lighter nuclides, such as 22Na.
Electron capture is more common among heavier nuclides, such as 125I, because the 1s electrons are held closer to the nucleus of an atom as the charge on the nucleus increases.
A third mode of decay is observed in neutron-poor nuclides that have atomic numbers larger than 83. Although it is not obvious at first,
-decay increases the ratio of neutrons to protons. Consider what happens during the
-decay of 238U, for example.
The parent nuclide (238U) in this reaction has 92 protons and 146 neutrons, which means that the neutron-to-proton ratio is 1.587. The daughter nuclide (234Th) has 90 protons and 144 neutrons, so its neutron-to-proton ratio is 1.600. The daughter nuclide is therefore slightly less likely to be neutron-poor, as shown in the figure below.
