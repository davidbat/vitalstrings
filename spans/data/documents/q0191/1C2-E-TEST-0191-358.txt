Hello
what is the difference between Elite Remy EZ fusion and EZ tips ?
EZ-Fusion = Fusion bond. EZ-Tips = stick hair or shoelace tip. EZ-Fusion can be heated and rolled into stick hair and is a thicker strand. Better value if you want to roll the tips.
Can i use EZ fusion for shrinkies ?
Absolutely. No gooey mess.
What is the difference between sily straight and natural body hair ?
Silky straight is processed to be straight. Natural body has a slight wave pattern and more body.
what does natural body look like ?
Very slight wave.
