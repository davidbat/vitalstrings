Absolute          risk: the proportion of a population          expected to get a disease over a specified time period. See also risk , relative risk .
Absorbed          dose: the amount of energy deposited          by ionizing radiation in a unit mass          of tissue. It is expressed in units of joule per kilogram (J/kg), and          called “ gray ” (Gy). For more information,          see “ Primer on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Activity          (radioactivity): the rate of decay of radioactive material expressed          as the number of atoms breaking down per second measured in units called becquerels or curies .
Acute              exposure: an exposure to radiation that occurred in a matter              of minutes rather than in longer, continuing exposure over a period              of time. See also chronic exposure , exposure , fractionated              exposure .
Acute          Radiation Syndrome (ARS): a serious illness          caused by receiving a dose greater than 75 rads of          penetrating radiation to the body in a short time (usually minutes). The          earliest symptoms are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hair loss,          bleeding, swelling of the mouth and throat, and general loss of energy          may follow. If the exposure has been approximately 1,000 rads or more,          death may occur within 2 – 4 weeks. For more information, see CDC’s          fact sheet “Acute Radiation Syndrome” at emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ars.asp .
Air          burst: a nuclear weapon explosion that          is high enough in the air to keep the fireball from touching the ground.          Because the fireball does not reach the ground and does not pick up any          surface material, the radioactivity in the fallout from an air burst is relatively insignificant compared with a surface          burst . For more information, see Chapter 2 of CDC’s Fallout          Report at http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/falloutreport.pdf
.
Alpha          particle: the nucleus of a helium atom, made up of two neutrons and two protons with a charge of +2. Certain radioactive          nuclei emit alpha particles. Alpha particles generally carry more energy          than gamma or beta particles ,          and deposit that energy very quickly while passing through tissue. Alpha          particles can be stopped by a thin layer of light material, such as a          sheet of paper, and cannot penetrate the outer, dead layer of skin. Therefore,          they do not damage living tissue when outside the body. When alpha-emitting          atoms are inhaled or swallowed, however, they are especially damaging          because they transfer relatively large amounts of ionizing energy to living          cells. See also beta particle , gamma          ray , neutron , x-ray .
Ambient          air: the air that surrounds us.
Americium          (Am): a silvery metal; it is a man-made element whose isotopes Am-237 through Am-246 are all radioactive.          Am-241 is formed spontaneously by the beta decay of plutonium-241. Trace quantities of americium are widely used in smoke          detectors, and as neutron sources in neutron moisture gauges.
Atom: the smallest particle of an element that can enter          into a chemical reaction.
Atomic          number: the total number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.

Beta          particles: electrons ejected from the nucleus of a decaying atom . Although they can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminum, beta particles          can penetrate the dead skin layer, potentially causing burns. They can          pose a serious direct or external radiation threat and can be lethal depending          on the amount received. They also pose a serious internal radiation threat          if beta-emitting atoms are ingested or inhaled . See also alpha particle , gamma          ray , neutron , x-ray .

Biological              half-life: the time required for one half of the amount of              a substance, such as a radionuclide, to be expelled from the body              by natural metabolic processes, not counting radioactive decay, once              it has been taken in through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption. See also radioactive half-life , effective half-life .
C
Carcinogen: a cancer-causing substance.
Chain          reaction: a process that initiates          its own repetition. In a fission chain reaction,          a fissile nucleus absorbs a neutron and fissions          (splits) spontaneously, releasing additional neutrons. These, in turn,          can be absorbed by other fissile nuclei, releasing still more neutrons.          A fission chain reaction is self-sustaining when the number of neutrons          released in a given time equals or exceeds the number of neutrons lost          by absorption in non-fissile material or by escape from the system.
Chronic              exposure: exposure to a substance over a long period of time,              possibly resulting in adverse health effects. See also acute              exposure , fractionated exposure .
Cobalt          (Co): gray, hard, magnetic, and somewhat malleable metal. Cobalt          is relatively rare and generally obtained as a byproduct of other metals,          such as copper. Its most common radioisotope ,          cobalt-60 (Co-60), is used in radiography and          medical applications. Cobalt-60 emits beta particles and gamma rays during radioactive          decay .
Collective          dose: the estimated dose for an          area or region multiplied by the estimated population in that area or          region. For more information, see “ Primer on Radiation          Measurement ” at the end of this document.

Critical          mass: the minimum amount of fissile          material that can achieve a self-sustaining nuclear chain          reaction .
Cumulative          dose: the total dose resulting from          repeated or continuous exposures of the same portion of the body, or of          the whole body, to ionizing radiation .          For more information, see “ Primer on Radiation          Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Curie          (Ci): the traditional measure of radioactivity based on the observed decay rate of 1 gram of radium. One curie of radioactive          material will have 37 billion disintegrations in 1 second. For more          information, see “ Primer on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Cutaneous          Radiation Syndrome (CRS): the complex syndrome          resulting from radiation exposure of more than 200 rads to the skin. The immediate effects can be reddening and swelling of the exposed area (like a severe burn), blisters, ulcers on the skin, hair          loss, and severe pain. Very large doses can result in permanent hair loss,          scarring, altered skin color, deterioration of the affected body part,          and death of the affected tissue (requiring surgery). For more information,          see CDC’s fact sheet “Acute Radiation Syndrome,” at emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ars.asp .
D
Decay          chain (decay series): the series of          decays that certain radioisotopes go through          before reaching a stable form. For example, the decay chain that begins          with uranium-238 (U-238) ends in lead-206 (Pb-206), after forming isotopes,          such as uranium-234 (U-234), thorium-230 (Th-230), radium-226 (Ra-226),          and radon-222 (Rn-222).
Decay          constant: the fraction of a number of atoms of a radioactive          nuclide that disintegrates in a unit of time. The decay constant is          inversely proportional to the radioactive          half-life .
Decay          products (or daughter products): the isotopes or elements formed and the particles and high-energy electromagnetic radiation emitted          by the nuclei of radionuclides during radioactive          decay . Also known as "decay chain products" or "progeny" (the isotopes and elements). A decay product may be either radioactive          or stable.

Deterministic          effects: effects that can          be related directly to the radiation dose received.          The severity increases as the dose increases. A deterministic effect typically          has a threshold below which the effect will not occur. See also stochastic effect , non-stochastic          effect .
Deuterium : a non-radioactive isotope of the hydrogen atom          that contains a neutron in its nucleus in addition to the one proton normally seen in hydrogen.          A deuterium atom is twice as heavy as normal hydrogen. See also tritium .
Dirty          bomb: a device designed to spread radioactive          material by conventional explosives when the bomb explodes. A dirty          bomb kills or injures people through the initial blast of the conventional          explosive and spreads radioactive contamination over possibly a large area—hence the term “dirty.” Such          bombs could be miniature devices or large truck bombs. A dirty bomb is          much simpler to make than a true nuclear weapon. See also radiological          dispersal device .
Dose          (radiation): radiation absorbed by person’s body. Several          different terms describe radiation dose. For more information, see “ Primer          on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Dose          coefficient: the factor used to          convert radionuclide intake to dose. Usually          expressed as dose per unit intake (e.g., sieverts per becquerel ).
Dose          equivalent: a quantity used in radiation          protection to place all radiation on a common scale for calculating tissue          damage. Dose equivalent is the absorbed dose in grays times the quality          factor . The quality factor accounts for differences in radiation effects          caused by different types of ionizing radiation .          Some radiation, including alpha particles ,          causes a greater amount of damage per unit of absorbed dose than other          radiation. The sievert (Sv) is the unit used to          measure dose equivalent. For more information, see “ Primer          on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Dose          rate: the radiation dose delivered per unit of time.
Dose          reconstruction: a scientific          study that estimates doses to people from releases of radioactivity or other pollutants. The dose is reconstructed by determining the amount          of material released, the way people came in contact with it, and the          amount they absorbed.
Dosimeter: a small portable instrument (such as a film badge, thermoluminescent dosimeter          [TLD], or pocket dosimeter) for measuring and recording the total accumulated          dose of ionizing radiation a person receives.
Dosimetry: assessment (by measurement or calculation) of radiation          dose .
E
Effective          dose: a dosimetric quantity useful          for comparing the overall health affects of irradiation of the whole body. It takes into account the absorbed          doses received by various organs and tissues and weighs them according          to present knowledge of the sensitivity of each organ to radiation. It          also accounts for the type of radiation and the potential for each type          to inflict biologic damage. The effective dose is used, for example, to          compare the overall health detriments of different radionuclides in a          given mix. The unit of effective dose is the sievert (Sv); 1 Sv = 1 J/kg. For more information, see “ Primer          on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Effective          half-life: the time required for the amount of a radionuclide deposited in a living organism to be diminished by 50% as a result of          the combined action of radioactive decay and biologic elimination. See also biological          half-life , decay constant , radioactive          half-life .
Electron: an elementary particle with a negative electrical charge and a mass 1/1837          that of the proton . Electrons surround the nucleus of an atom because of the attraction between their          negative charge and the positive charge of the nucleus. A stable atom          will have as many electrons as it has protons. The number of electrons          that orbit an atom determine its chemical properties. See also neutron .
Electron          volt (eV): a unit of energy equivalent          to the amount of energy gained by an electron when it passes from a point of low potential to a point one volt higher          in potential.
Element: 1) all isotopes of an atom that contain the same number of protons . For example,          the element uranium has 92 protons, and the different isotopes of this          element may contain 134 to 148 neutrons. 2) In a reactor, a fuel element          is a metal rod containing the fissile material .
Enriched          uranium: uranium in which the proportion of the isotope uranium-235 has been increased by removing uranium-238 mechanically. See          also depleted uranium .
Epidemiology: the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states          or events in specified populations; and the application of this study          to the control of health problems.
Exposure          (radiation): a measure of ionization in air caused by x-rays or gamma          rays only. The unit of exposure most often used is the roentgen . See also contamination .
Exposure          pathway: a route by which a radionuclide or other toxic material can enter the body. The main exposure routes are inhalation , ingestion ,          absorption through the skin, and entry through a cut or wound in the skin.

.
Fissile          material: any material in which neutrons can cause a fission reaction. The three primary fissile materials are uranium-233, uranium-235,          and plutonium-239.
Fission          (fissioning): the splitting of a nucleus into at least two other nuclei that releases a large amount of energy.          Two or three neutrons are usually released during          this transformation. See also fusion .
Fractionated          exposure: exposure to radiation that occurs in several small acute exposures , rather than continuously          as in a chronic exposure .
Fusion: a reaction in which at least one heavier, more stable          nucleus is produced from two lighter, less stable nuclei. Reactions          of this type are responsible for the release of energy in stars or in thermonuclear weapons .
G
Gamma          rays: high-energy electromagnetic radiation emitted by certain radionuclides when their nuclei transition          from a higher to a lower energy state. These rays have high energy and          a short wave length. All gamma rays emitted from a given isotope have the same energy, a characteristic that enables scientists to identify          which gamma emitters are present in a sample. Gamma rays penetrate tissue          farther than do beta or alpha          particles , but leave a lower concentration of ions in their path to potentially cause cell damage. Gamma rays are very similar          to x-rays . See also neutron .
Geiger          counter: a radiation detection and          measuring instrument consisting of a gas-filled tube containing electrodes,          between which an electrical voltage but no current flows. When ionizing          radiation passes through the tube, a short, intense pulse of current          passes from the negative electrode to the positive electrode and is measured          or counted. The number of pulses per second measures the intensity of          the radiation field. Geiger counters are the most commonly used portable          radiation detection instruments.
Genetic          effects: hereditary effects (mutations)          that can be passed on through reproduction because of changes in sperm          or ova. See also teratogenic effects , somatic effects .
Gray          (Gy): a unit of measurement for absorbed          dose . It measures the amount of energy absorbed in a material. The          unit Gy can be used for any type of radiation ,          but it does not describe the biological effects of the different radiations.          For more information, see “ Primer on Radiation          Measurement ” at the end of this document.

Health          physics: a scientific field that          focuses on protection of humans and the environment from radiation .          Health physics uses physics, biology, chemistry, statistics, and electronic          instrumentation to help protect individuals from any damaging effects          of radiation. For more information, see the Health Physics Society website: http://www.hps.org/ .
High-level          radioactive waste: the radioactive material resulting from          spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. This can include liquid waste directly          produced in reprocessing or any solid material derived from the liquid          wastes having a sufficient concentration of fission          products . Other radioactive materials can be designated as high-level          waste, if they require permanent isolation. This determination is made          by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the basis of criteria established          in U.S. law. See also low-level waste , transuranic          waste .
Hot          spot: any place where the level of radioactive          contamination is considerably greater than the area around it.

Internal          exposure: exposure to radioactive          material taken into the body.
Iodine: a nonmetallic solid element . There are both radioactive          and non-radioactive isotopes of iodine. Radioactive          isotopes of iodine are widely used in medical applications. Radioactive          iodine is a fission product and is the largest          contributor to people’s radiation dose after          an accident at a nuclear reactor.
Ion: an atom that has fewer or more electrons than it has protons causing it to have an electrical          charge and, therefore, be chemically reactive.
Ionization: the process of adding one or more electrons to,          or removing one or more electrons from, atoms or molecules,          thereby creating ions . High temperatures, electrical          discharges, or nuclear radiation can cause ionization.
Ionizing radiation: any radiation capable of displacing electrons from atoms , thereby producing ions .          High doses of ionizing radiation may produce severe skin or tissue damage. See also alpha particle , beta          particle , gamma ray , neutron , x-ray .

Lead          Federal Agency (LFA): the federal agency that          leads and coordinates the emergency response activities of other federal          agencies during a nuclear emergency. After a nuclear emergency, the Federal          Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP, available at http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/doctrine/national/frerp.htm ) will          determine which federal agency will be the LFA.
Local          radiation injury (LRI): acute          radiation exposure (more than 1,000 rads ) to a          small, localized part of the body. Most local radiation injuries do not          cause death. However, if the exposure is from penetrating radiation ( neutrons , x-rays , or gamma rays ), internal          organs may be damaged and some symptoms of acute radiation          syndrome (ARS), including death, may occur. Local radiation injury          invariably involves skin damage, and a skin graft or other surgery may          be required. See also CDC’s fact sheet “Acute Radiation          Syndrome” at emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ars.asp .
Low-level          waste (LLW): radioactively contaminated industrial          or research waste such as paper, rags, plastic bags, medical waste, and          water-treatment residues. It is waste that does not meet the criteria          for any of three other categories of radioactive waste: spent nuclear          fuel and high-level radioactive waste ; transuranic radioactive waste; or uranium          mill tailings . Its categorization does not depend on the level of          radioactivity it contains.
M
Megaton          (Mt): the energy of an explosion that is equivalent to an explosion          of 1 million tons of TNT. One megaton is equal to a quintillion (1018)          calories. See also kiloton .
Molecule: a combination of two or more atoms that are chemically          bonded. A molecule is the smallest unit of a compound that can exist by          itself and retain all of its chemical properties.
N
Neoplastic: pertaining to the pathologic process resulting in the formation and growth          of an abnormal mass of tissue.
Neutron: a small atomic particle possessing no electrical charge typically found          within an atom's nucleus . Neutrons are, as the          name implies, neutral in their charge. That is, they have neither a positive          nor a negative charge. A neutron has about the same mass as a proton . See also alpha particle , beta          particle , gamma ray , nucleon , x-ray .
Non-ionizing          radiation: radiation that          has lower energy levels and longer wavelengths than ionizing          radiation . It is not strong enough to affect the structure of atoms it contacts but is strong enough to heat tissue and can cause harmful          biological effects. Examples include radio waves, microwaves, visible          light, and infrared from a heat lamp.
Non-stochastic          effects: effects that can be related directly to the radiation          dose received. The effect is more severe with a higher dose. It typically          has a threshold, below which the effect will not occur. These are sometimes          called deterministic effects . For          example, a skin burn from radiation is a non-stochastic effect that worsens          as the radiation dose increases. See also stochastic          effects .
Nuclear          energy: the heat energy produced          by the process of nuclear fission within a nuclear          reactor or by radioactive decay .
Nuclear          fuel cycle: the steps involved          in supplying fuel for nuclear power plants. It can include mining, milling,          isotopic enrichment, fabrication of fuel elements, use in reactors, chemical          reprocessing to recover the fissile material remaining in the spent fuel, reenrichment of the fuel material refabrication          into new fuel elements, and waste disposal.
Nuclear          tracers: radioisotopes that give doctors the ability to "look" inside the body and          observe soft tissues and organs, in a manner similar to the way x-rays          provide images of bones. A radioactive tracer is chemically attached to          a compound that will concentrate naturally in an organ or tissue so that          an image can be taken.
Nucleon: a proton or a neutron ; a          constituent of the nucleus of an atom.
Nucleus: the central part of an atom that contains protons and neutrons . The nucleus is the heaviest part          of the atom.
Nuclide: a general term applicable to all atomic forms of an element .          Nuclides are characterized by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus ,          as well as by the amount of energy contained within the atom .
P
Pathways: the routes by which people are exposed to radiation or other contaminants.          The three basic pathways are inhalation , ingestion ,          and direct external exposure . See          also exposure pathway .

Photons ( gamma rays and x-rays ), neutrons , and protons are          penetrating radiations. However, alpha particles and all but extremely high-energy beta particles are not considered penetrating radiation.
Photon: discrete "packet" of pure electromagnetic energy. Photons have          no mass and travel at the speed of light. The term "photon" was developed to describe energy when it acts like a particle (causing          interactions at the molecular or atomic level), rather than a wave. Gamma          rays and x-rays are photons.
Pitchblende: a brown to black mineral that has a distinctive luster. It consists mainly          of urananite (UO2), but also contains radium (Ra).          It is the main source of uranium (U) ore.
Plume: the material spreading from a particular source and traveling through          environmental media, such as air or ground water. For example, a plume          could describe the dispersal of particles, gases, vapors, and aerosols          in the atmosphere, or the movement of contamination through an aquifer          (For example, dilution, mixing, or adsorption onto soil).
Plutonium          (Pu): a heavy, man-made, radioactive metallic element .          The most important isotope is Pu-239, which has          a half-life of 24,000 years. Pu-239 can be used in reactor fuel and is          the primary isotope in weapons. One kilogram is equivalent to about 22          million kilowatt-hours of heat energy. The complete detonation of a kilogram          of plutonium produces an explosion equal to about 20,000 tons of chemical          explosive. All isotopes of plutonium are readily absorbed by the bones          and can be lethal depending on the dose and exposure time.
Polonium          (Po): a radioactive chemical element and          a product of radium (Ra) decay. Polonium is found          in uranium (U) ores.
Prenatal          radiation exposure: radiation exposure to an embryo or fetus          while it is still in its mother’s womb. At certain stages of the          pregnancy, the fetus is particularly sensitive to radiation and the health          consequences could be severe above 5 rads , especially          to brain function. For more information, see CDC’s fact sheet, “Possible          Health Effects of Radiation Exposure on Unborn Babies,” at emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/prenatal.asp .
Protective          Action Guide (PAG): a guide that tells state and local authorities          at what projected dose they should take action to protect people from          exposure to unplanned releases of radioactive          material into the environment.
Proton: a small atomic particle, typically found within an atom's nucleus ,          that possesses a positive electrical charge. Even though protons and neutrons are about 2,000 times heavier than electrons, they are tiny. The number          of protons is unique for each chemical element. See also nucleon .
Q
Quality          factor (Q): the factor by which the absorbed dose ( rad or gray )          is multiplied to obtain a quantity that expresses, on a common scale for          all ionizing radiation , the biological          damage ( rem ) to an exposed person. It is used because          some types of radiation, such as alpha particles ,          are more biologically damaging internally than other types. For more information,          see “ Primer on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
R
Rad          (radiation absorbed dose): a basic unit of absorbed          radiation dose . It is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed by          the body. The rad is the traditional unit of absorbed dose. It is being          replaced by the unit gray (Gy), which is equivalent          to 100 rad. One rad equals the dose delivered to an object of 100 ergs of energy per gram of material. For more information, see “ Primer          on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Radiation: energy moving in the form of particles or waves. Familiar radiations are          heat, light, radio waves, and microwaves. Ionizing          radiation is a very high-energy form of electromagnetic radiation.

It must be displayed where certain quantities          of radioactive materials are present          or where certain doses of radiation could be received.
Radioactive          contamination: the deposition          of unwanted radioactive material on the surfaces of structures, areas,          objects, or people. It can be airborne, external, or internal. See          also contamination , decontamination .
Radioactive          decay: the spontaneous disintegration          of the nucleus of an atom.
Radioactive          half-life: the time required for a quantity of a radioisotope to decay by half. For example, because the half-life of iodine-131 (I-131)          is 8 days, a sample of I-131 that has 10 mCi of activity on January 1, will have 5 mCi of activity 8 days later, on          January 9. See also: biological          half-life , decay constant , effective          half-life .
Radioactive        material: material that contains unstable (radioactive) atoms that        give off radiation as they decay .
Radioactivity: the process of spontaneous transformation of the nucleus ,          generally with the emission of alpha or beta          particles often accompanied by gamma rays .          This process is referred to as decay or disintegration          of an atom.
Radioassay: a test to determine the amounts of radioactive        materials through the detection of ionizing        radiation . Radioassays will detect transuranic nuclides, uranium , fission and activation products, naturally occurring        radioactive material , and medical isotopes .
Radiogenic: health effects caused by exposure to ionizing          radiation .
Radiography: 1) medical: the use of radiant energy (such as x-rays and gamma rays ) to image body systems. 2) industrial: the use of radioactive sources to photograph internal          structures, such as turbine blades in jet engines. A sealed radiation          source, usually iridium-192 (Ir-192) or cobalt-60 (Co-60), beams gamma          rays at the object to be checked. Gamma rays passing through flaws in          the metal or incomplete welds strike special photographic film (radiographic          film) on the opposite side.
Radioisotope          (radioactive isotope): isotopes of an element that have an unstable nucleus .          Radioactive isotopes are commonly used in science, industry, and medicine.          The nucleus eventually reaches a stable number of protons and neutrons through one or more radioactive decays.          Approximately 3,700 natural and artificial radioisotopes have been identified.

Radiological          dispersal device (RDD): a device that disperses radioactive          material by conventional explosive or other mechanical means, such          as a spray. See also dirty bomb .
Radionuclide: an unstable and therefore radioactive form of a nuclide .
Radium          (Ra): a naturally occurring radioactive metal. Radium is a radionuclide formed by the decay of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) in the environment. It occurs at low levels in virtually all rock,          soil, water, plants, and animals. Radon (Rn) is a          decay product of radium.
Radon          (Rn): a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in soils, rock,          and water throughout the United States. Radon causes lung cancer and is          a threat to health because it tends to collect in homes, sometimes to          very high concentrations. As a result, radon is the largest source of          exposure to people from naturally occurring radiation.
Relative          risk: the ratio between the risk for disease in an irradiated population to the risk in an unexposed population. A relative risk of          1.1 indicates a 10% increase in cancer from radiation, compared with the "normal" incidence. See also risk , absolute risk .
Rem          (roentgen equivalent, man): a unit of equivalent dose. Not all radiation has the same biological effect, even          for the same amount of absorbed dose . Rem          relates the absorbed dose in human tissue to the effective biological          damage of the radiation. It is determined by multiplying the number of rads by the quality factor ,          a number reflecting the potential damage caused by the particular type          of radiation. The rem is the traditional unit of equivalent dose, but          it is being replaced by the sievert (Sv), which          is equal to 100 rem. For more information, see “ Primer          on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Risk: the probability of injury, disease, or death under specific circumstances          and time periods. Risk can be expressed as a value that ranges from 0%          (no injury or harm will occur) to 100% (harm or injury will definitely          occur). Risk can be influenced by several factors: personal behavior or          lifestyle, environmental exposure to other material, or inborn or inherited          characteristic known from scientific evidence to be associated with a          health effect. Because many risk factors are not exactly measurable, risk          estimates are uncertain. See also absolute          risk , relative risk .
Risk          assessment: an evaluation of the risk to human health or the          environment by hazards. Risk assessments can look at either existing hazards          or potential hazards.
Roentgen        (R): a unit of exposure to x-rays or gamma        rays . One roentgen is the amount of gamma or x-rays needed to produce ions carrying 1 electrostatic unit of electrical charge        in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air under standard conditions.
S
Sensitivity: ability of an analytical method to detect small concentrations of radioactive          material.

Sievert          (Sv): a unit used to derive a quantity called dose          equivalent . This relates the absorbed dose in human tissue to the effective biological damage of the radiation. Not          all radiation has the same biological effect, even for the same amount          of absorbed dose. Dose equivalent is often          expressed as millionths of a sievert, or micro-sieverts (µSv). One          sievert is equivalent to 100 rem . For more information,          see “ Primer on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
S.I.          units: the Systeme Internationale (or International System) of          units and measurements. This system of units officially came into being          in October 1960 and has been adopted by nearly all countries, although          the amount of actual usage varies considerably. For more information,          see “ Primer on Radiation Measurement ” at the end of this document.
Somatic          effects: effects of radiation that are limited to the exposed          person, as distinguished from genetic effects ,          which may also affect subsequent generations. See also teratogenic          effects .

Stochastic          effect: effect that occurs on a random basis independent of the          size of dose . The effect typically has no threshold          and is based on probabilities, with the chances of seeing the effect increasing          with dose. If it occurs, the severity of a stochastic effect is independent          of the dose received. Cancer is a stochastic effect. See also non-stochastic effect , deterministic          effect .
Strontium          (Sr): a silvery, soft metal that rapidly turns yellow in air.          Sr-90 is one of the radioactive fission materials created within a nuclear reactor during its operation. Stronium-90 emits beta particles during radioactive decay.

Uranium          (U): a naturally occurring radioactive element whose principal isotopes are uranium-238 (U-238)          and uranium-235 (U-235). Natural uranium is a hard, silvery-white, shiny          metallic ore that contains a minute amount of uranium-234 (U-234).
Uranium          mill tailings: naturally radioactive          residue from the processing of uranium ore. Although the milling process          recovers about 95% of the uranium, the residues, or tailings, contain          several isotopes of naturally occurring radioactive          material , including uranium (U), thorium (Th), radium (Ra), polonium (Po), and radon (Rn).

Like gamma rays, x-rays require          more shielding to reduce their intensity than          do beta or alpha          particles . X-rays and gamma rays differ primarily in their origin:          x-rays originate in the electronic shell; gamma rays originate in the nucleus . See also neutron .
Primer on Radiation Measurement
In the              aftermath of a radiological emergency the public will see radiation              and its potential hazards described in many different and sometimes              confusing ways. This primer is intended to help journalists and community              leaders understand these terms.
Activity              or radioactivity is measured by the number of atoms disintegrating              per unit time. A becquerel is 1 disintegration              per second. A curie is 37 billion disintegrations              per second, which is the number of disintegrations per second in 1              gram of pure radium. A disintegrating atom can emit a beta particle,              an alpha particle, a gamma ray, or some combination of all these,              so becquerels or curies alone do not provide enough information to              assess the risk to a person from a radioactive source.
Disintegrating              atoms emit different forms of radiation–—alpha particles,              beta particles, gamma rays, or x-rays. As radiation moves through              the body, it dislodges electrons from atoms, disrupting molecules.              Each time this happens, the radiation loses some energy until it escapes              from the body or disappears. The energy deposited indicates the number              of molecules disrupted. The energy the radiation deposits in tissue              is called the dose, or more correctly, the absorbed dose. The units of measure for              absorbed dose are the gray (1 joule per kilogram of tissue) or the rad (1/100 of a gray). The cumulative              dose is the total absorbed dose or energy deposited              by the body or a region of the body from repeated or prolonged exposures.
Alpha              particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and x-rays affect tissue in              different ways. Alpha particles disrupt more molecules in a shorter              distance than gamma rays. A measure of the biologic risk of the energy              deposited is the dose equivalent. The units              of dose equivalent are sieverts or rem.              Dose equivalent is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by              a quality factor.
Sometimes              a large number of people have been exposed to a source of ionizing              radiation. To assess the potential health effects, scientists often              multiply the exposure per person by the number of persons and call              this the collective dose. Collective dose              is expressed as “person-rem” or “person-sieverts.”
Abbreviations              for Radiation Measurements
When the amounts of radiation being measured are less than 1, prefixes              are attached to the unit of measure as a type of shorthand. This is              called scientific notation and is used in many scientific fields.              The table below shows the prefixes for radiation measurement and their              associated numeric notations.
