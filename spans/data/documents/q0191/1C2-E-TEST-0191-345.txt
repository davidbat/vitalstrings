Gibed,
Stremmenos may be the one to actually shed some light on what is going on with Defkalion.  His association with them gave some credibility and he is a known player in a company filled with unknown and anonymous players.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say about the matter.

Defkalion itself may or may not be a goner – I was really using their name as a sort of shorthand term for anyone who eventually produces domestic or small scale devices that would dent the energy monopolies by allowing virtually anyone to go ‘off grid’.
If (a) e-cat is real, and (b) if AR sells/has sold the technology to the power utilities, then the probable outcome – at least in the short to medium term – is no change. It will only be when the common oik can directly buy and use LENR devices that it becomes disruptive, in the way I think that many of us hope it will be.

Hi Gibed,
No time to search more now but translating the original as text from Greek to English, on Google Translate,  I get:
“”With new negative letters answered, as expected, the question submitted by the MP Xanthi New Republic to competent ministers on the issue of environmental impacts from the possible establishment of Xanthi plant devices producing energy from fusion of hydrogen-nickel.
After the replies of the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Development responded to Members of the Southwest there is filed an application for the company Defkalion for this investment and therefore can not assess the potential environmental burden .
Indeed the response of the Ministry of Development, signed by the Deputy Minister Socrates Xynidis.
In this report: “In response to the above question tabled in the House by Congressman Alexander Short, you know that it has submitted documentation to permit installation and operation of industrial plant of this type»
Negative responses from Papakonstantinou – Sokos.
Respondents who were released from Alexander Short, included a cover of the Environment Minister George Papakonstantinou and a response by the Head of the Department of Industry that the YPEKA not submitted any application. Also by the Secretary of ADMTH letter sent by the Director of the relative address of Apoakentromensi Administration Lambrini Rizos. There is no known application for approval of building fusion power nickel-hydrogen has not been filed and that of the crop should be ensured through the Environmental Impact Study filed in each case.”
“Contos” translates as Short (as previously Rossi translates to Smith!)

In a comment below the article at Xanthi Press, the comments moderator/administrator wrote that each minister is required to release separate reports on the environmental issues and that when they become available Xanthi Press will post them, and people can then draw their own conclusions. That was using Google translate or Yahoo Babel Fish.

ADMINISTRATOR – re:
This [simainoi] my friends, that each one is person in charge for those who it reports.
The things are simple. It is enough seeks no one who has spoken in public or it has made announcements for her particular investment, as also and against, for his own reasons.
The time will show if the particular company realises the investment, that she has announced in advance in Xanthi. When the affair is completed with positive negative way, then XanthiPress.gr will present to you the all public reports that have become for the subject and each one might draw his conclusions.

This is Google’s translation:
“MANAGER – re:
This means my friends, that everyone is responsible for what he says.
Things are simple. Just look for someone who has spoken publicly announced or made for this investment, as well as against, for its own sake.
Time will tell if this company made the investment, which has been announced in Xanthi. When the case was completed with positive or negative way, then XanthiPress.gr will show you all the public reports made on the subject and everyone can draw their own conclusions.”

Defkalion in their forum went into great detail.  They said they had built a factory in which they were going to install a megawatt plant which would supply steam to heat among others, the Xanthi Police Academy.  They said they had applied to Greek government agencies for inspection of their version of the E-cat they call Hyperion.  That was to include efficacy as well as safety.  The reports were to be made public as soon as they were ready, probably around the early part of September.
So where is the factory and who has seen it?  They always refused publishing any images citing their need to complete security devices.  Well, are those complete?  Strange: nobody reports working for Defkalion, nobody says they know where the factory is, nobody has seen a single actual Hyperion machine, none has been pictured in print anywhere ever that we know of.
Yet all sorts of things were promised in the forum.  I’d love to ask Defkalion about it but (drats!) they closed the forum for too much traffic (which it never had).  Maybe some clowns and snakes gummed up the works?  Where’s Defkalion?  What are they saying?

It seems that the factory is not in Xanthy, Greece, but in Limassol, Cyprus, which is where the  Defkalion resides. This is corroborated by statements of the employees that posted on their forums, in which they said that they usually met on the beach for meetings, which was 5 minutes away from the factory by walking. Limassol is a coast city whereas Xanthy is 30KM away by road or 20Km away in straigh line to the closest beach.

They are waiting for their patents to be approved. If anybody gummed up their forum, I can probably take three or four guesses as to who was responsible, and the first two or three won’t count.

In a couple of passages, the English translation misses the negative particle “den (δεν)”, thus reversing the meaning.
The paragaph starting with “After the replies…” should read (comments in [square brackets] are mine):
“After the replies of the services of the Ministry of Finance [I suppose Chemical Service of Xanthi], both the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Development responded to the member of Parliament of New Democracy [i.e. Alexander Contos] that there is **no** filed application (submitted) by the company Defkalion for this investment and therefore can not assess the potential environmental burden.
The paragraph starting with “In this report…” should read:
In this report: “In response to the above question submitted to the Parliament by Parliament member Alexander Contos, we let you know there exists **no** filed request to permit installation and operation of industrial plant of this type”.
I noted the comment by the administrator: I see it as a disclaimer, in reply to a rather angry comment asking if previous articles regarding the Xanthi factory were phony.
I note also that Defkalion did not react to the article, posted on 31 August.
My previous reference to Stremmenos was a joke. While I would appreciate his insight, I imagine he must be quite embarrassed by the development of the Defkalion policy – or lack of it – after the split from Rossi. Therefore he should not be inclined to comment – let alone translate – the articles published by Xanthipress.

LOL…no I didn’t actually expect Stremmenos to translate.  But I do expect him to have something to say about it at some point. You are right, his insight would be appreciated.

Thank you, Gibed.   In the Google Translate version, it appeared as if the negative had been left out but I had no way to be sure because I speak neither Greek nor Italian.
Defkalion was quite clear in their forum as to which authority they claimed was testing the Hyperion.  It was always Greek.  Not Cyprus,  not EU, not anyone else.
All sorts of tests were supposed to be scheduled for October including a large number to be done at Defkalion facilities in Greece (not Cyprus) by a number of independent companies who were interested in investing $40 million and up for regional or country rights to market Hyperion.   Does anyone know of a group or individual who is still scheduled to make that trip?  I know of one person who says they *think* it’s still on but is not at all sure.  Anyone else have any information?
Has anyone been given a specific location (you don’t have to say what it is) for the October Rossi test in the US?   A specific invitation with time and place?  It would be about the time famous scientists would be making time in their busy schedules and making air line reservations.  Not everyone can drop everything and travel on a moment’s notice.

Defkalion looks a bit like blacklightpower. I am wondering what kind of work blp is doing and where the money is coming from.
Now we also have Piantelli in the same circuit. I am curious to see what is going to happen.

Blacklight Power is currently funded by private investors. In the past, they received financial support from electrical utilities.
BLP has a laboratory with about 20 employees. Visitors have said the employees seemed to be working. BLP has made numerous claims and predictions over the last 20 years. Nothing substantive has come out of any of them.
I doubt that Defkalion will last anywhere near as long as BLP, but we’ll see. In terms of the factory, I recall Defkalion saying it was in Xanthi, Greece. The company is registered in Cyprus to avoid disclosure of shareholder identity. Cyprus is a haven for companies that would like to keep shareholder information secret.

Either Defkalion has units currently being certified by the Greek government or not.  They stated that it cost them a lot of money and would take a while to get them certification (which I believe would then be EU wide certification).  It is logical and predictably that they would be silent while the certification process was taking place.  Furthermore, I doubt a company would want to label their devices as anything but an exothermic reaction involving nickel and hydrogen, in that the word “nuclear” is radioactive (ha-ha).  It would sure be surprising if Rossi leaving Defkalion meant it was a useless shell of a company, especially since the patient situation on the E-Cat kernel and Rossi’s “Italian sauce” is not clear (arguably non-existent).
By the way, what is really important here isn’t specific players, but instead public proof that LENR Ni-H can be commercialized, because then it will be like blood in the water to the sharks of competition.  Can’t you feel the excitement building?

I never thought of Rossi’s reaction at the energy level of nuclear power plant rods before. But Rossi may not be aware of the upper power limit as long as enough heat can be carried away since too much heat kills the reaction.
With that amount of coolant flowing, the difference between stone cold and thermal meltdown might be a small percentage range of the normal operating flow. Once the reactor reaches the optimal temperature for the Rossi reaction, increasing the hydrogen pressure may be all that is needed to take it to massive heat levels. The trick is keeping the whole core within the narrow optimal temperature range for the reaction to occur without destroying the nickel / catalyst.

@Peter Roe.
Peter, our crystal balls are starting to show similar pictures now.  I agree about the Czech republic – and Hungary too, I suppose.  Your darker imaginings about English speaking ‘western’ stitch ups now sounds pretty believable to me – I can only too easily imagine the weasel words that would be used in the UK to support an expensive licensing and approval system with the ensuing duties or taxes, that, funnily enough, mean you would be paying about as much for electricity that way as you would off the grid. Funny, that.
There is more bullsh*t hidden under the mantle of Heath & Safety in this country than one can imagine – if anything finally brings UK PLC to it’s knees it will be malevolent enforcement of these regulations. <>.
A good current example would be the energy that goes in to the pursuit of incorrect use of red diesel – in road vehicles for example. Woe betide you if you get caught doing that, it is likely to be a very painfully expensive experience.  They’d behave just the same over home E-cats. <>.
On your other comment, in a previous life I spent some of my time extracting natural essential oils, but saw the black clouds of regulation coming over the horizon and got out, with my capital, while the getting was good.
Isn’t it great to live in as free country……
September 7, 2011 at 5:52 pm
“Isn’t it great to live in a free country……”
I’m sufficiently ancient to remember a time when I did – more or less. Unfortunately by the time I started shaving (in the days when I did!) the first signs of big brother closing in on my carefree little world were already pretty apparent. But enough senile maunderings.
As to the future of e-cat technology I think, as you say, we may be pretty much on the same page. I think that the hopes of many people who contribute to this blog and other similar ones that if Ni-H technology becomes widespread, then the world will become a better place are likely to be only partially fulfilled at best.
The fact is that in most of the ‘Western’ world a power structure and bureaucracy is already in place that will allow governments to arrange for taxes and other costs on Ni-H that ensure that in the short to medium term energy costs to the end user are practically unaffected, and that the energy corporations control it anyway.
On the up side, demand for fossil fuels from post-peak deposits located in politically unstable parts of the world may fall (this would depend on ways being found to propel vehicles directly or indirectly from ‘e-cat’ energy), CO2 output would fall (which is presumably important to anyone who still believes in so-called AGW, even if the next volcano will totally offset a decade’s worth of ‘carbon reduction’), and it will become politically impossible to build new nuclear plant to create future Fukushimas.
In the longer term the new physics that will have to spring from ‘cold fusion’ will inevitably offer more new energy technologies that corrupt states will find it increasingly hard to control, and eventually the status quo will have to crumble, but I’m not going to hold my breath.
Now I’ve REALLY depressed myself.

September 9, 2011 at 12:55 pm
Peter,
As you say, we’re pretty much in agreement, but I don’t feel there’s anything to get additionally depressed over…
Sure, we live in a control freak country, where we will soon need a signed form in triplicate from the H&SE before we can go to the bog. Where kids will soon have to wear foam rubber suits a foot thick to avoid any grazes at school, and where an Act of Parliament will be required to sanction any individual school trip.
But, if LENR – as a whole, not just Rossi and E-cat – fails to deliver, we would be really up s^&t creek! Half hearted, half assed green energy initiatives running into serious NIMBYism, coal fired power being run down, gas declining, and so on (I won’t even mention nucelar fission)…  energy and transport costs would continue an accelerating increase, until a semi-meltdown of society limited demand.
I come from a position that is pretty sure that something in the LENR stable is going to ring the bell, and that maybe that will even be Rossi. If that is the case, the situation will at least stabilise, even if we don’t get some sort of fantastic energy gift-week. The government needs a certain level of income for all it’s programmes – whatever we feel about them – and if one of the money sources falls off a cliff (like road fuel) it has to be replaced. The entertaining bit is listening to the wriggling that goes on whilst they try to assure us that it is all fair, for our own good, required by the Bible,…etc
So, if /when LENR happens, things will at least stabilise, and maybe energy costs will dip a little. That’s worth having! In addition, elsewhere we might see real major, major benefits in the developing world from desalination (and maybe SE England as well!!). This could be truly transformational, and in time there would be great beneficial knock on effects for the whole world.
Greenhouse warming – well it’s a tough one to call, even without LENR in the equation. I have heard more bulls*it spouted by both sides of that debate than is heaped up in the yard of my neighbouring farm. All I’d note is that IF the anthropogenic component needs adjusting, this is clearly a powerful tool, and could even power carbon sequestration attempts – if any ever work…..
Nope – I’m feeling pretty good about the likely future if LENR comes to pass, despite our bloody governments…
