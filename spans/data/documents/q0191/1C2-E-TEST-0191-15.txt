Fission splits atoms and fusion joins them.
When either happens the excess mass is given off as energy E = mc^2. Fusion gives more energy but nobody has been able to get it to happen at low enough temperatures for practical use.
The atom bomb was an example of fission, neutrons caused the elements to split into smaller atoms and the energy was given off.
The sun (and all stars) use fusion to create heavier atoms. In fusion especially there is a mass defect - the sum of the mass of the atoms fused is greater than the mass of the atom formed. This is called the mass defect and it is lost as two photons of energy from Einstein's equation E =  mc^2
