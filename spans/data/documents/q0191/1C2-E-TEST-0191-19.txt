Small plastic tray (approximate capacity of 100 mL,    approximately 8 cm in diameter)
2 pieces of wire (able to be easily bent), 25 cm in length
Wood splint
 
Procedure
Use the graduated cylinder to carefully measure 2 mL dish    detergent, 5 mL glycerin, and 6 mL water into the tray. Use the    wood splint to stir the liquid until it is of a uniform    consistency.
Make two bubble wands from the wire pieces. Take each piece of    wire and form a 3-4 cm circle at the center of the length, twist    the two ends together to form the handle (see diagram).
Hold one wire frame in each hand. Dip the two circular wire    frames in the solution.
Gently blow through each wire frame to create a bubble with a    diameter a little larger than the frame, and catch the bubble on    the frame.
Bring the frames and the bubbles together. Let the bubbles    press against each other until they form one large bubble. This    illustrates the fusion process.
Stretch the bubble by pulling the two frames farther apart    until the bubble separates into two bubbles, one in each frame.    This demonstrates the fission process. When this is done a little    faster a small bubble may be released, illustrating the released    neutron.
  
 
Students with Special Needs
Students unable to blow the proper size bubbles or manipulate the wire frames    independently can work with a partner or the class can be divided into groups.
