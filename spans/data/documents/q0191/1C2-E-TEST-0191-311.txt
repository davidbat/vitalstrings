Abs tract:
A prospective, randomized trial was performed comparing anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of cervical spondylosis with neurologic compromise. 44 patients had ACD and 40 underwent ACDF. Operative time, hospital stay and the need for analgesia were less in the ACD group. It was found that while the incidence of fusion was greater in the ACDF group (97% vs 70%, p< 0.01), patient satisfaction and a return to pre operative activity level was similar between groups. This suggests that the addition of a fusion procedure may be unnecessary.
Int roduction:
Cervical spondylosis is a process whereby degeneration and instability in the spine are compensated by hypertrophy of the supporting ligamentous structures and bony outgrowths. This process has been described as occurring in three phases: dysfunction, instability and stabilization (22). The end point of this process is auto fusion of the involved joint space. This is an adaptive process in many areas of the body (eg., hip, knee) resulting in increased structural support and some surgical procedures are designed to facilitate this endpoint (arthrodesis). However, the proximity of neurologic structures to the spine can lead to unwanted neurologic side effects of this process(3,12,22). By narrowing the bony spaces within which neural structures lie, compression and dysfunction can occur. Radiculopathy as a result of foraminal stenosis or myelopathy from spinal canal stenosis with spinal cord compression may occur.
Initially, the posterior approach to the cervical spine was utilized (12).      Although this yielded favorable results for soft, accessible disc fragments,      it provided limited access to and exposure of midline disc fragments and      calcified spurs characteristic of cervical spondylosis. Based on the limitations      of the posterior approach, the anterior approach to intervertebral disc      pathology was developed at several institutions apparently independent of      each other. Since this time, controversy has developed concerning the superiority      of the anterior or the posterior approach. It has not been demonstrated      that one is better than the other. As such, both still have their proponents      and detractors (3 4,6,9,19,20).
The initial descriptions of the anterior approach for cervical discectomy           all included a fusion procedure (1,3,4). Concern over the possibility      of developing late kyphosis from disc space collapse or radiculopathy from           foraminal narrowing supported this philosophy. However, as experience      with           the procedure mounted, it became clear that some patients had relief      of the radicular symptoms but developed complications related to the fusion           procedure (5). Some surgeons began to perform simple discectomy without           the addition of a fusion procedure for these patients (8,10,11,13).
This has led to contention regarding the necessity of a fusion procedure.      Many reports are difficult to interpret as the two techniques were utilized      at different times and/ or by different surgeons (11,18). In the absence      of a randomized prospective study in patients with cervical spondylosis      comparing anterior cervical discectomy with and without fusion, firm recommendations      regarding the superiority of either approach are difficult to support.To      this end, the current study was undertaken.
Me thods:
The series reported in this communication represents a three year experience from 1986 until 1989. One hundred consecutive patients presenting with cervical spondylosis of one or two levels and a diagnosis of radiculopathy or radiculo- myelopathy were evaluated for the study. Sixteen patients either withdrew from the study due to patient treatment preferences or did not meet inclusion criteria. The remaining 84 patients were prospectively randomized via closed envelope technique to anterior cervical discectomy alone or with a fusion procedure. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board.
All of the patients in this series were managed by the principal investigator      (FPW). Additionally, the procedures were performed at a single institution      in conjunction with a dedicated neurosurgical operating room staff ensuring      a modicum of consistency. The setting was favorable for this study as the      patient pool is largely drawn from the local area, which aids in patient      follow up.
The surgical technique was quite consistent in all cases with the incision           through an appropriate horizontal skin fold on the right side of the      neck. Dissection was via the usual route medial to the carotid sheath but      lateral           to the tracheo- esophageal bundle. Lateral X ray was used to confirm      vertebral level. The Cloward retractor system was used deep to the longis      colli muscle           group. Discectomy was performed utilizing a Smith- Robinson technique      but with opening the posterior longtitudinal ligament in all cases and removal           of posteriorly directed osteophytes with curette and Kerrison rongeur      (Figure           1B). Cases with radiculopathy had foraminal augmentation. The cartilagenous           endplates were carefully removed.
A fusion procedure was added for those patients randomized to this           arm of the study (Figure 1C). Iliac crest autograft bone via a modified           Cloward           technique (21) was utilized for fusion. The recipient site and graft           were tailored to ensure a snug fit. This was facilitated using cervical           traction.           No screw or plate fixation was used. Tissues and skin were closed with           absorbable sutures. No drains were used. Post operatively, fusion patients           wore a soft           collar for a period of six weeks.
Clinical follow up was performed while in hospital, during two office visits           (five and ten weeks) and at delayed phone contact (mean 4.5 years,      range 1.5- 8 years).

Res ults:
Following randomization, 44 patients underwent ACD while 40 patients received ACDF. These groups were found to be comparable on the basis of their demographic data (figure 2),

Note that the two groups are quite comparable except for arm weakness- this was a more significant complaint in the ACDF group. However, on neurological examination, there was no significant difference in objective weakness between the two groups.ACD: anterior cervical discectomy; ACDF: anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.

and the form of preoperative therapy that each received (figure 5).

Importantly, the number of patients with problems           caused by motor vehicle accident or involved in compensation claims           was similar           between groups. More patients in the ACDF group (10/40 vs. 1/44, p< 0.005) complained of arm weakness. However, physical examination (18/40 vs. 18/44, ns) did not support this difference between groups.
The distribution of operative levels and ratio of single/ double level procedures      was similar between groups (figure 6).
Figure 6: The distribution of operative levels and the ratio of single/ double procedures is similar in the two groups (ACD v. ACDF).ACD: anterior cervical discectomy; ACDF: anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.
Two level procedures were performed in 59% of the ACD group compared with 50% of the ACDF group.
The presence of myelopathy was determined by evidence of hand intrinsic musculature weakness and/ or pathologic long tract findings. Gait, bowel and bladder function were not recorded. By these criteria,12 patients in the ACD group and 14 patients in the ACDF group demonstrated signs of myelopathy.
The operative time was approximately 29 minutes           longer in the ACDF group (131 vs 102 minutes, p< 0.001). This difference           and significance were maintained when single and double levels were           compared separately. The length      of time in post operative unit was not different between groups (103 vs.      98 minutes, ns)
Post operative results were quite different between           the two groups. There was no perioperative mortality and no patients           deteriorated           neurologically.      The ACD group was significantly more satisfied with their pain relief (34/44      v 20/40, p<0.01) on the morning following surgery. Patients with ACD      requested fewer narcotic shots (3.5 vs. 3.6, ns), narcotic pills (3.6 vs.      4.4, p< 0.05) and non-narcotic analgesics (0.4 vs. 1.0, p< 0.01).      Two patients developed transient hoarseness in the ACDF group compared with      none in the ACD group. Medical complications (urinary tract infections,      atelectasis, elevated leukocyte count, etc.) were significantly fewer in      the ACD group (4/44 vs 10/40, p<0.05). Finally, the hospital stay was      shorter for the ACD group (3.6 vs. 5.0 days, p< 0.005). Taken together,      these data suggest that a fusion procedure adds a significant length of      time to the operative procedure. ACDF patients had more pain, developed      more medical complications and stayed in the hospital longer.
The two groups were evaluated for rdiographic           fusion. Thirty-one patients in each group had complete flexion- extension cervical           X ray series post      operatively. Patients with two level procedures that showed fusion at only      a single level were classified as failures. ACDF patients had a statistically      greater fusion rate (30/31 v 22/31, p<0.01). Stratification of patients      between one and two level procedures, smoking history or age did not demonstrate      any difference in fusion success with multi- variate analyses. However,      women were found to have a lower rate of successful fusion (28/37 v 24/25,      p<0.05) when compared with men regardless of procedure type.
Post hospital follow up revealed that the discrepancy           in pain relief abated by the first office visit ("improved":           ACD 40/44 vs. ACDF 37/40, ns). At the second office visit there was           near universal improvement in      pain (ACD 31/32 vs. ACDF 35/35, ns) in both groups. Phone follow up demonstrated      some recrudescence of pain although this was similar between groups. Severe      pain was present in some patients ( ACD 4/33 vs ACDF 5/23, ns) at the time      of phone follow up.
The number of patients returning to work was           greater in the ACD group at both the first (10/44 vs. 4/37, ns) and           second (12/32           vs. 10/33, ns) office      visits. Phone follow up revealed that more patients in the ACD group had      maintained their pre-operative level of activity (24/33 v 15/23, ns). Also,      when asked whether the procedure "helped and would be worth repeating      given a second chance", patients from both groups were largely satisfied      ( ACD 33/33 vs ACDF 22/23, ns). However, these differences do not attain statistical significance.
Two patients required a second operative procedure,           both from the ACD group. The first patient had persistence of radicular           symptoms following a C5-6           and C6-7 ACD. At four months postoperatively, posterior foraminotomy      was performed at these levels with relief of symptoms. The second patient      had           a C5-6 ACD with immediate relief of symptoms and radiological evidence      of successful fusion. She gradually became symptomatic again and underwent      C4-5 and C6-7 ACDF eight years after her initial operation.
Dis cussion:
Cervical spondylosis is a common condition that has been recognized as a major cause of arm and neck pain (13,17). Dysfunction at the level of the intervertebral disc and joint complex is the earliest form of the disorder. This may occur in response to a specific injury or as a result of cumulative wear and tear of an active lifestyle (7,22). Hypertrophy of the supporting tissues in response to this subtle instability occurs. This is a heterogeneous response with ligamentous hypertrophy, joint narrowing, reactive growth from the bony endplates and calcification of the joint capsule. These changes perform the teleologically useful function of stabilizing worn joints with a stable osseous bridge or auto fusion of that joint space (22). Procedures to facilitate arthrodesis have been developed for other joints (eg, knee) to achieve such stability. However, the proximity of neurologic structures to the affected joint complexes may result in adverse consequences (2,7,17,22). This is often the case in the cervical spine. Joint narrowing, ligamentous thickening and bony spurring can cause compression at the root level (ie, radiculopathy) or the spinal cord level (ie, myelopathy). Also, pain related to joint instability may preceed neurologic injury (type III syndrome) (17).
The relative importance of each pathologic change           will vary between patients. As such, treatment strategies need to be           tailored to match the specific      changes present in a given patient. Cervical traction will facilitate foraminal      opening and cervical collars aid in minimizing dynamic injury. Strengthening      exercises can shift some of the support function away from the spine. However,      cases with true mechanical compression of neurologic structures often require      surgical intervention (17).
Both anterior and posterior approaches have been           used for the treatment of this condition (12,19,20). However, incomplete           recovery for pathology           situated anterior to the spinal cord has been found following posterior           decompression alone (6,19). The treatment of radiculopathy is largely           successful with either approach. The anterior approach offers maximal           exposure to the           pathology centered around the disc space (1,3,14). Following decompression           of the involved neurologic structures, many authors favor the use of           a fusion procedure (1,3,9,14,17,23). Arguments in favor of this approach           include           the maintenance of disc space height which avoids vertebral settling           and minimizes the potential to develop foraminal stenosis. Also, fusion           will           remove the instability component of the disorder which may cause progressive           deterioration (22).
The necessity of adding a fusion procedure is           not universally accepted (5,10,11,13, 15). In the cervical area, fusion           has its own set of complications                in addition                to those of ACD alone (5,16). Most obvious are autogenous donor           site complications such as hematoma and neurologic injury to the lateral                femoral cutaneous                nerve (meralgia paresthetica). Patients often complain of more           pain                in this area than at the cervical surgical site. The use of allograft                material has                the potential for transmission of viral particles and other infectious                agents. Placing the graft in the recipient site may entail further                neck dissection                for exposure than discectomy alone. Late complications of cervical                fusion include graft extrusion causing spinal cord injury or dysphagia.
The results of this study suggest that a fusion procedure adds                little to the ACD alone in the surgical management of cervical                spondylosis                at one                or two levels. The operative time was significantly longer for                ACDF patients. The ACDF patients had more pain as measured by                initial satisfaction                and                requests for analgesic medications. The incidence of medical complications,                such as atelectasis and urinary tract infection, related to the                procedure was greater in the ACDF group and hospital stay was                significantly prolonged.
As expected, the rate of successful fusion was           statistically different between groups. The ACDF group had a 97% fusion           rate compared                     with 70% in the ACD                     group. Connolly et al. have found that using cine radiographs,                     motion was detectable at operative levels which appeared           fused on plain films                     (5).                     Fusion has been evaluated in a goat model (23). The investigators                     in this study found only 25% osseous union by histology in           levels exhibiting                     radiological                     fusion. This suggests that bony fusion is poorly evaluated           by radiographic measures and may be inappropriate as an endpoint.                     A better goal is                     relief of symptoms and patient satisfaction. This was well           achieved with both ACD                     and ACDF.
Rosenorn reported a series of patients with cervical           herniated disc prospectively randomized to anterior cervical discectomy                          with or without                          fusion (15).                          Five separate surgeons participated in this study. Patients                          undergoing ACD had a significantly greater return to           work                          for the first 9                          weeks and superior                          clinical outcome at both 3 and 12 months. This is especially                          significant considering that cadaveric donor bone was           utilized for fusion                          procedures in that series.
Conclu sions:
The results of the study demonstrate a distinct difference in early patient satisfaction. Operative times were shorter in the ACD group. Post operative pain relief was greater in the ACD group. Post operative requirements for analgesia were less in the ACD group. This resulted in a decreased length of hospitalization in the ACD group. Two patients did require further surgery in the ACD group, but the return to preoperative status and overall satisfaction were equal between groups.
As expected the rate of successful fusion was           greater for the ACDF group (97% vs. 70%, p, 0.01). However, this did           not correlate with an improved      level of satisfaction with the procedure or less long term pain. This would      suggest that the addition of a fusion procedure is not absolutely necessary.      Procedure selection should be at the discretion of the surgeon and based      on individual patient factors.
