Modern nuclear power plants uses nuclear fission reaction with uranium as the fuel. Inside the reactor of an atomic power plant, uranium atoms are split apart in a controlled chain reaction.  This chain reaction gives off heat energy. This heat energy is used to boil water in the core of the reactor. This energy can be converted using a turbine to generate electricity.
Another form of nuclear energy is called fusion. Fusion means joining smaller nuclei (the plural of nucleus) to make a larger nucleus. The sun uses nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. This gives off heat and light and other radiation.
What's better about nuclear fusion is that it creates less radioactive material than fission, and its supply of fuel can last longer than the sun.  Scientists have been working on controlling nuclear fusion for a long time, trying to make a fusion reactor to produce electricity. But they have been having trouble learning how to control the reaction in a contained space.
