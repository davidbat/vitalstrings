History of U-235 Fission
In the 1930s, German physicists/chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman attempted to create transuranic elements by bombarding uranium with neutrons. Rather than the heavy elements they expected, they got several unidentified products. When they finally identified one of the products as Barium-141, they were reluctant to publish the finding because it was so unexpected. When they finally published the results in 1939, they came to the attention of Lise Meitner, an Austrian-born physicist who had worked with Hahn on his nuclear experiments. Upon Hitler's invasion of Austria, she had been forced to flee to Sweden where she and Otto Frisch, her nephew, continued to work on the neutron bombardment problem. She was the first to realize that Hahn's barium and other lighter products from the neutron bombardment experiments were coming from the fission of U-235. Frisch and Meitner carried out further experiments which showed that the U-235 fission yielded an enormous amount of energy, and that the fission yielded at least two  neutrons per neutron absorbed in the interaction. They realized that this made possible a chain reaction with an unprecedented energy yield.
