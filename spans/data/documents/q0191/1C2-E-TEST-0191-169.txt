Fission and Fusion
Comparision of Fission and Fusion Processes
Conversion Factors: 1 G of matter converted = 9.0 X 1020 ergs = 9.0 X 1013 J = 2.15 X 1010 Cal.
Atomic Masses:
Typical Fission:
Mass defect=0.2127 G per mol of U-235 =1.9 X 1020 ergs = 4.6 X 109 Cal.
Mass defect per gram of reactant (U-235)= 9.0 X 10Ü4 G destroyed per gram of reactants. This equals 1.94 X107 Cal produced per gram of reactant.
Fusion Process #1:
Mass defect=0.02560 G per 2 mols of H2.
This is equal to 2.3 X 1019 ergs = 5.5 X 108 Cal.
Mass defect per gram of reactant (H2) equals 0.0064 G. This equals 1.4 X 108 Cal.
Ratio of energy produced=
Fusion Process #2:
Mass defect=0.01863 G per mol of Lithium. This equals =1.7 X 1019 ergs = 4.0 X 108 Cal.
The mass defect per gram of reactant = 0.0023 G.
Ratio of energy produced =
Teacher Comments
This document has been enhanced for Netscape 2.0.
I use this to show why the Hydrogen Bomb is more distructive than the Atomic Bomb. It can also be used to show why fusion reactors are preferred over fission reactors: more energy and less "radioactive ash"
Calculations are done in dietary calories (Calories) to help students relate the energy to something they are familar with.
