Most prokaryotes reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission. During binary fission, the single DNA molecule replicates and the original cell is divided into two identical cells.
Binary fission begins with the single DNA molecule replicating and both copies attaching to the cell membrane.
Next, the cell membrane begins to grow between the two DNA molecules. Once the bacterium just about doubles its original size, the cell membrane begins to pinch inward.
A cell wall then forms between the two DNA molecules dividing the original cell into two identical daughter cells .
