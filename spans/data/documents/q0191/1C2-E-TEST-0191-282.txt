Well, the areas you're asking about are pretty broad and sometimes overlapping. But here's what I know about it: 1 Adult cell cloning: this is a form of reproductive cloning (nuclei transfer) and is designed to create a carbon copy (genome/phenotype) of a mature organism. 2. Cell fusion cloning: this is, more or less, a type of technique where two diploid somatic cells of the same, or different, species are literally fused (membrane to membrane) together in order to create a hybrid cell type, a combination of the two original somatic cells. Now, this could make up one step in the cloning procedure but isn't in itself, cloning. 3. Embryo Transplants: in terms of cloning, this is taking one embryo at an early stage in development, usually before the blastula stage (5 days post fertilization), and splitting the embryo into two or more smaller embryos. If done correctly and at the right stage in development, the smaller split embryos will mature into identical clones. They would be ... Â  more
