a hydrogen bomb requires an atomic bomb trigger because
A        neutrons are necessary to form helium
B        the electrons must first be stripped from the hydrogen atoms
C        high temperatures are necessary to overcome the electric repulsion of the hydrogen nuclei
D        no trigger is needed at all
what is special about iron-56 nuclei?
A        if they are fused with other nuclei, kinetic energy is absorbed, not generated
B        if a star's core becomes primarily iron-56, it can no longer generate the energy required to support itself against its own weight
C        it and all nuclei with more protons are currently generated only during supernova explosions
D        all of the above
four protons weigh
A        more than one helium nucleus
B        less than one helium nucleus
C        the same as one helium nucleus
D        an unknown element
the minimum temperature required for helium "burning" to start in the core of a star is
A        10 million degrees
C        1 billion degrees
D        helium burning can occur in a star's core at any temperature
if all the stars were mostly helium rather than mostly hydrogen, which of the following would be true
A        the centers of stars would be cooler
B        stars would never fuse anything in their centers
C        the centers of stars would be hotter
D        stars would evolve directly to the white dwarf stage
the theoretical limit for the buildup of elements by fusion reactions in stars is
A        iron
