I should state that hydrogen bombs as they are currently fielded are Fission - Fusion - Fission. This is where the centre is a fission bomb, surrounded by often some deuteuride (an element combined with heavy water) and an outer tamper material to contain it all.
The first fission reaction sets the right conditions that enable fusion in the deuteuride and then the resulting high flux of neutrons from the fusion reaction sets off another fission reaction in the remaining fissionable material in the centre and the tamper material which is often fissionable (such as Uranium 238). This provides more "oomph" as it were to the explosion. Such bombs have a very high output with a very low radiation output and so have been touted as "clean bombs". This is in comparison to fission bombs which have a high radiation output for the blast in comparison as un-fissioned material and material which is now radioactive is left over in higher amounts.
A further step on this is a "Neutron Bomb" where the bomb is designed to minimize the blast and the radiation fallout, but there would be an extremely high flux of neutrons given off. Theoretically this would not be destructive to destroy building and infrastructure, but enough to destroy living organisms in the area.
There are also "Cobalt Bombs" Which go the other way and instead maximize the radiative fallout, this was first theorized as an extinction class weapon as it would render fallout shelters incapable of protecting you from the high amount of gamma radiation given off.
You can also get an amalgam of the two products where you have "boosted" atomic weapons. This is where there is a bottle of tritium (or other suitable material) that feeds into the centre of the fissionable part of the fission bomb and subsequently dramatically increases its output.
All in all this makes atomic weapons a very varied and destructive weapon.
