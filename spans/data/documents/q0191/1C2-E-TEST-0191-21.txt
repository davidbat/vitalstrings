For a quick and simple example of how it happens they did a good job. Fission was making some good progress with a global scientist project in San Diego - If I recall correctly Clinton took the funding away and all the researcher went back to their home countries.
The E=GREEN do not want to solve the energy problem they want to limit the amount of energy available so they can then reduce the total global population by 2/3 = SUSTAINABLE POPULATION?
