Fission and Fusion
Fission  : 
Fission  Mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the mass of its parts. mnucleus < mprotons + mneutrons mass defect Mass defect is converted to energy,               and holds the nucleus together E = mc2
Fission Reactions  : 
Fission Reactions  Large nucleus split into two or more smaller ones, with some particles left over (maybe) A tiny bit of mass is converted into energy E = mc2 Law of Conservation of Matter               does not hold true!
Law of Conservation ofMatter and Energy  : 
Law of Conservation ofMatter and Energy  Matter and energy can be converted Total of mass and energy is conserved
Fission Reactions  : 
Fission Reactions  Small amount of matter is lost Large amount of energy is produced
Matter-Energy Conversion  : 
Matter-Energy Conversion  If a total of 1 gram of matter is converted to energy, how much energy would that be? E = mc2 E = 0.001 kg x (3 x 108 m/s)2 E = 9 x 1013 J (1/3 of the total energy produced in           PA nuclear power plants in 2006)

Nuclear Power  : 
Nuclear Power  In Pennsylvania, 34% of our electricity is produced using nuclear power. In the USA, 20% of our electricity is produced using nuclear power.
Nuclear Power Plant  : 
Nuclear Power Plant  Design Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Model Two models will be built, labeled,                  compared Questions about nuclear power Questions about atomic theory
Nuclear Study so far…  : 
Nuclear Study so far…  Radioactive decay Nuclear bombardment Fission reactions  Next… Fusion reactions
Nuclear Fusion  : 
Nuclear Fusion  Two small nuclei joined by bombardment High temperature High pressure
Nuclear Fusion  : 
Nuclear Fusion  H  +  H      ?  +     n  +  Energy
Nuclear Fusion  : 
Nuclear Fusion  H  +  H      ?  +     n  +  Energy
Nuclear Fusion  : 
Nuclear Fusion  H  +  H      ?  +     n  +  Energy
Nuclear Fusion  : 
Nuclear Fusion  H  +  H      He  +   n  +  Energy
Nuclear Fusion in Stars  : 
Nuclear Fusion in Stars  H      He  +  Energy +2  e+  + 2 neutrinos  Since our sun is a smaller                                    star, it will fuse H to He                                    to C Larger stars fuse C to O to                                    Ne to Mg to Si to Fe
Nuclear Fusion in Stars  : 
Nuclear Fusion in Stars  H      He  +  Energy +2  e+  + 2 neutrinos  Elements heavier than Fe                                      are formed when large                                  stars undergo supernova                         explosions.
Nuclear Fusion on Earth  : 
Nuclear Fusion on Earth  Because of the very high temperatures and pressures needed and the very large amount of energy released, we cannot yet control fusion reactions.
