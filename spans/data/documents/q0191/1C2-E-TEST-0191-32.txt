1. does fusion always involve just 2 atoms? i know that fusion and fission both require huge amounts of energy so, is there no way to "bundle" fusion reactions togther to make them more practical?
For all intents and purposes for use on earth, only 2 nuclei are involved. Only rarely do more than 2 nuclei fuse together at once.
3. someone asked me to compare the yields of fusion and fission... any explainations?
4.i found this on the web "For fission of U or P, energies released are around 200 MeV or so. The energy per event is greater (in these examples) in fission, but the energy per nucleon (fusion = about 7 MeV/nucleon, fission = about 1 Mev/nucleon) is much greater in fusion." is this always the case? even when fission reaction are done in large quantities are they always less than fusion reactions(per nucleon)?
A nucleon is a proton or neutron, since they occupy the nucleus.  The energy released in each Fission event is much greater than Fusion events. (An event is one fission or fusion of nuclei)  However, if you look at Uranium, it has around 47 times the mass of the easiest fusion fuels, Tritium-Deuterium. (5 in D-T Fusion, Deuterium has a mass of 2 and Tritium has a mass of 3, compared to 238 in Uranium)
This means that if you use 10 kg of fuel for fission and for fusion, the fusion will give you 47 times the amount of energy that the fission one. (Assuming you used Uranium for fission fuel)
