Fission is the splitting of an atom in which neutrons are bombarded into a nucleus, which makes it highly unstable and it basically splits emitting particles that create a chain reaction and continue the same process.
Fusion is the combination of two tritium atoms (hydrogen isotopes) in which high heat is needed.  Usually a fission reaction is used to produce a fusion reaction (in nuclear weapons).
