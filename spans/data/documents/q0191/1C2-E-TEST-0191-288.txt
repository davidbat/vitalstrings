I have both and the really are very similar in most respects.  One difference I noticed is the Fusion is a little choppy when moving Windows around in Coherence mode while Parallels is smooth.
My one big disappointment with Fusion over Parallels is that Fusion only supports 256MB of video memory while Parallels 7 supports up to 1 GB.  This can make a big difference for gamers.
