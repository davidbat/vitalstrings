O Level Chemistry: Difference between Atom, Molecule & Particle
46 Comments
Can you differentiate between Atom, Molecule & Particle? I received an enquiry from a subscriber to SimpleChemConcepts.com yesterday and i realized that many students have misconception of the different definitions given to them.
When we say Avogadro’s Number states that there are 6 x 10^23 particles for 1 mole of substances, the “particles” is actually a general term.
“Particles” can mean atoms (He gas atoms), molecules (H2 gas, N2 gas molecules), ionic substances (NaCl ionic salt) or even the ions itself (Chloride Cl- anions, Mg2+ cations).
Do not confuse between this “Particle” as the other “Sub-atomic Particle” that is mentioned in the topic of Atomic Structure. The “Sub-atomic Particle” refers to the PEN – Proton, Electrons & Neutrons. These “Sub-atomic particles are smaller than the atoms themselves.
By the way,
Atom is defined as the the smallest component of an element having the chemical properties of the element. Example, any of the elements you see on the periodic table exist as atom.
&
Molecule is defined as a group of two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds. When atoms combine by sharing electrons, molecules are formed. Example, H20 molecules, CO2 molecule, Cl2 gas molecule.
Hope the above explaination helps. Do leave your comments in the “comment” section below.
