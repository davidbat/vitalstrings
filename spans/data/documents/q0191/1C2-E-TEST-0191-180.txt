As stated in the previous post , in order for fusion to take place, a large amount of energy needs to be added to begin the reaction.  This fact makes using fusion as a source of energy impractical.
Fusion-based energy is desirable over fission based energy for a couple of reasons.  First, it’s relatively clean compared with fission energy which produces nasty byproducts known as nuclear waste which must be carefully disposed of.  Second, the fuel for fusion energy is relatively inexpensive compared with fission fuel.
A lot of research has been done into producing fusion energy with minimal energy to begin the reaction.  This is called cold fusion.  It has been the Holy Grail of atomic energy research because it would provide an inexpensive and widely available source of energy.
Several of these experiments have demonstrated excess heat that cannot be explained chemically, inferring that fusion must be taking place.  However, the nuclear byproducts that would be expected are not present in sufficient number to support the cold fusion theory.  In other words, something is happening, but they don’t know what.
