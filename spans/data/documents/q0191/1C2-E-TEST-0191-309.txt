The Fusion S uses P205/60R16 tires and the SE/SEL use 225/50VR17 tires.  The contact patch--the surface area of tire that contacts the road--is smaller in the S with the 60 series tire vs the 50.   So there is less rolling resistance.  The trade off comes in braking and handling performance because there literally is less rubber on the road to stop and steer.   The S also uses the Goodyear fuel saving Assurance radial which has a different rubber compound than the Michelin MVX-4 on the SE and SEL.
The S also uses an aluminum alloy wheel which is lighter than the steel wheel/wheel cover on the SE.   I recall reading somewhere that the weight difference per wheel between the S and SE was 16 lbs per tire/wheel.   Combine that with the wheel and you have a good case for the mileage improvement.
The other power equipment on the SE, such as the power seat, is a momentary drain on the system and a minor one that wouldn't affect the fuel economy.
I really wish Ford did what they did on the first gen Fusion and gave the S the steel wheel/cap and the SE the alloy wheels.  It's all for the sake of fuel efficiency standards.
