Learn the difference between the Nuclear Fusion and Nuclear Fission.
During the Second World War, the humankind has found a weapon that shocked the world. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, showed the world the great destructive power of nuclear fission.
Nuclear fission is the process in which “bombard” the nucleus of a radioactive element with a neutron. This collision results in the creation of an isotope of the atom, completely unstable, it breaks forming two new elements and releasing large amounts of energy.
Nuclear Fission
Nuclear fusion occurs when two or more nuclei of one element fuse and form another element, releasing energy. An example of nuclear fusion is what happens inside stars when four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium atom. This process releases an amount of energy much greater than that released in the process of nuclear fission.
In 1952, they created the H-bomb (hydrogen bomb), which had as its nuclear reactor hydrogen fusion. This incredible weapon of destruction caused in their first experiment, energy about a thousand times larger than the A-bomb (atomic bomb) nuclear fission.
H – BOMB
The main difference between the reactor of an atomic bomb and a nuclear power plant reactor, which is that the fusion reaction is controlled, and it always happens in quantities sufficient to heat the water that will evaporate and turn the turbines of the plant. In the atomic bomb, that reaction is not controlled.
Currently, nuclear energy has been aimed at obtaining power, called nuclear power plants. This name is given due to the heating of the neutrons, used for the fission of the nucleus of atoms like uranium (235U), which generates a high degree of agitation, making a great neutron projectile to break the nucleus.
