Advances in Ceramic Materials
Akira Kohyama, Institute of Advanced            Energy, Kyoto University
Abstract. Carbon and ceramic materials have been utilized in many            areas of fission reactors and the role of those high temperature materials is            becoming more important for the advanced nuclear reactor systems. On the other            hand, fiber reinforced composite materials have been historical and classical            tailored structural materials.
In a few decades, R & D efforts on ceramic composites            have been very extensive, especially in the fields of aero-space and energy.            Among them, C/C and SiC/SiC R & Ds have been very much emphasized in            nuclear energy research.
In the field of fission reactor R & D, gas reactor            technology R & D activities have a wide spectrum from near term PMR/PBR to            generation IV reactors of very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and gas cooled            fast reactor (GFR). Although there have been many progresses in conceptual            design study but supporting activities from engineering and materials have been            still pre-mature and insufficient.
The materials R & D methodology has been quite unique for the case of            ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite materials, such as, C/C,            C/SiC, SiC/SiC, where ceramic fibers, ceramic matrix and interphase connecting            fiber and matrix are the three key components and materials design is done by            optimizing these components to meet the material requirement.
In this presentation, starting with the brief introduction            of ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic composite materials, material design,            process engineering, and performance evaluation methodologies toward the            application to advanced nuclear reactors will be provided.
Fusion Breeders to Fuel Fission Burners, a New (Old) Idea for Fusion Development
Wallace Manheimer,  US Naval Research            Laboratory (Retired)
Abstract. This talk first gives a very brief overview of fusion and its            current status.  It then introduces the fusion hybrid, i.e. using fusion            neutrons to breed fissile material for fission reactors.  The major part            of the talk makes the case that the fusion hybrid could have a significant role            to play in sustainable development [1,2].  It focuses principally on            one possible configuration, the 'energy park'.  This is an area of a few            square miles containing 7 1GWe reactors.  One of these, the key to            the energy park, is an ITER sized fusion reactor run as a hybrid.  In addition            to the power it produces, it also produces fuel for 5 other reactors of today's            design (GEN <~3).  Also in the park is a separation plant which            separates the uranium and actinides from other waste, and a            cooling pool  to store the short lived, highly radioactive waste for            several hundred years.  The seventh reactor is an actinide burner.  The park treats its own waste with a combination of fission, fusion and            patience.  Only thorium enters, only electricity (or hydrogen) leaves.  The park has little or no proliferation risk.  In another            configuration, the fusion breeder could produce proliferation proof fuel for            existing burners or  for export, even to countries we did not fully trust;            as long as spent fuel is sent back for treatment.  Another intriguing            possibility is fission breeders fueling only themselves, while the much more            prolific fusion breeders fuel a large legacy of fission burners.
Finally the talk will discuss the research necessary to make            this a reality.  Five of the seven reactors and the separation            plant could be built today.  The actinide burner, which might be            either a fast or thermal neutron reactor would take some development.  The            hybrid fusion reactor would take considerable development, but there is already            a large fusion budget in place which might be used a resource for this.

Geoscience Needs for Subsurface Storage

Abstract. The nuclear fuel cycle is a key concept when discussing a            sustainable future for nuclear energy and nuclear waste management. To the            first order, there are two approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. An open (or            once-through) fuel cycle, as currently planned by the United States, involves            simply disposing of spent nuclear fuel as waste within a geologic repository.             New nuclear fuel is only derived from mined uranium. In contrast, a closed (or            recycle) fuel cycle, as currently planned by other countries (including France,            Russia, and Japan), involves reprocessing spent nuclear fuel by separating            useable actinides to put into new fuel rods and disposing of other elements            that are inappropriate for nuclear fuel in a geologic repository.  It is            important to note that regardless of the fuel cycle approach, a geologic            repository is required to dispose of long-lived radioactive material. The            constraints for a repository design are primarily the type of waste form(s) to            be disposed of and the inventory of radionuclides they contain.
There is scientific consensus that the disposal of spent            nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in deep geologic formations is            potentially safe and feasible, provided that sites are chosen and characterized            well, and that the combination of engineered and natural barriers is designed            appropriately.  Geologic systems are considered suitable for radioactive waste            disposal because of their stability over long time periods, their ability to            physically and chemically isolate the waste canisters, their property to limit            or significantly retard the release of radionuclides, and their relative            inaccessibility, preventing unintentional or malevolent interventions. For            geologic repositories, the main scenario of possible pathways for radionuclides            to reach the biosphere and expose humans to unacceptably high radiation doses            is the transport by groundwater that contacts and corrodes waste containers,            dissolves the waste form, and leaches the radionuclides into the water, where            they migrate in dissolved or colloidal form towards locations where the            contaminated groundwater is used as drinking water or for agricultural            purposes. Other release and transport mechanisms (such as volcanism, earthquakes,            erosion, meteors, and human intrusion) also need to be considered.
The barriers important to waste isolation are broadly            characterized as engineered barriers and natural barriers associated with the            geologic and hydrologic setting. The engineered barriers are designed            specifically to complement the natural system in prolonging radionuclide            isolation within the disposal system and limiting their potential release.            Natural barriers would contribute to waste isolation by: (1) limiting the            amount of water entering emplacement drifts, and (2) limiting the transport of            radionuclides through the natural system.  In addition, the natural system            provides an environment that would contribute to the longevity of the            engineered components (disposal canisters and waste forms). The components of            the engineered system are designed to complement the natural barriers in            isolating waste from the environment.
The grand technical challenge for nuclear waste disposal is            the need to understand and predict with sufficient confidence flow and            transport processes and performance of materials (engineered and geologic) over            geological time scales (at least to a million years), with long-term climate            changes and the impact of extreme (disruptive) events (e.g., seismic and volcanic            events) taken into account. It is important to enhance the interaction of            engineered barriers with natural systems, to maintain retrievability and            monitoring, and to prioritize/address the performance in a regulatory            framework. The longevity of engineered barrier components depends on the            quantity and chemistry of fluids in the surrounding natural system. Finally,            there is a need to establish a sound foundation for model abstraction and            stochastic approaches used for performance assessment.  Specific research            opportunities include:
1) Engineered materials performance
A major component of the long-term strategy for safe            disposal of nuclear waste is, first, to completely isolate the radionuclides in            waste packages for long times, and then, to greatly retard the egress and            transport of radionuclides from breached packages. Corrosion is a primary            determinant of waste package performance in any storage or disposal environment            and will control the delay time for radionuclide release and transport from the            waste package. Materials optimization must be realized through a coordinated            R&D program.  Areas of enhanced understanding include: a) long-term            behavior of protective, passive films; b) composition and properties of            moisture in contact with metal surfaces; c) rate of penetration and extent of            corrosion damage over extremely long times.
2) Radioactive waste form (which is the source for radionuclide releases)
The goal of source term research is to enhance the            understanding of the performance and evolution of nuclear waste forms (mainly spent nuclear fuel            and nuclear waste glass) and to quantify the release of radionuclides in the            evolving near-field environment expected in the repository. A basic            understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of radionuclide release and a            quantification of the release as repository conditions evolve over time,            particularly at longer times (>105 years), must be developed. Radionuclide            release will be sensitive to variations in temperature, the radiation field,            redox conditions, pH, PCO2, surface area-to-solution volume, and the presence            of near-field materials. Among the important processes that can control            radionuclide release are:
the kinetics of waste form corrosion;
the              formation of secondary, alteration phases;
the reduction and sorption onto              the surfaces of near-field materials.
In addition, biogeochemical processes            and microbial activity may influence the geochemical environment and promote            colloid formation with resultant impacts on waste form stability and radionuclide            transport.
3) Natural systems
The term 'geologic disposal' highlights the key role that            the natural system plays in isolating the waste from the biosphere for as long            as it poses significant risks. Assessment of the barrier capability of the            natural system and demonstration of its significance for repository performance            need to be based on:
an understanding of the features, events, and processes              that could transport radionuclides from the repository to the accessible              environment;
laboratory experiments and field observations and tests to              appropriately characterize the relevant properties at a potential repository              site;
conceptual, mathematical, and numerical models that predict the              behavior and performance of the repository system given its site-specific              characteristics and properties;
natural analogs, which help build confidence              that the model predictions can be reliably extrapolated to the long time scales              required for waste isolation.
Specific features, events, and processes of            interest include long-term climate change; groundwater recharge and discharge;            percolation processes and definition of groundwater flow fields; near-field            effects and thermally coupled processes; radionuclide transport; and low            probability disruptive events (such as volcanic and seismic events).

Advanced Fuels for Actinide Recycling
Sylvie Pillon, CEA - France
Abstract. For the management of high level and long life radioactive            waste (HLLW), a large and continuous research and development effort is carried            out in France in order to provide a wide range of scientific and technical            alternatives according to three main options: partition and transmutation,            disposal in deep geological formations and long term interim surface or            subsurface storage.
For the feasibility demonstration of the HLLW transmutation            in nuclear reactor (essentially Np, Am and Cm), an important program dedicated            to the development of fuels containing minor actinides is underway. The            transmutation of minor actinides has been envisaged to take place preferably in            fast critical power reactors of the 4th generation (Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor            : SFR and Gas-cooled Fast Reactor : GFR), or in fast sub-critical reactors specifically            designed to incinerate minor actinides (Accelerator Driven System: ADS).
Concerning the critical reactors, two recycling methods can            be distinguished. Minor actinides can be diluted in all or in part of the fuel,            in sufficiently weak concentrations as not to affect fuel and core performance:            this is known as homogeneous recycling. Minor actinides can also be            concentrated into targets and managed separately from the fuel within the core            or in the core periphery: this is known as heterogeneous recycling. As for            sub-critical reactor, ADSs employ a fuel composed of minor actinides that            significantly contribute to core reactivity.
Contrarily to the homogeneous fuel, the performance of the            targets and ADS fuels is very different from that of a standard fuel due to            their composition. So a large irradiation program is carrying out to collect            data necessary to model their behaviour under irradiation. This program is            conducted within a collaboration with industrial partners (EDF) and in the            frame of various international collaboration (Europe, USA, Japan, Russia),            using the main material test reactors (MTR) in operation (HFR, BOR60 and            Phénix).
This talk summarizes the main results of this irradiation            program.
Thorium Reactors
Ratan Sinha, Director, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre- India
Abstract. Thorium fuel cycle can be commercially implemented, in a            closed fuel cycle mode, provided several technologies in the area of fuel manufacture            and fuel reprocessing are developed to provide the necessary economic            competitiveness at the required scales of operation. Thorium can be used in            conventional reactors, as has been already demonstrated in the past.  One has            to, however, recognize that the deployment of thorium on a large scale will be            needed in a  time frame when the volume of nuclear energy related activities            globally may increase multi-fold, necessitating enhanced safety, security,            waste management and proliferation resistance related concerns to be addressed.            It is therefore prudent to conceive of thorium reactors along with a necessity            to fulfill enhanced requirements in several key areas.. The presentation will            address issues and scientific challenges associated with large scale commercial            implementation of thorium reactors and identify some associated R&D            directions.  The presentation will also provide a broad over view of the Indian            activities in these directions.
The Role of Nuclear in the Future Energy Mix
Andrew White, GE Hitachi            Nuclear Energy
Abstract. Managing global greenhouse gas emissions from power            generation is a daunting challenge and will require a portfolio of technology            solutions.  As policymakers and utilities move towards 'greener' energy            options, the commercial nuclear industry is ramping up to help to meet the            demand for emissions-free, base load energy generation. The question for the            nuclear industry isn't 'will we build new nuclear power plants,' but instead            'how many can we build and over what time horizon?' The answer to this question            will depend on our ability to solve several pressing challenges.
To be sure, there are questions of regulatory certainty. But            to a much larger extent, the industry must meet challenges of initial capital            costs and construction schedules, human resource availability and expertise,            and materials performance and accessibility, while at the same time ensuring            that plants operate with optimal safety and reliability. Additionally, we must meet            the challenge of managing spent nuclear fuel in the most cost-efficient,            sustainable way possible. Industry and academia can partner to find innovative            solutions to these challenges to accelerate the positive impacts of a dramatic            increase in commercial nuclear power.
Atomistic Simulation for the Development of Advanced Materials
Brian Wirth, University of California, Berkeley
Abstract. Radiation damage, and its consequence to a wide range of            material properties, is a central issue in many advanced technologies, from            light water reactor lifetime extension to the future development of advanced            fission and fusion power plants. Irradiation effects are initiated by the            violent displacement of atoms from their lattice sites, and ultimately            determined by the subsequent diffusional transport and evolution of the point            defects and their clusters, along with the transport of solutes and impurities.
Fortunately, nature has provided hints that it may be possible to            scientifically tailor materials to be extremely resistant to irradiation            effects by promoting the efficient recombination, or 'self-healing', of the            vacancy and self-interstitial point defects that are the principal radiation            damage products. This presentation will first introduce the inherently            multiscale nature of irradiation effects in materials and then describe a            multiscale research paradigm involving a close integration of atomistic-based            computational modeling and advanced experimental techniques required to better            understand irradiation effects. Select results will be presented from this            hierarchical, but atomic-scale based modeling approach that highlight recent            improvements in understanding materials degradation in nuclear environments.
In            particular, results will be presented that provide a basis for understanding the            long-term evolution of displacement cascades and damage accumulation in            irradiated Fe-Cu alloys, the observations of Cr enrichment and depletion at            grain boundaries observed in various irradiation experiments performed on            binary Fe-Cr and ferritic-martensitic alloys, and the dislocation – obstacle interactions in irradiated fcc metals, which control observed            mechanical property changes of irradiated materials.
Finally, the scientific            questions that determine the potential development of irradiation resistant            materials will be discussed.
