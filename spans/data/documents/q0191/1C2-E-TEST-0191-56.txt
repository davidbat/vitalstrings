Fusion is the combination of 2 atoms, and typically releases more energy than fission.  Fusion is the reaction that is happening in the sun, and all the stars in the universe.  It powers life on our planet.
Fission is the breaking apart of an atom into 2 atoms.  This process is used in nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs.
We are able to create a fission reaction, but we have not yet been able to create a fusion reaction that yields energy.  This deals mostly with the energy needed to dissociate the particles in 2 atoms so that they can recombine.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fus… for more information on Fusion, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fis… for more information on Fission.
