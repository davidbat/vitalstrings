Difference between binary fission and conjugation.  Binary fission is the means by which a bacterial cell duplicates its components and divides into two cells.  Conjugation is the transfer of genetic information from one bacterial cell to another by means of a conjugation pili.  With binary fission you initially start out with one cell and end up with two.  With conjugation no new cells are created, you start and end with two cells.  Also, in binarny fission all genetic material is replicated (chromosome, plasmids, etc).  In conjugation, not all genetic material is replicated and passed.
Similarities - both systems replicate at least a portion of DNA.
