CELL DIVISION : BINARY FISSION AND MITOSIS
Table of Contents
Despite differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes , there are several common features in their cell division processes. Replication of the DNA must occur.
Â 
binary fission The method by which bacteria reproduce. The circular DNA molecule is replicated; then the cell splits into two identical cells , each containing an exact copy of the origin al cell 's DNA .
binary fission
The type of cell division by which prokaryotes reproduce; each dividing daughter cell receives a copy of the single parental chromosome .
binomial ...
Binary fission: Mode of reproduction not involving any sex but division of a parent cell into two equally sized offspring .
[edit] Binary fission
Main article: Binary fission
Many, but not all, single-celled organ isms ( unicellular ), such as archaea , bacteria , and protist s, reproduce asexual ly through binary fission.
Binary fission is a method of asexual reproduction used by most prokaryotes (i.e. ... Asexual reproduction theoretically results in two identical cells . ...

binary fission Asexual reproduction in protist s in which mitosis is followed by cytoplasm ic division , producing two new organ isms.
binomial The two names, genus and species , comprising the scientific name.
binary fission mostly; budding
exponential growth, binary fission, asexual reproduction , population dynamics , lag phase , log phase, stationary phase, death phase

For most plasmid types, copies in the cytoplasm are passed on to daughter cell s during binary fission.
Cell reproduction is by binary fission, not mitosis . By this process, a second chromosome is produced that is an identical copy of the first. The cell elongates and the chromosomes separate so that each new cell receives a chromosome .
Linkage The proximity of two or more marker s (e.g., genes, RFLP marker s) on a chromosome ; the closer together the marker s are, the lower the probability that they will be separated during DNA repair or replication processes (binary fission in ...
