Fission Yeast Tel1ATM and Rad3ATR Promote Telomere Protection and Telomerase Recruitment
Author Summary Stable maintenance of telomeres is critical to preserve genomic integrity and to prevent accumulation of undesired mutations that might lead to formation of tumor cells. Fission yeast cells serve as a particularly attractive model system to study telomere maintenance mechanisms, since proteins critical for telomere maintenance are highly conserved between fission yeast and humans. Previous studies have shown that the checkpoint kinases ATM (Tel1) and ATR (Rad3) are required for stable maintenance of telomeres in a wide variety of organisms. Here, we investigated the molecular basis for telomere dysfunction in fission yeast cells lacking ATM and ATR kinases. Our results show that fission yeast ATM and ATR are redundantly required to promote efficient recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits to telomeres, which in turn promote recruitment of telomerase needed to maintain telomeres. Human ATM and ATR kinases might similarly promote telomere protection and telomerase recruitment by promoting recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits.
