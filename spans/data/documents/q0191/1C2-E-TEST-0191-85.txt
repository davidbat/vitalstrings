to get fusion power density.
Discussion:
To calculate the rate of reactions per unit volume, multiply the rate     coefficient, R, by the particle densities of the two reacting species (divide     by two if there is only one species, in order to avoid double-counting the     reaction possibilities).  The p + p => D reaction rate coefficient in the sun     is much lower than that achievable with a deuterium-tritium fuel mix, because     the p + p reaction proceeds by the weak nuclear interaction. Despite the sun's     high density, the low rate coefficient means a proton in the sun will exist     for an average of billions of years before it fuses.  By comparison, a     deuteron in a magnetic fusion power plant would only exist for about 100 seconds,     and a deuteron in an imploding, fully-burned inertial confinement pellet only     for 1.0E-9 seconds.
