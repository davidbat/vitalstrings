It has not been demonstrated to be safe or practical method of burning sludge. If it works, use it to destroy already existing waste. Don't generate more waste there are too many places in the fission cycle that can cause release of radioactivity or material for terrorist bombs.

Neil, dirty bombs are a myth. I thought everyone knew that by now?

This is absolutely great. Now we can safely continue our progress in nuclear power technology (be it with fission or fusion) without Nevada getting screwed. Seriously, we never wanted to be the dumping ground of the US. I say we hurry the hell up with this method, process as much nuclear waste as we can as quickly as possible, and just continue on-site proccessing to reduce the risk of nasty spills or whatever else might happen.

Dirty bombs are an actual possibility, they're just extremly impractical for your average terrorist. Remember, they blow away most of their allowance on AK-47's and quality propaganda videos.

AK-47's are extreemely cheap, they need to get their allowance raised.
As for dirty bombs, in order to get an RDD to send the radioactive material far enough and in sufficient concentration to be harmful it would have to be radioactive enough to make people ill/kill them, within it's presence, then produce an explosion large enough to effectively decimate the area it wishes to disperse the radioactive material over. There was some testing done to see how well an RDD would really work. The finding: not well at all, you'd be better off poisoning a water supply.

And I never wanted neither valuable material being dumped in one of the most inaccessible locations on the planet.

Nope. The conventional explosive in the dirty bomb will kill more people than the radiation release; they simply don't work unless you manage to scare simpletons to the point that they do something stupid that ends up costing lives; in that eventuality I would hold the news organizations complicit in the crime for their constant drumbeat of misinformation.
Terrorists could easily do much better just taking pot-shots at trains transporting chlorine gas, phosgen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide or other vital industrial chemicals that are absolutely deadly.

I have always much preffered burning nuclear waste, both gets rid of it and produces energy, but I have to admit I still don't trust either industry or government to handle highly toxic waste safely.  There are just too many cases when big money is at stake of corners being cut and stuff getting dumped and then everything covered a few years. After that clean up costs more than then original benfits gained.  So my worry is some company cutting corners, lobbying Washington and States to get laws changed because it is "too expensive" operate the industry safely and having the waste end up in water supply from incompentence and greed not terroists.
So I really like the theory, I just don't know how it could be safely implemented in practice.

I don't understand how this would work without creating more toxic radioactive waste. Why don't we do what the French and Japanese do, recycle most of it?  What cannot be recycled could be encase in concrete and dumped into the deepest ocean trenches where the earth's crust is being subducted.  Let nature bury it for the next 100 million years or so.

I heard long ago that dirty bombs are non-lethal. But you miss the point. I also heard a dirty bomb can cause massive disruption in the form of lengthy and expensive evacuation and clean-up. Maybe not really a terrorists choice becuase it isnt so scary, but very effectively fulfills the part of terror that seeks to disrupt and financially injure. Such a bomb doesnt need to create levels of radiation that would kill quickly. Relativley low levels would make it so you just couldnt live or work there until it was cleaned up. It could cause far more damage that way than a more-lethal conventional bomb. It's important for an area struck by terror to recover quickly and show resilience. A dirty bomb attacks that psychological need (and financial recovery), since there would be no quick return to normalcy.

Can we get the author to respond on whether this approach could be used to destroy existing nuclear waste already in storage?  I kept expecting at least a passing reference to this (it would be a fantastic solution to a huge problem), but no such reference ever came...

Not compared to actually killing a whole bunch of people.
The 9/11 attack cost millions of dollars, did billions of dollars of damage and provoked a trillions of dollars response.
That's a million to one lever. A dirty bomb is going to provoke a law response, not a war response; it's not big enough, it's not spectacular enough. It will be cleaned up primarily by evacuating people and having men in fully enclosed suits hose the area down with soapy water, removing trees and soil, removing anything badly contaminated, perhaps another layer of asphalt. It doesn't look all that expensive to me.

Well lets get this project out there and working.  Once proven viable use it at all possible plants.  Also, if it can be used on stored sludge then build one at each storage site.
This way we don't have to transport as much of this radioactive sludge as we do now.
If safe this is a win/win situation. We get more energy while cleaning up!

Spent nuclear fuel is in the form of, solid, refractory ceramic pellets encased in highly corrosion resistant zirconium-clad fuel pins. It's about as water-soluble as a coffee cup; it's not a "sludge".

Here is a related story. The intent would definitely be to eliminate the nuclear waste so far accumulated, and if, for the future, we can cobble together a system that does not leave more waste in its wake, that would be a great thing.

Getting rid of the fissile waste is good if it works but large amounts of heavy radioactive elements sitting in a fission reactor will always be a terrorist target. Fusion will be the only nuclear energy that promises minimum risks to society.

Hasn't been so far and it's quite frankly a terrible choice if you're a terrorist.
Nuclear plants are hardened facillities.  First you'd have to somehow avoid crashing into all the junk in the switchyard to have a chance to hit the containment dome. If you manage to hit the containment dome the most likely outcome is aluminium, styrofoam and flesh confetti. You'd have to hit the containment dome dead center with an engine(if you're slightly off it will just slide off, this is a capsule shaped object with no flat walls). If you manage to puncture the containment dome the most likely outcome is that the nuclear plant SCRAMs and successfully cools the core with any of it's backup diesel generators and sometimes even passive cooling mechanisms. If you somehow manage to cause a melt-down the likely death toll is small; unlike Chernobyl(RBMK design, with dual moderators, losing the water increases reactivity AKA positive void coefficient) a proper reactor is designed so that an accident decreases it's coefficient of reactivity(the fuel will sit and boil water for many hours before it's exposed and may eventually melt, if it does some volatile fission products may escape but they're heavier than air and not much will make it out of a small hole at the top of the containment structure).
If you stroll in the front door with an AK-47 and somehow manage to get passed the armed guards and locked doors it would require a significant level of expertise to manage to actually cause an accident and under most accident scenarios there would just be a costly clean-up without any danger to the public(think three-mile island).

You can't get within 50 meters of a nuclear plant unless you're going through the front door. They hire former military special forces and give them an order, "If something passes through your field of vision, shoot until your magazine is empty, load a new magazine, and shoot until that one is also empty."
Nuclear security is absolutely paramount in this country, almost to the point of ridiculousness. Anyone who's worked in one will tell you there are "no go zones". Basically, if you go there, you will be killed and not a second thought will be had about it.
