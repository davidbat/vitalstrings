Modernism -Tthe Enlightenment Era
By Connor R Sullivan
Historians have divided the 20th century into modernism and postmodernism periods. Some experts believe both to be parts of one larger period, while others take them separately. Modernism, to be very simple, means modern thoughts and practices. It is a cultural movement which includes progressive art and architecture, music, designs and different forms of art. Modernism is manifested by a strong and intentional split in the traditions, and includes reaction against literature, art, etc. Modernism has given us the latest styles and attitudes, as well as revolutionary ideas and practices. For example, modern classic furniture, such as Bauhaus furniture and Modloft furniture are examples of modernism, which have now become an icon of elegance and sophistication.
Roots of Modernism
For historians, modernism may have started in the sixteenth century. This is regarded as the Early Modern period and extends up to 18th century. The actual modernism appeared during the Renaissance period. It was at that time when humans revived the notion of man through art, poetry, philosophy, and through ideas. The roots of modernism are much deeper when it moves to the 19th century, as after World War II, much emphasis was laid on modern visual and performing arts.
This Enlightenment era saw the maturation of human beliefs as well as lead to the Scientific Revolution, which paved way for scientists like Galileo and Newton. Two of the elite people who shaped this era were Charles Darwin, with the theory of evolution, and Karl Marx, who played a significant role in modernism and communism. However, it is in the ideals of Enlightenment that the roots of modernism can be found. Theorists and thinkers of 18th and 19th century believe that virtually everything has a reason: traditions, customs, art, etc.
Characteristics of Modernism
• Modernism is described as a movement away from the apparent objectivity given by the narrators and clear-cut moral positions. Many famous narrative stories come under this aspect of modernism.
• Modernists can be viewed as people who question and focus more on the axioms, i.e. formally declared assumptions or well-defined rules. They reject the theory of Enlightenment thinking and All-Mighty Creator. However, some modernists reject these religious aspects, but not all.
• The language that modernism uses in literature is more in a self-conscious way. It leads to experiments with work, and focuses more on the processes and materials used. In other words, it regards language as a technique to craft the piece of literature, just like an artist crafts a piece of art.
• It emphasizes on discontinuous narratives and includes fragmented forms and collages.
• Modernism rejects the philosophy of high and low, when it comes to the display and distribution of art and architecture.
• It uses image and symbols as frequent literary techniques. According to some historians, it dislocates the true meaning and sense of the work from its original context.
• In literature particularly, it represents a story with the perspective of several different people, with the assumption that the truth is there somewhere.
• In the present-day era, commentators draw modernism as an overall progressive trend of thoughts, which make human beings improve and reform the environment with the help of scientific knowledge and latest technologies. Hence, modernism is an aspect that encourages the re-examination of every piece of existence, be it commerce or philosophy.
