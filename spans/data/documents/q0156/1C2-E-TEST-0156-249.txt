ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR COMMUNITY?  FOR CONNECTION?
WANT TO GO “WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME”?
Become a part of the Arizona Enlightenment Center–a place where strangers become friends–a place where you can re-connect with your “family.” We want to be part of your transformation.
“Come home” to the Arizona Enlightenment Center, a gathering place for those on a spiritual path to awakening. We invite you to join in some of our events as you open yourself to YOUR  next phase of growth. We provide the classes, workshops and experiences  that will help you to raise your consciousness to a level that allows  you to find peace and serenity in your life no matter what is going on  in the rest of the world.  Check out our children’s program, designed to allow children to learn by exploration and according to their own passion.
The Arizona Enlightenment Center has been growing on the west  side of Phoenix since 2005. Over the years we have spent some time in  two different Goodyear locations, and recently we have started in full  forward motion toward manifesting our next location.  Please go to OUR  VISION page to see all the exciting plans and discover how you might  become a part of this amazing journey.
Here is a view of the proposed layout of  our new Center–a one-stop  shop for good health, wellness, and  mind-body-spirit connection–a  place where you can live right, eat  right, and breathe right.
