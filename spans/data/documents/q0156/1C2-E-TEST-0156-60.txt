NEW SITE:  CURRENT POLITICS INCLUDING LINKS TO OVER A DOZEN A+++ MUSICAL CARTOONS ON THE CANDIDATES. 
This site, once the skeptical-educational efforts of JK, it is now currently being                            revised to reflect the varied interests of members of the skeptical group of San Diego, and thus the content of a non-skeptical                            nature are being removed, and placed in the linked site  jerrymondo.    (Other member sites will be found linked in                            suitable locations.)  This revision of this site will take some time, for there are many articles which we desire                            to add to this site and many others to move, and only two have volunteered to continue working upon the site. 
The essays                            which follow are exercises of our rational nature.  They also disabuse certain all too common errors                            in factual foundations and logical inference.  Taken as a whole, the articles contain a scientific explanation of the  Nature of Things (as understood by the Greek atomist school of philosophy).
The                            reference to Socrates (below the title "ENLIGHTENMENT") alludes to his assertion--according to Plato--that the God Apollo                            required of Socrates that he teach the citizens of Athens to know themselves.  Philosophy                            lies at its core. The Greek philosophers of all schools shared a vision of the ideal citizen. California Skeptics feel                            that Apollo is looking over our shoulders.
 
WHY BOTHER?
 
You probable wonder why we have done this.  There                            is the psychological answer:  We like working on this site because of intellectual                            pleasures and the relief of boredom; viz., we get more reinforcements from this activity than others for approximately                            20 hours per week.  And there is the conceptual answer:  the combination of the fulfillment of the utilitarian imperative, and Hope (the chance that this would                            lead to something bigger).  We are unloading years of learning and paper                            collecting.  Nearly all that we have pasted is for the sake of helping both                            you and me rise above our animal side and become both logical and free of spiritual poppycock.  Secondly, it is                            to prmote ataraxia, read  (Love of all things as foundation for happiness).   Why should                            we be knowing and logical? The Greek philosophers replied that such person, all other things being equal, would obtain                            a greater portion of ataraxia.
