 
Hi,
I can’t ever remember writing to somebody without knowing them and congratulating them on their website.  But, having stumbled upon yours recently – I have to congratulate you on the great work you’re doing.
I’ve downloaded a few of your podcasts and listened to them and you nail it with every one of them.  Without going overboard on the accolades – I like your focus on meditation – and the fact that you stress that meditation should be done regularly. And that it  and the peaceful relaxed awareness it engenders should be the focus of our lives. I agree with that 100% – it is as necessary as the food we eat and the air we breathe.
Meditation isn’t new to me – having meditated on and off for 20 years .  But over the last year for some reason – my experiences have become deeper and I’ve finally twigged onto the fact that meditation  actually tunes us into the source of everything.  It’s like having our own personal goldmine – but the rewards are way more valuable than any metal and are so multifaceted.  I’m sure you know what I mean! I cannot begin to tell you how much of a transformation I’ve experienced in myself from when I first started to practice up until  the present time. From complete distraction and confusion and looking back now – severe anguish – to the present time where  all I need is the smallest reminder to step back, tune into that life and experience the sublime nature of the present moment.
I particularly liked your podcast where you made the correlation between meditation and growth – listening to the podcast  was an experience of synchronicity for me.
I live on the other side of the world – so what you’re doing must reach a large number of people – and what you’re doing for them is immensely positive.  In general I like your approach, genuineness and your focus in maintaining a peaceful and aware mindset throughout our daily lives. I don’t need to tell you to keep up the good work.
Regards,
