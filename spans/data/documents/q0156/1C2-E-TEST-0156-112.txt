"The actual reality of this earth exists separately from the realm of intellectual thought, and is a reality in which we have full freedom to envision, create and enjoy the actualization of our heart's desire. The conceptual 'understandings...' of this reality - given to us by a thought-addicted mind - are like endless landscapes of cloud that dominate the sky and absorb the light from the sun, draining the colour and warmth from the land below.  From the outside, these clouds give the illusion of either a soft and inviting lanscape, a dark and threatening one, or somewhere in between, but in reality clouds - like thoughts - are completely insubstantial in essence and incapable of harming us - or supporting us - in any real sense. And no matter how beautiful they look from the outside, when we investigate inside the view is always the same and our perspective always becomes limited.  Up in the clouds is actually an extremely cold, empty and alien place to be, although it can ap
pear to be the opposite when we see them magnificently illuminated from high above or from down below.  So, like clouds that block the sun but never offer any rain, idle thoughts serve us no purpose at all - other than to help us avoid the experience of our real self. In contrast, creative thoughts - like clouds bringing rain to a thirsty lanscape - physically motivate us into action, which leads directly to growth on the earthly level and to a continually expanding experience of our true self.  Creative thought is an essential aspect of our natural human functioning. A healthy mind will act as a servant to the Heart, interpreting the Heart's desire into information, ideas and visions which can then be acted upon, thus giving shape and form to what originates from the formless and weaving the two worlds together." www.WorldofLight.org See More
