WHAT IS SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT? 
The 4 Keys to Spiritual Enlightenment are:
Meditation
Study
Application of what is understood. 
Spiritual ENlightenment  is not a one time event, but a gradual process of balanced increase in Awareness, Understanding, and ability to apply what is known to the art of living, both internally and externally for total integration.
This Program is designed to guide you in a balanced approach to further spiritual develpment.
