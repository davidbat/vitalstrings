Introduction
Enlightenment, also known simply as E, is a free software/open source graphical interface system. It can provide an X Window System window manager for use with GNOME or KDE, or it can also be deployed as a substitute for a full desktop environment. Enlightenment has a rich feature set - extensive support for themes and advanced graphics without sacrificing good performance.
The latest stable release of the software is version 0.16.8.5 . Version 0.17, also called DR17, is currently in development and is designed to be a full-fledged desktop shell based on the new Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). DR17 is a complete rewrite from DR16, targeted toward a range of platforms from embedded systems and mobile devices (including phones) to workstations.
