Live on purpose. Create conscious   communities. Leave this world a better place. -EOE
Welcome to Elements of Enlightenment!
"Elements of   Enlightenment is a grassroots organization of conscious souls, raising awareness of the many dimensions of healing."
Vision: Imagine spending three scrumptiously selfish days on a  beautiful island, nourishing your soul, replenishing your spirit, identifying  everyday actions to ensure balance while you clarify your authentic self. Meet  new like –minded friends in workshops, over delicious meals or simply relaxing  to the sounds of the lapping waters of Lake Winnipesaukee, all while enhancing  your spiritual tools to move forward on you purposeful path.
Event Description: Three day, two night retreat on the private,  secluded Sandy Island YMCA Camp on Lake Winnipesaukee with workshops, speakers,  and recreation activities designed to help you practice mindfulness. You will  have three workshops, three keynote talks, a healing experience and a spa  experience to learn from.
