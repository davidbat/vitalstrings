How to Obtain Hospital Medical Equipment
Sunday, 10 June 2012
Hospital medical equipment comes in many different shapes and forms and can be found in hospitals and clinics across the world. Some countries don’t have equipment that is as technologically advanced as the United States so the US donates the necessary equipment.
There are pieces of this equipment for every type of illness possible. There are breathing machines, heart rate monitors, and surgical tools. All of these devices can be purchased from a medical equipment distributor. The equipment needs to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible because these devices are ultimately what may save a life. There is no room for equipment that is outdated or that malfunctions because of the duties it is charged with. A salesman from a medical equipment company will often visit a hospital and show the doctors the benefits of using that particular piece of equipment. The salesman may also demonstrate how the device is used or bring someone in from their company to train the hospital staff on its uses. Knowing how to use the equipment is as important as making sure it’s in working order.
The biggest expense in a hospital is the cost of the medical equipment. The cost of the equipment can be prohibitive for many smaller hospitals and clinics. This is why it’s important to try and find a company that is willing to negotiate in price so that this equipment is made available to everyone that needs it. Not having the equipment due to the price is unacceptable in the medical field. It is imperative that it is accessible to everyone. It is possible to donate the used equipment when the hospital or clinic upgrades or finds they no longer have a use for that particular piece of equipment. Donations are how underdeveloped countries get most of their medical equipment. This insures that everyone be granted access to the tools that will provide them with the best results.

Healthcare a Bump in the Digital Road
Saturday, 28 April 2012
The path to computerized health records is a slow one.  CNN reports that only 8% of the nation’s 5000 hospitals and 17% of the nation’s 800,000 physicians use a common computerized record keeping system such as those offered by CPOE .
In a 2010 letter to President Obama, signed by John P Holden, Director of the Office of Science and Technology, and Eric Lander, President, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT; they concur that a digital conversion of medical records will outweigh the cost. An excerpt of the letter: “Information technology can help catalyze a number of important benefits including improved access to patient data, which can help clinicians as they diagnose and treat patients and patients themselves as they strive to take more control of their health”.
The government reports this switch to digital records will create roughly 212,000 jobs.  Further it estimates it will save billions by reducing medical errors, and duplicated test by reason of lost records.
The Government’s Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 paved the legal way for the validity of electronic records and signatures more than a decade ago. Specifically this GPEA as it is called prohibits the courts from treating electronic documents and signatures less favorably than their paper counterparts.
Some cite security issues as the medical professions reason for hesitancy to enter the digital age. However the technology for security measures is obviously in place, as most of the world relies on this technology for banking transactions and has for years. Of course there are hackers and the possibility of system failures with any computerized system.  The risk of a computerized system failure though is no greater than the risk of a paper medical file being lost, misplaced or stolen. Public acceptance of an electronic banking system has not waned due to past problems, nor will it provided that the system is standardized, streamlined and can be relied upon at least as much as our current banking system.
Overall Americans are more mobile than ever.  The need to have records available across many providers and health care systems has never been greater.
