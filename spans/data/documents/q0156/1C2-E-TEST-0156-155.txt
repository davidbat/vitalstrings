The Enlightenment Café
In the depths of The Old Vic Tunnels find The Enlightenment Café a Victorian world for aesthetes, geeks, bon-viveurs and enquiring minds. Do the rounds at a Victorian Psychiatric Clinic, be schooled in the science of love at the Institute of Victorian Dating Etiquette, experiment with the inebriating alchemy of Gin Distillation and flaunt your wits in a Speed Debating Tournament. Deeper still discover a series of laboratories and dens where people can congregate and be Enlightened.
