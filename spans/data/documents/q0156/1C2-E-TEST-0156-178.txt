What others are saying about “Evolutionary Enlightenment”…
Integral philosopher Ken Wilber, author of The Integral Vision :
“In Evolutionary Enlightenment, Andrew Cohen has given us a compellingly new, important, even profound work on the nature of spiritual enlightenment in  today’s world. More than an intellectual discussion, this is a book of practice, of actually how to realize this new  Evolutionary Enlightenment. It is truly one of the most significant books on spirituality written in the postmodern  world.”
Human potential pioneer Jean Houston, PhD, author of A Mythic Life:
“If the fourteen-billion-year  cosmic experiment that resulted in our lives is not to end in the next few centuries, it will require brave and brilliant  steps in our spiritual evolution. With instruction at once tough and tender, Andrew Cohen gives us the inspiration and  the means to accomplish the greatest of all endeavors for the human spirit. This is a spiritual masterpiece.”
Marilyn Schlitz, PhD, President and CEO of the Institute of Noetic Sciences:
“We are living in a time of  profound transformation. Learning to navigate the dynamic changes that are unfolding offers each of us the chance to embrace  our role as conscious agents in the evolutionary process. Cohen’s insightful book takes us into this dynamic process,  empowering us to co-create a future for our collective awakening.”
