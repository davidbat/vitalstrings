history of archaeology
Definition: The Enlightenment is the name given to the period in European history during the 18th and early 19th centuries, when there was a re-birth of interest in science and nature. Among the many societal changes that occurred during this period was an increased fascination with the past. England's expanding empire brought European intellectuals into contact with other worlds and other world views, and much discussion concerning the conflict between the Bible and the emerging science took place. Antiquarians of this period include Jacques Boucher des Perthes, J.A.A. Worsaee, C.J. Thomsen, William Stukeley, Auguste Comte, Dominique Vivant (Baron de Denon), Thomas Jefferson, and John Aubrey.
