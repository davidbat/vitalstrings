bipolar enlightenment
'Bipolar Enlightenment' unfolds a discipline  from within the mind as one.
I was diagnosed 'Bipolar I' over twenty years ago. Here I am sharing my practice and the wisdom of others which I find illuminating.
I am not medically trained. I do not give advice. I do not know. I believe that each person has a unique experience and path.
What I have integrated and has worked for me in the past may be different from what is enlightening for me now or in the future and may or may not work for you.
The kinds of approaches in this blog work integrally for me within a whole equilibrium. I try not to zoom in and just focus on one or other thing. It is all integral within a dynamic balance.
May you be well, may you be happy, may you be free from suffering.
