6.        Eighteenth-century artists and philosophers concerned themselves with
the attainment of larity and orderliness. (Repeat view of whole of
number        1)
7.        This desire for an orderly universe reminds us of the Renaissance. (The
Delivery of the Keys, fresco, c. 1482, Pietro Perugino, Sistine Chapel,
Vatican City, Rome, Italy)
8.        The values of the Renaissance-admiration for order…(The Annunciation,
fresco, c. 1440-1450, Fra Angelico, San Marco, Florence, Italy)
9.        …and inspiration from classical antiquity-were also very important to
the artists of the Age of Enlightenment. (St. Sebastian, oil on canvas,
Andrea Mantegna, c. 1431-1506, The Louvre, Paris,        France)
 10. The Enlightenment is a direct outgrowth        of the scientific inquiry into
the physical world in the Renaissance.        This is an anatomical study by
Vesalius, a Renaissance scientist. (Detail from        page of anatomical
studies by Andreas Vesalius, 1514-1564, courtesy        of Mrs. L.B.
McCandless, Greenwich, Connecticut)
11.        In Rembrandt's Anatomy        Lesson , the gentlemen are looking at an open
volume of an anatomy text at the foot of a cadaver.        (Anatomy Lesson of
Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, oil on canvas, 1632, Rembrandt,        Mauritshuis, The
Hague, Holland)
12.        It is identified as one written by Vesalius. (Detail from number 11)
13.        Thus, Rembrandt, a 17th-painter, illustrates the continuity of the
scientific interests of the Renaissance with        those of the 18th-century.
(Detail from number 11)
14.        The spirit of scientific inquiry in the Enlightenment reached extreme
limits when an elegant 18th-century lady kept a cadaver in her carriage
to study anatomy in her spare moments. (Detail from Entrance to Arras
of Louis XIV and Marie-Therese, Adam Frans van der Meulen, 1632-1690,
     Museum of the Chateau at Versailles, France)
15.        To Enlightenment artists, the Renaissance served as model and formula.
Raphael was particularly respected. (Detail, The        School of Athens ,
fresco, 1510-1511, Raphael, Vatican Museums,        Vatican City, Rome, Italy)
16.        His classical subjects and use of geometric perspective and symmetry
appealed to the system-loving intellects of        the Enlightenment.
( Marriage        of the Virgin , c. 1504, Raphael, Brera Museum, Milan, Italy)
17.        The spirit of the Enlightenment, in its balance and symmetry, is
reflected        in Newton's third law, which says that to every action there
is always opposed an equal reaction. ( Detail        from A Woman Holding a Balance, oil on canvas, c. 1664, Jan Vermeer,        National Gallery of Art,
Washington, D.C., Widener Collection)
18.        It is no coincidence that Montesquieu, an 18th-century philosopher,
called for a symmetrical government of checks        and balances! (Portrait
of Montesquieu, painting, 18th century, anonymous        French Versailles,
France)
19.        This was the logical outcome of faith in man's reason and of the
reaction against the unbalanced, powerful, absolutist        monarchies of
Europe. (Portrait of Louis XV, as a boy at 5,        oil on canvas, 1715,
Hyacinthe Rigaud, Museum of the Chateau at Versailles,        France)
20.        The political and scientific ideas of the Enlightenment were discussed
and debated in the fashionable salon, the 18th-century        equivalent of
the modern cocktail party. (Detail from The        Concert at Sans Souci,
18th-century painting, courtesy of The Bettmann        Archive)
21.        (An English Tea at the Home of the Prince of Conti, painting, 1766,

Saint-Aubin, c. 1773, Kunstsammlungen der Veste,        Coburg, Germany)
23.        ( Detail,        A Game of Hot Cockles , oil on canvas, c. 1767-1773,

24.        (Detail from Queen Christine of Sweden and Her Court, Pierre Dumesnil,
1698-1781,        Museum of the Chateau at Versailles, France)
25.        The salons were conducted by well-known ladies like Madame de
Pompadour. (Portrait of Mme. De Pompadour, oil        on canvas, 1759,
Francois Boucher, The Louvre, Paris, France)
26.        In her salon, the brilliant gathered to hear Voltaire's wit…(Voltaire
at his desk, maquette in cut stone, 18th-century, anonymous, Municipal
Museum, St.-Germain-en-Laye, France)
27.        …or to listen while the child Mozart played the piano…(Detail from
     number 21)
28.        …or to chat with that delightful American, Benjamin Franklin, who
succeeded        particularly in charming the ladies. (Detail from Franklin at
the Court of France, 1778, engraving by W.O.        Geller, 1830, courtesy of
the Yale University Library, New Haven, Connecticut)
29.        Some painters of the 18th-century, like Watteau and Fragonard,
illustrated        the decadence of the aristocracy,…(Embarkation for Cythera,
oil on canvas, 1717, Jean-Antoine Watteau, The        Louvre, Paris, France)
30.        …as they danced and flirted away their lives in the years before the
Revolution. (Detail from Bal Masque at the Galerie        des Glaces, from an
engraving by Charles Nicolas Cochin le jeune,        Bibliotheque Nationale,
Paris, France)

34.        (Concert Champetre, Jean-Baptiste Pater, 1695-1736, Beaux-Arts Museum,
Valenciennes, France)
35.        However, many of the intellectuals and artists of the period held an
increasing interest in the middle and working classes. (Ladies with
Water Jugs, Francisco de Goya, 1746-1828)
36.        These painters, like Chardin, avoided the frivolous, decorative style
of the Rococo. They chose instead clear and        simple compositions,…( The
Kitchen-maid , oil on canvas, 1738, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin,
National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., Samuel H. Kress Collection)
37.        …selecting charming middle-class children as their subjects…( The        House
of Cards , oil on canvas, c. 1738, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon        Chardin,
National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Andrew        Mellon Collection)
38.        ( The        Young Governess , oil on canvas, c. 1739, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon

Life , oil on canvas, c. 1755, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon        Chardin, National
Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., gift of Chester        Dale)
41.        The longing for simplicity which these works reflect was a reaction to the pomp of the court. (The Kitchen table, oil        on wood,
Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin, 1699-1779, The        Louvre, Paris, France)
42.        Jean Jacques Rousseau was to have great influence, even on Queen Marie
Antoinette, in his writings advocating the simple,        country life.
(Portrait of Marie Antoinette, oil on canvas, c.        1783, attributed to
Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun, National Gallery of        Art, Washington, D.C.,
     Timken Collection)
43.        The Queen had a country village imported and assembled on one corner of
the grounds at Versailles. (Hamlet at Versailles,        general view of
façade, Richard Mique and Hubert Robert, c. 1780)
44.        There she and her court could play at being shepherds and milkmaids.
(Detail of number 43)
45.        They could dress informally and behave naturally, without having to
assume the artificial manners of the court.        (Detail of number 43)
46.        The 18th century interest in Nature may be traced back through European
history in an uninterrupted flow, at least to        the Middle Ages. (The
Fete at Rambouillet, oil on canvas, c. 1780,        Jean-Honore Fragonard,
Calouste Gulbenkian foundation, Lisbon, Portugal)
47.        (The Flight into Egypt, 1308-1311, Duccio, Cathedral Museum, Sienna,
Italy)
48.        ( The        Flight into Egypt , c. 1500, Vittore Carpaccio, National Gallery of

49.        (The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, 1583-1587, Jacopo Tintoretto,
Scuola        de San Rocco, Venice, Italy; with overlay)
50.        However, 18th-century artists, as artists of all periods, looked upon
nature in their own way. ( Mountain        Landscape with a Bridge , oil on canvas, c.
1785, Thomas Gainsborough,        National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.,
Andrew Mellon Collection)
51.        The view of nature held in the 18th-century is reflected both in Marie
Antoinette's farmhouse, which expresses the        longing for a simple,
innocent country life, and…(Another general        view of number 43)
52.        …in these complex hedges, with their suggestions that man is able to
control the world through Reason. (View of gardens        at Versailles,
1667-1688, Andre Le Notre)
53.        During the Renaissance, artists sought to control their world through the use of perspective. (Draftsman drawing lute,        perspective study,
woodcut, 1525, Albrecht Durer)
54.        This pursuit of an orderly, mathematical universe comes to full flower
with the scientific theories of Newton on one        hand…(View of number 53
with overlay of Newton's formula)
55.        …and these clipped hedges on the other. (Another view of number 52)
56.        This ordering of nature reached an amusing extreme in the garden mazes
and labyrinths on the estates of the nobility.        (Gardens of the Chateau
at Villandry, Villandry, France)
57.        Not all mazes were in gardens, however. The love on intellectual
puzzles        in the 18th-century could also be found in the complex musical
compositions        of the times. (Detail from Portrait of Louis du Bouchet,
Marquis de Sourches, and His Family, by Francois-Hubert        Drouais,
1727-1775, Museum of the Chateau at Versailles, France)
58.        An example of this is the chamber music composition called, "The
Musical Offering." It was written by Johann        Sebastian Bach for King
Frederick the Great. (Score page from "The        Musical Offering")
59.        Frederick was King of Prussia and played the flute rather well. He
composed a flute theme and gave it to Bach,        asking him to write some
variations on it. (Detail from The Concert at        Sans Souci, 18th-century
painting, courtesy of The Bettmann Archive)
60.        Bach, like Diderot, had an encyclopedic mind. He used all kinds of
musical language to write his "Musical Offering." (Portrait        of Johann
Sebastian Bach, E. Haussman, courtesy of the        Francis G. Mayer Art Color
Slide Company)
61.        He began with Frederick's flute theme…(Score page from "The Musical
Offering")
62.        (Score page from "The Musical Offering")
63.        He then proceeded to write 13 different units; each one a variation on
this same theme; each one with the same basic        melody;…(Bach with score
of "The Musical Offering")
64.        …but each one quite different from every other. They are a series of
brilliant intellectual inventions. (Bach with        score of "The Musical
Offering")
65.        Let us listen again to Frederick's theme, which opens "The Musical
Offering," and then see what Bach does        with it. (Whole of number 59)
66.        (Same as number 59)
67.        This music is built like the rounds we all sing, but is much more
complicated. (18th-century orchestra group,        engraving, courtesy of the
Bettmann Archive)
68.        (Engraving of 18th-century musicians)
69.        Musicians describe these techniques with words like fugue, canon, or
ricercar. The word fugue means chase, and we        can hear the melody being
chased by the same melody, only played a little        later, and by a
different instrument. (Detail from La Musique,        Jacques-Francois
Courtin, 1672-1752, Musee Dobree, Nantes, France)
70.        (Engraving of 18th-century musicians)
71.        The word canon means rule or law. The whole composition is a skillful
use of musical rules in a variety of ways. (Same as number 70)
72.        (Same as number 70)
73.        Bach's love of musical structure, his scholarship, his encyclopedic
ambition, all combine to identify him as a man        of the Enlightenment.
(Same as number 60)
74.        Just as nature had been a constantly recurring theme in European
history, so the interest in classical antiquity        appears again and
again. (Burning of Rome, Hubert Robert, 1733-1808,        New Museum, Le
Havre, France)
75.        In the arts, classicism during the 18th-century meant the attainment of
the highest standard of beauty. (Temple in Ruins,        drawing, Hubert
Robert, 1733-1808, Beaux-Arts Museum, Lille,        France)
76.        Thomas Jefferson was an architect as well as a farmer and politician.
(Portrait        of Thomas Jefferson, oil on canvas, American)
77.        He designed the University of Virginia…(Façade of Rotunda, University
of Virginia, begun 1817, Thomas Jefferson, Charlottesville, VA)
78.        …with the buildings of ancient Rome in mind. (Façade of the Pantheon,
A.D.,120-124, Rome, Italy)
79.        The statehouse of Virginia, at his suggestion, was modeled after a
Roman temple…(Façade of State house of Virginia,        1785-1792, Thomas
Jefferson, Richmond, Virginia)
80.        …called the Maison Carree. Jefferson said of the building that he could
sit gazing whole hours at the Maison Carree,        like a lover at his
mistress. (The Maison Carree at Nimes, built        in 16 B.C. by Roman
architects; painting by Hubert Robert, 1733-1808,        in the collection of
 The Louvre, Paris, France)
81.        This is an office building, designed by a French architect of the
18th-century. (Façade, The Director's Pavillion,        Salt Mines at
Arc-et-Senans, 1773-1775, Claude-Nicholas Ledoux)
82.        And this is a temple in Italy, built during the 5th century B.C. (View
of Temple of Ceres, 5th century B.C., Greek        architect, Paestum, Italy)
83.        The ancients were important in the politics of the Enlightenment as
well. The philosophers of the Enlightenment        were dissatisfied with
their political situation-a corrupt and all-powerful        monarchy. (The
Family of Charles IV, oil on canvas, 1800, Francisco        de Goya, Prado,
Madrid, Spain)
84.        They looked to Greece and Rome, especially Republican Rome, for the
model of a better government. (View of Roman        forum, showing Arch of
Titus, c. A.D. 81 and Colosseum, dedicated in        A.D. 80)
85.        We have seen that the men of the Enlightenment had great confidence in
their ability to reason out their problems. ( The        Skater , Gilbert
Stuart, 1755-1828, National Gallery of Art,        Washington, D.C., Andrew
Mellon Collection)
86.        And we have talked of Montesquieu, with his opposition to absolute
monarchy, and his suggestion of a government        of checks and balances.
(Print of Liberty with Balances, 19th-century,        American, Library of
Congress, Washington, D.C.)
87.        King Louis XV said, in 1766: "The supreme authority is vested in my
person alone, the legislative power is mine, public order stems from
me-I am its highest representative." (Portrait of Louis XV,        Carle van
Loo, 1705-1765, Museum of the Chateau at Versailles,        France)
88.        However, Jean Jacques Rousseau, in his Social Contract, observed about conditions        in the 18th-century that "Man is born free, but he is
everywhere in chains." (A Peasant Carrying        the Burden of the Clergy and
Aristocracy on His Back, engraving, 1789, Musee        Carnavalet, Paris,
France)
89.        And he continued by suggesting that the best kind of government should
be based upon an agreement between the people        and the ruler-the people
giving the ruler his power in exchange for his        promise to do their
will, (The Oath of the Tennis Court, sketch        for the painting, c. 1789,
     Jacques-Louis David, Museum of the Chateau        at Versailles, France)
90.        In 1775 the "shot heard 'round the world" was fired. The American
Revolution was to have an electrifying effect        on the Europe of the
absolute monarchies. (A Battle of the Revolutionary        War, print, 19th
century, American)
91.        What the Americans had done-and done successfully-was to shift the
responsibility for government to the shoulder        of all the citizens.
(Declaration of Independence, oil on canvas,        1786-1794, John Trumbull,
Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven,        Connecticut)
92.        American state constitutions and the Declaration of Independence were
translated into French. (Facsimile of the Declaration        of Independence)

100.        …parmi lesquels nous comptons la vie, la liberte, et la quete du

101.        The paintings of Jacques-Louis David were to have special meaning for
Frenchmen, inspired by the Americans. ( Portrait        of Jacques-Louis David ,
oil on canvas, c. 1815, Georges Rouget, National        Gallery of Art,
Washington, D.C., Chester Dale Collection)
102.        He chose subject matter from Greek and Roman history. ( The        Death of
Socrates , 1787, Jacques-Louis David, The Metropolitan        Museum of Art,
New York, Wolfe Fund, 1931)
103.        Appropriate to the time, his paintings carried a propaganda message.
(Detail        from number 102)
104.        Finished in the crucial year 1789, this painting entitled The Lictors
Bringing Back to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons        suggests…( The        Lictors
Jacques-Louis David, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford,        Connecticut)
105.        …that if this Roman consul could make the supreme sacrifice of
condemning his own treacherous sons to death,…(Detail        of Brutus from

106.        …then Frenchmen should also make great personal sacrifices for the
causes of liberty, fraternity, and equality.        (Detail of women from
number 104)
107.        The political philosophy of the Enlightenment was given inflammatory
purpose by David. (Repeat of number 104)
108. In his Oath        of the Horaces , painted in 1784, the subject was again from
Roman antiquity. (Oath of the Horaces, oil on        canvas, finished 1785,
Jacques-Louis David, The Louvre, Paris,        France, photograph courtesy of

111.        No Frenchman could mistake the message! (Repeat of number 108)
112.        The Age of Enlightenment had begun basking in the glories of King Louis
XIV's Court. (Detail, Ceremony in the King's Chambers, Francois Marot,
1666-1719, Museum of the Chateau at Versailles, France)
113.        But in its love and luxury,…(Porcelain room, decorated with black
laquer, 18th-century, Schonbrunn Palace, Vienna,        Italy)
114.        …its fascination with science,…(Balloon Ascent, engraving from
Opuscoli, Agostino Gerli, published in 1785        by Stamperia Reale, Parma,
Italy)
115.        …its pursuits of the world of ideas, it forgot to listen to the cries
of the common man-for equality and justice.        (Detail from Portrait of
Queen Marie Leczinska, oil on canvas, c. 178,        Jean-Marc Nattier, Museum

116.        The Age of the Enlightenment ended in dismay-with the rising up on
violence of the new forces for reform-for REVOLUTION!        ( Liberty Leading
the People against he Barricades, oil on        canvas, 1830, Eugene
Delacroix, The Louvre, Paris, France)
