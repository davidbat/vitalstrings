•      But more important was he work  on the Social Order of the Universe
Newton’s Important Work
•      Newton’s Mathematical Principles of Natural  Philosophy was published in Latin in  1687.
•      He should the whole universe  worked according to fixed laws.
•      Those laws were Natural Laws.
•      He saw the world as a great  mechanical work of God.
•      Soon people thought this was  better than Revelation.
John Locke (1632-1704)
•       He wrote a treatise on the  defense of England’s Glorious  Revolution of 1688.
•       This was called Two Treatises of Government in 1690.
•       In the Second Treatise he noted  men are free, equal, and independent.
•       People submit to government  because they find it convenient.
•       Not because of a divine right of  the monarchy.
•       People make a compact or contract  with the government to be governed.
 Locke  Challenges Tradition
•      He denied that people submit to  authority from birth.
•      In his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).
•      Locke believed that the newborn  mind was tabula Rasa,  a blank slate.
•      In other words, environment and  reason were more important than heredity and faith.
The Result of Locke’s Work
•      Locke paved the way for a  critical examination of the Old Regime.
•      Consequently the men of the  enlightenment grasped for what they called “The Newtonian World Machine.”
The Dark Side: A Question of Hobbes
•       Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) had a  different view.
•       He believed that man was driven  to government by the fear of extinction.
•       He supports absolute monarchy.
•       His main work was the Leviathan (1651).
The New Thinking Supports  the Philosophes
•      Technological advances were  supported by the public faith in natural law and progress.
•      The Philosophes cheered each and  every new advance in scientific research.
Advances in Biology
•      A key player was Linnaeus (1707-78).
•      He demonstrated the natural laws  in family relationships.
•      He classified every known plant  and animal and classified them by species.
•      He placed species in a genus and  then into a class.
Work in Chemistry
•      Two important figures were Joseph Black (1728-88) and Lavoisier (1743-94).
•      Lavoisier studied gasses and  introduced the term oxygen.
•      Lavoisier also discovered that  water is composed of both hydrogen and oxygen.
•      Lavoisier believed that all  substances were composed of a relatively small number of basic elements.
•      That number was 23.
•      One important person was Laplace (1749-1827).
•      He was called “The Newton of  France.”
•      He worked on celestial mechanics  and explained the movement of the solar system in as a series of mathematical  formulas and theorems.
Physics
•       An significant American was Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790).
•       He demonstrated that lightening  and electricity were one and the same.
•       His experiment with a kite in a  thunderstorm drew worldwide attention.
•       He even visited Versailles.
 The  Impact on the Philosophes
•      Almost everybody in the 18th  Century who thought they were somebody tried an experiment.
•      Voltaire was serious about  Chemistry.
•      Montesquieu studied Physics.
•      Many European countries had a  Royal Society to promote knowledge.
•      Soon this fanned out into the  countryside.
The Internationalization of Knowledge
•      The scholars or philosophes paid  little attention with national borders.
•      Even in wartime they  corresponded with each other.
•      In other words, it was business  as usual.
The Cosmopolitan World of the Eighteenth
Century Thinkers
•      The roots of the movement were  found in France and England.
•      Soon it spread to Scotland,  Germany, Italy, Spain, and even the New World.
