I had the great honor to do an interview with Gene Hutloff and W. Kirk MacNulty. This interview was planned at the last minute and neither of them knew what I was going to ask, so they had no time to prepare. The room was far from being lit well but we did our best at the end of a long day and hundreds of miles of traveling together.
I think the content of this video is impressive and every Mason should know about The Taxil Hoax and how it still effects Freemasonry. Click here to read more about the Taxil Hoax
