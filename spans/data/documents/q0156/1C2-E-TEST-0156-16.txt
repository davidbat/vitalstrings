"The doors to living an enlightened life open with the keys of
silence and just being.  Leave your thoughts behind and enter."
~Dr. Robert Puff, Meditation Expert
Who am I? Why am I here? Where am I going?

Sincere human beings always ask themselves these questions. We were born into the world without an instruction manual and seem to be making it up as we go along. But deep in our center, in our inmost self, we remember who we are and have never forgotten our purpose. The instruction book is inside us, if only we quiet the chattering mind long enough to take a look.
Discovery of the forgotten self has traditionally been called enlightenment. In these podcasts and articles, Dr. Robert Puff, a respected psychologist and meditation teacher, shares his insights on enlightenment derived from his thirty years of personal experience meditating. If you are new to meditation and wonder where it all is heading, or if you’re a long-time meditator trying to make sense out of your new perceptions of life, these podcasts and articles are for you.
“You can truly live a peaceful, blissful, enlightened life. The only thing keeping you from it is your misconception of who you are. If you discover your true nature and learn how to just be, life will be transformed beyond your greatest expectations. I will help you on this step-by-step path.”
~ Dr. Puff
