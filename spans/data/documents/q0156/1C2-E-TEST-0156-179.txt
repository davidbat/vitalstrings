    Enlightenment....
    This spell requires two blue candles and one candle to portray yourself, and sandalwood oil.
    Anoint candles with the oil and visualize yourself being translike state. place blue candles on either side of the chosen candle, light the blue candles and say unto thyself:
    -Spirit guides/ higher self hear my plea
    -Come now and converse with me
    -Walk me and guide me through this veil trance, I ask of you
 
Now sit in a comfortable position and become aware of your breathing patterns. Inhale deeply, exhale deeply, listen to rhythmic body and breathing motions. become relaxed and close your eyes. Focus on your third eye and visualize red, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue, indigo, purple, and white in order. Hold each color for a count of five. Watch as it fades into each color, still focusing on third eye. Watch your breath and see your chest rise and fall with with air (eyes still closed) and watch your breath as it as it changes into waves. Now visualize a door on water.  Visualize yourself go in and visit with your spirit guide and ask questions. trust he answers you receive. Walk out the door, watch the waves turn back into breathing patterns. now open your eyes and say upon yourself:
        -I return to earth again
        -Thank you spirit self and friends
Then blow out the candles in reverse order, first your chosen candle and then the blue candles.
 
 This spell is very good to do before trying other in-depth spells.
