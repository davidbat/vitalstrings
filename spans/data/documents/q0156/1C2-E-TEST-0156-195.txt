Spiritual Midwifery            - Natural Childbirth
Birth is a rite of passage which will affect the incoming soul forever            in all relationships. Western medicine is concerned with government            policies - not with spiritual matters. Consequently, the birthing process            can be disempowering. Parents-to-be need realistic information to be            able to make informed choices.
