Are       You Ready for a Metaphysical Awakening? 
Do You Have a Sincere and    Burning Desire to Know Spiritual Enlightenment and Growth?
Are You Willing to Drop Limiting Beliefs That Prevent Your Awakening?
If Your Answer Is Yes, Then You Are Ready
 
This is a bold statement, but if you    choose to proceed, you can realize your own spiritual enlightenment now. If you have been searching for your    core spirituality for many years, it may seem counter to everything you have come to believe.
Attaining spiritual enlightenment is not difficult. You do not have to be born with a destiny to become enlightened. You do not need to sit in a Himalayan cave for twenty years or study with a guru for thirty. It does not take discipline, hard work, hours of meditation, or attainment of mystical experiences or powers. It is neither experiential nor attainable. It is your realization.
Advaita is the name of the 5000-year-old path to spiritual enlightenment. It means not two. It is also known as non-duality. It has been championed by many greats from antiquity to the present by familiar names such as: Krishna, Jesus (Gospel of St.Thomas), Swami Paramhansa Yogananda, U.G. Krishnamurti, Papaji, Gangaji, Sri Nisagadatta Maharaj, Osha, Adyashanti, Eckhart Tolle, and many others.
A focused and accelerated direct path for modern man is now available. When you are ready to bridge the gap between the conceptual and non-conceptual knowingness, this accessible guide is available to all who have a burning desire to awaken to the here and now. This is not about adopting a new set of beliefs. It is beyond belief, because belief is not necessary once you reach non-conceptual knowing.
