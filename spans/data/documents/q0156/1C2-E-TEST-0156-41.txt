Enlightenment DR16
Enlightenment, Development Release 16 was first released in 2000, and went 1.0 in 2009. It is still under development today, regularly updated by its maintainer Kim 'kwo' Woelders. With compositing, shadows and transparencies, E DR16 kept all of the speed but with up to date refinement.
To install E16
Simply run
# pacman -S enlightenment
E can be quite different from the other WM's out there, read /usr/share/doc/e16/e16.html after installation to learn more The man page is at 'man e16' , not 'man enlightenment', and only gives startup options.
(The name Enlightenment supposedly is reserved for the time the main project reach 1.0 - the current 16 and 17 are actually 0.16 and 0.17, as their DR names suggest.)
Basic Configuration
Most everything in E DR16 resides in ~/.e16 and is text-based, editable at will. That includes the Menus too.
Shortcut keys can be either modified by hand, from the ~/.e16/bindings.conf or with the e16keyedit software provided as source on the sourceforge page of the e16 project.
Background images
You have to copy the desired wallpapers into ~/.e16/backgrounds/
MMB or RMB anywhere on the desktop will give access to the settings, select /Desktop/Backgrounds/
Any new item copied there will get the list auto-updated. Select desired wallpaper from drop-down menu.
Start/Restart/Stop Scripts
Create a Init , Start and Stop folders in your ~/.e16 folder: any .sh script found there will either be executed at Startup (from Init folder), at each Restart (from Start folder), or at Shutdown (from Stop folder); provided you allowed it trough the MMB / settings / session / <enable scripts> button and made them executable with chmod +x yourscript.sh.
Compositor
Shadows, Transparent effects et all can be found in MMB or RMB /Settings, under Composite .
