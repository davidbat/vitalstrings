     The          quantity and diversity of artistic works during the period do not fit
easily          into categories for interpretation, but some loose generalizations may
be          drawn. At the opening of the century, baroque forms were still popular,          as
they          would be at the end. They were partially supplanted, however, by a
general          lightening in the rococo motifs of the early 1700s. This was followed,
after          the middle of the century, by the formalism and balance of
neoclassicism, with its resurrection of Greek and Roman models. Although          the
end of          the century saw a slight romantic turn, the era's characteristic accent
on          reason found its best expression in neoclassicism.
 
     In          painting, rococo emphasized the airy grace and refined pleasures of
the          salon and the boudoir, of delicate jewelry and porcelains, of wooded
scenes,          artful dances, and women, particularly women in the nude. Rococo
painters          also specialized in portraiture, showing aristocratic subjects in
their          finery, idealized and beautified on canvas. The rococo painting of
Antoine          Watteau (1684-1721) blended fantasy with acute observations of nature,
conveying the ease and luxury of French court life. Watteau's successors          in
France          included Francois Boucher (1703-1770) and Jean Fragonard (1732-1806).
Italian          painters, such a Giovanni Tiepolo (1696-1730), also displayed rococo
influences. English painting lacked the characteristic rococo frivolity,          but
the          style affected works by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) and Thomas
Gainsborough (1727-1788), whose portraits tended to flatter their          aristocratic
subjects.
     Eighteenth-century neoclassicism in painting is difficult to separate
from          some works in the era of Louis XIV. Both Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) and
Nicolas          Poussin (1594-1665) had earlier projected order and balance, often in
grandiose scenes from antiquity or mythology. Jean Chardin (1699-1779)          carried
some of          this over into the 1700s. The neoclassic approach, however, often
expressed powerful dissatisfaction and criticism of the existing order,
sometimes in stark realism and sometimes in colossal allegory. The most
typical          representative of this approach was Jacques Louis David (1748-1825),
whose          most famous work, Death of Socrates illustrates his respect for
Greco-Roman tradition. His sketch of Marie Antoinette enroute to the
guillotine clearly represents his revolutionary sympathies. The best          examples
of pure          realism and social criticism are the London street scenes by the
English          painter William Hogarth (1697-1764) and the Spanish court portraits of
Francisco Goya (1746-1828).
     The          number of women painters increased during the eighteenth century, but
they          were so limited by traditions and so dependent upon public favor that
they          could hardly maintain consistent styles. Very few were admitted to
academies, where their work might be shown; in France, they were not          permitted
to work          with nude models. The result was their practical restriction to
still-life and portraiture. Among rococo painters, the two best-known          were
Rachel          Ruysch (1664-1750), a court painter of flowers in Dusseldorf, and
Rosalba          Carriera (1675-1757), a follower of Watteau, who was admitted to the
French          Academy in 1720. Two very famous French portrait painters and members
of the          Academy, were Vigee Le Brun (1755-1842) and Adelaide Labille-Guiard
(1749-1803). If possible, they were overshadowed by Angelica Kaufmann
(1741-1807), a Swiss-born artist who painted in England and Italy. All          three
were          celebrated intheir time. Each produced grand scenes in the neoclassical
style,          but their market limited them to flattering portraits, at which they
excelled.
     Neoclassicism also found expression in architecture and sculpture.
Architecture was marked by a return to the intrinsic dignity of what a
contemporary called "the noble simplicity and tranquil loftiness of the
ancients." The Madeleine of Paris is a faithful copy of a still-standing          Roman
temple,          and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin was modeled after the monumental
entrance          to the Acropolis in Athens. In England, where the classical style had
resisted          baroque influences, the great country houses of the nobility now
exhibited a purity of design, which often included a portico with          Corinthian
columns.          Mount Vernon is an outstanding example of neoclassicism in colonial
America.          The trend in sculpture often revived classical themes from Greek and
Roman          mythology; statues of Venus became increasingly popular. Claude Michel
(1738-1814) and Jean Houdon (1741-1828) were two French neoclassical          sculptors
who also          achieved notable success with contemporary portraits. Houdon's
Portrait          of Voltaire is a well-known example.
 
     At          the opening of the eighteenth century, music demonstrated typical
baroque          characteristics. These were evident in instrumental music, especially
that of          the organ and the strings. The most typical baroque medium was opera,
with its          opulence and highly emotional content. The era culminated in the
sumptuous religious music of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), a          prolific
German          organ master and choir director. Bach's equally great contemporary, the
German-born naturalized Englishman, George Frideric Handel (1685-1759),          is
known          for his grand and dramatic operas, oratorios, and cantatas; he is best
known          today for his religious oratorio, Messiah (1742).
 
     Composers of the late eighteenth century turned from the heavy and
complex          baroque styles to classical music of greater clarity, simpler
structures, and more formal models. Plain, often folklike melodies also          became
common.          With the appearance of symphonies, sonatas, concertos, and chamber
music,          less interest was shown in mere accompaniment for religious services or
operatic          performances. The general emphasis on technical perfection, melody,
and          orchestration is summed up in the work of the Austrian composers Franz
Joseph          Haydn (1732-1809) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791). Haydn wrote
over 100          symphonies, along with numerous other works. Mozart wrote more than
600          works, including 41 symphonies, 22 operas, and 23 string quartets,
climaxing his career with his three most famous operas: The Marriage of          Figaro
(1786)          Don Giovanni (1787), and The Magic Flute (1791).
 
     Musical expression at the turn of the century was touched by the genius
of the          immortal German composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827). The passion
of his          sonatas and symphonies expressed a revolutionary romanticism, which
challenged the sedate classicism of his time.
 
Reflections Of The Age In Literature
 
     More than in art, neoclassicism in literature came closer to voicing the
eighteenth century's fascination with reason and scientific law. Indeed,          the
verbal          media of poetry, drama, prose, and exposition were commonly used to
convey          the new philosophic principles.
 
     A          typical poetic voice of the Age of Reason in England was Alexander Pope
(1688-1744). In his most famous work, An Essay on Man (1733), Pope          expressed
the          optimism and respect for reason that marked the era. He described a
Newtonian universe in the following often quoted lines:
 
          All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
          Whose body nature is, and God the soul ...
          All nature is but art, unknown to thee;
          All chance, direction, which thou cannot see.
          All discord, harmony not understood;
          All partial evil, universal good
          And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,
          One truth is clear: Whatever is, is right. ^5
 
[Footnote 5: Quoted in G. K. Anderson and W. E. Buckler, eds., The          Literature
of          England, 2 vols. (Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman, 1958), vol. 1, p.          1568.]
 
Two          other poetic voices deserve mention here. One belonged to the English
Countess          of Winchelsea (1661-1720), who extolled reason and feminine equality
in her          verse. The other was that of a Massachusetts slave girl, Phyllis
Wheatley          (1753-1784), whose rhyming couplets, in the style of Pope, pleaded
the          cause of freedom for the American colonies and for her race.
 
     Reflecting the common disdain for irrational customs and outworn
institutions were such masterpieces of satire as Candide (1759), by the          French
man of          letters, Francois-Marie Arouet, better known as Voltaire (1694-1778).
Another          famous satirist, England's Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), ridiculed the
pettiness of human concerns in Gulliver's Travels (1726), wherein          Captain
Gulliver, in visiting the fictitious land of Lilliput, found two          opposing
factions: the Big-endians, who passionately advocated opening eggs at          the big
end, and          the Little-endians, who vehemently proposed an opposite procedure.
 
     The          novel became a major literary vehicle in this period. It caught on
first in          France during the preceding century and was then popularized in
England.          Robinson Crusoe (1719), by Daniel Defoe (1659-1731), is often called
the          first modern English novel. The straight prose of the novel satisfied a
prevailing demand for clarity and simplicity; but the tendency in this          period
to focus          on middle-class values, heroic struggle, and sentimental love
foreshadowed the coming romantic movement. Writing along these lines          Samuel
Richardson (1689-1761) produced Pamela (1740-1741), the story of a          virtuous
servant-girl, and Henry Fielding (1707-1754) wrote the equally famous          Tom
Jones          (1749), the rollicking tale of a young man's deep pleasures and
superficial regrets. Each novel, in its own way, defined a natural human
morality.
     In          both France and England women found a uniquely promising outlet for
their          long-ignored talents in the romantic novel, with its accent on personal
feminine          concerns and domestic problems. Two among the multitude of able
French          women novelists were Madame de Graffigny (1695-1758), whose Lettres
D'Une          Peruvienne (1730) became a best-seller, and Madame de Tencin
(1682-1749), who wrote The Siege of Calais, a historical novel of love          and
danger.          In England, Fanny Burney (1753-1840) was universally acclaimed after
publication of her first novel, Eveline (1778), about "a young lady's          entrance
into the          world." Aphra Behn (1640-1689) was an early playwright whose novel,
Oroonoko          (1688), was a plea for the natural person, long before the works of
Defoe          and Rousseau.
The          Enlightenment And The Age Of Reason In Philosophy
 
     Western Europe's worship of reason, reflected only vaguely in art and
literature, was precisely expressed in a set of philosophic ideas known
collectively as the Enlightenment. It was not originally a popular movement.
Catching          on first among scientists, philosophers, and some theologians, it was
then          taken up by literary figures, who spread its message among the middle
classes.          Ultimately, it reached the common people in simplified terms
associated with popular grievances.
     The          most fundamental concept of the Enlightenment were faith in nature
and          belief in human progress. Nature was seen as a complex of interacting          laws
governing the universe. The individual human being, as part of that          system,
was          designed to act rationally. If free to exercise their reason, people          were
naturally good and would act to further the happiness of others.          Accordingly,
both          human righteousness and happiness required freedom from needless
restraints, such as many of those imposed by the state or the church.          The
Enlightenment's uncompromising hostility towards organized religion and
established monarchy reflected a disdain for the past and an inclination          to
favor          utopian reform schemes. Most of its thinkers believed passionately in
human          progress through education. They thought society would become perfect if
people          were free to use their reason.
 
     Before the eighteenth century, the Enlightenment was confined to Holland
and          England. Its earlier Dutch spokesmen were religious refugees, like the
French          Huguenot Pierre Bayle (1674-1706), whose skepticism and pleas for
religious toleration were widely known in France. Baruch Spinoza          (1632-1687),
a Jewish          intellectual and Holland's greatest philosopher, was a spokesman for
pantheism, the belief that God exists in all of nature. Spinoza's          influence,
along          with Newton's, profoundly affected English thinkers. Mary Astell
(1666-1731), perhaps the earliest influential English feminist, lauded
rational          thinking and cited Newton as proof of an ordered universe. Such ideas
were          given more credibility by John Locke (1632-1704), the famous English
philosopher. Back home from exile in Holland after the Glorious          Revolution of
the          1680s, Locke applied Newton's recently published principles to          psychology,
economics, and political theory. With Locke, the Enlightenment came to
maturity          and began to spread abroad.
 
     After the Peace of Utrecht (1713), the Enlightenment was largely a          French
Phenomenon. Its leading proponents were known as the philosophes,          although the
term          cannot in this instance be translated literally as "philosophers." The
philosophes were mostly writers and intellectuals who analyzed the evils          of
society          and sought reforms in accord with the principles of reason. Their most
supportive allies were the salonnieres, that is, the socially conscious          and
sometimes learned women who regularly entertained them, at the same time
sponsoring their discussion of literary works, artistic creations, and          new
political ideas. By 1750, the salonnieres, their salons, and the          philosophes
had made          France once again the intellectual center of Europe.
 
     A          leading light among the philosophes was the Marquis de Montesquieu
(1688-1755), a judicial official as well as a titled nobleman. He was          among
the          earliest critics of absolute monarchy. From his extensive foreign travel
and wide          reading he developed a great respect for English liberty and a sense
of          objectivity in viewing European institutions, particularly those of          France.
Montesquieu's Persian Letters (1721), which purported to contain reports          of an
Oriental          traveler in Europe, describing the irrational behavior and ridiculous
customs          of Europeans, delighted a large reading audience. His other great
work,          The Spirit of Laws (1748), expressed his main political principles. It
is noted          for its practical common sense, its objective recognition of
geographic influences on political systems, its advocacy of checks and
balances          in government, and its uncompromising defense of liberty against
tyranny.
     More than any of the philosophes, Voltaire personified the skepticism of
his          century toward traditional religion and the injustices of the Old          Regimes.
His          caustic pen brought him two imprisonments in the Bastille and even
banishment to England for three years. On returning to France, Voltaire
continued to champion toleration. He popularized Newtonian science,          fought for
freedom          of the press, and actively crusaded against the church. In such
endeavors, he turned out hundreds of histories, plays, pamphlets,          essays, and
novels.          His estimated correspondence of 10,000 letters, including many to
Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great, employed his wry wit in          spreading
the          gospel of rationalism and reform of abuses. Even in his own time, his
reputation became a legend, among kings as well as literate commoners.
 
     Voltaire had many disciples and imitators, but his only rival in
spreading the Enlightenment was a set of books - the famous French
Encyclopedie, edited by Denis Diderot (1713-1784). The Encyclopedie, the          chief
monument          of the philosophes, declared the supremacy of the new science,
denounced superstition, and expounded the merits of human freedom. Its          pages
contained critical articles, by tradesmen as well as scientists, on          unfair
taxes,          the evils of the slave trade, and the cruelty of criminal laws.
 
     More than has been widely understood, the Encyclopedie, and many other
achievements of the philosophes were joint efforts with their female
colleagues among the salonnieres. Madame de Geoffrin (1699-1777)          contributed
200,000          livres (roughly $280,000 equivalent) to the Encyclopedie and made her
salon          the headquarters for planning and managing it. Mademoiselle de
Lespinasse (1732-1776), the friend and confidential advisor of Jean          d'Alembert
(1717-1783), who assisted Diderot in editing the work, turned her salon          into a
forum          for criticizing prospective articles. Most of the philosophes relied
upon          such assistance. Voltaire was coached in science by Madame du Chatelet;
and the          Marquis de Condorcet (1742-1794), the prophet of progress and women's
rights          among the philosophes, was intellectually partnered by his wife, Sophie
(1764-1812), who popularized their ideas in her own salon. Even Madame          de
Pompadour aided the philosophes in 1759, when she presuaded Louis XV to          allow
sale of          the Encyclopedie.
     Perhaps the best-known of all the philosophes was that eccentric
Swiss-born proponent of romantic rationalism, Jean-Jacques Rousseau
(1712-1778). Although believing in the general objectives of the
Enlightenment, Rousseau distrusted reason and science. He gloried in          human
impulse          and intuition, trusting emotions rather than thought, the heart rather
than the          mind. His early rebuffs from polite society encouraged his hatred for
the Old          Regime. He also professed admiration for "noble savages," who lived
completely free of law, courts, priests, and officials. In his numerous
writings, he spoke as a rebel against all established institutions. The          most
famous          of these works, The Social Contract (1762), was Rousseau's indictment
of          absolute monarchy. It began with the stirring manifesto: "Man is born          free,
but          today he is everywhere in chains." ^6
 
[Footnote 6: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, trans. by W.          Kendall,

     The          French Enlightenment exerted a powerful influence on English thought.
Many          young upper-class Englishmen visited France to complete their education.
Among          them were three leading English thinkers: Adam Smith (1723-1790), the
Scottish          father of modern economics; David Hume (1711-1766), the best-known
English          skeptic; and Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), the founder of utilitarian
philosophy. Another famous English rationalist was the historian, Edward
Gibbon          (1737-1794), whose Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire markedly
criticized early Christianity. Among English political radicals after          1770,
Joseph          Priestley, Richard Price (1723-1791) and Thomas Paine (1737-1809) were
also          very much affected by French thought. Paine, who figured prominently in
the          American and French revolutions, was also a leader in English radical
politics.
     The          Enlightenment also affected English women. Hannah Moore and a coterie
of lady          intellectuals, known as "bluestockings," maintained a conservative
imitation of the French salons after the 1770s. One atypical "bluestocking"
was          Catherine Macaulay (1731-1791), a leading historian who published eight
widely          acclaimed volumes on the Stuart period. A republican defender of the
American          and French Revolutions, Macaulay exerted a decided influence on Mary
Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), whose life symbolized the Enlightenment and          the
emerging          English feminist movement. Born in poverty and burdened by a
dependent family, Wollstonecraft became a teacher and a successful
professional writer. She was personally acquainted with leading English
radicals, including Richard Price, Thomas Paine, and William Godwin
(1756-1836), whom she later married. Her Vindication of the Rights of          Man
(1790)          was the first serious answer to Edmund Burke's diatribe against the
French          Revolution, which Wollstonecraft personally observed and ardently
supported.
     The          reforming rationalism of the Enlightenment spread over Europe and
also          reached the New World. A leading spokesman in Germany was Moses
Mendelssohn (1729-1786), who wrote against dogmatism and in favor of          natural
religion. In Italy, the Marquis of Beccaria (1738-1794) pleaded for
humanitarian legal reforms. The Enlightenment was popular among the          upper
classes          in such absolutist strong-holds as Prussia, Russia, Austria, Portugal,
and          Spain. French ideas were read widely in Spanish America and Portuguese
Brazil.          In the English colonies, Locke and the philosophes influenced such
leading          thinkers as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), Mercy
Otis          Warren (1728-1814), and Abigail Adams (1744-1818).
