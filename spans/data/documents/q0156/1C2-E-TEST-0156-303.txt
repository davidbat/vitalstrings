Famous Quotes of Wisdom: Enlightenment
"Illness is not                   cured by saying the word 'medicine,' but by taking medicine.                   Enlightenment is not achieved by repeating the word 'God' but                   by directly experiencing God. Talk as much philosophy as you                   like, worship as many gods as you please, observe as many ceremonies                   and sing devotional hymns, but liberation will never come, even                   after a hundred eons, without realizing Oneness, Wholeness."
-- Shankara
"Knowledge is structured                   in consciousness. The process of education takes place in the                   field of consciousness; the prerequisite to complete education                   is therefore the full development of consciousness--enlightenment.                   Knowledge is not the basis of enlightenment, enlightenment is                   the basis of knowledge."
-- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

"Teachers, interpretations                   of sacred texts, the force of religious merit--none of these                   lead to the realization of that Ultimate Truth which is revealed                   in the clear reflection of the heart, engendered from contact                   with the good."
-- Yoga Vasishtha
"Individual life                   is the fundamental unit of the life of the cosmos. If the purpose                   of the individual life is served, automatically and simultaneously                   the purpose of cosmic life is served to the same degree."
-- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
"Doing and suffering                   being at end, peace alone survives--this expanded to the absolute                   limit, the wise call liberation."
-- Yoga Vasishtha
"The bliss of the                   state of enlightenment eliminates the possibility of sorrow,                   great or small. Into the bright light of the sun no darkness                   can penetrate; no sorrow can enter bliss-consciousness, nor can                   bliss-consciousness know any greater than itself."
-- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
"Yoga becomes firmly                   established when it has been respectfully and repeatedly cultivated                   for a long time."
-- Yoga Sutra, 1.14
"Balance of mind                   is called Yoga."
-- Bhagavad-Gita, 2.48
