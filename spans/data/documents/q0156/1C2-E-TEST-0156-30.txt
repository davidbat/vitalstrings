"The path to Enlightenment
is straight and narrow!"
To be seeking Enlightenment is the goal, for until one seeks to know the Truth, one knows only lies.
My quest for Truth began out of tragedy, as so often it does. Looking back now, I see it all as a blessing, for if there were no tragedies, I may never have sought the Truth.
This web site is for you: The spiritual seeker, the seeker of wisdom, the seeker of knowledge.
There are many paths to spiritual liberation. They all lead to the same goal, Self-realization. The greatest and most effective path incorporates them all. This is the path I have been on for seven years; however I did not know it until recently.
The greatest of all paths is the path of wisdom, also known as the path of knowledge, and jnana yoga. Knowledge refers to an intuitive understanding, not to an intellectual knowing.
The reason this is the greatest path is because once one has knowledge and understanding of Truth, through internal revelation, one begins to practice all paths, as a consequence of "what one has become". It is the evolution of consciousness.
Illumination is 1000 times more attainable than it ever was in the past. The reason for this is "information". We have entered the information age, and to truly intend to seek the truth now, means that you will find it.
My intent in creating this site is to save you some time, and to keep you from lies.
True Enlightenment is here and now. Explore this site, learn the Truth. All will be revealed within your Self.
