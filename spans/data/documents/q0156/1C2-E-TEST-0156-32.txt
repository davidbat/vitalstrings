The                          Enlightenment
The                            Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was                            a time when man began to use his reason to discover                            the world, casting off the superstition and fear of                            the medieval world. The effort to discover the natural                            laws which governed the universe led to scientific,                            political and social advances. Enlightenment thinkers                            examined the rational basis of all beliefs and in the                            process rejected the authority of church and state.                            Immanuel Kant expressed the motto of the Enlightenment                            well -- "Aude Sapere" (Dare to Think!).
