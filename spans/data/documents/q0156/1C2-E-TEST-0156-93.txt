Answer
Enlightenment is a profound emotional and spiritual experience accompanied by feelings of ecstacy in which an individual transcends normal conciousness and receives realizations and truths about their reason for being and the true nature of reality which are not easily expressed in words but must be achieved through personal revelation. Enlightenment can be achieved by preparing through meditative techniques and study of spiritual texts which prepares the mind for it's experience. People who seek out enlightenment are normally spiritually unsatisfied by modern day religion and seek a profound personal experience with the ultimate truth.

The explanation of enlightenment can only be defined by one that has attained enlightenment. Therefore enlightenment is beyond comprehension from the human consciousness of an unenlightened individual. It transcends anything beyond human comprehension unless as I mention an individual has attained enlightenment. Therefore explaining this experience or liberation if you will would be relevant if an enlightened being takes the opportunity to answer this very question.

I just stumbled upon this and since 'I' am enlightened, let me explain: Enlightenment is not of the 'I' (or ego entity that we identify with). Rather it is from the 'I.' When this 'I' is seen as just another object in awareness, just like a pencil, a tree, your arm, or your thoughts -- then enlightenment has occured. At this stage identification with this ego or 'I' ceases, and one understands fully that what one really is, is the backdrop on or the awareness in which the 'I,' the thoughts, the arm, the pencil, and the tree appear. When this becomes known, all else becomes known as well.
By the Vedic mythologies: Awareness of Absolute Truth.
By the Judaic Mythologies, a condition that will set man free from the carnal universe, ci-vil-ization.
For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: For it is not subject to the law of god, neither indeed can be. 8:8. So them that are in the flesh cannot please god. [ROMANS 8:6-7-8.]
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
[MATTHEW 24:35.]
Answer: An intellectual movement based on reason
Enlightenment is basically true knowledge of everything. It is the main goal of life. Buddhists called it "Bodhi" an old Sanskrit word for awakened. You have to meditate and after sometime you feel a spiritual encounter, and you will get enlightenment. All spiritual leaders have enlightenment and true wisdom. This is what enlightenment means.
