The Scottish Enlightenment was an intellectual movement that ranged across the fields of philosophy, chemistry, geology, architecture, poetry, engineering, technology, economics, sociology, medicine and history.
The 18th century is often described as Scotland’s ‘Golden Age’.
In this learning resource you will come face to face with David Hume , James Hutton , Robert Adam , Joseph Black , James Watt , Alison Rutherford and Adam Smith .
These Enlightenment figures were outspoken; they argued that it was vitally important for people to think for themselves rather than simply believing what they were told.
Their ideas were often controversial. In Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen great thinkers sought to understand the natural world and the human mind.
Today, many historians believe that the ideas and advances that emerged from the Scottish Enlightenment helped to shape the modern world.
