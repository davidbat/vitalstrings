Enlightenment is the process that allows characters to become stronger. Your enlightenment is measured by your tier. In order to gain enlightenment and go up a tier, you must be the appropriate level. Each faction has five tiers, from Tier 1 to Tier 5. As you progress in your enlightenment and gain tiers, you become stronger and tougher.
Humans start as Initiates , and can choose their faction at level 15. Athan characters pick their faction at character creation. Everyone starts out as Tier 1 in their chosen faction .
Tier 1 - Level 15 (human) or on Character creation (Athan)
Tier 2 - Level 45
Tier 4 - Level 105
Tier 5 - Level 135
When you reach the appropriate level, a Carrier Pigeon quest will appear in your quest log. This is the starting point of your Tier quest.
