Spiritism is a philosophy with scientific characteristics, because it is based on the observation of spiritual facts, carrying moral consequences to
those who use it as his or her guide for living. It comprises 5 basic postulates:
The existence of God
The immortality of the soul
The reincarnation of the spirit
The communicability of the spirits
The plurality of the Inhabited worlds
Spiritism resulted from the observation of material phenomena caused by the spirits’ action upon matter. All its teachings derived from deduction
rather than any preconceived hypothesis.
Reincarnation is one of its principal postulates that change thoroughly the concept of God and bring up a new understanding about life itself.
Spiritism teaches that God is the Supreme Intelligence and the First Cause of all things, which finishes with the traditional anthropologist
conception of the Divinity. Through the law of reincarnation, all beings evolve permanently destroying the idea of an eternal hell or an easy
conquered heaven.
As a consequence, God is no longer unjust. The struggles of life include a just objective. Most suffering is the result of previous wrongdoings
which can be erased by doing good. Consequently, all beings will reach perfection and will live in perfect harmony with the universe and the
Divinity.
In addition, as life goes on after death, we can communicate with the ones that are living now in different vibration or dimension and that is
possible through mediums.
The goal of the Spiritism is to help humanity to improve itself by better understanding Jesus' teachings as well as every great teacher that urge us
to love one another. This is only possible by a self-discovery process and a living based on unconditional charity.
