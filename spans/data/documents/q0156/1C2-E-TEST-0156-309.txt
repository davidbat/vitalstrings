"Being neither teacher nor guru, and since from the first not a thing is, the most one can do is help point the way.  In the end it resides in you."

"Real Masters never charge for their services,  nor  do      they accept payment in any form or any sort of material      benefits for their instructions. This is a universal      law  among Masters, and yet it is an amazing fact that      thousands of eager seekers in America and elsewhere, go      on paying large sums of money for "spiritual instruction.". Masters are always self-sustaining. They are never supported  by their students or by public charity."
