Introduction: The Enlightenment 17 Window Manager for X (Ubuntu 11.10)
vote
This tutorial is supposed to  show some features of the Enlightenment window manager as an alternative to the often used Gnome and KDE  managers. I will install Enlightenment on a desktop computer with Ubuntu 11.10 installed. Apart from the login screen however, all of the controls shown on the screenshots should be the same for every installation of enlightenment, whatever distribution you install it on. Enlightenment is already included in the Ubuntu repositories, therefore Ubuntu users and those of any Ubuntu derivatives won't have any problems installing it. It is also available for download for most other distributions though. read more...

Bodhi Linux and Enlightenment
vote
Bodhi is small in part because "The only applications you will find pre-installed on your Bodhi system are Firefox, LXTerminal, Elementary Nautilus, and Synaptic."
Bodhi Linux's advertised hardware requirements of a 300MHz CPU, 128MB of RAM and 1.5GB of hard disk space is certainly frugal by the standards of the day. I wish I still had my ca. 1998 350MHz 128MB laptop to try it out, the last time I used it was with Debian "unstable" in 2009 and it worked fine, but I'd like to have seen it with Enlightenment. Olwm was frugal with resources, true, but as a window manager it was computing like it was 1992 all over again.

Review: Enlightenment 17
vote
While true enlightenment may be an elusive goal, at least it's easy to enlighten your desktop...
I should mention that "window manager" isn't quite the right term for E17. The developers call it a desktop shell, intending it to fill in the space between a simple window manager like the original Enlightenment and a full-featured desktop environment like GNOME. In other words, they were setting out to create a desktop not unlike my own E16/GNOME hybrid. In this respect it does not disappoint.

Review: FVWM, IceWM, Enlightenment, AfterStep

Here is a look at four alternative window managers for your Linux desktop.
KDE and GNOME combine window managers with suites of applications to create comprehensive work environments. As complete as they are, it's easy to forget that there are other graphical ways to work on a Linux desktop. Sometimes a lighter-weight window manager is in order, such as for laptop usage, children's use, or quick startup applications. Here are four "alternative" window managers that are mature, fast, and functional.
