Disclaimer - Buddhist Enlightenment                    vs Nirvana... Is not an academic article, but simply a personal                    reflection on the unity and diversity found in Buddhism. My interpretation                    of Enlightenment and Nirvana is only a finger pointing and not                    the moon.
____________
When                    I first started reading books on Buddhism back in the late 1970s,                    I had trouble understanding *Nirvana and Enlightenment. These                    two words were often used interchangeably by authors writing                    on the *Theravada and *Mahayana traditions. Sometimes though,                    the meaning seemed to change depending on who was doing the                    writing.
I couldnt understand why, for instance... In some Zen                    and Mahayana texts folks didnt want Nirvana. Why did some                    choose one, and not the other? If they were not the same...                    What was the difference?
The first thing I did was define Enlightenment and Nirvana myself,                    in a way that made sense to me. My definition of Nirvana became- "The end of suffering"... and Enlightenment became- "The Wisdom of Emptiness."
Nirvana- The End of Suffering... In this lifetime and                    all future lifetimes.
The Buddha once said, I teach the path to immortality. As it turns out, he didnt mean, not having to die, even                    Christ had to die. The Buddha was saying... Samsara, the perpetual                    cycle of birth and death ended in Nirvana, I could never be                    reborn again... I would exist and not exist at the very same                    time, forever. I would abide in Nirvana.
Enlightenment- The Wisdom of Emptiness... The wisdom                    that arises from the direct experience of all phenomena being                    empty of independent existence.
Knowing through personal experience (for example, meditation)                    that all things are interconnected and interdependent. That                    nothing in this world exists independently. All things are connected                    and conditional... In other words... All things exist because                    of other things.
I am here because my parents had lust and I had Karma. If both                    conditions hadn't come together in a very special way years                    ago, I wouldnt be standing here today, but thats                    only half the story.
In order for me to live in this world, the Buddha said I need... Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Medicine. These are                    the four major conditions necessary for me to subsist. Some                    conditions were necessary for me to be born, other conditions                    are important for me to stay alive.
The                    whole story is... Certain conditions got me here, other conditions                    keep me here, and when all the necessary conditions come to                    an end, so do I. I do not live independent of conditions.
Enlightenment is a result of the direct experience, of conditional                    and interconnected reality.
Enlightenment is more than an intellectual understanding though,                    its also an intuitive knowing. It is a total transformation                    of the heart and mind.
A                    favorite Mahayana sutra on emptiness is the Heart Sutra.
The Perfect Wisdom of the Heart Sutra
Avalokitesvara                    Bodhisattva, when practicing deeply the Perfect Wisdom clearly                    saw that all five Skandhas are empty and passed beyond all suffering.
Sariputra, form does not differ from emptiness: Emptiness does                    not differ from form. Form then is emptiness. Emptiness then                    is form. Sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness,                    are also like this.
Sariputra, all Dharmas are marked with emptiness: not born and                    not dying, not stained and not pure, not gaining and not losing.                    Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, perception,                    volition or consciousness. No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or                    mind; nor form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or Dharmas; no realm                    of sight til we come to no realm of consciousness; no                    ignorance and no ending of ignorance, til we come to no                    old age and death, and no ending of old age and death. No suffering,                    origination, extinction, or path. No wisdom, and no attainment,                    with nothing to attain.
Because the Bodhisattva is the Perfect Wisdom of emptiness,                    his mind has no hindrance. Having no hindrance, there is no                    fear and far from all fantasy, he is dwelling in Nirvana.
Because all Buddhas of the three times practice the wisdom of                    emptiness, they gain complete and perfect enlightenment.
Therefore know, that Perfect Wisdom, is the great holy mantram, the great bright mantram, the wisdom mantram, the unequaled                    mantram, which can destroy all suffering---truly real and not                    false. So he gave the Perfect Wisdom mantram, which goes;
Ga                    te Ga te, Pa ra Ga te,
Pa ra sam Ga te,
Bodhi Swaha.
When a Buddhist realizes Enlightenment... The Great Compassion cannot but arise in his or her heart. He is no longer able to                    view the world in the same way he did before his Enlightenment.                    He can now see, feel, know, and understand... If one person                    is sick, hungry, homeless, or dying in the world... There is                    a part of him that is sick, hungry, homeless, or dying. He no                    longer feels separate and safe. He views the world as a sea                    of suffering and is directly connected to each and every suffering                    being, in the same way the ocean connects to each and every                    wave.
Its really a choice all Buddhist practitioners make...                    To change themselves in a way that is of benefit to all living                    beings, and not just their Self.' This transformation                    is founded on the direct experience of Enlightenment" in Mahayana Buddhism. The path that leads to Enlightenment is called the Path of the *Bodhisattva.
Reconnecting to the world in this very special way, does not                    end the Bodhisattvas suffering, however... In some ways Bodhisattva's may suffer more, but each time they help end the                    suffering of another being, their suffering is also eased. Each                    time they feed someone, clothe someone, shelter someone, comfort                    someone... Their suffering is transformed.
The path of the Bodhisattva is very difficult... There is no                    time out, they never take a vacation. Where would they go? Where                    is the place, no one suffers?
In the Theravada tradition, the Buddha was a Bodhisattva numerous                    times in his past lives and seemed to achieve Enlightenment                    many times before his Nirvana. The story of the Buddha's life                    as a Bodhisattva is found in an Early Buddhist text called the  Jataka                    Tales .'
In the Mahayana Tradition, the focus is on Enlightenment, not Nirvana. The goal is to become a Bodhisattva, and then a                    Buddha. The Bodhisattva ends his/her suffering only in Buddhahood,                    and not before. In the Mahayana, its not so much... Do                    what the Buddha says... But, do what the Buddha did.
In the Theravada tradition, the focus is on Nirvana... Here                    and now. By following the teachings of the Buddha, he/she can                    become an *Arahant. Having crossed over the sea of suffering                    and landed on the other shore... The Arahant not only ends his                    suffering, but gains the Compassion and Wisdom' of a Buddha                    to help end the suffering of others.
As with the Bodhisattva, the Arahants life is fully dedicated                    to the end of suffering. There is no rest so long as one person                    suffers. There is no place to go and nothing to do, other than                    be of service. The activity of the Bodhisattva and the Arahant                    is not determined by Self or ego, but by compassion and wisdom.
When all is said and done, are the path's of the Bodhisattva                    and Arahant the same? I don't think so, they appear to be different...                    But they both end and/or reduce suffering in the world.
Is Enlightenment the same as Nirvana? I think they mean different                    things. In my mind, the future Bodhisattva strives towards Enlightenment,                    and the future Arahant towards Nirvana.
In the Theravada tradition, the focus is on Nirvana, doing what                    the Buddha taught, and following the path of the Arahant to                    the End of Suffering.
In the Mahayana tradition, the focus is on Enlightenment, doing                    what the Buddha did, and following the path of the Bodhisattva                    to the Wisdom of Emptiness.
Before I end this portion of the presentation... One last point                    needs to be made... I have tried to share with you how Enlightenment                    and Nirvana may be different... But they are very much the same                    in this sense.
That in the end... In the Ultimate reality of Buddhism... Both                    the path of the Bodhisattva and the Arahant lead to the end                    of suffering. Just as the Buddhas many past lives as a                    Bodhisattva finished in Buddhahood. Every path found in Buddhism                    will ultimately end in Nirvana!
I hope my explanation of Enlightenment and Nirvana will help                    you read the teachings of the Buddha with more clarity                    and insight.
Bodhisattva... Arahant... Enlightenment... Nirvana... The Wisdom                    of Emptiness... The End of Suffering... The choice is up to                    you!
_____________________
* Mahayana
The Great Vehicle. This form of Buddhism emerged somewhere between                    150 BCE and 100CE. Its distinctive features include the new                    emphasis given to compassion and the Bodhisattva ideal, the                    three-bodies of the Buddha doctrine, emptiness and skill in                    means.
*                    Bodhisattva
Enlightenment Being. This is a being whose Buddhahood is assured                    but who postpones his/her own entry into Nirvana to help all                    other sentient beings attain to it first. The Buddha himself                    was described as a Bodhisattva in stories of his previous lives.
*                    Theravada
The Theravada school of Buddhism was the first one to emerge                    after the Buddha's parinirvana (Death). Over the centuries,                    it has retained its unique approach to the search for Nirvana,                    relying closely on the word of the Buddha as it appears in the                    Pali Canon.
*                    Arahant
Noble one. An arahant is an individual who has realized Nirvana,                    brought an end to his own suffering and the cycle of birth and                    death.
*                    Nirvana
To cease blowing. Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhism,                    the third noble truth. In nirvana, the suffering and the desire                    that causes suffering have come to an end, as has the cycle                    of birth and death. Sometimes nirvana is referred to by the                    Buddha as 'unborn' and 'unconditioned', in contrast to the phenomenal                    world we experience in our unenlightened state.
