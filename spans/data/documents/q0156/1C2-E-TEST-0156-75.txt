"Our society is the    product of several great religious and philosophical traditions. The    ideas of the Greeks and Romans, Christianity, Judaism,    humanism and the    Enlightenment have made us who we are". Jan Peter Balkenende
Enlightenment
1650-1790
"The    Age of Enlightenment (or simply the Enlightenment or Age of Reason) was    a cultural movement of intellectuals in 18th century Europe and America , whose purpose was to reform society and advance knowledge.    It promoted science and intellectual interchange and opposed    superstition,    intolerance and abuses in church and state. Originating about 1650 to    1700, it was sparked by philosophers Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), John Locke (1632–1704), Pierre Bayle (1647–1706), physicist Isaac Newton (1643–1727), and historian Voltaire (1694–1778). The wide distribution of the printing press , invented in Europe in 1440, made possible the rapid    dispersion of knowledge and ideas which precipitated the Enlightenment.    Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered figures and even attempted to    apply their ideas of government in what was known as Enlightened Despotism . The Enlightenment flourished until about    1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to Romanticism 's emphasis on emotion and a Counter-Enlightenment gained force. The term 'Enlightenment' did not    come into use in English until the mid-18th century,  with    particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent of the    French term 'Lumières' (used first by Dubos 1733 and already well    established by 1751). From Immanuel Kant 's 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist    Aufklärung?" (" Answering    the Question: What Is Enlightenment? ") the German term became    'Aufklärung'." Source: Wikipedia
