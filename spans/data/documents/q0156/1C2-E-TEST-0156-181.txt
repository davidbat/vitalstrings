>  A            Summary of what happened...
   The            18th-century Enlightenment may be represented as a new way of thinking about mankind and the environment.            The main proponents of this intellectual movement, the philosophes ,            were primarily men of letters - men like Voltaire, Locke, Diderot, Montesquieu            and Rousseau - but their views stemmed from the scientific revolution            of the previous century. The discoveries of Galileo, Kepler and Newton            in physics and cosmology revealed a universe that was infinite, yet            governed by universal laws that could be discovered by the human intelligence.
   The philosophes were convinced that all creation was similarity rational,            so that it was possible for man to uncover laws which regulated society,            politics, the economy, and even morality. Once understood these laws            would teach mankind not only what we are, but what we ought to be and            do.
   For            the philosophes, much of Western Christian civilization was incompatible            with such a rational order. The absolute monarchy, the aristocratic            society which dated from the Middle Ages, the established church, all            came under their scrutiny. 'Despotism, feudalism, clericalism' became            the objects of their criticism and satire.
   Though            some of their more daring ideas never passed the censor, the philosophes conveyed their message to the public through the printed word. Their            greatest monument was the Encyclopédie - entitled 'A Rational            Dictionary of the Arts and the Sciences' and edited by Denis Diderot.            The first volume appeared in 1752, the last of 35 in 1780, and it expressed            the author's pride in the European achievement since the Renaissance.
   From            the evils of ' despotism , feudalism , clericalism ' the main people of            the Revolution adapted the watchword of ' Liberty , Equality, Fraternity ',            drawing on notions from the Philosophes and the Enlightenment. Many            important documents of the Revolution (The Declaration of the Rights            of Man, The Constitution of 1791) owe debt to Montesquieu, Voltaire,            and Rousseau.

   John            Locke's central ideas were that of:
The              human mind is blank at birth, as such everyone is good.
Society              shapes their mind and corrupts.
God              established divine laws in which the universe conforms around and              there is no changing these laws, only acting within the constraints              of them.
   The          Baron de Montesquieu's central ideas were that of:
Separation of powers within the government;              The government should be formed based on the area in which they operate.              An example would be that in a large, hot area the government should              be dispersed within communities. Like that of Alderman and Wards.
Deity ; The Church should still influence              people's lives and they way that they are schooled and raised.
   François            Marie Arouet, more commonly known as Voltaire, worked to incorporate            philosophy as it was practiced by the English, into French intellectual            life. He would attack aristocracy , as such was imprisoned in the Bastille.            He persisted on persuading for religious tolerance within society. He            believed that all religions and practices were equal as they were all            drawn from the same source, the need for something to believe in. Many            of his books that we still read today have as their theme religious            tolerance.
   Jean            Jacques Rousseau merely recycled older Enlightenment ideas, but was able to spark the public with his ability to imply the            obvious. The central idea he dealt with most is summed up in the first            sentence of his most famous work, The Social Contract: "Man is            born free but everywhere is in chains." This contract of his plays            on the feudal            system , but places it more into a governmental            role. Once rulers cease to protect the ruled, the social contract is            broken and the governed are free to choose another set of governors            or magistrates. This became the primary force behind the Declaration            of Independence.
