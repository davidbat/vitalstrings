Travel to Enlightenment
Â 
Discover "out of             the ordinary" ideas and places that             will enrich your life and unlock             your mind.
While much of the focus will be on             visiting exotic places, it's not necessary to travel to             exotic locations in order to "travel             to enlightenment."
The important place to travel is in             your attitude. Being able to travel             to exotic locations is a gift, which             I want to encourage people to             explore, but even if you can't, just             reading about exotic locations can             break old mental patterns and take             you to a new world.
I also want to emphasize that             travel is not an excuse to get away             from where you are, but rather an             opportunity to enrich and broaden             your life experiences. Travel should             expand upon the familiar to create             something even greater. Be sure to visit:
