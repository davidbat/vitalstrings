The Enlightenment Lamp
Despite all the books on enlightenment, only this one can actually provide light. The Enlightenment Book Lamp ($130) is a book-shaped lamp made from white plexiglass, lit with a 9-watt energy-saving lamp, and with the words "The Enlightenment" on the binding and front cover. Plus, ten percent of the proceeds goes to fund education projects run by the Edukans Foundation. Now that's enlightenment. [ via ]
