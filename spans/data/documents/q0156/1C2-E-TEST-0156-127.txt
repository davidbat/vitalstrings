There                are few mysteries in                this world that are as                ancient as the mystery                of spiritual                enlightenment. What is                spiritual enlightenment?                For thousands of years                the quest to reach                enlightenment has                intrigued people.
Some                say it is understanding                or knowledge. Others say                it is wisdom. Some say                it is the ability to                heal others instantly.                Others point to the                Bible and say it is                about creating miracles.                Here and there, various                groups define it as the                ability to love, or                maintain continuous                peace of mind, or become                a millionaire, or cast                out devils.
Enlightenment itself is                just what the word                implies – to become                light. Spiritual                enlightenment is to                reach the state of                enlightenment by                developing the deeply                enfolded spirit that                lives within you,                bringing it to the                surface and living from                the center of that                Spirit-Self. This                Spirit-Self is the                eternal part of you that                never dies, is always                aware, and is the source                of the expanded                capacities mentioned                above – deep knowledge,                intuition, the ability                to heal or create                miracles, an                encompassing love,                extraordinary peace, and                the capacity to                transcend death.
Most                people are familiar with                Jesus, who was trying to                teach the basics of                enlightenment to a group                of fishermen and holy                women by demonstrating                it in real time. There                have been other great                teachers, but they are                not abundant in today’s                world. Yet we are                capable of figuring out                much of what has been                given to us and putting                it into practice.
Enlightenment is the end                of suffering and the                entry into peace and                joy. It is the ability                to move through the day                with a watchful                attentiveness, always                present in the moment                and watching to see what                is needed in any given                situation because there                is an inner willingness                to give.
Enlightenment is freedom                – from the past, from                old habits, from                tradition, and from                choices and decisions                that result in sorrow or                frustration. In Buddhist                teaching, enlightenment                is the ability to                transcend one’s ego, the                body, and all                attachments to the                material world. This is                often interpreted as                being willing to be                poor, but nothing could                be further from the                truth. Attachment to the                material world results                in continuous, grasping                efforts to get more                money, more power,                bigger houses or cars,                fancier clothing, etc.
Paradoxically, detaching                from these things does                not necessarily mean you                can’t have them. It just                means that you are in a                state of mind that has                not closed down to                everything except the                thoughts and actions                that will bring money,                power, or cars and                houses. When you open                yourself , these things                will come to you easily                if you want them or need                them. Why? Because you                are able to see a much                broader palette of                possibilities and                opportunities and thus                can gently and lovingly                position yourself so                that they unfold right                in your lap – where you                will typically use these                gifts to make life                better for all. When                people are not worried                about where their next meal is coming from,                they have the time and                space to become aware of                enlightenment and learn                about the incredible                Spirit that exists                within them.
Contrary to what you may                think, there are many                paths to enlightenment.                It is possible to touch                the experience                momentarily while doing                the most ordinary                things… from swimming,                to sculpting, to                driving, at the dinner                table, or while making                love. People often have                difficulty describing                the experience because                it is so challenging to                convey the                extraordinary,                transcendent love,                peace, oneness, insight,                and timelessness of the                moment.
Even                if the experience only                lasts a few seconds, the                power of it transforms                you. Some people go                through several years of                chaos because the                experience tips over                their apple-cart and                thoroughly uproots their                life. Other people                return quietly to their                work, their families,                and some of the                activities they were                formerly engaged in, but                there is the perception                that something is                definitely different and                a slow weeding-out                process begins as the                reasons for living take                on a whole new                perspective.
Whether this initiating                experience happens                spontaneously or in the                midst of deep                meditation, it is your                signal that the eternal                Spirit-Self hidden                within you is beginning                to make its presence                known and you are on the                path toward full                enlightenment. Either                way, the guidebook to                Attaining Spiritual                Enlightenment and the                many supports and                resources offered by                Ultimate Destiny can                help you take the steps                that will lead to your                full unfolding. ♦
 
Being spiritual doesn’t                necessarily mean being                religious.  Often they                go hand in hand,
but not always.  In this                interactive programs                from Ultimate Destiny,                the focus is on the                spiritual,
not religious, aspect of                our lives: our sense of                purpose, our divinity,                and our interaction
and communication with a                higher source, call that                source what you may. 
Through various                exercises, you will                learn how to recognize,                apply and enjoy your
spirituality and the                ways in which this                understanding affects                all areas of your life.
