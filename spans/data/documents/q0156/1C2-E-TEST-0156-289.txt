SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (MMD Newswire)  --  Motor enthusiast  Philip Cotton lived a life dictated by his need for speed, but it was  that very lifestyle that led him to find spirituality. In his book,  "Racing to Enlightenment" (ISBN 978-1450555777), Cotton explains how his  love for motor sports influenced his career choices, relationships and  connection to himself. He found that life was fast but not fulfilling.
A near-fatal accident is what finally started Cotton on his road to  introspection, self-reflection and personal growth. That experience  changed him profoundly, and inspired him to find his spirituality both  within himself and the world around him.
Cotton shares his autobiography through an honest, personal account  of his quest to find the deeper meaning of his life. He believes that  his path to awakening will interest people like him - spiritual seekers  and racing enthusiasts alike.
"My work shows that a regular person can find awakening without  spending an entire lifetime in meditation at an ashram, kissing the feet  of an Indian guru," Cotton says.
Readers will see Cotton's transformation from a twenty-something  thrill-seeker to an insightful spiritual-seeker after a series of  unlikely, life-changing experiences. He hopes that his story inspires  readers to take whatever path is necessary to bring them to their  desired level of consciousness.
"Racing to Enlightenment" is available for sale online at Amazon.com and other channels.
