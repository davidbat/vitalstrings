Insight
 
The outward appearance of all meditation practitioners is       the same,  but their substance and purpose differ.  Each practice requires Right Mindfulness, Right       Concentration, and Right View.  We recognize, teach and support five categories of meditative       practices.
 
Meditation pursued for mental and physical well-being without any spiritual goal.
Meditation pursued for mental concentration, contemplation or for the pursuit of supernatural powers.
The pursuit of self-liberation, nirvana, blissfulness.
The pursuit of self-realization to experience the unity of all things for the benefit of all beings.
The realization of Supreme Enlightenment.   To realize your Eternal Nature.
 
We support and guide each student every step of the way, giving them direct understanding of the ancient art            of meditation, and a clear and precise practice to support their goals.
