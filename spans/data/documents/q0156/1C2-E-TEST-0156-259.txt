Enlightenment Pictures is happy to announce that BenD, a previously attempted production, is back in the works and is currently undergoing stages of principal photography.
Written & Directed by Séamus Hanly, BenD will be Enlightenment Pictures’ first feature length film as well as Séamus’ feature debut.
Starring Colm Kearns, BenD tells the story of a lone young man who lives a nocturnal existence having experienced a bizarre car accident. While wandering through the streets of his neighbourhood he encounters strange people in the night and slowly unravels the mystery of his situation.
Produced by Tony Flynn, BenD will continue to be filmed over next 6-7 months and will hopefully be near completion some time in late 2012.
enlightenmentpictures.net will be posting more news about the project as it comes.
