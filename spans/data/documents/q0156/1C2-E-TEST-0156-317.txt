Zen philosophy  asserts that inner peace and  enlightenment  can be attained through self-contemplation and meditation rather than devotion, faith and belief.
           
Zen is short for Zen Buddhism. It is sometimes called a religion and sometimes called a philosophy.
 
Zen Buddhism developed from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, better known as the Buddha. About 500 B.C. as a prince of what is now India, he became so deeply disturbed by the misery he witnessed in his homeland, that he gave up his fortunate life to seek understanding. He found that suffering and unhappiness are the result of attachment to circumstances and things which are temporary. By elimination of these attachments, including affection to the artificial notion of self ("I" or “me”), one can be free of pain. After 6 years of hardship he achieved Enlightenment at age 35
 
The Buddha’s teachings have been passed down from teacher to student to this day. Sometime around 475 A.D. one of the Buddha’s students traveled from India to China and introduced the teachings of the Buddha there. In China Buddhism merged with the native Taoism.
 
The result of this mingling spread from China to Japan, where it later formed into what is now known as (at least in translation) Zen Buddhism.
 
Buddhism and it's cousin Taoism have gained significant popularity in the United States and Europe, to the point that it have become somewhat of a movement. Many true practitioners are hoping it isn't just a fad, but rather the beginning of a global consciousness.
