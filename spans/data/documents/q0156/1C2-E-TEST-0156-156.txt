The Keys to Life are yours for the price of a cheap paperback!
Many seekers have trod the difficult path to enlightenment, giving up everything and going through hell—Not only is a trip to the Himalayas expensive, but you have to hike through yak poo to remote villages with no Wi-Fi.
Now you can reach the highest states of consciousness possible to humanity without missing a single text message. And even Walmart couldn't beat the price if it hired all the sadhus in India to toil in sweatshops for ten cents an hour to bring you the secrets of the Universe. This book is everything you need to ascend into the stratosphere of spiritual mastery!
