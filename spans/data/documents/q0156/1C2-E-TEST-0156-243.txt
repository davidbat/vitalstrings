Enlightenment Period Architecture: HOMEPAGE
he Enlightenment Period lasted from 1600 to1800. The Enlightenment Period in Europe was full of spectacular architectural works of art. There were many different styles of architecture that showed up during that time. Some of the cathedrals, castles, and homes built in the period still stand today all over Europe. The architects who designed and constructed these priceless works of art all had their own styles and methods in creating one of their extravagant buildings. Also the materials and tools used back during the Enlightenment are much different than the ones we use today. The overall architecture of the Enlightenment Period was different than any other time and deserves to be studied.
