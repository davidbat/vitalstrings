Spain Table of Contents
Charles III (r. 1759-88), Spain's enlightened despot par excellence,         served his royal apprenticeship as king of Naples . He was one of         Europe's most active patrons of the Enlightenment, a period during which         attempts were made to reform society through the application of reason         to political, social, and economic problems. Despite Charles's attempt         to reform the economy, the impact of the Enlightenment was essentially         negative. Anticlericalism was an integral part of Enlightenment         ideology, but it was carried to greater lengths in Spain than elsewhere         in Europe because of government sponsorship. Public charities financed         by the church were considered antisocial because they were thought to         discourage initiative, and they were therefore abolished. The state         suppressed monasteries and confiscated their property. The Jesuits,         outspoken opponents of regalism, were expelled. Their expulsion         virtually crippled higher education in Spain. The state also banned the         teachings of medieval philosophers and of the sixteenth-century Jesuit         political theorists who had argued for the "divine right of the         people" over their kings. The government employed the Inquisition         to discipline antiregalist clerics.
Economic recovery was noticeable, and government efficiency was         greatly improved at the higher levels during Charles III's reign. The         Bourbon reforms, however, resulted in no basic changes in the pattern of         property holding. Neither land reform nor increased land use occurred.         The rudimentary nature of bourgeois class consciousness in Spain         hindered the creation of a middleclass movement. Despite the development         of a national bureaucracy in Madrid, government programs foundered         because of the lethargy of administrators at lower levels and because of         a background rural population. The reform movement could not be         sustained without the patronage of Charles III, and it did not survive         him.
