We are in the midst of a tremendous evolution in consciousness that is forcing us to become spiritually enlightened, for if we do not we will destroy ourselves as a species. In effect, we must either evolve or die for those who do not evolve will be unable to protect themselves from the cancer and other degenerative diseases that are being caused by the unprecedented amount of pollution of all kinds that now exists upon our planet.

I am against all pesticides, herbicides, chemical food additives, toxins that enter the air, earth, and water, and genetically modified foods for the obvious reasons – they are harmful to human health and are a form of biological warfare that is being perpetrated on earth’s inhabitants by government-protected corporations who don’t seem to care much about life on earth. These chemical agents are behind the rise in cancer and all degenerative diseases, especially disease that effect the nervous system and brain.

“I am responsible for what I see. I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for and receive as I have asked.”
