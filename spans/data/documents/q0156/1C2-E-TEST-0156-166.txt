What is Enlightenment?, 1784
Was ist Ã„ufklarung?
Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred tutelage.   Tutelage s man's inability to make use of his understanding without   direction from another. Self-incurred is this tutelage when its   cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of resolution and   courage to use it without direction from another. Sapere aude! "Have courage to use your own reason!"- that is the   motto of enlightenment.
Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a portion   of mankind, after nature has long since discharged them from external   direction (naturaliter maiorennes), nevertheless remains under   lifelong tutelage, and why it is so easy for others to set themselves   up as their guardians. It is so easy not to be of age. If I have   a book which understands for me, a pastor who has a conscience   for me, a physician who decides my diet, and so forth, I need   not trouble myself. I need not think, if I can only pay - others   will easily undertake the irksome work for me.
That the step to competence is held to be very dangerous by the   far greater portion of mankind (and by the entire fair sex) -   quite apart from its being arduous is seen to by those guardians   who have so kindly assumed superintendence over them. After the   guardians have first made their domestic cattle dumb and have   made sure that these placid creatures will not dare take a single   step without the harness of the cart to which they are tethered,   the guardians then show them the danger which threatens if they   try to go alone. Actually, however, this danger is not so great,   for by falling a few times they would finally learn to walk alone.   But an example of this failure makes them timid and ordinarily   frightens them away from all further trials.
For any single individua1 to work himself out of the life under   tutelage which has become almost his nature is very difficult.   He has come to be fond of his state, and he is for the present   really incapable of making use of his reason, for no one has ever   let him try it out. Statutes and formulas, those mechanical tools   of the rational employment or rather misemployment of his natural   gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting tutelage. Whoever throws   them off makes only an uncertain leap over the narrowest ditch   because he is not accustomed to that kind of free motion. Therefore,   there are few who have succeeded by their own exercise of mind   both in freeing themselves from incompetence and in achieving   a steady pace.
But that the public should enlighten itself is more possible;   indeed, if only freedom is granted enlightenment is almost sure   to follow. For there will always be some independent thinkers,   even among the established guardians of the great masses, who,   after throwing off the yoke of tutelage from their own shoulders,   will disseminate the spirit of the rational appreciation of both   their own worth and every man's vocation for thinking for himself.   But be it noted that the public, which has first been brought   under this yoke by their guardians, forces the guardians themselves   to renain bound when it is incited to do so by some of the guardians   who are themselves capable of some enlightenment - so harmful   is it to implant prejudices, for they later take vengeance on   their cultivators or on their descendants. Thus the public can   only slowly attain enlightenment. Perhaps a fall of personal despotism   or of avaricious or tyrannical oppression may be accomplished   by revolution, but never a true reform in ways of thinking. Farther,   new prejudices will serve as well as old ones to harness the great   unthinking masses.
For this enlightenment, however, nothing is required but freedom,   and indeed the most harmless among all the things to which this   term can properly be applied. It is the freedom to make public   use of one's reason at every point. But I hear on all sides, "Do   not argue!" The Officer says: "Do not argue but drill!" The tax collector: "Do not argue but pay!" The cleric: "Do not argue but believe!" Only one prince in the world   says, "Argue as much as you will, and about what you will,   but obey!" Everywhere there is restriction on freedom.
Which restriction is an obstacle to enlightenment, and which is   not an obstacle but a promoter of it? I answer: The public use   of one's reason must always be free, and it alone can bring about   enlightenment among men. The private use of reason, on the other   hand, may often be very narrowly restricted without particularly   hindering the progress of enlightenment. By the public use of   one's reason I understand the use which a person makes of it as   a scholar before the reading public. Private use I call that which   one may make of it in a particular civil post or office which   is entrusted to him. Many affairs which are conducted in the interest   of the community require a certain mechanism through which some   members of the community must passively conduct themselves with   an artificial unanimity, so that the government may direct them   to public ends, or at least prevent them from destroying those   ends. Here argument is certainly not allowed - one must obey.   But so far as a part of the mechanism regards himself at the same   time as a member of the whole community or of a society of world   citizens, and thus in the role of a scholar who addresses the   public (in the proper sense of the word) through his writings,   he certainly can argue without hurting the affairs for which he   is in part responsible as a passive member. Thus it would be ruinous   for an officer in service to debate about the suitability or utility   of a command given to him by his superior; he must obey. But the   right to make remarks on errors in the military service and to   lay them before the public for judgment cannot equitably be refused   him as a scholar. The citizen cannot refuse to pay the taxes imposed   on him; indeed, an impudent complaint at those levied on him can   be punished as a scandal (as it could occasion general refractoriness).   But the same person nevertheless does not act contrary to his   duty as a citizen, when, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his   thoughts on the inappropriateness or even the injustices of these   levies, Similarly a clergyman is obligated to make his sermon   to his pupils in catechism and his congregation conform to the   symbol of the church which he serves, for he has been accepted   on this condition. But as a scholar he has complete freedom, even   the calling, to communicate to the public all his carefully tested   and well meaning thoughts on that which is erroneous in the symbol   and to make suggestions for the better organization of the religious   body and church. In doing this there is nothing that could be   laid as a burden on his conscience. For what he teaches as a consequence   of his office as a representative of the church, this he considers   something about which he has not freedom to teach according to   his own lights; it is something which he is appointed to propound   at the dictation of and in the name of another. He will say, "Our   church teaches this or that; those are the proofs which it adduces." He thus extracts all practical uses for his congregation from   statutes to which he himself would not subscribe with full conviction   but to the enunciation of which he can very well pledge himself   because it is not impossible that truth lies hidden in them, and,   in any case, there is at least nothing in them contradictory to   inner religion. For if he believed he had found such in them,   he could not conscientiously discharge the duties of his office;   he would have to give it up. The use, therefore, which an appointed   teacher makes of his reason before his congregation is merely   private, because this congregation is only a domestic one (even   if it be a large gathering); with respect to it, as a priest,   he is not free, nor can he be free, because he carries out the   orders of another. But as a scholar, whose writings speak to his   public, the world, the clergyman in the public use of his reason   enjoys an unlimited freedom to use his own reason to speak in   his own person. That the guardian of the people (in spiritual   things) should themselves be incompetent is an absurdity which   amounts to the eternalization of absurdities.
But would not a society of clergymen, perhaps a church conference   or a venerable classis (as they call themselves among the Dutch)   , be justified in obligating itself by oath to a certain unchangeable   symbol inorder to enjoy an unceasing guardianship over each of   its numbers and thereby over the people as a whole , and even   to make it eternal? I answer that this is altogether impossible.   Such contract, made to shut off all further enlightenment from   the human race, is absolutely null and void even if confirmed   by the supreme power , by parliaments, and by the most ceremonious   of peace treaties. An age cannot bind itself and ordain to put   the succeeding one into such a condition that it cannot extend   its (at best very occasional) knowledge , purify itself of errors,   and progress in general enlightenment. That would be a crime against   human nature, the proper destination of which lies precisely in   this progress and the descendants would be fully justified in   rejecting those decrees as having been made in an unwarranted   and malicious manner.
The touchstone of everything that can be concluded as a law for   a people lies in the question whether the people could have imposed   such a law on itself. Now such religious compact might be possible   for a short and definitely limited time, as it were, in expectation   of a better. One might let every citizen, and especially the clergyman,   in the role of scholar, make his comments freely and publicly,   i.e. through writing, on the erroneous aspects of the present   institution. The newly introduced order might last until insight   into the nature of these things had become so general and widely   approved that through uniting their voices (even if not unanimously)   they could bring a proposal to the throne to take those congregations   under protection which had united into a changed religious organization   according to their better ideas, without, however hindering others   who wish to remain in the order. But to unite in a permanent religious   institution which is not to be subject to doubt before the public   even in the lifetime of one man, and thereby to make a period   of time fruitless in the progress of mankind toward improvement,   thus working to the disadvantage of posterity - that is absolutely   forbidden. For himself (and only for a short time) a man may postpone   enlightenment in what he ought to know, but to renounce it for   posterity is to injure and trample on the rights of mankind. And   what a people may not decree for itself can even less be decreed   for them by a monarch, for his lawgiving authority rests on his   uniting the general public will in his own. If he only sees to   it that all true or alleged improvement stands together with civil   order, he can leave it to his subjects to do what they find necessary   for their spiritual welfare. This is not his concern, though it   is incumbent on him to prevent one of them from violently hindering   another in determining and promoting this welfare to the best   of his ability. To meddle in these matters lowers his own majesty,   since by the writings in which his own subjects seek to present   their views he may evaluate his own governance. He can do this   when, with deepest understanding, he lays upon himself the reproach, Caesar non est supra grammaticos. Far more does he injure   his own majesty when he degrades his supreme power by supporting   the ecclesiastical despotism of some tyrants in his state over   his other subjects.
If we are asked , "Do we now live in an enlightened age?" the answer is, "No ," but we do live in an age of enlightenment.   As things now stand, much is lacking which prevents men from being,   or easily becoming, capable of correctly using their own reason   in religious matters with assurance and free from outside direction.   But on the other hand, we have clear indications that the field   has now been opened wherein men may freely dea1 with these things   and that the obstacles to general enlightenment or the release   from self-imposed tutelage are gradually being reduced. In this   respect, this is the age of enlightenment, or the century of Frederick.
A prince who does not find it unworthy of himself to say that   he holds it to be his duty to prescribe nothing to men in religious   matters but to give them complete freedom while renouncing the   haughty name of tolerance, is himself enlightened and deserves   to be esteemed by the grateful world and posterity as the first,   at least from the side of government , who divested the human   race of its tutelage and left each man free to make use of his   reason in matters of conscience. Under him venerable ecclesiastics   are allowed, in the role of scholar, and without infringing on   their official duties, freely to submit for public testing their   judgments and views which here and there diverge from the established   symbol. And an even greater freedom is enjoyed by those who are   restricted by no official duties. This spirit of freedom spreads   beyond this land, even to those in which it must struggle with   external obstacles erected by a government which misunderstands   its own interest. For an example gives evidence to such a government   that in freedom there is not the least cause for concern about   public peace and the stability of the community. Men work themselves   gradually out of barbarity if only intentional artifices are not   made to hold them in it.
I have placed the main point of enlightenment - the escape of   men from their self-incurred tutelage - chiefly in matters of   religion because our rulers have no interest in playing guardian   with respect to the arts and sciences and also because religious   incompetence is not only the most harmful but also the most degrading   of all. But the manner of thinking of the head of a state who   favors religious enlightenment goes further, and he sees that   there is no danger to his lawgiving in allowing his subjects to   make public use of their reason and to publish their thoughts   on a better formulation of his legislation and even their open-minded   criticisms of the laws already made. Of this we have a shining   example wherein no monarch is superior to him we honor.
But only one who is himself enlightened, is not afraid of shadows,   and has a numerous and well-disciplined army to assure public   peace, can say: "Argue as much as you will , and about what   you will , only obey!" A republic could not dare say such   a thing. Here is shown a strange and unexpected trend in human   affairs in which almost everything, looked at in the large , is   paradoxical. A greater degree of civil freedom appears advantageous   to the freedom of mind of the people, and yet it places inescapable   limitations upon it. A lower degree of civil freedom, on the contrary,   provides the mind with room for each man to extend himself to   his full capacity. As nature has uncovered from under this hard   shell the seed for which she most tenderly cares - the propensity   and vocation to free thinking - this gradually works back upon   the character of the people, who thereby gradually become capable   of managing freedom; finally, it affects the principles of government,   which finds it to its advantage to treat men, who are now more   than machines, in accordance with their dignity.
