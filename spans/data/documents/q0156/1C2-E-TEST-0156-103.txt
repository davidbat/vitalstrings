Unless you've woken up recently, you've probably heard much about the so called "Law of Attraction". Motivational Gurus the world over seem to be advocating it's use to create the reality we might want, to generate abundance in life or that long sought after soulmate. From my perspective, indeed there is a Law of Attraction, but I observe how this natural science has been mis-informed or in some cases, maligned to promote or 'sell' a particular approach - namely that we can essentially manifest the reality we might want by using the law. So how might we unlock the real secret behind the Law of Attraction and harness it for maximum uplifting benefit?...
