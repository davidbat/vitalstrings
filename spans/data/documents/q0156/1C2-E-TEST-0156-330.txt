Who We Are
Enlightenment Ales is a Massachusetts nano brewery making American  Bière de Champagne .
Brewer and Founder Ben Howe is making innovative “urban farmhouse” beers using traditional techniques usually found in Champagne production. This laborious process allows for the natural conditioning of our beers that results in a fine carbonation and unique drinking experience. It is this extra effort and dedication to crafting a true American Bière de Champagne that makes Enlightenment Ales stand out in the growing nano brewery scene.
