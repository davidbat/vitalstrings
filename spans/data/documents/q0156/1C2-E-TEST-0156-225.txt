Letter from the Editor and Publisher
Subscription Information
Objectivity is moving to the big time. That means you're going to  have to pay. The current issue is printing now (as of August 27th, 2001).  Future issues, including the Proceedings of the Annual Meeting, will be  published through a book publisher. You will be able to get it by  subscription, if you prefer, for an additional handling charge. Otherwise,  you'll be able to buy issues via Amazon.com or directly through the  publisher's website.
Individual issues, if purchased directly, will cost $16.00.
I'm estimating that a subscription, for two issues yearly, will cost  $50.00.
