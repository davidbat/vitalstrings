Is this another celebrity death hoax?
Unconfirmed reports say that Sweet November actor Keanu Reeves died on Sunday, February 12, shortly after a snowboard accident in a ski resort in Switzerland.
The actor & novice snowboarder was vacationing at the Zermatt ski resort in Zermatt, Switzerland with family and friends. Witnesses indicate that Keanu Reeves lost control of his snowboard and struck a tree at a high rate of speed.
Keanu Reeves was air lifted by ski patrol teams to a local hospital, however, it is believed that the actor died instantly from the impact of the crash. The actor was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident and drugs and alcohol do not appear to have played any part in his death.

According to the source, this story is still developing and further details about his death will be posted soon.
If you are going to search the Google or Yahoo! about this sad news, no major news sites like CNN, CBS or even a local Switzerland news report about it.  Further, fake news reports of similar content but of different actor’s name [like Christopher Reeves, Vita Crave (whoever he is)] were also posted.   So I guess, the website or source just randomly select actors’ name to put on the article.
I think the fake “news report” was intended to advertise the ski resort mentioned in the article. Thus, this is a death hoax.
