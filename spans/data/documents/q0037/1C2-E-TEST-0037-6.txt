Keanu Reeves is reportedly set to marry old flame Autumn Macintosh.Friends claim the Hollywood actor proposed after rekindling his romance with Autumn, who he first dated in the early ‘90s, earlier this year. A source is quoted by Britain’s Daily Star newspaper: “Keanu and Autumn have know each other for years. In May, they got it together again and over the last few months Keanu started thinking about settling down. Commitment is a huge deal to Keanu.” In January, Keanu was rumoured to be back in the arms of another old flame, former wild child Amanda De Cadanet, who he was once engaged to. Despite the meteoric success of his Hollywood career, both Keanu’s family life and love life have been dogged by disaster.
The troubled star’s ex-convict father, Sam, abandoned both Keanu and his mother when he was just a few years old.
Later, the Reeves family was again rocked when an argument between Keanu’s sister, Kim - who has been battling leukaemia - and her mother over an English woman she had taken on as an adoptive daughter caused a bitter rift.
Since then, Keanu has battled deep depression after the heartache of his daughter being still-born, as well as her mother, Jennifer Syme, being killed in a tragic road accident a year later.

I just watched LAKEHOUSE & think that this actor is probably one of the best we have today.  His genuineness and his beauty of soul are evident in his personality and in his acting.

to marry or not to marry, you will always be one of the actors I admire. Marry anyway to find more meaning in your life.
