Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves
Hint for a happy moment:
If you ever need a little pick me up go to Youtube.com. Search "Sandra and Keanu" and watch some of their junkets and interviews. The two of them are independently quite adorable and together so sweet it'll put a smile on your face and warmth in your heart.
Love stories and friendship are necessary for all of us whether our personal strong suits or not. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock bring both love and friendship to the forefront of our
souls.
We are very fortunate to have actors in the world that make us smile and who in their own rights are truly wonderful additions to our world.
Love.
