Meet the new Ryan Gosling . In the past few days, a video of Keanu Reeves riding the subway has been making the rounds -- and it's not just because Reeves is on the crowded train alone. ( Cue: Sad Keanu meme .) The clip, which was originally posted to YouTube in August, shows the 'Matrix' star giving up his seat for an elderly lady. That's right: movie star and pretend kung-fu extraordinaire Keanu Reeves takes the subway and looks out for the little people.
Also, does everyone else on the train not realize there's an A-list actor sitting there, or are people just playing cool? You can see for yourself in the video below.
Reeves is set to appear in the fantasy film, '47 Ronin,' out Nov. 21, 2012.
