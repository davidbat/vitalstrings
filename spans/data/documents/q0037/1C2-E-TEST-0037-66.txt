Could Keanu Reeves be a baby daddy?? According to 46-year old Karen Sala from Canada, he’s the father of her four children!
According to the Toronto Star Sala is seeking child support from Keanu for herself and her four children, whom she claims are the actor’s.
She filed a notice in court earlier this week, and papers were served to Keanu’s business manager. She said in an interview yesterday, "I'm pissed. I just want him to stand up and be a man.”
A spokesman for Reeves denies his client has ever met this woman, though she says she’s tried privately over the years to persuade him to provide child support.
Sala said her children would like to know the truth about who their father is and she is launching the suit to seek "closure." She said, "They grew up with the ex's family always saying they weren't his, so they had to contend with that.”
Keanu’s rep issued a statement saying, "Karen Sala's allegations are completely false and absurd. Mr. Reeves has no knowledge of who she is.  Before you disparage my client and lend validity to this, there's clearly something wrong with someone who claims child support after all the kids have grown. I'm just pointing that out.”
Sala said her relationship continued with Reeves throughout her teens and early 20s, saying Reeves has stayed in touch over the years and played a minor role in her children's upbringing. She even says he came to the hospital for the birth of her youngest son, who is now 20.
Sala went on to say, "He knows what the kids are doing. He used to buy them Christmas gifts when they were little. His mother bought Easter gifts and stuff like that. He did contribute back in the day when they were younger.”
In addition to the DNA test, Sala is seeking child support of $150,000 per month, retroactive to June 1988, as well as $3 million per month in spousal support retroactive to November 2006.
This is either a case of the crazy, or a major dark secret Keanu has been hiding for a very long time!
