Atlanta Keanu Reeves fans, the handsome actor struck a pose dressed to kill on the red carpet at the Power of Film Gala on March 18, 2012 across the seas in Hong Kong.
Dressed in his monochrome blue ensemble worthy of any GQ (Gentleman’s Quarterly magazine) fashion shoot which included a sharp navy blue suit, looking incredibly sultry, Reeves still managed to kid around and display some martial arts moves with actor Donnie Yen.

The Power of Film Gala honors the international actor and filmmaker Keanu Reeves as well as Hong Kong-based documentary filmmaker Duncan Jepson.
Funds from the charity event support FilmAid Asia's programs, which use the power of film to bring education to refugees and displaced persons globally as well as addressing pressing issues such as trafficking of men, women and children in the Asia region.
Attending the gala event were actor Daniel Wu and wife Lisa S, the Monaco-born and New York-raised model Lisa S, wore a lovely one-shoulder gown in reds and purples.
