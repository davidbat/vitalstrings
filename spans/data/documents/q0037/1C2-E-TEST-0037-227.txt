Keanu Reeves Paternity Suit
Keanu Reeves talks about his anguish after a Canadian lady claimed he’d fathered her kids, naming the paternity episode “horrible.”
The celebrity took a DNA examination after Karen Sala filed suit against him in ’09. The woman alleged the acting professional was the biological father of a minimum of one of her four grown-up children and demanded huge amounts of money in child and spousal support payments.
The examination demonstrated the actor is not related to any of the children, however, Sala took the case back to the courtroom to contest the outcome.
A judge dismissed the case in 2010 and Reeves, who asserted all along he did not know Sala, is pleased he has been cleared of the accusations.
He explains to UsMagazine. com, “I had to go to court. It was horrible. I didn’t do it. I’m not the dad.”
