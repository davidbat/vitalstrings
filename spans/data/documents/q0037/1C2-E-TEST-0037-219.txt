Charlize Theron supposedly looking for baby daddy, Keanu Reeves fits the bill.
Charlize Theron adopted baby Jackson last month, but we have yet to see the presumably adorably little guy. But that’s not the story here. Instead, we’re going to talk about Charlize’s other man: Keanu Reeves. In Touch Weekly claims longtime pals Charlize and Keanu have taken their friendship to another level. A romantic, instant family level.
“They were friends with benefits in the past, but now it’s something more,” a friend of both stars whispered to the mag. ITW also says Charlize “is looking for a baby daddy.” Apparently, the 36-year-old is a month in to motherhood and incapable of doing the single mom thing. Puh-leeze. Nevertheless, it’s Keanu to the rescue.
“He babysits and brings toys when he visits Charlize and Jackson,” the friend reports. “He even built the crib and changes diapers!” Snort. Who’s buying this? I don’t doubt the Sweet November and The Devil’s  Advocate co-stars are friends, but more than that? I don’t think so. Keanu seems to be the go-to guy for single women, famous women, who adopt. After Sandra Bullock adopted little Louis, the rumours started with her and Keanu as well.
If Charlize and Keanu are a thing, he’s not the only man in her life. Michael Fassbender? Sadly, no, she’s not his type . Alexander Skarsgard? Maybe. Us Weekly (via Cele|bitchy) claims Alex and Charlize went on a “second date” recently, where “she rested her head on his shoulder and they looked very couple-y.” A Theron source added, “It isn’t serious. And no, he has not met the baby!”
If anything actually is happening with Charlize and any of these guys, it’s probably not serious. She’s a little busy right now adapting her new life as a mom, so keeping it casual might be the way to go. For now. But I’m sure Jackson is all the man she currently needs, even if that does mean fending off the advances of Keanu, Alex and Fass.
Hey, wait a sec... what about:
