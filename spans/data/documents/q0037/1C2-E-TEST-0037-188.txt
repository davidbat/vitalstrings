Enigmatic: Keanu as Neo in Matrix Reloaded
Keanu Reeves has always had a reputation for revealing nothing to the          press. Even his co-star in the Matrix films, Laurence Fishburne, laughingly          admits Keanu gives little away.
"I've been working with him for five years. I don't know a f*cking          thing about him. All I can tell you about Keanu is that after I've spent          that much time with him, I love the motherf*cker, but I can't tell you          a f*cking thing about him."
Keanu isn't about to make our lives any easier. Sitting on a studio soundstage          and feeling more relaxed than usual, trying to get to know the real Keanu          is simply a waste of energy. As good natured as he is, he is not prepared          to divulge to the press what Fishburne was unable to uncover over five          years, laughingly saying that "Oh yeah, you'll get that right here," when asked what the real Keanu is like. He relishes being an enigma and          is happy to remain that way. "No, I want to sit here and cry and          reveal my self to you all you fucking crazy guys." At least the now          38-year old star has managed to develop a sense of humour.
72 hours to save the girl and his world
When it comes to discussing the work, Reeves is more passionate, especially          regarding the latest Matrix instalment. One of the year's most anticipated          films, Matrix Reloaded casts Reeves again as Neo, aka Thomas Anderson,          who, along with the rebel leaders, estimate that they have 72 hours until          250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants.
During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity from a dark fate          in his dreams. In part a Messianic fable, the original Matrix was not          only a surprise hit when released in 1999, but its influence on popular          culture and cinema in general, remain extraordinary.
Reeves is reluctant to define the first Matrix's role in pop culture. "I hope that if people did respond to the first one, that they get          something out of the second."
More self-assured these days, he claims that although he hasn't reflected          much on how he might have changed since The Matrix. "I'll just say          I'm older and older. I don't know. It's such a hard question. With any          experience you have, you know more about yourself in terms of what goes          on, in terms of being away from home for so long. Then, through that you          discover what is important and there are things that inform you, including          the friendships along the way."
Including the shoot on the first Matrix, Reeves spent close to two years          living in Sydney working on the trilogy, or "basically my whole 37th          year working on the last Matrix films."
"It was really hard to be away from friends and family that long," he admits. But at least it was in Sydney and he defines his experiences          in the Australian city as being memorable. "I just loved the city.          Great people, beautiful weather, beautiful architecturally and there's          good cuisine there."
While Reeves relishes being a part of the Wachowski Brothers vision, it          remains a vision that the trilogy's directors themselves won't share with          the press. Keanu is reluctant to further define their vision in their          place, "because they don't want it defined. I don't think that's          something they're interested in giving to anyone who watches the film."
But unlike most Hollywood films, this pair of directors was at least able          to realise a vision they had been harbouring for years prior to the first          film. "I think there's always something you wish you could do more          of, but we, the brothers, Warner Bros and all the producers certainly          gave a lot of resources to realizing these pictures, and it's great and          I think you see it on the screen. There's a lot of movie up there."
Reeves put more into this latest duo of films than ever before, in terms          of training and keeping better in shape.
"Some of the things I had to do were a little more advanced such          as some of the multi-fighting and the weapons." Keanu and his fellow          cast members spent an initial six months in Los Angeles undergoing an          intense training schedule, though the actor downplays the rigour of it          all.
"I just did it through basically practice and learning. Because of          the experience of the first one I had some body memory. I knew what I          was going into and so I could pick up the choreography quicker and I knew          where I was in wirework.
Some of the stuff that was difficult in the first one was kinda like — I know how to do this. And then once I said that, our action choreographer          Woo-ping Yuen would say well how about this? Or the brothers would say          how about this? So then it was the back flips and the cartwheels."
Pass the salts
It wasn't easy, and even involved the actor occasionally immersing himself          in a bathtub full of ice. "Sometimes what happens during the first          four weeks of training, you're basically tearing micro-muscle tissue every          day, so you get inflammation. I'm not 22 anymore and bouncing around,          so ice and Epsom salts just help the recovery. Also, sometimes, because          you're stretching two hours a day, kicking and stretching and kicking,          you get all those tears and inflammation and I get cramps, so cold water          tends to help alleviate that so you can sleep or walk upstairs."
Reeves may have been only too aware of the physical pain, the reason that          The Matrix redefined a genre was its sci-fi sophistication with its layers          of religious undertones and metaphysical symbolism to a futuristic Biblical          tale.
Even Keanu admits that in working on both Reloaded and November's Revolutions,          he was mystified as to why certain scenes or moments were being executed "but that's also part of the fun of it for me".
He begins to warm to his theme. "Those questions you have are also          strongly Neo's questions such as: Do you believe in fate? Why not? I'm          not in control of my own life. That whole thing of asking those questions          I think is Neo's journey and it was fun to ask them. I have a feeling          about what Neo wants and the brothers had a feeling, so in the second          one in an odd way I think they kind of invert what happened. In the first          one, Thomas Anderson became Neo; his digital self became his real self          and his fear of flying became him flying and there's a certain aspect          in Reloaded where the hero gets inverted and we're back to Neo as Thomas          Anderson. We see his fears, his personal kind of hopes and his          vulnerabilities."
Almost like the actor himself, but he won't say so.
Reeves is currently shooting something quite different, a new untitled          romantic comedy from Nancy Meyers, co-starring Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton,          Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand. "It'll be great to finally show          off my funny side." And no, he is not in the running to play Superman,          he says.
"They've all died or have been injured", he jokes darkly. "Like          films that have Johnny in it," he concludes with a wry smile.
