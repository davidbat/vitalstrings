Keanu Reeves Married?
Extra, extra, read all about it. Keanu Reeves MAY have gotten married.
Yup, a British tabloid reported this week that the privacy-loving "Matrix" megastar secretly wed his former squeeze [ Autumn Macintosh ] last month in Los Angeles.
“They don't like causing a fuss," an insider told the paper, adding that the supposed "quiet civil ceremony" at a "small restaurant" was attended by "only family and friends."
The timing of the alleged aisle walk is bewildering. In recent weeks, Reeves, 40, has been squiring Lynn Collins, 28, his "Il Mare" co-star and rumored girlfriend around Los Angeles.
So what's the deal? Did the notoriously close-mouthed Keanu take an under-the-radar plunge with Macintosh, whom he was first linked to back in March 2004?
Well, considering that the last movie I saw him in was in 1994 ( Speed ) and the only good movie that I saw him in was in 1986 ( River’s Edge ) …who cares?
