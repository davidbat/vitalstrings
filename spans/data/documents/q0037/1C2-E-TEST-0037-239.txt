EEK! Oh My God!  It's... Keanu Reeves!
I'm going to write about something now that scares the hippidy-hoo out of me:
 Keanu Reeves.
Trying To Squeeze Our Mind Grapes
No.  I'm not joking.
The man, if you can call him that, just frightens me.  You see, way before he was Satan's love-child in The Devil's Advocate and a detective that Hell spit back out, in Constantine, I knew that there was something fundamentally wrong there.  I mean, he just oozes scary, computer-mind-melding, time-traveling in a phone booth with death, you might be the anti-christ-ness.
My husband thinks I'm a freak, but I'm not crazy.  That guy has no emotion. None.
 He's been tauted as one of the worst actors in Hollywood yet, he's in everything!  He's on everything! And he looks down at you from a tv screen with those giant sized scary, dead eyes, like he can see right through you.  Brrr!
It's evil, I tell, you!
I mean have you looked into his eyes? Have you?
Look!
