It's about damn time.
Keanu Reeves is in negotiations to get financing for his directorial debut, a Mandarin-English language movie in which he plans to star and direct.
Keanu will be playing the villain in Man of Tai Chi against his Matrix co-star, Tiger Chen who played a member of the kung fu team in the 1999 movie.
The film will give Keanu a chance to show off more of his martial arts skills because the film is said to feature some serious fighting scenes.
Right up Keanu's alley!  We knew it would be any day now that the actor would be wanting to direct his first film.  This seems like a good fit.  Get it, Keanu!
