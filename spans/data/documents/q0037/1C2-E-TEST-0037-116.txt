Gorgeous, Evocative Romance
Keanu Reeves survives the horrors of World War II by writing letters and clinging to the memories of the wife (Debra Messing) he met and married over a weekend leave.  Returning home, the wife isn't as he remembers her, the 'old job' isn't what he wants, and the world is changing in ways he never imagined.  Meeting young college student Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, who is returning home pregnant, and without a wedding ring, to the traditional old-world father she knows will never accept her back, Reeves agrees to accompany her, posing as her husband.  The plan is for Reeves to leave on the following morning, writing that he made a mistake and wants a divorce, but life in the family's vineyards takes a surprising turn for the young conspirators.  The scenery is gorgeous, the film includes some beautifully evocative imagery, and this marks one of the final appearances by the great Anthony Quinn as the all-understanding grandfather who goads the young couple's relationship along while his son, Giancarlo Giannini as the traditional 'old-world' father, struggles to maintain control over his newly 'modernized' children.

Not for the simple minded, but for mature audiences only. By mature, we mean people of moral values.
This movies has non stop action without car crashes, explosions, gun fights or martial arts mayhem.(sp) The movie is extremely romantic without nudity or raw sex.The acting is fantastic without profanity. How can this be so? You just have to watch the movie to understand. If after you watch the movie and still don't understand, then you are just not mature yet.

I'll never get tired of this movie!
This romantic tale is one to leave you awestruck.  The chemistry is so that you are drawn deep into the lives of the characters, you feel their emotions first hand.  I cannot help but grin through this movie, from their smiles to the father's glare. This is definitely a movie that almost any woman would enjoy kicking back and sharing with a significant other.

One you can enjoy over and over and over
My wife recently discovered that we had this movie while checking out seemingly blank tapes. We have watched it 7 times in the first 3 days we found it. What a treasure of a romance. For those who are incureable romantics. The music is just 'wonderful'. Rated with our top three romance films the other two being Somewhere In time and The Love letter (Hallmark)

Beautiful Movie
I felt this movie in my soul.  It was not only a beautiful love story but beautiful to watch.  The story made you feel you had ownership in the vineyards and the family's pain becomes your own, their joy becomes yours. You will feel a real connection to the people in this movie and love all that they love. This is a great movie to snuggle up with someone you love and enjoy!! My favorite scene is when the frost comes to the vineyard and they try to stop it with the ''wings''.

I'm still walking in the clouds....
Every time I see A Walk In the Clouds, I forget to breathe & keep having to remind myself! It carries you away into an extraordinary wonderland, in a different time & place that is inexplicably wonderful.    World War II is winding down. Men are returning to the women & families that love them. In Paul's case, he is an orphan with no family aside from the wife he met & married just days before he left to fight in the war. One's interest is peaked in the sexy beginning when Paul returns home to his vivacious wife. Then, the viewer is graciously tempted to become more involved in the plot & lives being presented.   The chemistry between Paul & Victoria can't be found just anywhere. This is by far one of Reeves' most outstanding performances. He almost makes you believe that he really is this ''Paul Sutton.''    The conflict with Victoria's father is a strong base for interest & the climax near the end is the perfect bow for tying up this most beautiful package! I would recommend it to anyone who ever has or ever could fall in love!

A timeless classic
Alfonso Arau brings out the romantic best in   Keanu Reeves, who portrays Paul Sutton, the   chocolate selling WW II veteran. The drama   begins when Paul and Victoria meet on a bus. He   learns that she is pregnant and unmarried, and   offers a one-day pretend marriage to protect her   honor. The ruse is complete with a foil chocolate   wrap for a wedding band. But, sigh, they fall in   love. The obstacles in their relationship are   Victoria¿s father, obsessed with honor and   tradition, and the fact that Paul is already married.   A Walk in the Clouds is perfectly cast, and   California¿s vineyards create a majestic, almost   surreal setting. I¿ve watched this movie several   times, and it remains one of my favorites.

What a film
I really love this movie! I find it so romantic and breathtaking! If there was ever a way to fall in love this would be it. I can watch this movie a million times. I think that this was one of Keeanu Reeve's best movies ever. It is a wonderful combination of romance, humor, and story. The scenery is absolutely amazing.
