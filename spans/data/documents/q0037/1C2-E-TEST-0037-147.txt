Is Keanu Reeves Married ?
For  the most of his life Keanu Reeves lived in hotels and rented apartments even  after rising to stardom. This is because he did not have a family of his own  and lived all by himself. He was along term resident in Chateau Marmont.
Only in 2003 he  bought his first house in Hollywood Hills and he also purchased an apartment in  Central Park West in New York City.  Reeves has never been married but he did have his share of affairs with women. In  1999, Reeves was dating Jennifer Symes, who gave birth to a still born daughter  and later in 2001, Symes lost her life in a car accident. After that Reeves  never attempted marriage again and he still is not known for dating anyone.
In spite of his  high profile life and a great career, Keanu Reeves has been very unlucky in his  personal life. He did not have a normal childhood and had to move around a lot  all over the world as a child. He went where ever his mother took him and he  had to grow up with many step fathers. His mother was divorced too often and  also she took up various professions. Keanu Reeves has one sister, who was  diagnosed with cancer and died later.
Keanu was  involved in a car accident himself and was sued for a hefty sum of $700,000.  There are rumors today that Keanu has joined the group of scientologists along  with Tom Cruise. He has not denied or confirmed it so far.
