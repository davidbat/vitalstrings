jtm_74, that's an awful thing to write. Keanu has suffered so much in his personal life and you go and make a stupid, slanderous comment like that. Don't you have any compassion?
Anyway, on Christmas Eve in 1999 Keanu and his then girlfriend Jennifer Syme lost their baby daughter. Thier grief over her death was too much to bear and Jennifer pushed Keanu away so they ended up breaking up. They got back together and were on and off again until April 2001, tragically Jennifer died in a car accident. Keanu was filming The Matirx sequels in Australia at the time when he got the word of her death. He immediatly flew home to be one of the pallbearers at her funeral. Insiders say that Keanu was devestated at the funeral. It's so sad. I myself, feel Keanu still hasn't gotten over this. Afterall, he had a ready-set family and it was tragecally taken away from him. It is said that he had many female friends but none are involved with him. It is also said that no other woman has been able to get close to him. He has pubically stated in a Parade magazine article that he had undergone therapy(talked to a psychiatrist) to try and get over his personal truama due to the tragedies. He seems happier lately but no one can really tell if it's all an act or not. He's so private and mysterious so it's hard to know for sure who or what's going on in his personal life. All I know for sure is that he seems like a cool, sweet down to earth guy in real life and I hope he finds future happiness because he deserves it.
