Despite a deadpan style, Keanu Reeves has developed an impressive portfolio of acting parts. His theatrical start at Shakespeare and Company in Lenox, Mass., including a small part in The Tempest, gave credence to his assaying other Shakespearean roles in Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing (1993) and, in the title role, a Winnipeg stage production of Hamlet. His roles in everything from the blockbuster Speed (1993) to untraditional flicks like My Own Private Idaho (1991) display his versatility. Reeves first received attention for his performances in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1987) and has since been seen in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1991), Feeling Minnesota (1995)The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1996), Devil's Advocate (1997), The Gift (2000), The Replacements (2000), and Something's Gotta Give (2003). He starred as Neo in The Matrix trilogy: The Matrix (1999), The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both 2003). Off the screen Reeves plays in the band Dogstar.
