Trivia: Filmed on location on LA's 105 freeway                 before it was opened to the public.
Goofs: Errors in geography: When the bus                 crashes into the airplane supposedly at LAX, a mountain range                 can be seen in the background. There is no mountain range that                 close to LAX. 
 
Plot                 summary
 
Jack                 Traven (Reeves) is a hot-shot Los Angeles police S.W.A.T.                 officer who is willing to do unconventional things to resolve                 hostage situations. Howard Payne (Hopper) tries to extort money                 by threatening to send an elevator full of people plummeting to                 the ground, using remote controlled explosives attached to the                 cable. Jack and his partner Harry (Daniels) foil his plan and                 nearly catch him. Payne takes Harry hostage, only to have Jack                 shoot Harry to deprive him of a shield. Payne ducks through a                 door and an explosion follows almost immediately, leading them                 to believe he killed himself.
 
Later,                 a very-much-alive Payne phones Jack, telling him that a bus has                 been rigged with explosives. When it exceeds 50 miles per hour                 (mph), the bomb is armed and set to explode if the speed drops                 below 50 mph thereafter. Additionally, no one is allowed on or                 off the bus.
 
 
 
Traven                 races to intercept the bus, commandeering a sports                 car to do so. He locates the bus on a freeway and jumps from                 the car to the fast-moving bus. Unfortunately, he is too late to                 stop the bomb from arming. A passenger, mistakenly believing                 that Jack is there to arrest him, produces a handgun and demands                 the bus be stopped. While Jack tries to explain the situation,                 another rider tackles the hoodlum, causing the gun to go off and                 hit the bus driver.
 
A                 young woman, Annie (Bullock), takes the wheel. Even though she                 lost her license for speeding, she must, ironically, speed                 through the congested city. The police are alerted to the crisis                 and provide an escort, clearing traffic and eventually directing                 the bus to an unfinished section of freeway clear of traffic.
 
The                 police commandeer a large flatbed truck to try to unload the                 passengers. Jack warns his superior that the attempt would be                 seen by the bomber (since television news helicopters are                 filming overhead) and the passengers killed. However, the young                 cop convinces Payne to allow the bus driver off the bus. Seeing                 the injured man taken off safely, a woman attempts to get off                 too. Payne, who is indeed watching, detonates a small charge                 below the floor of the bus near the door, killing her.
 
The                 situation takes a terrifying aspect when the police learn of a                 wide gap at an approaching overpass. With no other option,                 Traven tells Annie to speed up in hopes of jumping the gap.                 Against all probability (and the laws of physics), the bus                 successfully makes it while still maintaining the necessary                 speed.
 
 
 
Following                 Jack's instructions, Annie drives into Los Angeles International                 Airport, whose airspace is prohibited to the media helicopters.                 Jack realizes that Payne must have a camera watching the                 interior of the bus and manages to have several minutes of the                 transmission taped and fed back into the camera in an endless                 loop. This allows the passengers to get off without being                 detected. The driverless bus then collides with a cargo plane                 and explodes, leading Payne to think everyone has been killed.
 
Meanwhile,                 Harry finds the bomber's identity. It turns out that he is a                 retired Atlanta police bomb squad officer, living in Los                 Angeles. Unfortunately, Payne is prepared. When they go to                 arrest him, the house that the police raid blows up, killing                 Harry.
 
The                 police set up a sting operation to try to capture Payne, but he                 is not taken in. In a last ditch attempt to get his money, Payne                 masquerades as a policeman, lures Annie onto a Metro Red Line                 subway train and takes her hostage. Realizing Payne's plan, Jack                 boards the train. The two fight on top of a subway car and Payne                 is decapitated by a hanging light. However, the train can't stop                 since Payne killed the operator and destroyed the controls. In                 the end, it crashes at what is now the Hollywood/Highland Red                 Line station. (In 1993, the North                 Hollywood extension was under construction.) The train                 derails and is sent up an equipment access ramp outside                 Grauman's Chinese Theater.
 
As                 they emerge unhurt from the wreckage, Jack asks Annie jokingly "I thought relationships based on extreme experiences never                 worked?" She replies "Well, we'll just have to base it                 on sex then." and they kiss.
