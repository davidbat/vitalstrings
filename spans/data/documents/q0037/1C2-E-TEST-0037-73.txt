Dating since April, Keanu Reeves and girlfriend, Parker Posey are to have their first child together.
They are together since April.
Keanu had never been in a serious relationship after his traumatic experience when his long term girlfriend died in a car crash.
Keanu had fathered a still born child in 1999 after which Jennifer Syme died in 2001.
He had been on and off relationships and link ups never really getting stable.
Reeves and Posey were seen happily whiling away their time in an exclusive Los Angeles store Petit Tresor. They were spotted buying baby products which were worth more than $1000.
An onlooker says that Keanu was over excited in picking up things which were a lot and were varied.
“…They were holding hands and laughing as they walked around the shop…”, was what the onlooker had to say about the seemingly happy couple who are expecting their first child.
But other reports contradict the present one. A source close to the couple said the products bought by the couple do not bear their monogram that is the playmats bought by the couple (are presumable for a friend) have names/symbols that do not match either Keanu or Posey’s names.
