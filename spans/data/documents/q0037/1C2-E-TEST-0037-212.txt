Hekki - It's devistating, something that can either make you stronger or tear you down.
I can not explain how horrible it is to go through labor and give birth to a dead child.

Re: Keanu Reeves' stillborn daughter
I was under the impression that this rarely happens any more, at least in industrialized nations with prenatal care. In ye olde days women gave birth in barns and shit where no one knew the gender or relative health of the fetus. Why couldn't doctors have caught whatever pathology existed before labor? Did the fetus just suddenly die?
Inquiring, stoned minds want to know.

I know of TWO women (both friends of a friend) who had stillbirths. The only thing more devastating would be losing a child you already know and love.
Sometimes modern medicine can't do a thing about it.

I was born in Barrie and my parents still live there.  It is enough of a small town that if Keanu Reeves was there on a regular basis the whole population would have known.  Plus my Keanu senses would have been tingling, I had the Hugest crush on him when he was Johnny Utah.

Well, if Keanu ever decides to procreate again, mah womb will be available. Even if it's 20 years from now and I'm barren. We can still try. Over and over again. ;D
BTW I was a huge fan of him back in the day and I was extremely jealous of Jennifer, not that I wanted her to die or anything. I got the impression that she was normal and a genuinely  cool person. SO NOT like the famewhores trying to get with actors for the moolah. The whole ordeal was and is still sad. RIP Baby Ava & Jenny Syme.

I love the Pre-Matrix nose job Keanu.  Now he's all pastey and gray.

Sheeps that's hilarious..yes acting as your own lawyer is a bad sign. It's a sign that someone is riding the crazy train full speed ahead.
GOd poor Keanu I had no idea. Wow. I would be in rehab 8 times over with that trail of misfortune. His baby then his girlfriend? I never saw pictures of them together. And she must have been doing drugs with MM (from what someone posted) she was found intoxicated with rolled up bills, etc. She probably was so destroyed from losing a child she went off the rails. That fucker MM was probably too out of it to notice/care not to let her drive.
This hag should be ashamed of herself leave the poor guy alone.

This was a blind item on CDAN maybe a year ago. A lot of people guessed Keanu. Something about a foreign-born actor having a baby mama who didn't know that he was rich and famous. Guess she knows now.

I don't think Keanu will ever have another child. I believe he's too traumatized from losing his daughter and girlfriend to go down that route again.

I don't think any details were ever given about his stillborn baby, rightfully so. I do remember when it happened because I was in JHS and my best friend at the time looooved Keanu Reeves and wished Jennifer Syme would die (in a jealous 7th grade way) and then SHE DID. We went to LA for a drama club trip and at LAX it was all over the newsstands that she had died in a car accident. It was like a year after the baby was stillborn.
