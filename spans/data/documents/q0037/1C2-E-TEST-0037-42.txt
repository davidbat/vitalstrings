Biography
Keanu Charles Reeves ( born September 2, 1964) is a Canadian film actor. Reeves is perhaps best known for his role in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure as well as Speed , Point Break and the science fiction-action trilogy The Matrix . He has worked under major directors, such as Stephen Frears (in the 1988 period drama Dangerous Liaisons ); Gus Van Sant (in the 1991 independent film My Own Private Idaho ); and Bernardo Bertolucci (in the 1993 film Little Buddha ). Referring to his 1991 film releases, The New York Times’ critic, Janet Maslin , praised Reeves’ versatility, saying that he “displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.” A repeated theme in roles he has portrayed is that of saving the world , including the characters of Ted Logan , Buddha , Neo , Johnny Mnemonic , John Constantine and Klaatu .
