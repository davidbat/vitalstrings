Sad No More
Keanu Reeves gently pushed out a subtle smile over the weekend to promote his movie Henry's Crime at the International Film Festival of Marrakech in Morocco. Keanu is 46 years old and his face skin is still as smooth as a Ken Doll's crotch. Either Keanu is on that Nicole Kidman stuff, or hapa don't crack! It's the latter. Hapa don't crack.
Keanu was probably in the middle of shaving off his beard when he got distracted by the sweet scent of a cupcake and dropped his razor to frown at it, but it works for me. It sort of looks like the furry outline of the Mushroom Kingdom.
