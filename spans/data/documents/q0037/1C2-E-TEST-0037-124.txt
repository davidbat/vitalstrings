The Smith family all came out to support Jaden at the big premiere of his movie The Day the Earth Stood Still . He was joined by the movie's big name stars Jennifer Connelly and Keanu Reeves who looked like they were having a blast at the premiere...ha. Sexy Jon Hamm had his longtime girlfriend Jennifer Westfeldt on his arm, though methinks Mad Men fans might be disappointed to see he's not playing Don Draper this time. It's hard to match the enthusiasm of the Smith family when they get on a red carpet and it sounds like they should get used to cheering Jaden on considering he may be the next Will Smith .
