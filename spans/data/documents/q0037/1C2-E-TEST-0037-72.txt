The Wall [due to his position in ice hockey] The One
2 September 1964, Beirut, Lebanon

One of the most inscrutable actors to ever hit it big, Keanu Reeves has been by turns adored, reviled, and grudgingly respected by the movie-going public. As the controversy over his talent rages on, his career choices and paychecks show him inching toward A-list status. Reeves, whose first name means "cool breeze over the mountains" in Hawaiian, was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1964. His mother, Patricia, was a showgirl; his father, Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. After their marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister Kim to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was 'Paul Aaron' (qv), a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father, who is now in prison on charges of cocaine possession. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname "The Wall") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.  After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the 'Rob Lowe (I)' (qv) hockey flick _Youngblood (1986)_ (qv), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama _River's Edge (1986)_ (qv), but his first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted Logan in _Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)_ (qv). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite 'River Phoenix' (qv)'s narcoleptic male hustler in _My Own Private Idaho (1991)_ (qv), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in _Dracula (1992)_ (qv), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don Jon in _Much Ado About Nothing (1993)_ (qv).  In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of _Speed (1994/I)_ (qv). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between largely unwatched small films, like _Feeling Minnesota (1996)_ (qv) and _The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997)_ (qv), and unwatched big films like _Johnny Mnemonic (1995)_ (qv) and _Chain Reaction (1996)_ (qv). After all this Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski brothers' cyberadventure _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv). Despite his deadpan delivery style and reputation as an oaf, Reeves continues to reel in choice roles and fat paychecks. Whatever he knows, he's not telling the public--his self-deprecating interview tactics and mysterious private life provide little insight into his artistry. As far as Reeves is concerned, it seems, he's just a regular guy who rides a motorcycle, plays in a band (Dogstar), and shows up every now and then for a movie shoot.

-   What would happen if you melted? You know, you never really hear this talked about much, but spontaneous combustion? It exists!...[people] burn from within...sometimes they'll be in a wooden chair and the chair won't burn, but there'll be nothing left of the person. Except sometimes his teeth. Or the heart. No one speaks about this, but its for real.
-   My name can't be THAT tough to pronounce!
-   When I don't feel free and can't do what I want I just react. I go against it.
-   [when told he'd have to "bite the bullet"] Yes, but I don't have to eat the whole rifle.
-   I'm a meathead, man. You've got smart people, and you've got dumb people. I just happen to be dumb.
-   I'm sorry my existence is not very noble or sublime.
-   [On being a star] It can still be very surreal. It's easy to become very self-critical when you're an actor. Then you get critiqued be the critics. Whether you agree with them or not, people are passing judgment on you.
-   [On drugs] I've had wonderful experiences. I mean really wonderful. In teaching. Personal epiphanies. About life. About a different perspective -- help with different perspectives that you have. You know what I mean? Relationships to nature. Relationships with the self. With other people. With events.
-   [when asked if he had any fears] I used to have nightmares that they would put "He played Ted" on my tombstone.
-   I'm Mickey Mouse. They don't know who's inside the suit.
-   Here comes 40. I'm feeling my age and I've ordered the Ferrari. I'm going to get the whole mid-life crisis package
-   It's always wonderful to get to know women, with the mystery and the joy and the depth. If you can make a woman laugh, you're seeing the most beautiful thing on God's Earth.
-   [On 'River Phoenix' (qv)] You can't blame Hollywood for what happened to River. Kids are doing drugs everywhere in the world. He had his own very personal problems I will never discuss with the press. They're just way too personal. River had a self-destructive side to his personality. He was angry and hurt that he couldn't have a private life once he became famous. He just couldn't deal with having his private life on the front page all the time.
-   [On 'River Phoenix' (qv)] River was a remarkable artist and a rare human being. I miss him every day.
-   [On 'River Phoenix' (qv) and _My Own Private Idaho (1991)_ (qv)] We were doing _I Love You to Death (1990)_ (qv), and we got the Idaho script. We were driving in a car on Santa Monica Boulevard, probably on the way to a club, and were talking really fast about the whole idea. We were excited. It could have been like a bad dream, a dream that never follows through because no one commits, but we just forced ourselves into it. We said, "Okay, I'll do it if you do it. I won't do it if you don't." We shook hands. That was it.
-   on Patrick Swayze: He was a beautiful person, an artist! Patrick, he just wanted to experience life and for his work he wanted to take the opportunity of the film and it gave him that sense. There was some sky diving sequences in this film we did together and as filming was going on it came to be that Patrick was jumping out of airplanes all the time. I think he had over 30 jumps during the course of filming and so the production served him with a cease and desist which he listened to until they got to Hawaii. He jumps out of planes and did the flips and falling to the ground and he did it with an open heart. I'll always remember his buddy for lighting up a room with his presence. I can say what I know that he lived life to the fullest.
-   (1995 quote on his idea of happiness) Lying in bed with my lover, riding my bike, sports, happy times with my friends, conversation, learning, the earth, dirt, a beautiful repast with friends, family with wine and glorious food and happy tidings and energy and zest and lust for life. I like being in the desert, in nature, being in extraordinary spaces in nature, high in a tree or in the dirt, hanging out with my family, my sisters.
-   (1995 quote) L.A. has been my place of abode for seven years and I have a little place in New York City. I don't even have a house house, but I have been living in the same place in Los Angeles for a couple of years and it's just now becoming a home. I like to be free and unfettered. I like the option of being able to do anything and go anywhere, anytime. I like to have my house open. A lot of my friends have keys to my houses and I like to have everything, you know, 'What's mine is yours,' and to drink wine, talk and hang out.
-   (1995 quote on My Own Private Idaho) You know what's great? Right after I finished Dracula, I went to Paris to visit a couple of friends, shipped over one of my Norton's, my '72 750 with California plates, and just hung out for two-and-a-half weeks. My Own Private Idaho had just opened at a theater right near my friend's house where I was staying. I got stopped by a couple of American students who'd seen it and they bought me a beer. Which is what you should do in Paris: sit in cafés, talk, hang out. I had miraculous weather, so it didn't rain on my parade. Then, I went to New York to visit friends, sat down, hung out, and the same sort of thing happened there. So, do I want more movies that lead to experiences like that? Yes, please.
-   (On auditioning for Oliver Stone's The Doors) I auditioned a few times, but I don't think I was ever seriously in the running. I was terrified. I just read some of Jim Morrison's poetry and listened to some of his music and did what I could.
-   (1992 quote) It's only very recently that I've been approached with, 'Would you like to do this?' Mostly, I'm still auditioning, which there's something to be said for. Up to now, my only real choices have been: 'Hmmmm, an audition, go or not go? Go!' I auditioned seven times for Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and all the 'finalists' had to read with everyone else-me, Pauly Shore, Josh Richman, Alex Winter and others. I met with Coppola three times before he asked me if I wanted to play the part in Dracula.
