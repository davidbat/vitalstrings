That’s right folks, according to The Hollywood Reporter:
The four main Japanese cast members for the Universal’s 3D version of the upcoming Keanu Reeves movie 47 Ronin have been cast.
The movie which is directed by Carl Rinsch (The Gift) and starring Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) is an English-language take on the much-filmed Japanese classic that will feature Hiroyuki Sanada (The City Of Your Final Destination), Tadanobu Asano (Ichi The Killer) and Rinko Kikuchi (Moteki) with Kou Shibasaki (Amalfi)
The story for 47 Ronin is based on a Japanese historical event known as Chushingura.
Production is supposed to start on the film this month.
