Notes
"He has only three possessions of any consequence. A bass guitar, so he can play with his folk-rock band, Dogstar, and two Norton motorcycles, British-made in the 1970s." - Michael Shnayerson on Keanu in Vanity Fair magazine, August 1995
"I'm Mickey Mouse. They don't know who's inside the suit." - Reeves on fame in Vanity Fair magazine, August 1995
"I'm trying not to be alone so much," says Reeves. "And man, it's a struggle. I want to get married. I want to have kids. That's at the top of the mountain. I've got to climb the mountain first. I'll do it. Just give me some time." - Reeves to Parade magazine, June 2006
"I've always considered that there's the role, and there's the actor. These two entities come together, and in the process I learn about the role, and the role learns about me. So you're holding the mirror up to nature, but that nature is your own." - Reeves to Premiere magazine, February 2005
"Listen, I'm an actor, not a movie star. The worry for me is that you never know where your next gig is coming from. To me the nature of the beast is that you finish working and then wonder if you'll ever work again. That feeling never goes away. Hopefully I'll be successful enough that people will be able to hire me. But I give my thanks for my life so far. It's been incredible. Do I want it to continue? Yeah, I really love it." - Reeves to the Chicago Sun-Times, March 28, 1999
"Playing live is fun. It is completely different to acting, but they are both imaginative, creative and emotional acts. Sometimes I think of playing full time, but it's a passing phase. Acting is home for me, that is where I live." - Reeves to the London Times, Jan. 11, 1998
He performs with his band Dogstar, formed in 1993 with Bret Domrose and actor Robert Mailhouse.
His first name, Keanu, means 'cool breeze over the mountains.'
In the June 2006 issue of Parade magazine, Reeves talks about his late girlfriend Jennifer Syme, whom he met in 1998 and who later gave birth to their stillborn baby daughter. Reeves and Syme remained best friends until April 2001, when Syme died in a car crash.
Reeves has an abdominal scar which is the result of a motorcyle accident.
Reeves was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child.
The Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, began a class called "The Films of Keanu Reeves" as of January 1994.
Various sources list either September 2 or September 4 as his date of birth (one lists August 2); since the majority indicate September 2, that is the date this database is listing.
"He's so fuckin' hard on himself, that it's to the point of depression. It's beyond art or work for him. If he feels he's bad in a scene, he'll go home pissed off, wake up pissed off, come back to the set pissed off, and then he'll try to focus. As soon as his take is done, you can see his whole body rest." - Shia LaBeouf on Keanu quoted to Premiere magazine, February 2005
