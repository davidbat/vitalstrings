It looks like Keanu Reeves has a sense of humor when it comes to his stereotyped sadness. According to The Guardian , the often glum actor has penned a book titled, 'Ode to Happiness.' But the actor's book is far from sunny.
"I draw a hot sorrow bath. In my despair room," reads one line.
Each page of the book features a line more somber than the last -- printed in large ink blot letters that look as though they've been smudged by falling tears. The book ends with a single black hole and the words, "It can always be worse."
Quick! Somebody offer this man a role in the next Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy -- that ought to cheer up this aching actor. But not so fast, ironically, the depressing literary work wasn't originally created with the intention to depress.
