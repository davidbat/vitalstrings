Actor musician Keanu Reeves was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1964 and has an estimated worth of $350 million dollars. Although he spent much of his early childhood globe-trotting with his family, they finally settled in Toronto and became Canadian citizens. Hampered by dyslexia, Reeves’s education suffered but he compensated for this on the ice, excelling as goaltender for his high school hockey team. After performing in a school production of Romeo and Juliet, Reeves left hockey and school to pursue a career in acting. Starting out with small roles on Canadian television, commercials, and various stage productions, Reeves first appeared on the big screen in Youngblood and then in various co-starring roles. Reeves achieved box office success with the 1989 smash-hit Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, which domestically grossed over $40 million dollars. Reeves went on to star in a host of films, both major and independent, including the drama Point Break, the indie cult-hit My Own Private Idaho.
Reeves was propelled into A-list status with the success of 1994 action flick Speed, which earned two Academy Awards and a total gross revenue of $350.5 million internationally and domestically. Between movies, Keanu took up the bass and co-found the band Dogstar with fellow actor/musician Robert Mailhouse. Reeves experienced further success starring in The Matrix franchise, a trilogy of sci-fi action films with total gross revenue of $1.6 billion dollars.  Keanu Reeves was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January of 2005.
