“The View” returns with new episodes next week, and the ABC chatfest has a good mix of guests.
Considering her touching and funny comments after Elizabeth Taylor’s death, Debbie Reynolds should have a lot to say to the “View” ladies. Reynolds will be on Friday’s show (which actually tapes Thursday). The Friday show also features Keanu Reeves and James Caan, who are co-stars in “Henry’s Crime.”  The Fashion Friday segment will feature designer Elie Tahari.
“Desperate Housewives” star Eva Longoria could have a lot to say on Tuesday’s show. That installment also features the women from “The Real Housewives of New York.”
“The View” airs at 11 a.m. weekdays on WFTV-Channel 9. The other guests next week:
Monday: Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb of the film “Soul Surfer. ” Also on tap are producer Jerry Weintraub; his wife, Jane Weintraub; and his girlfriend, Susan Ekins. Imagine how the women of the “View” will handle that trio.
Wednesday: Ashley Judd, Jesse Ventura and Robbie Robertson, who performs.
Thursday: Wynonna and Naomi Judd, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
