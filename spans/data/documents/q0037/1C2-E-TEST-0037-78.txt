I read all the other reviews for this movie, and I was amazed at the negative comments the guys made about it.  Well, I'm a guy and I loved this movie.  Okay, so Keanu Reeves doesn't get the award for best dramatic actor  of the century, but he's a lot better than, say, Jim Carey.  I didn't  perceive him as "woody" or "stoic," but rather I saw  him portraying a polite and shy young man who helps out a young woman in  distress at his own personal inconvenience.  That's a trait you don't see  very often these days.  It's a pleasant and refreshing change to see a  young soldier who is actually moral and decent and willing to help, even at  personal loss to himself.  Yes, it's a huge chick flick.  So what?  A lot  of chick flicks are great movies, and this is one of them.  Buy it and  watch it with someone you love.  You'll have a great time.  The photography  is spectacular.  The music is great.  The story is predictable, but then,  so are the plots of most of the action movies.  It's a rare movie that is  completely unpredictable.  This is one you won't forget.  Thanks to those  who produced it for giving us a good example of the way real men act around  women, particularly women in need.  This is one movie you can watch with  anyone... your spouse, your kids, your date.  It's a good, clean, moral  tale of shivalry that warms your heart and restores your faith in humanity.  It's a totally enjoyable experience.
