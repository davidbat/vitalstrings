Keanu Reeves Talks About His Tragic Life
Reeves: "I've had a vagabond life."
Hollywood hunk Keanu Reeves shocked the world with tragic stories about his life.
The actor reveled he had a hard time going though the past events in his life - his stillborn daughter and the girl's mother sudden death in a car crash,-  but now he's another man and ready to start a family again .
"I miss being a part of their lives and them being a part of mine. I wonder what the present would be like if they were here — what we might have done together. I miss all the great things that will never be," he told Parade magazine.
"I'm trying not to be alone so much," Reeves added. "And man, it's a struggle. I want to get married. I want to have kids. That's at the top of the mountain. I've got to climb the mountain first. I'll do it. Just give me some time."
Reeves had a hard time growing up too. His father abandoned the family when he was just a little boy and his mother married several times.
"I've had a vagabond life," Reeves told the magazine. "There is a bit of the gypsy in me, and living that way seemed to make sense. I couldn't settle down. I liked going to new places — renting apartments, staying in hotels. Then I turned 40. That birthday is hard, perhaps because you know you're grown-up. So now it's a makeover for me. I have bought my first house. I wanted a home."
