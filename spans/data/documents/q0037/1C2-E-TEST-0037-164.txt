Vasectomy reversal
1. Flexing his muscles and saving the day in the action movie Speed (1994). With short cropped hair and a slightly larger physique, Keanu has never looked so hot.
2. Redefining the word cool in The Matrix movies. Long black coat, small black sunglasses, swept backed hair - Neo was 'the one' and so is Keanu.
3. Charming older woman Diane Keaton in the movie Something's Gotta Give (2003). Doesn't do anything for you? Wait until you're the wrong side of forty and then you'll understand.
Three Things You Never Knew
1. Despite his surfer dude type image, he was actually born in Beirut, Lebanon. However, his family moved to New York City when he was a child.
2. He very nearly signed up to reprise his role as Jack Traven in Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) but pulled out at the last minute. Just as well he did because the film was a turkey.
3. He was first choice for Charlie Sheen's role in Platoon (1986) but turned it down. Unfortunately for Keanu the film was a tremendous critical and financial success
