Don’t worry Sandra, I am definetly not buying that scumbag’s book, it’s only filled with more lies and we all love you, Jesse can go rot in hell, all he is is a big liar and nothing in that book will be true so I wouldn’t even waste money on it unless someone wants to use it for fuel for their barbecue
Don’t worry Sandra, keep your head high and move forward with grace and style, you’re a queen compared to that dumb Kat Von D.

That’s what happens if you’re too picky. In the end you pick the wrong guy.
