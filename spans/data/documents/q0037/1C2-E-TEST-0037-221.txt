Dude! Keanu Reeves confirms to The Independent that the script for "Bill and Ted 3" is finished. “Yeah, we have a script,” Reeves told the British paper. "We’re trying to put it together. It’s a good script too.” Reeves’ co-star in time-traveling misadventure, Alex Winter, tweeted the good news on Sunday: “Script done? Check.  We love it? Check. Green light? Working on it!”
No more details are available for the third go-round, but Reeves told MTV last April that Bill and Ted are still trying to save the world: "When we last got together, part of it was that Bill and Ted were supposed to have written the song that saved the world, and it hasn't happened. So they've now become kind of possessed by trying to do that. Then there's an element of time and they have to go back.”
It's been 21 years since the last "Bill and Ted," nearly half a lifetime for the now 47-year-old Reeves, who admitted to the Independent, "I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness. It was also the end of the projection of my younger self. I came to the place where I thought, 'I don't know where I am anymore but where have I come from and what am I doing?'"
Reeves was being interviewed about the new documentary he produced, called "Side by Side," in which illustrious group of directors, including  Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher and James Cameron talk about the transition to digital film. Reeves is joining their ranks: he'll direct his first film, "47 Ronin," later this year.
