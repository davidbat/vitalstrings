Keanu Reeves is Still Sad
Keanu Reeves walks around the Meatpacking District in a jacket and jeans despite the 90 degree weather in New York City on Friday (July 9).
The 45-year-old actor, who was joined by a friend, still looked a little blue despite a massive internet effort to cheer him up a couple weeks ago.
On June 15, due to a recent photo of Keanu eating alone, a huge outpouring of love came in the form of creating a ‘Cheer Up Keanu Day’.   Fans left endearing messages and creative photoshopped pictures depicting the actor in different scenes all in a effort to cheer up the Matrix actor.  In case you missed it, here’s a hilarious video that pretty much summed it up.
