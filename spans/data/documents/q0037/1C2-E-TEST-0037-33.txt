We're not big fans of "gossip" news on this site (in fact,             we never cover it), but this story was just too big to ignore. Who             knows what sorts of waves this will cause through the Hollywood             community. Weird stuff. I've pasted the entire article below:
Keanu Reeves and Alan Cumming get             married
Wednesday March 31,11:59             PM ET
MASSACHUSETTS             (Providence Journal) - First Rosie, now Keanu! Only days before the             Massachusetts legislature was set to vote on the banning of gay             marriages in their state, actors Keanu Reeves and Alan Cumming,             raced over there to marry one another before a small party of             invited friends. Reeves, star of such films as "The             Matrix", "Something's Gotta Give" and "Point             Break" had always been rumored to be gay, but always maintained             his heterosexuality. Cumming, star of such films as "Spy             Kids" and "X-Men 2" had always been openly bi-sexual,             but had never married before. The duo, who had apparently been             "secretly dating on-and-off" for over four years, wrote             their own vows and recited them while Melissa Etheridge softly             hummed "Come Through my Window" in the background.
The state of Massachusetts was getting set to amend the state             constitution to ban gay marriage but establish civil unions for             same-sex couples, which is one of the reasons the long-time             companions decided to speed up the process and marry right now.             Ex-talk show host Rosie O'Donnell married her six-year companion Kelli Carpenter in a similar high-profile celebrity gay wedding in             San Francisco on February 27th. Reeves said that this was the             "happiest day of his life, both professionally and             personally". The couple, who held hands and french-kissed             openly in a press conference after the civil ceremony, were happy to             get it all out in the open, "I wanted to come out when The             Matrix hit big, but my agents told me that it would be career             suicide. I'm glad that I can finally tell the world that I am gay             and proud today. Thanks to The Matrix Revolutions!"
Reeves             and Cumming flew from Los Angeles to Auburn, Massachusetts             yesterday afternoon, for a 4 p.m. appointment at the Auburn City             Hall to obtain a marriage license. Immediately after the license was             issued, the marriage ceremony was performed by City Treasurer K.D.             Grant. The ceremony was held behind closed doors in a Mayor Gavin             McCleod's office. "It was one of the most beautiful things that             I have ever witnessed", said McCleod, "Keanu looked as             though he was on cloud nine, while Cumming was in tears the whole             way through. He was definitely the more 'queen' of the two".             The wedding, a first for either actor, lasted only a few minutes,             but featured plenty of bouquets and show tunes.
Cumming, elated by the whole affair, couldn't help but let his             joy be known to the world at the jam-packed press conference,             "I love Keanu Reeves and I don't care who knows! I am a man and             I love another man and I am proud of it. Tom...come out already, you             jerk!" Cumming's last remark apparently aimed at actor Tom             Cruise, a celebrity who has been dogged by "gay rumors"             since he hit it big, despite being married twice (to women), having             children with one of them and dating plenty of women over the years.             Reeves, embarrassed by Cumming remark, followed that up with a             crude note about his partner's surname, "Forget Tom, Alan...I'm             going to be Cumming with you tonight!" The crowd, made             up of a variety of cross-dressers, transvestites, lesbians and             business men in suits, squealed throughout most of the flashy             affair.
Gerry Adelstein, founder of the "Gay Men for America"             Organization took the opportunity to re-integrate their agenda,             "If we can put a man on the moon, why can't one man tell             another man that he loves him without the government getting             involved?" Adelstein, also known for dating actor Corey Feldman             (who is, surprisingly, not gay himself), also had some harsh words             for those people who are opposed to the legislation, "We are             proud to be gay and free in this society and other than Richard             Simmons, proud of every single of one of our man-loving brothers".
After the ceremony, Keanu had a few beers with local gay men at a             tavern called "The Back Door" and even took the             opportunity to come clean about a number of other things, "I             have no idea what the Matrix sequels were about either, but I was             gay and happy during those years, and didn't really care. The rumor             about me marrying David Geffen was actually false, but I did give             him a handjob once, at the back of a Denny's restaurant parking lot.             It was more of a fling. Also, I'm not going to "out"             anybody myself, but needless to say there is one other member of our             'Speed' cast that is about as gay as a French horn, and I'm not             talking about Dennis Hopper! Sandy, you butch, come clean             already!"
The             ramifications of this major Hollywood "outing" and             marriage was already sending shockwaves through the industry. Jack             Nicholson noted how he thought Reeves was always acting a little             "fruity" on the set of their last film together             "Something's Gotta Give", but didn't pay it much attention             because he was too busy "putting the nail to Peet". Barbra             Streisand, long-time proponent of gay marriages, was elated by the             news and couldn't help but wish her confreres a joyous life             together, "While this most certainly will not help Keanu's             limited acting abilities, the fact that he sleeps next to another             man every night, makes me proud to be ugly and American."             Streisand, who lost most of her talent back in the early 60s,             followed that up with a Yiddish salute, "Mazeltov, gay men...mazeltov!"
No word on how the marriage will             affect Reeves' next film, "Constantine", in which he plays             an irreverent supernatural detective, but early word is that he will             likely be playing him a little more "effeminate" because             he understands how most audiences will not be able to deal with the             "whole gay thing". "Joe Blow in bumf*ck, Arkansas             isn't going to see past the fact that I am a man-lover when he sees             me on the big screen from now on, so why bother hiding it. Leonardo             DiCaprio has been swinging his dick that way for years, and it             doesn't seem to have slowed down his career. Scorsese calls him all             the time, all I ever get is Jan De-f*ckin Bont."
Reeves             also wanted to thank the "Internet" for helping him face             his biggest fears. "I remember reading a story on JoBlo.com a             year or so ago about how much my last two movies sucked, and wanted             to email the owner of the site to tell him how much he sucked as             well, but then I realized that it was all a big joke, just like his             site, his haircut and this story. That's the day that I decided to             let the world know that I enjoyed hugging other men."
Berge Garabedian, owner of said             property, wasn't available for comment, but did offer a press             statement which read simply: "I always knew that he was             gay...not that there's anything wrong with that."Â
