On Sunday, many people are wondering is Keanu Reeves dead or alive? The latest celebrity death rumors indicated the star of "The Matrix" died in a snowboarding accident. However, this has not been confirmed by any major news sources. At this point in time it looks like yet another fake story someone decided to waste people's time with on the internet.
As the news of Whitney Houston's death is still sinking in for many people, there have been celebrity death rumors spreading on Twitter. A report from IBTimes indicates that Keanu Reeves' death hoax started up a trending topic on Twitter earlier on Sunday. The rumor was set in motion by a fake news site called Global Associated News. The site apparently reported that Keanu Reeves died in a snowboarding accident.
The fake site indicated that Reeves had been on vacation at a ski resort in Switzerland when the accident occurred. The false story also claimed the actor was airlifted to a local hospital, but that he had died instantly from the impact of the crash. This set off a lot of worried and upset tweets from fans who thought the actor had really perished.
These rumors seem to never stop, and thanks to Twitter they spread very fast. In the case of the Keanu Reeves death hoax, it came around the same time as a real deathâ€”Whitney Houston's. It's unfortunate that some people go to these lengths to get a fake website views, and especially during a time when a real celebrity death is being mourned.
