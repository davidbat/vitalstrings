Hollywood most-wanted man Keanu Reeves secretly married his girlfriend Autum Macintosh last month in Los Angeles. The rumors spread after the couple was seen at parties introducing themselves as man and wife.
A source told Britain's Daily Star newspaper: "Keanu and Autumn wanted something really low-key so opted for a quiet civil ceremony with only family and friends. "They don't like causing a fuss. It was at a small restaurant in Los Angeles and was very simple and chic". The couple were dating just over a year.
