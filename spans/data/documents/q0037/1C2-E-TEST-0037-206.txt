Keanu Reeves on Walk of Fame
Hong Kong - Hollywood movie star Keanu Reeves said the making of supernatural thriller Constantine has not changed his beliefs about religion but admitted he was now less sceptical about heaven and hell.
Currently on a three-day promotional tour for the film in Hong Kong, Reeves spoke of his love for his character, a chain-smoking exorcist who patrols the border of heaven and hell, fighting with half-breed angels and demons.
But the movie, an adaptation of the DC-Vertigo comic book, did not change his stance as an atheist.
"I wasn't raised in any special denominations and I haven't taken on any so far," he told reporters. "I used to have doubts (about heaven and hell) and now I doubt less," said the star of Matrix and Speed.
To prepare for the role, the 40-year-old screen heart-throb, who recently received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said he had to visit real-life exorcists to see them in action.
"I had to learn how to hold someone who is possessed with devils," he said.
The film will be released in South Africa on March 4 2005.
