Oh, great. Keanu Reeves is in Hungary (and England?) shooting scenes for a film that is based on the true story of a group of Japanese samurai avenging their lord. Nani? What the heck? What place does Keanu Reeves have inï»¿ such a depiction? More reasons to verify why I'm so put-off and fed up with mainstream Hollywood garbage. They could have at least gone to the Source if they wanted to film something authentic....why did they go to Hungary? Oh yeah, money.
The Japanese probably said "iie" too.
