  When lonely Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) takes a new job at Chicago City Hospital, she moves out of the lakeside home on Lake Michigan leaving a message for the new tenant to forward her mail. An architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), moves into the home, which is the home his father (Christopher Plummer) built for the family, and the house has been empty for years. Alex finds Kate's note and is confused because the address is for an apartment building not scheduled for completion for over a year from now. Alex sends Kate a letter, and the two begin exchanging notes that evolve into love letters. When it is discovered that they are living two years apart–Alex in 2004, Liz in 2006–they try to get to the bottom of the mystery, which involves Alex seeking Kate's 2004 counterpart while Kate waits for Alex to catch up in time.     1 User Review

  Best movie I have seen in a while. I loved this movie and will watch it again and again. I loved it so much that I went right out and got it.
