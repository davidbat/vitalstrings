Among the '50 most beautiful men in the world', according to People Magazine, Keanu had always led one of the most mysterious lives in Hollywood.
He was at first just another actor, but hit it big in 1994 with 'Speed' and made it directly to the A-list of real stars. Few things are known about him and, apparently, there isn't a lot to know: just a regular guy who likes to drive motorcycles, sings in a band, isn't involved with any (or more than one) famous actress and who, occasionally, appears on a set to make another smashing box-office movie.
In fact, just yesterday, Reeves put aside all secrecy and opened up to the fans, proving them that there are many things yet unknown about him. He declared that he has been terribly lonely and alone after the death of his wife, Jennifer Syme, which occurred in 2001 in a car crash, following another personal tragedy: the stillborn baby girl, only two years before.
Keanu confessed that he is still grieving for the loss of those dear to him and that he will try to move on with his life, unfair as it may seem. He is settled to start a new family and to have as many children as possible and, for this purpose, has bought and moved into a new house, because his vagrant existence just had to stop; he still has to 'grow some roots', though. So... girls, watch out, 'cause anytime now Keanu may decide it's the right moment to choose a bride!
