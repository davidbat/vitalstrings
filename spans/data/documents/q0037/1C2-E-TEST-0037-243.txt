He is going to be 45 in September, he can dress as he likes, he can shave or not shave and it's all ok and good........he is a PERSON.  Everyone would like to think that "celebrity" makes you something more than you are, it doesn't, it won't, and it is what it is......none of us are the sharpest shrimps on the boat.........including me.........let it go........he's fine and if I remember correctly, he is not gay, and isn't racist.he LIKES hats and football......just a human being......let him be, how would YOU like it if every time you went out someone snapped your pic??? huh, NOT pleasant................
