You’re right — the star of The Matrix and Speed has stayed mainly under the radar since the 2008 sci-fi remake The Day the Earth Stood Still. Reeves has focused on a few indie films, such as the upcoming drama Generation Um . . . , but returns to action fare with two new projects: a starring role in 47 Ronin, about a band of 18th-century samurai, and the bilingual martial-arts feature Man of Tai Chi, which Reeves is directing.
