Keanu Reeves and Parker Posey started dating earlier this year and recently visited Petit Tresor and spent over $1000.00 on items they picked out themselves.
Rumor mill, anyone?
An onlooker said: “They both looked really happy. They were holding
hands and laughing as they walked around the shop. Keanu was picking
out lots of different things and seemed really excited.”
I was all excited because I really like Parker Posey and thought it would be really cool for the two of them to have a baby even though it is a little soon in their relationship. Then I found out that none of the items they had monogrammed matched either of their initials.
So bummed.
I guess we’ll have to believe the rep who said that they were buying items for a friend.
