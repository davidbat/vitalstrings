Reeves Slams Wedding Rumours
Hollywood hunk KEANU REEVES has hit out at reports he secretly married his  ex-girlfriend AUTUMN MACINTOSH last month (MAY05) in Los Angeles.
This week (begs06JUN05) several British newspapers claimed the MATRIX  actor had a quiet civil ceremony at a small restaurant which was only attended  by family and friends.
Reeves, who first dated actress Macintosh in the 1990s, was rumoured to  have rekindled their romance months before the wedding.
The news sparked a media frenzy because Reeves is reportedly dating his IL  MARE co-star LYNN COLLINS and has been inseparable from her in the past few  weeks.
But his spokeswoman has branded the allegations "completely false".
