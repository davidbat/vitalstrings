Keanu Personal Diary
In December 1999, Reeves' girlfriend, Jennifer Syme, gave birth to a stillborn daughter who was named Ava Archer Syme Reeves. In April 2001, Syme was killed in a car accident. She was buried next to their daughter in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.Reeves has never reconnected with his estranged biological father, who served time in prison and was paroled after serving two years of a 10-year sentence for selling heroin at Hilo Airport in 1992.
Reeves enjoys riding motorcycles and coined the term "demon ride" to describe how he often rides with no headlights at night. On one of his "demon rides" in 1988, he crashed near Topanga Canyon and broke several ribs and ruptured his spleen; he has had an abdominal scar ever since when the paramedics arrived an emergency medical technician trainee dropped one end of the stretcher by mistake. He does not formally practice any religion, although he has a Christian background and is interested in Buddhism.
Reeves is fond of chess, motorcycles, ice hockey, and table tennis. He is left-handed, but plays the bass guitar right-handed and loves punk rock bands such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash, as well as legendary R&B singers such as Stevie Wonder and Otis Redding. Reeves is reported to be very generous with his time and money, lending both to a variety of causes. He took a significant amount of the profits from his Matrix series and treated the twelve stuntmen who worked on the films to motorcycles, among other things. In June 2006, he said that he would like to get married and to have children.
