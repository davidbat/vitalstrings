Whenever I try to log into the server it tells me that I'm currently banned. But I have done nothing wrong and I haven't been in any trouble whatsoever when I played on the server last night. Is it because you have not updated to 1.6.5 yet and that it's just a bug? Please message me with an answer. I'd really like to play on this server.
