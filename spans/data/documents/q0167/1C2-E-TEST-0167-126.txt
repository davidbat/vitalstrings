The Biggest Dig!
The Biggest Dig is a project which will have you digging through time. You will become a sort of archaeologist, sifting through many sources of information until you uncover a vivid picture of a historic moment. The Dig will call on your skills as a researcher, writer, and artist. It will make you familiar with facts and call on your imagination. Like the seventh grade Cultural Heritage Portfolio and the eighth grade Creative Scholar’s Project, it is the common, signature event of the sixth grade year at Beaver. Can you dig it?
Each of you will be assigned a year. The earliest of those years dates back more than 17,000 years. The most recent is 2008. In between are 31 years that are marked by a Main Event. Over the next six weeks, each of you will be researching that year, focusing not only on that Main Event, but also on other conditions and accomplishments across the continents. You will then author a chapter of a book, modestly entitled The Sixth Grade History of the World (Volume Six). Your findings will be reported in an oral presentation before classmates, faculty and selected guests. At that presentation you will unveil a visual display that you created to be featured on a time line to be installed in the hallways. You will be busy little Beavers, indeed.
Humanities classes will be dedicated to this work full time. Science, Language, Mathematics and Drama will pitch in when needed. For the next six weeks we’re packing up our PIGSEARS, piling into one big time machine, putting it into reverse and traveling back through history. When we return, we’ll have a better idea of how we got here in the first place.
Brace yourselves, kids. Its going to be the ride of the millennia!
