BigDig
This website is no longer live.
BigDig was a brand that was established to publicise the phenomenal scale of redevelopment which was taking place across Liverpool both in and in the years leading up to the city's successful year as European Capital of Culture 2008.
Regeneration and development in the city are continuing. You can find out more at either www.liverpool.gov.uk (will open a new window) or www.liverpoolvision.co.uk (will open a new window)
