Yes, it will make it a better place. I've visited Boston during the Big Dig process and it's clearly evident the highways negative effect on the city. It's like a sharp knife cut the city in half with this big ugly green elevated fume spuing highway. It's not a pedestian freindly gesture and cuts off the waterfront from the downtown. When all said and done, this seam will be transformed into a garden space reconnecting the broken communities and water front district of downtown boston. Boston will be a much more beautiful place to visit when the Big Dig is finished. Personally I loved the visit and would recommend it to anyone.
