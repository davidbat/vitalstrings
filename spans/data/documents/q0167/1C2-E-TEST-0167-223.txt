UNDERNEATH the INFRASTRUCTURE
Boston, Massachusetts Big Dig
Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel, surely the      world's largest urban infrastructure project, would have been a challenge      anywhere.  The Boston location guaranteed that deep soft clay      throughout its path would add some unique geotechnical complications, one      being that the entire new infrastructure itself would need deep support.
Founded in Boston in 1913 as a deep      foundation specialist, long before infrastructure became a buzzword, New      England Foundation Co. was well positioned to serve.  But it would face      unprecedented national and international competition, as the world community      of under-ground specialty contractors was attracted to Boston's mega      project.
Dwarfed by the giant 250ft. diameter x 80 ft. deep      cofferdam, two NEFCO rigs install 5 ft.diameter caissons, socketed up to 30      ft. in rock, for CA/T Vent Bldg. #6.
