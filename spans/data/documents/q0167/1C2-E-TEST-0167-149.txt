Jobs
One aspect of analysis for the Big Dig is job creation.  Being one of the largest civil works projects in history, it required an enormous amount of manpower.  One person involved with the project even described it as building the Panama Canal through downtown Manhattan.
The project officially broke ground in 1991 and officially concluded in December 2007, although construction was largely completed a few years prior.
According to an article in the Boston Globe, when construction peaked in July of 2000, an estimated 5,200 workers were on the job.  By May of 2004 that number had dropped to 1,000.  During this time, throughout the state of Massachusetts, construction employment stayed fairly steady.  In June 2004, “the average employment rate in the construction sector was 83.6 percent, up from 82 percent in June 2003.” (Boston Globe*)  In 1990, just before the Big Dig got underway, “the average employment rate in the construction trades was just 58.2 percent.” (Boston Globe*)
This proves that the Big Dig provided an significant increase in employment, a great accomplishment for the city of Boston.  I am still searching for information on how many of these workers moved to the Boston area and where they lived.  It is notable that during construction, transportation into the city was never shut down; Interstate 93 continued to provide a route into the city, the subway system ran everyday, and the commuter train into town was never interrupted.  So, it was possible for workers to commute into town daily, though I am still searching for data on how many of the workers were commuters and how many were residents.
Either way, the increase of construction in the city was a factor in the area for a number of years, the full impacts of which are still a point of research for me.
*The Boston Globe article in reference is titled “Big Dig Jobs are Nearing End of Road; Completion Will Mean Less Work for Unions” and was printed on Aug 19, 2004.
