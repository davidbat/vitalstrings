San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino | The Big Dig Contest
Your Fortune Awaits
The beaches in San Juan promise sunshine, sparkling waves and warm sand, but a lucky few will have the opportunity to discover real treasure buried underneath famous Condado Beach:  $10,000 in cash!  The San Juan Marriott Resort's "The Big Dig Parte Dos" promotion will see five pre-qualified travel agents comb the sands of Condado Beach in search of five treasure chests, four of which will contain $1,000 and one which will contain $6,000 in cash.
Like all good treasure hunts, it's not just about the prize but the adventure itself.  That's why these five treasure hunters and a guest each, will be invited for a 4-night all inclusive vacation in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino.  At the grand finale evening, the five travel agents, with shovel and treasure map in hand, will hunt for one of each of the five chests.  What a perfect way to cap off a grand adventure!
