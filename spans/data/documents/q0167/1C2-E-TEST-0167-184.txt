From the Paper:
"Boston traffic was once considered to be one of the worst cities in which to drive due to intense traffic problems. They Central Artery opened in 1959, designed to carry approximately 75,000 cars per day. As time went on, the highway had to support nearly 200,000 cars per day (Massachusetts Turnpike Authority). This created a sticky jam for Boston motorists as traffic crawled along the highway for more than ten hours every day. Traffic accidents climbed to more than four times the national average, as the congestion spilled into the tunnels and other streets (Massachusetts Turnpike Authority). Boston became known for its traffic problems, not the opportunities that it had to offer."
