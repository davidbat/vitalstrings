Ted Williams Tunnel
Big Dig
The Big Dig is the unofficial name of the Central Artery/Tunnel  Project (CA/T), a massive undertaking to route the Central Artery ( Interstate 93 ), the chief controlled-access highway through  the heart of Boston,  Massachusetts , into a tunnel under the city, replacing a previous elevated  roadway. The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending Interstate 90 to Logan  International Airport ) and the Zakim Bunker Hill  Bridge over the Charles River .
At the time, the Big Dig was the most expensive single highway project in  American history. When the last major highway section opened in December  2003 , over $14.6 billion had been              spent in federal and state tax              dollars.
