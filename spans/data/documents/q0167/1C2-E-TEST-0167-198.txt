The Big Dig
Boston, Massachusetts
Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, better known as the Big Dig, constitutes the biggest construction project in U.S. history. It called for replacing an elevated six-lane highway through downtown Boston with an 8-to-10 lane underground highway directly beneath it. Engineers of this subterranean road had to navigate existing subway lines and innumerable pipes and utility lines. In addition, the project called for extending the Massachusetts Pike, which ended just south of downtown, across Boston Harbor to the airport. And of course, this massive construction -- on the scale of the Panama Canal or the Chunnel from Britain to France -- had to happen without disrupting the daily traffic flows and business life of the city.
The engineering and construction marvels of the Big Dig are many: some five miles of slurry walls, the biggest use of the construction technique in North America; three highway-sized jacked tunnels, the biggest use of this technique in the world; the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world and the first in the U.S. with an asymmetrical hybrid design; innovative soil-mixing and ground-freezing techniques to improve the quality of Boston's soft soil; the country's most advanced electronic traffic-management system, developed with the help of MIT; and more. For these breakthroughs -- as well as the project's infamous budget and scheduling woes -- it has become a case study for public works.
