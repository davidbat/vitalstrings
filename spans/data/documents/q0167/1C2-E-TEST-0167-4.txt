BOSTON  — The hulking elevated Central Artery highway that has marred the city’s landscape for more than four decades carried its last car Saturday as it was replaced — five years late and billions over budget — by a tunnel routing Interstate 93 under downtown Boston.
In a simple morning ceremony, Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Massachusetts Turnpike Authority chairman Matthew Amorello cut a ribbon to open a two-mile stretch of highway that allows traffic to soar over the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge and then sweep through four southbound lanes of underground Interstate 93.
“This changes the face of Boston forever,” Menino said.
The first motorist to travel the new stretch of highway was Elaine Cronin, returning home to Boston after visiting a sister in Woburn. She was met on the bridge by Menino and Amorello and given a Big Dig baseball cap and map of the project autographed by the two men.
“It’s part of history,” Cronin said. “I live in the West End and I’ve watched this being built.”
Moments earlier, officials had greeted Anne and Nick Najjar of Stoneham in the last vehicle to drive across the crumbling Central Artery.
‘Highway in the sky’
The elevated road was hailed as a “highway in the sky” when it opened in 1959 but it became clogged by more than double the number of cars it was designed to carry.
Its matte green paint prompted Menino to call it Boston’s “other Green Monster.” The original Green Monster is Fenway Park’s left field wall.
