STEVENSON, age 53 of Furlong, PA, JOHN J.                           FARRAR, age 43, of Canterbury, CT, MARC BLAIS, age 36 of Lynn, MA were convicted late                           yesterday of conspiracy and fraud charges following a three week trial in U.S. District Court in                           Boston. PROSPERI and STEVENSON were convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Highway                           Project Fraud and Mail Fraud; Conspiracy to Defraud the Government with Respect to Claims;                           and Making False Statements in Connection with Highway Projects and Mail Fraud. FARRAR                           was convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Highway Project Fraud and Mail Fraud and Making                           False Statements in Connection with Highway Projects and Mail Fraud. BLAIS was convicted                           of Making False Statements in Connection with Highway Projects and Mail Fraud. Codefendants,                           KEITH H. THOMAS, age 51 of Billerica, MA and GERARD M. MCNALLY,                           age 54, of Rockland, MA pled guilty prior to trial on July 8, 2009, to Conspiracy to Commit                           Highway Project Fraud and Mail Fraud; Conspiracy to Defraud the Government with Respect to                         Claims; and Making False Statements in Connection with Highway Projects and Mail Fraud.
Between 1996 to 2005 PROSPERI, STEVENSON, MCNALLY, BLAIS, FARRAR                           and THOMAS were all employed in managerial positions in Aggregate’s concrete division.                           They were charged with highway project fraud and related offenses for their participation in a                           scheme to provide concrete to Big Dig projects that did not meet contract specifications, and to                           conceal the true nature of the concrete through false documentation. Between 1996 and 2005 the                           defendants delivered approximately 5,000 truckloads of non-specification concrete to the Big                           Dig. Each truckload comprised approximately ten yards of concrete. This concrete included                           recycled concrete that was over ninety-minutes old, concrete that had been adulterated with the                           addition of excess water, and concrete that was not batched pursuant to Big Dig project                         specifications.
The defendants recycled “leftover concrete,” i.e. concrete that had not been used by other                           customers, mixed the leftover concrete with Big Dig project concrete, and delivered this                           adulterated concrete to the Project. The leftover loads of mixed concrete were dubbed “10-9                           loads" by the defendants, and did not meet Big Dig project specifications. The defendants                           concealed this fraud by falsifying concrete batch slips delivered to Big Dig inspectors and/or                           representatives of the general contractors at the various construction sites. These false batch                           reports were relied upon by the Government to determine the quality and amount of concrete                         placed by the general contractors on the project.
Big Dig project specifications required that concrete must be placed or poured within                           ninety minutes of batching. In most instances involving these “10-9 loads,” the concrete had                           exceeded the ninety minute time limit. In order to conceal the true age of the concrete, the                           defendants directed truck drivers and other Aggregate employees to add water, as well as other                           ingredients, to the “10-9 loads” to make those loads appear to be freshly batched. Big Dig                           project specifications also prohibited the addition of water to concrete after the concrete had                           been batched except under tightly controlled circumstances. The defendants also directed that                           fly ash be eliminated from the concrete mix specifications on the occasions when Aggregate                           Industries ran short of fly ash. Fly ash is an essential ingredient in concrete that makes the it                         more durable and prevents the infiltration of water.
The defendants face maximum penalties of 20 years’ incarceration on each of the mail                           fraud counts, 10 years’ incarceration on the conspiracy to make false claims against the United                           States, and 5 years’ incarceration on the conspiracy to commit highway project fraud and mail                           fraud count, as well as on each highway project fraud count. Each count also carries a period of                           3 years’ of supervised release and a maximum fine of $250,000 fine. The defendants could also                           face an alternative fine in excess of $10 million which is twice the loss or, in this case, the                         amount billed to project contractors by Aggregate pursuant to the fraud.
Aggregate Industries N.E., Inc pled guilty in July 2007 and agreed to pay $50 million to                           the federal and state government, to resolve its criminal and civil liabilities in connection with a                           fraudulent scheme to deliver adulterated concreted to the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (“Big                           Dig”). The plea and settlement agreements also required Aggregate provide up to $75 million in                           insurance coverage for potential future structural maintenance costs related to their conduct.                           The case was worked jointly with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office and                           included the execution of search warrants obtained by that Office. Evidence obtained in those                           searches was presented at the federal trial. Acting United States Attorney Michael K. Loucks                           commented that the joint federal and state collaboration in this investigation was critical to the                         verdicts achieved.
The case was investigated by the United State Department of Transportation, Office of                           Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts State Police                           Assigned to the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office . It is being prosecuted by Assistant                           U.S. Attorneys Fred M. Wyshak, Jr., Anthony E. Fuller and Jeffrey M. Cohen of Loucks’ Public                         Corruption Unit.
