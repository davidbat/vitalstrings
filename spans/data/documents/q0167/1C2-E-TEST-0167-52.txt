Dig jobs soared under GOP govs
August 3, 2000
BOSTON, Massachusetts (The Boston Herald) -- Just a few months after newly elected Gov. William F. Weld and Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci took control of the Big Dig in 1991, the patronage feeding frenzy took off, Central Artery records show. \
Internal Artery documents obtained by the Herald reveal that, beginning in July 1991, officials managing the Big Dig project were suddenly flooded with resumes from the friends, relatives and supporters of state and local politicians.
That confirmation of Weld and Cellucci's patronage machine at the Artery came as one of those politically connected hires resigned under fire yesterday. The Herald reported Tuesday that the employee, William R. Martino, was a virtual no-show at his Artery job.
Martino had been in charge of the Artery's East Boston Community Outreach Center since 1995 when his cousin, state Sen. Robert E. Travaglini, got him the job.
But new documents obtained by the Herald suggest Martino was one of many patronage hires who came on at the Artery under the Republicans. They show that in the first 18 months after Weld and Cellucci took the reins of the Big Dig, the number of politically connected job applicants skyrocketed.
