Obamas MEDAL OF FREEDOM Recipients - NYTimes.com
The Medal of freedom is only partly about medals and freedom. Its also about politics and appearances and constituencies.
Who selects for the Presidential MEDAL OF FREEDOM?
Hello.  Who does the selection process to ultimately select those citizens awarded the Presidential Medal of freedom?  Clearly the President himself doesnt receive a huge pile of potential names to sift through, and perhaps he (whoever "he" might specifically be) doesnt even choose the last few from a culled pile.  Im afraid that I cant find anything beyond the medals historic timeline.  500 interns working night and day?  Thanks much.
Answer: The site below goes into some detail as to medal selection processes for a number of USA awards.  Perhaps it will give you some insight for finishing your quest.  Basically, nominees are submitted to the White House and someone[s] on the staff culls through list and selects the finalists.  You can be sure that many of the recipients are selected based partly on their political beliefs.  The POTUS would then confirm the awards and present them at a ceremony and dinner.

What did Mary Robinson do to deserve the Presidential MEDAL OF FREEDOM?
Im not quite clear on that.  Im not asking this as a way of saying she didnt deserve it, but the media only reported when she spoke out against Jews, so I realize we might not be getting the full story.
Answer: "Despite fierce opposition from pro-Israel advocates, including Jewish groups and bipartisan lawmakers, the White House awarded its highest civilian honor Wednesday to Mary Robinson, a former UN official who presided over the 2001 Durban conference on racism. "   "....Nancy Rubin, a former American ambassador to the UN Human Rights Commission, praised Robinson as a "dedicated crusader for human rights for all people," in an August 11 letter to President Obama.  Rubin noted that critics of Robinson have neglected to mention her denunciation of anti-Semitism as a form of racism and her "passionate rejection" of anti-Semitic cartoons during the Durban conference.  "As a Jewish American who affirms that defending the human rights of all is a basic tenant of my faith, I wholeheartedly endorse your recognition of Mary Robinson for the narrative of her life," Rubin wrote."

Can we go ahead and award George W. Bush his MEDAL OF FREEDOM for catching Bin Laden?
As you might know, the Medal of freedom is pretty much the civilian equivalent to the Medal of Honor.  And as you are probably already aware, George W. Bush pulled off a great operation that he ordered and executed.  Thank you Bush, for killing Bin Laden.
Answer: George Bush has been out of office for years now.  He had little or nothing to do with this operation.  Evidently, you think this medal should go to President Obama  Edit:  Just out of curiosity, exactly what role do you guys think Bush played in this?

What did Helen Keller receive the Presidential MEDAL OF FREEDOM for?
I am doing a speech on her, and i know that she received the Presidential Medal of freedom, but I need to know what specifically she was awarded for doing.   Thanks.
Answer: Here are some of the things she accomplished in her life:  "In addition to her autobiography, The Story of My Life, Keller published some dozen other books. Among these were Light in my Darkness, which focused on the work of philosopher and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. (Keller was a member of the Swedenborgian religion founded on his writings.) She was also the author of numerous essays, articles, and speeches. She toured widely, delivering her speeches in favor of various groups and causes. For a time she also performed on the vaudeville stage, reveling in the limelight and the press of humanity.  In all these endeavors, her constant companion was Anne Sullivan, interpreting the visual and auditory world for Helen through finger signs, and explaining Helen's signed words to the world. In later years, many of Anne's duties were subsumed by assistant Polly Thomson, who assumed the role entirely after Anne's death in 1936. With Polly at her side Helen continued to as an active speaker on social issues, traveling all over the world to carry her message and meet influential people until shortly before her death on 1 June 1968. After her passing, her work on behalf of the blind was continued through the various institutions that she helped to found and fund, including Helen Keller International and the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults."  http://www.nndb.com/people/074/000046933/
