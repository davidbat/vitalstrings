Sydney Harbour YHA and The Big Dig Archaeology Education Centre has been awarded a Jury Commendation for Innovation, one of the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation.
The award recognises newly-built structures which demonstrate outstanding standards for contemporary architectural design which is well-integrated into history contexts. Sydney Harbour YHA is sympathetically situated on a site of great historical significance, above the remnants of houses, pubs and laneways dating back to the earliest days of the Australian colony.
This highly prized UNESCO award has never before been won by a hostel. A panel of international conservation experts chose YHA’s project from a total of 34 entries from 10 countries in the region, including museums, religious sites and public institutions.
