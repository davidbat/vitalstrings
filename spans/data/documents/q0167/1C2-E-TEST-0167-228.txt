How about of just getting rid of the damn thing altogether, and watch the asthma rates in Downtown Brooklyn plummet. Build the rail tunnel between Brooklyn and NJ instead.

Tal Barzilai from Pleasantville, NY says:
After what happened in Boston with their Big Dig and those leaks that occured, I am glad this will not be the case.  Keep in mind that this was built there after protests of building through Brooklyn Heights.  Nobody is against mass transit, but highways are still needed no matter how much the anti-car crowd hates it.  When they were built, they were not made to create the car culture, but react to it to help with efficiency.  As for asthma, you can also get it from smoking cigarettes and cigars, but I doubt there will be calls to get those banned.  If it wasn't for the interstate highway system, you would have trucks constantly going through neighborhoods on local streets, and I know nobody likes that.

How about a special tax for the neighborhood surrounding the route since its thier property value that would go up if its in a tunnel.

If work does not have to begin until 2020, why can't they put some money towards it every year before and after 2020. all the money will not be needed by 2020, so we can save for the first payments starting now.
This would be a monumentally-important way to spend our tax dollars. $2.2 billion is not THAT much considering what this could do to improve traffic and quality of life in BK over the life of the tunnel.

epc from DUMBO says:
It’s ridiculous that the state/city is prohibited from using tolls to fund any work on the BQE, tunnel or otherwise.  The so–called “gas tax” barely generates enough revenue to fund the existing road network, let alone expansion or rehabilitation.
The ongoing joke of the one–way toll on the Verrazano is helping accelerate damage to the BQE as truck after truck makes the pilgrimage up the BQE, across into Manhattan and out via one of the other tunnels.
As far as the 2020 date goes, I was at the presentation and my understanding is that the work must be well underway by 2020 as the existing infrastructure will be long past its expected lifespan.

I know some of those anti-car fanatics will be grilling me for not seeing that Streetfilms on Demolishing Highways, but I did see that.  I think that the idea is more of a short term rather than long term.  When the Miller Highway portion of NY 9A was taken down, there was the idea to either to bury it or just make it a regular road.  The latter was chosen over the former.  BTW, the Westway wasn't just opposed due to the high cost, it was also because environmental studies found it to be a bad idea.  Seriously, this portion of the BQE isn't even blocking access to anything, so I don't see what's wrong with keeping it as is.  How do we know that the construction for the tunnel will not cause sinkholes due to weak foundations?  If you asked me, it's cheaper to rennovate than demolish and build an entire new system.  Overall, highways may be obstructive and unsightly, but they help get traffic around efficiently.

Yes, build something like Octavia Blvd in SF, with two way protected bike lanes. Also, put tolls on the East River bridges and double the tolls on them to discourage autos from coming into Brooklyn.

Sorry Paul Steely White, but you and your friend Mark Gorton already lost the battle on congestion pricing and on tolling, so you are not going to win this one either.  If you asked me, elevated highways work best, because they do not disrupt local roads.  Since they are built on top, the rest can just go under it, so they are not a divider such as those either at or below street level.  If Robert Moses agreed to build the LOMEX only Canal Street, which would have held it from end to end, there probably wouldn't have been much opposition, because it wouldn't have involved demolition of any property unlike his plan that involved part of Broome Street.  Nevertheless, highways are still needed today despite how much you despise them.

Sorry, Robert Moses, but your days, and that of the automobile, are ending. There will be congestion pricing within the next two years, and the tolls will rise over and over, until you drivers pay for the devastation you wreak on our communities. This section of the BQE, and hopefully more, will be removed, because that is the only thing the city and state can afford to do.

Just like the WNBA, the automobile is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's here to stay forever whether you anti-car zealots like it or not.  If highways bother you so much for being elevated, which I think works best, then why not find ways to burry the last subway stations that aren't below the ground as well?  They are just as much unsightly, but I don't hear you calling for that seeing that you have a bias against cars hence the selective attitude.  The rendering of the plan almost looks like the way the BQE was supposed to be built originally.  While I won't view Robert Moses as a hero, he was only trying to help with traffic by creating the very highways, and this was after the complaints of traffic being on local roads, so you shouldn't grill him for this.  If you asked me, NYC had worse traffic before the highways were built.  As for the interestate highways, they are federally owned, so if there is a decision to change it, that must come from the federal government, not the city or state government, and the same would go for US highways as well.  Since tolls were brought up, they were supposed to go to help giving the funds, but later governments misused them for their pet projects and keep giving the excuses to raise them when they will continue to misuse them.

The BQE occupies a tremendous amount of real estate, especially where it slices diagonally across blocks, and where it connects to the bridges with loop ramps.
Wouldn't it make sense for the DOT to sell this land to help fund the tunnel?

Tal Barzilai from Pleasantville, NY says:
What is this real estate you speak off?  Then again, wouldn't putting a tunnel actually raise the real estate value rather than lower it?  BTW, where the BQE is elevated, it doesn't block anything and many can just go under it.  Just like affordable housing, highways are still needed as there is a demand for it.  As for the Cross Bronx Expwy that some complain about, most of it was built in an already existing valley, so much wasn't lost except for the Bruckner Interchange.  One other thing, taking down this part of the BQE will result in demolition of some of the property that is there, and many are against that.

the reality is that those trucks have to go somewhere.  if we just build a boulevard, it will be jammed with trucks.  i say bury the bad boy and develop the bqe's footprint with some sort of mid rise/park mohawk.
