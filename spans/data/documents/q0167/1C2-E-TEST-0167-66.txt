Totally Nude
Big Dig
The Big Dig is the largest public works project in American history.  The project, costing the city around $22,000,000,000 (yes- 22 Billion), was designed to revitalize and reconnect the north end of Boston.  Formerly, elevated highways divided the district from the rest of greater Boston- the project was to submerge the highways below ground, allowing pedestrians to easily move between both districts and adding public parks.  The project confronted many problems throughout its development, including escalating budgets, leaking, and collapsing roofs.  However, with the project now completed (as of December 2007), many of the residents on the North End are angered by the increase of tourism, gentrification, and a growing amount of suburban visitors.
It’s interesting to see how many of the walk ability ideas that we have as architects/planners can have the best of intentions yet still impact areas in negative ways.
