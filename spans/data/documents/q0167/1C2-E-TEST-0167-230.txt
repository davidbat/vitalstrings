Oakland County Sheriffs Office and Channel 7 Team Up for Bills Big Dig
Sheriff's Office to Help Those in Need with Snow Removal
Sheriff Mike Bouchard and Channel 7's Bill Spencer are once again partnering in "Bill's Big Dig", an effort to assist Oakland County's senior citizens and disabled residents with snow removal.
If snow accumulates more than 3 inches, the OCSO's Trusty Camp will help eligible residents* with snow shoveling or assist in finding reasonably priced snow removal services for seniors.
In order to participate, Oakland County residents can call the OCSO's Community Service hotline at 248-975-9700 and leave a message with their name and address.
When snow accumulates more than 3 inches, supervised crews will be sent out from the OCSO's Trusty Camp to assist residents with snow removal. On the first visit, a supervisor from the OCSO will knock on the door of the resident to verify their status as elderly or disabled and in need.
"A heavy snowfall can create real challenges for our most vulnerable residents," said Sheriff Bouchard. "Safety issues become a problem for the resident and for the community as a whole. We are all obligated to keep our streets and pathways clear for safe pedestrian traffic. This effort is a great way to help those residents in need meet their obligations as well as helping them to get out and about when they need to."
*Eligible Residents are those who are not able to afford to pay to have their snow removed and are physically unable to shovel snow.
To register for this program, please call the OCSO Community Service Hotline at 248-975-9700 and hit key #5 to leave your name and address.
