Follow Boston's great engineering feats from the filling of         the Back Bay to the Big Dig, now America's         largest public works project. Walk through the         new Rose Kennedy Greenway and some of         Boston's oldest alleys. Ride the nation's first subway and         learn about such taken-for-granted utilities as water, sewage,         gas, steam, and electricity.
Boston established the first underground subway                      in the U.S. in 1897. The original route went all                      the way from Park Street to Boylston Street.

Join us for this unique look at Boston where most of the         sightseeing takes place around your feet! Learn the origin of         manholes, the different ways to engineer a tunnel, the secret         identities of some of Boston's newest buildings, and what was so         big about a recent dig.
The cleaning of the Charles River and Boston Harbor                  is improving water quality resulting in the return of                  seals, porpoises and other wildlife to the harbor.
Over the past ten years, the Charles River EPA rating                  has increased from a D to a B+ and now meets swimming                  standards many days of the year.

Why is the Orange line orange and why does the Green line         screech at Park & Boylston?  What is the real reason         Boston's streets are the way they are? If the Big Dig was         called the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project, why         does Boston now have 5 tunnels under its harbor? What's         holding up the Custom House tower and who is buried in Dawes'         grave?
Get the answers to these questions and many more. You will         never look at a fire hydrant the same way again.
