Participants are required to select and indicate on the Redemption Form the number of Reward Points (in increments of 100) they want to redeem. Any Reward Points submitted that are in excess to the indicated number and are less than 100 will be forfeited automatically and cannot be used for future redemption.
A Happy Rewards Certificate will be mailed to the Participant at the mailing address he/she provides on the Redemption Form within 6-8 weeks after submission of the redemption, and can be used at a participating Fisher-Price™ diaper retailer, chosen by the Participant on the Redemption Form, to purchase any Fisher-Price brand product(s). Multiple Happy Rewards Certificates may be used toward any single purchase of Fisher-Price brand products. The Participant will be responsible for the payment of all amounts, including any sales tax, in excess of the face value of the Happy Rewards Certificate(s).
Happy Rewards Certificates will expire ninety (90) days after the date they are mailed from Fisher-Price to Participants.
All Redemption Form submissions must be postmarked no later than the Ending Date.

Fisher-Price is not responsible for lost, late, damaged, misdirected, incorrectly addressed, illegible, incomplete, undeliverable, destroyed or postage-due submissions, or submissions with inaccurate or incorrect information or typographical errors.
Reward Points have no cash value and are only redeemable for offered Happy Rewards Certificates. Any Reward Points remaining with Participants after termination of the Rewards Program will be forfeited without compensation.
