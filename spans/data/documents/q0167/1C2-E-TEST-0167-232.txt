An artifact protected by a force field
Fighting the Fek'Ihri Demon on the Temple Summit
[ edit ] Rescue Archeologists
There are twenty archeologists in the excavation trenches, of which 16 have to be rescued (Federation) or 14 kidnapped (Klingon).  Each archeologist is held captive in a force field which the player must deactivate.  Be sure to open the crates as the player moves through the trenches.  This will make the last few archeologists much easier to find, as the players tricorder will point to them instead of to the crates.  A teammate should move around the map clockwise and another counter-clockwise.  Using this method, the team can rescue all the archeologists before the crates have time to replenish their goods (and interfere with Tricorder scans).
[ edit ] Protect Artifacts with Force Fields
Take 12 of the 20 force field generators from the trenches (the same ones you disabled to free the archeologists) and bring them up to the artifacts on the temple.  You can carry up to five at a time.
[ edit ] Clear Temple Summit
To drive the Romulans and Remans off the planet and save the day, you'll need to defeat the Fek'Ihri Demon that they summoned from the gateway. This boss is at the top of the temple.
[ edit ] Scan Plants / Drill Data
The Big Dig (Daily) version of this mission requires Federation players to scan 4 plants hidden among the trenches.  On the Klingon version, they scan drill data.
[ edit ] Combat Tips
Romulans and Remans use disruptors , so it may be useful to equip Body Armor and a Personal Shield to counter distruptor weapons (or energy damage in general). The Phase-Shifted Personal Shield can also be helpful against Reman psionic attacks.
If you open the crates as you rescue the archeologists you should find plenty of Shield Charges , so you shouldn't need to bring many of your own.
