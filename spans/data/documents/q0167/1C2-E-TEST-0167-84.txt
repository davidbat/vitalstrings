This is some footage that I filmed for my Big Dig Documentary.
This footage will give you the best look at what it was like in and around Boston's Old i-93 Overhead Highway that ran through the City. You will see the State Street Bank Tower,  International Place, Rowes Wharf, One Financial and South Station in 2003.
And I'm not certain; but I'm pretty sure, if it wasn't for Tip O'Neil and Ted Kennedy's  foresite this project would of never got off the ground and Boston wouldn't have one of the best economies in the country as well as being one of the Top Destination Cities in THE WORLD!
I'M PRETTY SURE OF THAT!
Once the State allows a World Class Casino to be built in the City, Boston will be the TOP City in the World! No doubt.
Why I say that is; we have the Top Universities, Hospitals, Hotels, Restaurants , Sports Teams, Mountains, Beaches, and fishing plus Great Companies to work for. Not to mention great towns and Cities in and around Boston and New England which have everything you need to live a meaningful life. Great People, Great Food. Great Things To Do, What Is Better Then That? I almost forgot, And GREAT LOOKING WOMEN,
And I think it would be a Great City to host a World's Fair.
Peace
