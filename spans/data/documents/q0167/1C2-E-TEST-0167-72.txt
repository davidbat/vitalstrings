Map showing the approximate distribution of DiGIR providers (georeferenced by IP address).  Yellow markers indicate providers known to be online, red  indicates the provider was offline when last checked. If you have Google Earth then the KML file can be downloaded here .  Note that the  provider locations are modified by a small random factor so that icons from the  same institution don't fall on exactly the same spot.
