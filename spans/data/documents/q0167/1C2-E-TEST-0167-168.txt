(Israel / USA / West Germany , 1969, 90 Minutes, Black & White, Hebrew, English subtitles, Cast: Bomba Tzur, Nissim Azikri, Albert Cohen,Gabi Amrani,Oshik Levi, Shaike Ophir, Uri Zohar )
A comedy which depicts the madness of bureaucracy through a municipality’s reaction to the actions of a lunatic.
A lunatic (Blaumilch) who has escaped from an asylum steals a compressor and proceeds to open up a main street and traffic artery in Tel Aviv (Allenby Street).
Rather than question his actions, the police as well as city officials assume he is operating under the municipality’s orders and aid him as much as they can.
Complaints from local residents, whose lives become a living hell due to the noise and traffic jams, lead to infighting between city departments. To hurry up the work before the elections, the city then sends armies of construction workers and heavy equipment to help the lone compressor, turning a mere annoyance into a disaster.
When the city realizes that they are destroying a street without any plans or goals it is too late, and the end is chaotic in the extreme.

QUOTES
"The actors draw you in to this great tale of an escapee from the nut house who loves nothing more then his air compressor and a jack hammer. Like "King of Hearts" in Jerusalem. Not since Charlie Chaplin has someone come along who says nothing yet digs into your soul with warmth as he goes to work in the middle of the city. You would think somebody would stop this mad man but the world doesn't always listen to the sane. Throw in romance and remove swearing and modern day crutches for poor movies and you have a great treat for the whole family". (Amazon)
