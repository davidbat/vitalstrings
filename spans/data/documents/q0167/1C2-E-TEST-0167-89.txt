Synopsis
This Discovery Channel Production goes inside Boston's Big Dig, a vast construction project grander in scope than the building of the Panama Canal. A monumental undertaking, the plan to build an underground highway system beneath Boston was met with much skepticism and protest when it was first designed in the1980s. Considered by many to be implausible, the Big Dig would surely pose environmental, physical, and political problems in its elaborate attempt to cure Boston of its never-ending traffic jams. Created while construction was still underway, EXTREME ENGINEERING: BOSTON'S BIG DIG combines footage from newsreels and time-lapse photography with computer graphics and interviews to create a timeline of the construction process. As viewers witness the I-93 and I-90 highways being redirected underground, former Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Fred Salvucci, BIG DIG author Dan McNichol, former governor Michael Dukakis, and engineering manager Lou Silano address the project's inherent hurdles and what its completion will mean for the city of Boston.
