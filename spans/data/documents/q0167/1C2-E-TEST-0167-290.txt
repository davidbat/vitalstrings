"The new LED lights are the same length as the existing fluorescent fixture, so we can replace them using the existing wireway without the need for a new power distribution system," DePaola says. The LED lights will save 25% in energy costs.
The discovery of the fallen light fixture in February 2011 was followed by the resignation of one MassDOT engineer, the firing of another MassDOT engineer and the resignation of former Secretary of Transportation Jeffrey Mullan. After the incident, the agency was criticized for communication breakdowns and mishandling its public response.
Paying the Light Bill
The LED project will be financed with operating capital that MassDOT hopes will be reimbursed by the $400-million Big Dig maintenance trust fund that was set up in 2008 to cover defective work, DePaola says.
The agency plans to put the project out for bid in the winter and award the contract by spring 2013.
Daniel Lax, vice president at Clear-Vu Lighting, headquartered in Westbury, N.Y., says transit-tunnel environments present unusual challenges with respect to vibration, thermal concerns and corrosion.
"When designing for lighting, you have to take into consideration the ambient temperature of the tunnel environment," Lax says. "If temperatures are too low, electronic ballasts can fail to energize. If the LED chip-junction temperature rises too high, depending on the type of chip, the useful life of the LED can decline and may not live up to the specifications of the manufacturer."
In July 2006, several 4,600-lb ceiling panels broke free in another portion of the tunnel system, crushing a passing car and killing the driver, 38-year-old Boston resident Milena del Valle.
The 7.5-mile-long Central Artery Big Dig project is estimated to have cost about $15 billion.
