Urban Fill: Everything Including the Kitchen Sink
The Big Dig in Boston, Mass., is one of the most challenging and complex    heavy construction projects ever undertaken. Formally called the Central Artery/Third    Harbor Tunnel, or CA/T, project, the Big Dig takes on a formidable challenge:    to construct a below ground superhighway beneath an active, but aging, six-lane    elevated highway that must remain in service 24/7  keeping the city open    for business  and to build a third tunnel beneath Boston Harbor; all while    working within complex subsurface geology and applying advanced engineering    solutions.

However, the challenge faced by the Big Dig constructors is only a recent example    of how the subsurface conditions and complex geology in the Boston area have    influenced and controlled the development of the city and its built environment;    and also contributed to the development of the disciplines of engineering geology,    geotechnical engineering and several aspects of modern construction practice.
Bostons blessing has been its extraordinary coastal setting. The Town    of Boston was originally founded on the small, 789-acre Shawmut Peninsula, a highland connected by a narrow neck to the mainland that high tides often breached.    By 1623, early English settlers recognized that the area hosted defensible promontories,    a deepwater harbor, abundant shellfish and the potential for marine trade.
In his 1989 article History of Boston: The Impact of Geology, engineering    geologist David Woodhouse summarized several geologic factors affecting the    founding, and growth, of the city. First, the indented coastline of Massachusetts    was the result of glacial erosion of the underlying softer bedrock, generally    formed of the Cambridge argillite, a weakly metamorphosed, laminated,    late-Proterozoic mudstone. The erosion provided the natural topographic basin    that was later flooded following the end of the Wisconsinan glacial period and    subsequent rise in eustatic sea level. Second, prominent glacial landforms,    principally drumlins, exposed marine clays and granular glaciofluvial outwash features  as well as complex, puzzling moraines exhibiting deformed and    folded sediments, such as Beacon Hill  created features that could function    as natural defenses from seagoing enemies. Third, natural springs and good quality    water in shallow dug wells sustained the town, providing enough for the initial    settlements until the population substantially increased.
Colonial streetscapes developed around the irregular topography and coastline.    As the city grew, so did the harborfront and coastline. The shallow tidal bays,    coves and marshlands became logical areas to fill in, creating made land. By the early 1800s, the geography and settlement patterns began to expand toward    the surrounding areas as the citys growth accommodated the geological    setting.
The confluence of education, geology    and engineering
As the city of Boston grew in national influence, the educational institutions    of Massachusetts and New England attracted 19th century geologists such as Edward    Hitchcock (1830s), William Otis Crosby (1880s), Nathaniel Shaler (1890s) and    J.B. Woodworth (1900). But the academic and practical understanding of the interaction    between geology and engineered structures remained relatively unrefined until    the late 1890s.
Through the 1870s, early area buildings, bridges and other structures utilized    comparatively simple soil-supported foundations. These were usually constructed    on brick or mortared stone footings. Later, tapered wood-piles driven into the    desiccated, stiffer marine clays commonly supported waterfront structures (Parkhill,    1998).
Many of these 19th-century buildings remain in downtown Boston, often reused    for elegant office or residential space. A significant construction challenge    facing todays geotechnical engineers, particularly along the route of    the Big Dig, is anticipating and mitigating potential construction impacts to    these delicate masonry structures. Sophisticated instrumentation installed along    the new construction route allow engineers to measure and respond to potential    ground movements, utility conduit deflections, and vibration impacts to other    structures well before damage can occur.
In the early 20th century United States, the discipline of foundation engineering    grew along with rapid growth in urban areas, including New York, Chicago and    San Francisco. In Boston, emigration, industrial advances, desire for larger    buildings and the economic expansion occurring between 1880 and the mid-1920s    fueled demands for new construction on filled lands outside the old urban core.    The core then was suitably underlain by typically dense, stable glacial soils.    The made land  marginal by itself even for simple construction    purposes  was often a combination of unstable fill soils, soft organic    peats and silts, and thick compressible marine clay. If loaded beyond a certain    point, these materials could potentially deform, leading to settlement of the    structure with consequent shifting and likely damage.
Although not alone in recognizing the influence of geology on urban foundation    construction at the time, geologist Irving B. Crosby published engineering geology    maps in the early 20th century, including possibly the first detailed seismic    studies of an urbanized area (in 1903 and 1932) that depicted relative stability    of the local terrain to earthquake-induced ground motions. And as twists of    fate often turn, differential settlement observed in the foundations of what    was then the new Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus in Cambridge    attracted the interest of scientist Karl Terzaghi following his arrival at MIT    in 1925. By the early 1930s, Terzaghi and Arthur Casagrande examined the relationship    between laboratory experiments on the strengths and properties of undisturbed    cohesive soils (among them the Boston Blue Clay) and the predictions for how    these soils would behave under construction conditions. Their careful analyses    of cohesive soil strengths and characteristics of other soils identified general    soil properties, behaviors and limitations that were formative to the discipline    of soil mechanics. Many of the early theories of soil mechanics are still applicable    to major constructed works and deep excavations worldwide, including the Big    Dig.
These challenging subsurface conditions, directly or indirectly, made Boston    one of the educational centers for the nascent sciences of soil mechanics and    engineering geology, offshoots of the established disciplines of civil engineering    and traditional geology.
Foundations go deeper
With the construction of larger buildings in the 1940s and 1950s, foundations    had to stretch from the soil, or overburden, down into the deeper glacial soils    and bedrock. Geologic investigations were limited to exploratory soil borings    and diamond core drilling methods performed for geotechnical design purposes.    Drilling typically evaluated the characteristics of only the upper five to 10    feet of the bedrock.
A comprehensive understanding of the structure of the Boston Bay Group bedrock  which primarily hosts Precambrian argillites, sandstones, conglomerates, tillites, volcanic materials, and younger crosscutting mafic dikes  remained elusive. Most of the bedrock surface was masked beneath thick    overburden deposits, as outcrops near the center of the Boston basin were nonexistent.
However, in the 1950s, further complexities in the deep bedrock basin structure    were revealed and examined in several bedrock water supply and sewer infrastructure    tunnels constructed under the supervision of the Metropolitan District Commission.    Most of the Dorchester Tunnel was reportedly driven employing the first application    of a mechanized, tunnel-boring machine (TBM), now a commonly used construction    technique for both soil and bedrock tunnels.
According to Woodhouse, less than ideal bedrock conditions were observed in    sections of almost all of these tunnels studied. To differing degrees, the areas    included softer, kaolinized, and decomposed bedrock resulting from likely hydrothermal    alteration, which were often affiliated with major shear zones, breccias, fault    gouge or fault zones. The structurally weaker rock was accommodated within the    tunnels by concrete lining, steel supports, rock bolts or other construction    methods. Again, the construction techniques responded to the problematic ground    conditions.
In the 1960s and 1970s, presaging the future building boom to come in Boston,    foundations became more complex and were constructed by a variety of methods:    machine-excavated straight shaft and belled caissons replaced the dangerous    hand-excavation methods. Precast-prestressed concrete piles replaced the more    costly steel pipe piles, and, in 1976, the advent of slurry wall excavation support method arrived in Boston. With the downtown real estate development    boom in the early 1980s, the need for deeper excavations and foundation systems    yielded additional insight into the soils and bedrock below the city. And the    extensive subsurface explorations for the publicly funded CA/T and Deer Island    Outfall Tunnel provided rock cores that are available for examination outside    the engineering and engineering geology community.
Now: the Big Dig
In a league by itself for magnitude, the Big Dig consists of almost 168 total    lane-miles of highway and ramp access, about half of that in tunnels. As in    the past, CA/T construction designers and engineers contend with complex geological    conditions that vary in both lateral extent and with increasing depth. And while    the range of anticipated subsurface conditions identified by early explorations    and historical foundation construction experience can be beneficially applied    to the CA/T project, geotechnical designers still require detailed geologic    information at the locations of each engineered structure.
Important    engineering attributes of the soils include the thickness and content of the    fill materials, presence of compressible organic soils, and strength and stability    of the often thick cohesive marine and glaciomarine clays. Also important is    identifying the presence of dense glacial tills that might provide suitable deep structural support, and determining the depth, overall competency and strength    of the bedrock. Designers must accommodate the presence of groundwater and minimize    the effects that construction dewatering in a deep excavation could have on    adjacent ground stability. Understanding the characteristics and engineering    behaviors of the individual stratigraphic units is critically important for    large infrastructure works such as the Big Dig.
Dramatic changes in roadway configurations leading northeast toward Boston demonstrate    the complex construction required at the interchanges of interstate I-93, the    Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) and the access ramps leading to the Third Harbor    Tunnel beneath the Fort Point Channel (just off the images to the right).

Building the Big Dig means working in tight spaces that have low headroom and    are close to fragile, early 19th century masonry buildings. As construction    of Interstate I-93 below the city and I-90 access roads for the Ted Williams    Tunnel to Logan International Airport advances, workers are close to huge steel    and glass office towers and below-grade subway lines. Reportedly, former CA/T    Director Peter Zuk once likened the construction of the CA/T to conducting    heart surgery on a patient actively playing tennis. Several construction    approaches demonstrate the technical challenges the project teams face, as summarized    in an article prepared by the CA/T projeect for Southeast Asia Construction    magazine in January/February 2002:
By far the biggest construction challenge is keeping the existing six-lane,      1959-vintage Central Artery operable, while construction occurs beneath it      and deep below ground, in some places to bedrock. Using permanent concrete      slurry walls typically supported in bedrock (and constructed by specialized      low-headroom equipment), the loads of the still-in-use highway structure are      shifted from their old supports to bear on the new slurry walls, which also      serve as lateral and vertical support walls for the new below-grade roadways.      Once the new roadway is complete, the aging Central Artery structure will      be demolished, and surface grades restored and landscaped.
One applied construction technique in building the Ted Williams Tunnel used      sectional, immersed tube tunnels, lowered by barge into a prepared seabed      trench across Boston Harbor. A dozen twin-tube steel sections, each longer      than a football field, were sequentially connected and lowered, ribbon-like,      into the seabed floor. Each opening in the twin tubes is approximately 40      feet in diameter, and is dedicated to carry east bound or westbound traffic.
Soil stabilization methods that allowed deep excavations to proceed while      reducing the possibility of lateral or vertical ground displacement included      ground freezing (with recirculating pipes containing superchilled brine);      jet grout underpinning (injecting cement-based or chemical grout into permeable      soils that later harden and strengthen the soil); and soil mixing (that incorporates      cement and the existing soils with a series of paddle-like mixers mounted      on a specialized drilling rig) which strengthens the soil overall.
To extend I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) beneath nine active railroad      tracks carrying Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail passenger trains from South      Station, designers employed three massive jacked tunnel boxes, essentially      pushing rectangular reinforced concrete sections into previously frozen soils.      After mining out and excavating soils at the working face with road      header machinery, the tunnel box is pushed ahead several feet, and the      process repeated. This method avoided disruption of the railroad traffic that      would occur using the more conventional cut-and-cover tunneling      method, and reduced the potential for construction-induced movement of the      rail alignments themselves.
Building on the past
The contributions of early local geologists, engineers and researchers laid    the groundwork for our current understanding of several problematic geologic    conditions that can exist throughout the Boston area. Many of these discoveries    and their subsequent engineering and construction solution were transferable    to similar conditions elsewhere. But even with our knowledge of historical conditions    and local construction experience, careful examination and analyses of site-specific    ground conditions are still performed for virtually all engineered structures,    including the tremendous Big Dig effort. As in the past, geologists and engineers    continue to gather more data and information about the subsurface. By applying    both well-established and advanced engineering construction techniques, they    learn to work with the existing urban geology beneath the city.
Urban        Fill: Everything Including the Kitchen Sink
Many Bostonians know that the city's shoreline footprint has grown through          history. The waterfront expanded outward into Boston Harbor and the city          grew onto land "reclaimed" along the Charles River estuary,          perhaps most famously in the Back Bay and South End areas. However, not          all of the residents give much thought to how much area actually was created, and where the filling material originated. Nor do they consider how this          unique soil profile affects construction and underground engineering.
Cumulatively, an urban area far larger than the Back Bay was filled to          accommodate the growth and settlement patterns of the vibrant port and          commercial hub of Massachusetts. In their book Historical Atlas of          Massachusetts (1991), editors Richard Wilkie, Roy Doyon and Jack Tager          estimated that the general urban land area increased due to filling by          approximately 3,930 acres (6.1 square miles) between 1803 and 1988, very          roughly doubling Boston's geographic size. This estimate is qualified          somewhat, because it includes former towns later annexed by Boston (Charlestown,          Roxbury, East Boston, South Boston); portions of Cambridge and Brookline          adjacent to the Charles River; and Logan International Airport.
From an engineering and site characterization perspective, these urban          fills create problematic subsurface conditions that raise several yellow          flags to engineering geologists and geotechnical engineering professionals.          The soil properties of the fill materials and their engineering behavior,          particularly in response to surcharges, loads and excavations, are almost          exclusively unfavorable -- a situation that demands fairly comprehensive          evaluation and analysis prior to most excavation and construction activities.
Urban fills are likely to be heterogeneous over short distances, are compressible          due to their inconsistent manner of placement (or because they often contain          overly soft organic deposits), and are often unstable in proximity to          excavations. Because of their nature, these fills cannot be used as foundations          because due to the continued and variable settlement of the structure          that occurs, requiring support on deeper, more stable soils. In some areas          of Boston, fills have been documented to be more than 30 feet thick.
Creating particular problems for subsurface construction efforts are the          presence of former granite seawalls and wharves. These robust waterfront          structures, typically constructed from hundreds of massive, dry-laid granite          blocks and an underground "forest" of wood piles, were often          infilled with all manner of stone rubble, debris and a startling array          of other materials. Once buried and forgotten under an advancing urban          shoreline ("Progress!" the city's fathers must have shouted),          these structures lie in wait for the unsuspecting construction project.
The source of the fill soils is variable and identified in only limited          documentation. Several area drumlins, and the former topographic highs          on the original Shawmut Peninsula (including portions of Beacon Hill,          which was likely formed by localized ice thrusting and deformation of          earlier glacial tills, clays and sands during Pleistocene deglacial events),          were cut down and transported as borrow material to fill in low-lying          coves, bays and the developing waterfront. Land modification efforts were          so substantial that two of the original three major hills, or "trimounts" (reflected in the name of Tremont Street), were completely removed and          leveled.
As described in Harl Aldrich's 1970 article in the journal of the Boston          Society of Civil Engineers, the Back Bay and Fenway areas were filled          between 1856 and 1890 using sand and gravel transported by train from          Needham, a residential community located about nine miles southwest of          Boston. Hydraulic fills were also used to provide material for certain          areas of Boston, where soft, organic marine muds and clays were dredged          to deepen channels or waterways, and then pumped or sluiced as slurry          to open coastal tracts rimmed by crude wooden barriers. Once exposed,          the hydraulic slurry desiccated, consolidated and provided the newest "made land" along the waterfront.
Urban soils can also host a wide range of hazardous chemical contaminants          as well, often with no discrete or identifiable source. In a 360-year-old          city, a given parcel of land may have experienced uncountable building          and construction cycles, or several generations of undocumented commercial          or industrial uses. As byproducts of heating with wood, and later coal,          discarded cinders and ashes are common components of urban soils. Typical          fill contaminants may include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)          or other combustion byproducts, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including          chlorinated solvents and lighter-fraction gasoline components, numerous          metals (from arsenic to zinc), and a slew of petroleum constituents. Contaminated          soil characterization and soil management is a significant cost consideration          for underground construction and development projects in an urban setting,          a cost exacerbated by the erratic subsurface extent, often high concentrations,          and variety of chemical compounds potentially present. To this end, one          environmental professional, tongue-firmly-in-cheek, succinctly described          the urban Boston soils as "Downtown Brown."
