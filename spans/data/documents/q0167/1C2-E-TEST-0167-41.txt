Big Dig
In 1995, the Boston Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel, more commonly known as the Big Dig, ran billions over budget and years behind schedule. Sold to Congress as a $2.3 billion project to be completed in 1998, the Big Dig far exceeded all cost estimates, ringing in at a stunning $14.6 billion. Building the most expensive highway project in the history of the United States, the contractors Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, drained federal money with virtually no government oversight. The lack of oversight produced flaws in design, rejection of cost saving alternatives, and problematic management practices.
