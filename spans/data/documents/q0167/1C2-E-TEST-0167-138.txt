Still trying to understand why we in this state actually have to file Income tax.
Wouldn’t it be easier just taking the money outside and then put a match to it ?
You freeze something and unless you keep it cool, it will thaw
But no, apparently putting a tunnel section on top of it will prevent the laws of physics from taking place
But thankfully, the transportation secretary assure us that the tunnels are safe. Of course aside from falling slabs crushing cars, falling lights and now the surrounding soil holding the tunnels up, melting away

what about the train tracks how are they affected by the thawing soil

I wouldn’t worry about it. Don’t forget…
“We don’t think it’s serious at all, it’s another issue that we have to monitor,” says DePaola. “

Thanks for the warning!!  That’s to be expected with the colossal goat f*&# that the Big Dig developed into.  These companies involved with the whole project should be incarcerated deep into the worst prison that Mass has!!!!!!  Someone made some big $$$$$$$$$$$  on this boondoggle!

IYa right, it’s safe – until the disaster comes.

I wonder how many times a day those same engineers use the tunnel themselves.  They must think we’re all fools, or just plain stupid if we believe any of that tunnel is safe.
joey
what a shame: Ronald Reagan vetoed this project and it got overriden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have a very strong feeling that if Tip O’Neil was still around, he would take his name off that boondoggle in a New York minute. While I admit that I love using the results of the Big Dig, the corrupt practices by many companies involved, a complete lack of oversight and total mismanagement of the entire project can only make you wonder how they ever built the pyramids without benefit of “20th century ingenuity”.

Another gift from Ted that keeps on giving.

You mean that you actually expect decent quality in a $15 Billion government project?

“They froze it 200 feed wide” may it is time to double check the spelling. 200 feet wide not “200 feed wide”.

It acts as a bridge. It doesn’t affect the tunnel strength if a small section of soil is settling. They expected it to thaw and settle, its just settling more than expected. If they didn’t actually believe it wasn’t safe, they wouldnt risk their behinds to pretend it was.
