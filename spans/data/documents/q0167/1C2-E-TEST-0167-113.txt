Yet another Big Dig web page
Yet another Big Dig web page...
 
Hello, visitors. As you may notice when you browse my page,  the newest pics here are more than a year old as I write this (Oct 2002). I  apologize for not being able to complete my vision for this page that I dreamed  up when I started it, which was to show a complete photographic chronology of  the many varied construction projects happening around the city of Boston.  Personal illness has taken me out of the roving photography business, but I hope  this page will still stand on its own for what it is: A decent visual chunk of  the Big Dig, showing at least some of the vast changes that have  happened, and will happen, in Boston.
 
I finally    added a feedback form. You can send me comments, and ask me questions! Right    now, you can click    here
