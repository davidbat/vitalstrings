From the 2nd July to the 6th July 2012 CCL will be removing all surfacing to Market Square (as far as the AIB bank).  All surfacing works will be carried out at night.  On the 2nd, 3rd and 4th July 2012 traffic in the square area will be reduced down to 1 lane from 19:00 hrs with ALL traffic flows through the square being closed off from 20:00 hrs to 07:00 hrs the following morning.  In preparation for the final surfacing CCL will have to restrict traffic to the Square, outside of rush hour traffic to carry out essential watermain changeovers etc this week.  These works will be carried out during the day.  In order to ease traffic flows at night Foster Place will be temporarily made 2-way from Tullinadaly Hill to the N17 and the junctions will be manned by CCL.  Please note that unless CCL are manning these junctions Foster Place is NOT 2 WAY
Works will be taking place all along the N17 next week at night from 20:00 hrs to 07:00 hrs.
