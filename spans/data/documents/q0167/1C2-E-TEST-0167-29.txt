The Big Dig
With his own lightweight earth-moving equipment, your child can be the boss of  his own construction site, gold mine or archaeology dig without leaving the yard. The sturdy metal construction of this  hand-operated scoop will shovel sand, snow and gravel with ease. The base is fashioned in the same manner as a  sturdy office chair, so it doesnâ€™t lean or fall forward when the scoop is full. The unit is heavy enough for rock-solid  stability, yet still light enough for easy transport to the lake or beach, where your little excavation boss can discover  new treasures buried in the sand. Ages 4+.
Dimensions: 44-1/2"L x 22-1/2"W x 17-3/4"H.
Weight: 7.5 pounds.
