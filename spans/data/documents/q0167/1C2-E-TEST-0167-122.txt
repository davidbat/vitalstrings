Bloody hell - no one's reviewed The Big Dig yet! Is Boston too shell-shocked at the ridiculous price, the length of construction time, the ceiling tiles of death and the blatant corruption? Has The Big Dig become the skeleton in Boston's closet that no-one wants to talk about? Am I breaking some code of silence by not ignoring the black sheep in Beantown's family? I'm a little scared.
The whole thing about The Big Dig is the scale of it. Spending 12 billion dollars more than you expect (4 times the estimate) is very impressive. I mean, if I was to throw a dollar into a fire every second it'd take me 380 years to lose that much money. And to do it so badly in so many of the aspects is even more impressive. Honestly, people have died from the shoddy construction here. That's a minus star already...
But you know, The Big Dig was a great idea and taking a taxi through the underground labyrinth from Logan to Storrow is quite an experience that no other city can boast. The Ted Williams tunnel gets you to the airport quick enough and the urban park will soon be in place where the I93 used to dis-harmonise Downtown, Chinatown and the North End. Maybe when that's finished we may appreciate things more. Perhaps the whole Big Dig was a little too ambitious - to place a freeway system in the underground space between the foundations of America's oldest buildings and subways is quite a task. But still, I can't give a positive review to something that would've spent Â $38000 in the 20 mins it took me to write it up.
