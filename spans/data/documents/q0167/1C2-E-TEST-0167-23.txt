Big Dig Thank You!
ALM Charities, Gasser Construction and Milestone Materials would like to thank you, our community volunteers, families and friends for your continued support of The Big Dig and its related activities held over the past 10 years.  We had a great time bringing the "construction playground to life" to more than 20,000 participants.
Note: There will not be a Construction Playground this year.  Please read about New Vision of the Big Dig for more details.
