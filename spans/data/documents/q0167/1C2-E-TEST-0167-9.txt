Seeing the loads of f home complaints we have had the past few weeks, we've decided to do something simple against it.
From now on, all factions must make sure that their f home is easy to identify. You must use Red Wool in every entrance to the f home itself, to show it's the f home.
The f home is the room you spawn in when killed, nothing else! Not a room next to it, not a room above it. Only the room you spawn in!
So Faction Leaders, go get the Red Wool and edit your f home entrances.
Like this for example:
^This alone will do, since it shows that you're entering the f home.
This is now part of the rules! Factions without the proper f home editing will be warned!
Hopefully this will decrease the amount of complaints about PvP quite a bit and make the community less restless.
Equil and Fakker.
