A visitor to Boston would have to go to great lengths to avoid running into road construction these days. Boston is home to the largest, most ambitious and most expensive civil engineering project in the world. The Big Dig's purpose is to create a 10-lane underground superhighway to replace the current elevated six lanes that cut through the heart of the city. The space formerly occupied by the elevated highway will become 150 acres of new parkland. An exhibit at the Museum of Science explains the mess.
