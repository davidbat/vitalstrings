Lincoln —
For a little more than a dollar a pound, you can buy a massive home in the Lincoln woods that is made from recycled steel and 20 slabs of concrete from the Central Artery Big Dig project.
Called the Big Dig House 2 (there is another Big Dig House in Lexington), the house stands on 1.2 acres at 11 Reiling Pond Road in Hobbs Brook Farm. Big Dig House 2 features two separate ground-level foundations, or abutments, that hold up the massive, steel-framed bridge-house. The foundation and frame alone weigh in at a megalithic 1,800,000 pounds.
The house, listed for $2,299,000, looks like it could have been a reinforced bunker that one might see in World War II fields of battle. The brown rectangles are accordioned together and jut above the ground ready to withstand a thermonuclear attack.
It’s not that the house doesn’t have grace. It does. In fact, it reflects some of the sleek minimalism and modernity of another house in Lincoln, the Gropius House.
“The inspiration of the house was to take structural components of what was once a bridge supporting I-93 and use them to once again build a bridge between two hills in Hobbs Brook Farm. I doubt there are many people around Boston who can walk under their house, or have a full basement under their garage,” said owner Paul Pedini. Pedini is senior Vice President with Jay Cashman Inc., which worked on the Big Dig. Pedini designed the Big Dig 2 House.
 “ It would certainly have been more cost effective to build a foundation under the middle third of the house to make it a full bottom-bearing house, but that would have significantly disrupted the existing water flow on the lot and changed the runoff characteristics of the land. One of our principal goals was to preserve the existing trees, slope, and water flow on our land as much as possible,” Pedini said.
“The concept of recycling the slabs was simple. If the slabs were to have been demolished and the component parts scrapped, the scrap value of the materials would not be enough money to pay for the labor, equipment, and landfill charges required to dispose of the rest of the material. 
“If we preserve the structural slabs in their entirety, however, they are worth tens of thousands of dollars each. I figured it would be a shame not to re-use these slabs, as they were made from the finest materials available and were in like-new condition. I sought to preserve all of the labor and equipment costs that went into creating them in the first place,” Pedini said.

Carole Lee de Jong, real estate agent for William Raveis, who is handling the sale of the property said, “this is a house made from materials that will last forever. It is for someone who wants a unique green living experience and who wants to own a piece of history.”
An in-floor, forced hot water radiant heat system keeps the foot-thick concrete slab floors toasty. The floors, which were ground, polished, stained and sealed, look like terrazzo. Computer-controlled pumps and valves provide a blend of heat through 9 heating zones. The manufacturer claims that the gas-fired boiler operates at 98 percent efficiency.
The exterior walls of the house were made from 2 by 6 construction and filled with icynene insulation rated to R-38 factor.
The exterior of the house is finished with more than 2.5 miles of 1-inch thick, western red cedar siding. Commercial grade, inch-thick insulated glass is set in anodized aluminum. A 16-foot-long wall of glass connects the living and dining rooms to the adjacent woods.
Big Dig 2 features an open floor plan that extends the 100-foot-length of the first floor.
The kitchen is impressive. Pedini of Italy made its wood and lacquer cabinets. There is a GE double oven, Fisher and Paykel dishwasher and a Viking cook top on a large eat-in island.
On top of the house, there is a two-level garden. The lower garden is a spice and vegetable garden with trex decking and area lighting. The upper garden is a lighted “Zen” garden that contains Japanese maples and Mugo pines. In the center is a water and lily pond. A 1.5-ton boulder serves as a “contemplation” seat.
There are four bedrooms on the second floor, including a 1,000-square-foot master bedroom with dual walk-in closets.
Standing outside near the wall that separates the driveway from the rolling wooded area below, one can hear the thrum of tires from Route 2 traffic drift through the trees. It is a fitting and familiar sound for a house built from ramps that were used to support the loads from 18-wheelers.
