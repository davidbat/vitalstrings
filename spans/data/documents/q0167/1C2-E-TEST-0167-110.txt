The New Vision of The Big Dig
Our vision for The Big Dig moving forward is to "dig in" and assist with  community service work.  This is a good time to change the format of The Big Dig  as the state of the economy has caused communities and non-profit organizations  to cut programs, projects, and services. Changing The Big Dig from a fundraising  event to a community service activity will benefit a broader range of the communities  that our employees live in and we do business in.  We feel that community service work  will give us great satisfaction and long-lasting relations knowing that together we have  accomplished projects that will benefit and improve our quality of life in the areas  in which we work.
Grant applications should not be limited to gravel and asphalt type projects,  but also could include such projects/events as:
community park improvements
