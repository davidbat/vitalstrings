In the latest in Big Dig controversies, the Boston Globe reported this morning that the once-frozen soil underneath the tunnel beneath South Station has begun to thaw, creating a gap filled with water. According to a   WBZ Radio  report this morning, the affected area is about the size of a football field.
The soil was chemically frozen during construction of the tunnel, but has thawed at a faster rate than initially anticipated. Of course, Big Dig officials preach that there is no imminent danger for motorists, however, as WBZ pointed out, "In the parking lot along the South Station train tracks you can see can see the buckling, an impact of the sinking soil around the Big Dig tunnel below."
Great.
