The history-making success of James Cameron's "Avatar" has not only quashed pre-release grumblings about the production's bloated budget, but turned the conversation toward the two confirmed sequels that don't exactly sound like low-budget affairs either.
With the mega-blockbuster's re-release approaching, details about the next two films have started to trickle out via the maestro himself, specifically Cameron's hints that the second film will involve the oceans of Pandora.
