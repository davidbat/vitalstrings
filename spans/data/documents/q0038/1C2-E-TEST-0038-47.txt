Behind every great love is a great story.
Description :-
I always enjoy watching movies that go in Narrative style.The Notebook is one such film and by far the best romantic movie of 21st century.The film is based on famous novel of same name by Nicholas Sparks.His novels were already adapted in movies.The Notebook,However is the best adaption.
The movie tells the tale of a Young couple that falls in love during the 1940s summer.Guy is poor,Girl Is rich and Girl's family take her away from the boy.Well till now this plot will look similar to many romantic movies.But the best part of The Notebook comes after that.(I'm not gonna ruin that)
Ryan gosling and Rachael McAdams did pretty good job.Apart from romantic story and chemistry between characters,one thing that i loved was Cinematography.Every scene was beautifully filmed.All these things together make this a perfect EVERY COUPLE'S DREAM ROMANTIC FILM.
Director :- Nick Cassavetes
Star-Cast :- Gena Rowlands, James Garner and Rachel McAdams
Plot :- An Old Man Narrates story to an old woman about a young couple that falls in love in 1940's summer.
