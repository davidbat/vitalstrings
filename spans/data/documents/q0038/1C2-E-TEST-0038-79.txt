4375 people died in 1987 when the ship Dona Paz sank outside the Phillippines. Heard of THAT maritime disaster?? What was that 4375 lives in 1987 is not as tragic as 1500 lives in 1912?
Also, not so long ago, in 2002 the MV La Joola sank outside Senegal killing over 1800 people. Wept for those people??
Like most simpletons you have noï»¿ fucking clue and base all your knowledge on popular media.
Feel free to verify those maritime disasters anywhere you want and learn a thing.
