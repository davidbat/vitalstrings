(Martha Ankomah i see you are on the roll this year, "Kor su wai", continue to say yes to every crap movie and build up your resume/cv real good. Just continue. I guess like the rest of em - you gotta eat too, and thus accept any thing that comes your way and working with scripts/producers/directors who cannot make you realise your great potential ando for you to  shine and be known for the best work. Good luck - Two fingers and Deuces to you!)

As it is well known on this blog, I DO NOT/WILL NOT review movies which i do not consider classics. I could review it like i use to back in the day, but in the past 3 yrs i have decided - I just dont have the time. Blogging is my unpaid hobby I do very late at night when everyone else is enjoying their beauty sleep -this is not my full time paid job.
.
A movie which is a classic to me is one with an
-Excellent Script
-Great Acting by all actors or actresses  - READ HERE FOR MY DEFINITION or HERE
-Great Production
-Excellent Sound and Picture Quality
-etc etc etc
.
The movies listed below - i have watched in and my opinion  is no where near classic. Some are good, just ok, simply average or absolutely crap - you make your judgement call by the rating. After 4 yrs (2000-2004) piling up boxes and boxes of crap movies (and those were VHS which even took more space) - i decided no more wasting money, and this is why i created this blog to alert people.
.
These movies will not be sitting in my video library, I just return it to my long time dealer for credit for a future classic release. I know many dont have that previledge cos once you buy it and leave the african store where you buy its a done deal - you cannot return it for exchange or refund, but fortunately i have a long standing customer relationship with movie dealer whom i have spent money with over 8 years since 2004 and we have developed an understanding where he knows i dont like good, average, just ok and definately not crap movies. It has to be great for me to spend my money on it and Keep it. If after watching it - I dont consider it great, I give it right back. 
.
They are a lot of movies i bought many years ago and were so great I still watch them till this day (to name a few Keeping Faith, All My Life, Blood Sisters, Alice my first Lady etc and many more ) - I can go into my library take it out and watch it and enjoy it like the very first day i watched it many years ago.
.
If people want to continue to marinate and praise movies that are not good  or simply average - well thats your own. We are more than 20 yrs deep in the industry - the bafoonery and mediocre movies, bad acting, ridiculous titles,  movies split into many parts and/or different titles etc, movies that insult the audience intelligence. We laughed about it many atimes in the early years and said "oh thats ok - its african movie, we dont have to be perfect, its ok if script sucks, or if the background music drowns the actors delivery, its ok someone is shot with a gun but i dont see blood or i can hear live construction going on in the background of some one hammering etc. People are aiming high and making international film festivals others want the short cut to make a quick buck for now.
.
If you the audience continue to buy into it, and let your self be insulted with these back to back nonsense movies,  they will have the platform to continue to produce it, but I MsTilii choose will not entertain such - to each his own. The money you use to produce the movie is precious and important to you and you want to break even - well same here, my money is equally important to me and I like to spend it WISELY - If you do not give me my monies worth, am sorry i cant praise your work. To the audience, You may watch it and love it cos thats your taste - to each his own.
.
I wish i can sugarcoat stuff and act all fake ans say something is nice when i know I know for a fact its not and i will never watch the movie again, I just dont know how. I will continue to tell it like it is. I have done my part of warning you. DEUCES..

1st Quarter - .JAN / FEB / MAR 2012
LADY GAGA - 3.5 / 10
MAMA & THE GIRLS/SWAGGER LADIES- 3/10
DECEPTION - 4 / 10
BRAVE MIND/HAND OF FATE - 5 / 10
VICTIMS (Part 1 - 4) - 4/ 10
*The script for "Victims" had so much potential and coulda been so much better but somwhere along the line - the writer/producer lost track and the movie was all over the place - no head no tail - long boring court room scenes etc etc. I hate movies that insult my intelligence - a gynaecolist who examines his patients with no nurse present and goes on to rape them? really? ok. Majid  and Mercy were good as usual, Paul Sambo acting was average - i expected more - this script was just not him, Paul needs a better script and a good director / producer who can challenge him to shine. He is a natural as he was in Ladies Men, and has great potential and he is very articulate and eloquent (something that MOST of the actors struggle with but he doesnt). I am still waiting for a classic from him. This just wasnt it. Too many loose holes.
FIREBRAND / SPELLBOUND- 5.5 / 10
* As much as i enjoy RAA movies this production collabo by Emem and Morris Sesay - just did not do it for me at all - I was quite disappointed. Newbie "Morris Sesay" please just cos you co-produce a movie doesnt mean you have to act in it if you are not ready for acting. Honestly I would say take some time off (just like Majid did in his day which paid off greatly) and register some acting classes with all the money you got and get some training and then maybe you grace our screens again. Until then please dont torture us like this again. Nse was good, Joe B - I expected more. Anybody else I did not notice - nothing exceptional from them as usual - always average. I will not say more - if you like go buy it and see for yourself and come here and review it.
coming soon- x/x
