The box office performance of Endhiran – The Robot is still good at the end of 4th week. The movie was able to sustain well at various centers around the country, especially South India. The Hindi version is doing a consistent business and had not seen big drops since its release, 4 weeks back.
Endhiran – The Robot’s box office collection estimates of all three versions, as derived from various sources and the occupancy factor taking into consideration are as follows –
Indian Gross – 182 Crores
Indian Net – 163 Crores
Overseas – 65 Crores
Hence, total worldwide collections of Endhiran – The Robot from all three versions is  estimated at INR 247 Crores at the end of 4th week. In all probability the movie is expected to do highest ever business in Indian Cinema in terms of “Net” Collections, but will lag behind 3 Idiots in terms of “Gross” Collections by some margin. Even in Overseas market, the movie is expected to cross 3 Idiots business of 70 Crores.
