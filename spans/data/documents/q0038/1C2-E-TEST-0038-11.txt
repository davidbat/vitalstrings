Main article: List of box office records set by Avatar
Avatar released internationally in more than 14,000 screens. [159] Avatar earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3-D release limited to 2,200 screens. [160] The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second largest December opening ever behind I Am Legend , [4] [26] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping The Incredibles ), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3-D (breaking Up 's record), [161] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking The Day After Tomorrow 's record), [162] and the 40th largest opening weekend in North America, [4] despite a blizzard which blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results. [18] [26] [27] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens. [157]
International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million) and Spain ($11.0 million). [163] Avatar's worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film. [164] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend. [157]
Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence, [165] earning $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office [166] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time [167] (since surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers ). [168] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office, [169] to set a third-weekend record. [170]
Avatar crossed the $1  billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days [171] (a record now matched by both Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011 and Marvel's The Avengers in 2012) [172] and also making it the highest-grossing release of 2009 worldwide. [173] In its fourth weekend, Avatar continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217, [174] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States. [175] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day four-day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446, [176] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612. [177] It held to the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records earning $34,944,081 [178] and $31,280,029 [179] respectively.
On January 31, it became the first film to earn over $2 billion worldwide, [180] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in North America, on February 27, after 72 days of release. [181] However, after inflation adjustment , the movie falls to fourteenth on the all-time box office list. [182] It remained in the number one spot at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks—the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since Titanic spent 15 weekends at No. 1 in 1997–'98 [183] —and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of 9 consecutive weekends set by Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest . [184] By the end of its first theatrical release Avatar had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328. [4]
Including the revenue from a re-release of Avatar featuring extended footage, Avatar grossed $760,507,625 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,021,767,547 in other territories for a worldwide total of $2,782,275,172 [4] [5] with 72.7% of its total worldwide gross in international markets. [4] [5] Avatar has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed Titanic's worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release, [185] [186] [187] just two days after taking the foreign box office record, [188] and on February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, Avatar surpassed Titanic to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States. [189] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] and is the first film to earn over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts. [29] IMAX ticket sales account for $228 million of its worldwide gross, [196] more than double the previous record. [197]
Box Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, Avatar would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America. [198] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3-D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on Avatar's gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that Avatar had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theatres, more than any other film since 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace . [199] On a worldwide basis, Avatar ranks third after adjusting for inflation, behind Gone with the Wind and Titanic, [200] although some reports place it ahead of Titanic. [201]
[ edit ] Commercial analysis
Before its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office , in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster Titanic. [202] [203] [204] This criticism ranged from Avatar's film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D "blue cat people". [202] [203] Slate magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3-D effects, but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the Star Wars prequel films and for having the " uncanny valley " effect. [205] The New York Times noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel alongside Avatar, calling it a "secret weapon" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box-office. [206]
"I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation ... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer."
—James Cameron on criticism of Avatar before its release. [203]
Box office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success. [207] [202] "The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived," said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for Avatar. This is the one. The behemoth." [207] The "cautionary estimate" was that Avatar would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher. [207] [208] Some analysts believed the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3-D films had been successful. [202]
Cameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. "It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants," he stated. "We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment." [203] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic , [203] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [209] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant "repeat business" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same "sharing" reaction as Titanic. He said that the film worked because, "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life." [203]
After the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanic's worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. [210] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight , [211] but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3-D screenings [210] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. "Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," relayed Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. "This is just unprecedented," he said. "I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation." [165] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [165] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, "While Avatar may beat Titanic's revenue record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [165] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to "try to topple Titanic off its perch" because it "just struck some kind of chord" and there had been other good films in recent years. [212] He changed his prediction by mid-January. "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," he said. [213]
"You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks . People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora ."
—James Cameron on the success of Avatar [214]
Though analysts have been unable to agree that Avatar's success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically "the dumping ground for the year's weakest films", and this also applied to 2010. [215] Cameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January. [203] Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. [215] Additionally, Avatar established itself as a "must-see" event. Gray said, "At this point, people who are going to see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [215] Marketing the film as a "novelty factor" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. [215] The " Oscar buzz" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. "Two-thirds of Titanic's haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [tracked] similarly ...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" with "more screens and moviegoers" than before. [215] Films in 3-D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, according to Variety , "a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film. [215] Likewise, Entertainment Weekly attributed the film's success to 3-D glasses, but also to its "astronomic word-of-mouth ". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but "the buzz" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings. [216] Gray said Avatar having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. "The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes," he said, "but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: Titanic (historical events), the Star Wars movies (an established film franchise), or The Lord of the Rings (literature). It was a tougher sell ..." [215]

The film was well received by film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 275 professional critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.4 out of 10. [217] Among Rotten Tomatoes' top critics, who are popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, [218] the film holds an overall approval rating of 95%, based on a total of 39 reviews. [219] The site's consensus is that "It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking." [217] Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 84% based on 35 reviews. [220] CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave Avatar was A on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3-D . [221]
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film "extraordinary" and gave it four stars out of four. "Watching Avatar, I felt sort of the same as when I saw Star Wars in 1977", he said. Like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings , the film "employs a new generation of special effects. "Avatar" is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message". [222] A. O. Scott of At The Movies also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed Star Wars, and added that although "the script is a little bit ... obvious," it was "part of what made it work". [223] Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film. "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [224] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention" he stated. [225] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers awarded Avatar three and a half out of four stars and wrote in his print review, "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams." [226] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was, "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [227] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt the film has "powerful" visual accomplishments but "flat dialogue" and "obvious characterization". [228] James Berardinelli , film critic for ReelViews , praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars he wrote, "In 3-D, it's immersive—but the traditional film elements—story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.—are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." [229]
Avatar's underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the New York Press wrote that Cameron used villainous American characters to misrepresent facets of militarism , capitalism, and imperialism . [230] [231] Evo Morales , Bolivia's first indigenous president, praised the film for its "profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle for the defense of nature". [232] Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post concluded that propaganda exists in the film and stated, "If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects." [233] Some commentators sympathetic to anarcho-primitivism have even praised the film as a manifesto for their cause. [234] [235] Adam Cohen of The New York Times was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message "a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British , India vs. the Raj , or Latin America vs. United Fruit ". [236] Ross Douthat of The New York Times opined that the film is "Cameron's long apologia for pantheism  ... Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now", [237] while Saritha Prabhu of The Tennessean called the film a misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general, [238] and Maxim Osipov of The Hindustan Times , on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the Bhagavad Gita . [239] Annalee Newitz of io9 concluded that Avatar is another film that has the recurring "fantasy about race" whereby "some white guy" becomes the "most awesome" member of a non-white culture. [240] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Avatar "the season's ideological Rorschach blot ", [241] while Miranda Devine of The Sydney Morning Herald felt that, "It is impossible to watch Avatar without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer." [242]
Critics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, with several accounts concluding the matter as simple "borrowing" and others claiming outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of the Boston Globe called it "the same movie" as Dances with Wolves . [243] Like Dances with Wolves, Avatar has been characterized as being a "white savior" movie, in which a "backwards" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture. [244] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 short story Call Me Joe , in which a paralyzed man uses his mind remotely to control an alien body. [245] [246] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that Avatar has elements in common with the 1960s Noon Universe novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky , which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave. [247] Various reviews have compared Avatar to the films FernGully: The Last Rainforest , [248] [249] Pocahontas [250] and The Last Samurai . [251] NPR 's Morning Edition has compared the film to a montage of tropes , with one commentator stating that Avatar was made by mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender. [252] Some sources noted similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean , which featured fantastic images of floating rock formations and dragons. [253] [254] Similarities have been found between Avatar and Ursula Le Guin's novel The Word for World is Forest , with Gary Westfahl writing for Locus Online that "... the science fiction story that most closely resembles Avatar has to be Ursula K. Le Guin's novella "The Word for World Is Forest" (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook." [255]
Avatar received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as "the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since Star Wars" and others calling it "audacious and awe inspiring", "master class", and "brilliant". On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: "It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?". [256] Time ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)" [257] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list , [258] and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time. [259]
Main article: List of accolades received by Avatar
Avatar won the 2009 Academy Awards for Art Direction , Cinematography , and Visual Effects , and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director . [31] The New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award. [260] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations. [261] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film. [262] Avatar also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director , and was nominated for two others. [263] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for seven others, including Best Film and Director. [264] The film has received various other awards, nominations and honors.
[ edit ] Extended theatrical re-release
In July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical re-release of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3-D theaters and IMAX 3D. [265] Avatar: Special Edition includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG , [266] including an extension of the sex scene [267] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film. [266] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish. [2] During its 12-week re-release, Avatar: Special Edition grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million. [4]
[ edit ] Home media
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010 [268] and in the UK on April 26. [269] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day . [270] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's native 1.78:1 ( 16:9 ) format as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film. [271] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM ( BD+ 5 ) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update. [272] [273]
Avatar set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by The Dark Knight (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over 4 million units sold. [274] In its first four days of release, sales of Avatar on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada – overtaking The Dark Knight to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region. [275] [276] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week. [277] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period. [278] As of July 31, 2011, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.4 million units sold with $189 million in revenue. [279]
The Avatar Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut, the special edition cut, and a collector's extended cut [280] (with the DVD set spreading them on two discs, but the Blu-ray set presenting them on a single disc). The collector's extended cut contains 6 more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, "you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening". He stated the "Earth opening" is an additional 4 1/2 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release. [281] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras. [280]
Cameron initially stated that Avatar would be released in 3-D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: "3-D is in the conceptual stage and Avatar will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November." [282] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3-D version would be released some time in 2011. [278] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3-D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV . The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012. [283] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3-D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was, "maybe one, two years out". [284]
On Christmas Eve 2010, Avatar had its 3-D television world premiere on Sky . [285] [286] [287]
[ edit ] Sequels
In 2006, Cameron stated that if Avatar were successful, he hoped to make two sequels to the film. [288] In 2010, he said the film's widespread success confirmed that he will. [289] The prospect of sequels was something he planned from the start, going so far as to include certain scenes in the film for future story followups. [288] [290] In August 2010, Cameron stated that his plans are to shoot both sequels in the planned trilogy back-to-back. He also mentioned, "what I'm working on primarily is the novel" and "presumably, once the novel is nailed down, work will begin in earnest on getting the sequel going." [291]
Cameron stated that they are going to widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus . [282] The first sequel will focus on the ocean of Pandora but will also feature more of the rainforest from the original movie. [292] Later in 2010, Cameron announced his intention to capture footage for this sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. [293] In December 2011, Cameron revealed that he is writing second and third films together, but that he is just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, will not be "strident", as the film will concentrate on entertainment encouraging action to save the oceans of our blue planet . [294]
The sequels will continue to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri. [295] Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story. "I expect that those nasty humans didn't go away forever," he said. [296] Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana have signed on to reprise their roles in future sequels. [290] In February 2010, Cameron confirmed that Sigourney Weaver , who played Dr. Grace Augustine, will also be appearing in Avatar 2, stating that "no one ever dies in science fiction." [297]
The sequels, to be produced by Cameron's own Lightstorm Entertainment in partnership with 20th Century Fox , were originally scheduled to be released in December 2014 and December 2015. [32] In January 2012, producer Jon Landau stated that Avatar 2 is "four years away" and is scheduled to be released in 2016. [298] [299] During the 2011 CinemaCon in Las Vegas, James Cameron stated his intention to film the two Avatar sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, in order to add a heightened sense of reality. [300] In May 2012, Cameron said that "[he was] making Avatar 2, Avatar 3, maybe Avatar 4". [301] In June 2012, actress Sigourney Weaver revealed that the three sequels were shooting simultaneously, and that she wasn't sure how long shooting for the movies was expected to take. [302] Filming is expected to begin September 2012. [303]
