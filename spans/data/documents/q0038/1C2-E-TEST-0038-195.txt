Hundreds of of graphic artists linked up the world’s third-biggest computer setup and invented new camera systems to create the astonishing 3-D futuristic world of “Avatar,” James Cameron’s new sci-fi thriller.
With a whopping $489 million budget, the groundbreaking movie — the most expensive ever made and Cameron’s first since 1997’s “Titanic” — is meant to immerse audiences in high-tech imagery and ensure they leave the theater asking: “How did they do that?”
Cameron’s team hired WETA Digital, the same New Zealand company behind Gollum and other special effects in “The Lord of the Rings” films, to create the artificial yet realistic-looking images in “Avatar.”

Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and Jake (Sam Worthington) are the virtual stars of “Avatar.”
“WETA Digital ended up having more than 800 employees just working on their effects,” said Jon Landau, Cameron’s co-producer.
Some of the film’s shots required 100 computer hours for each frame — or 2,400 hours of computing time for each second of film, figuring each second requires 24 frames.
