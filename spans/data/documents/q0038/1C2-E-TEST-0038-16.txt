'Avengers' Sunk 'Battleship,' Director Peter Berg Says
'What I need everyone to do is go see 'Battleship' now that they've seen 'Avengers' five times,' Berg tells MTV News of sequel chances.                   By Josh Wigler, with reporting by Kelly Marino                                                                                                                                                        Taylor Kitsch in "Battleship"                                        Photo:                                 If there's one thing you can count on Earth's mightiest heroes to accomplish, it's kicking alien ass. Iron Man, Captain America and the rest of the gang didn't just destroy the extraterrestrial threat in their movie, either — they also sunk the aliens of "Battleship" without even knowing it."Battleship" director Peter Berg spoke with MTV News recently about his thoughts on the box-office earnings of his latest big-budget blockbuster. The Hasbro adaptation has earned $235 million overseas, but only $63 million at the domestic box office — an outcome Berg pins on the outstanding success of "Marvel's The Avengers.""The movie kicked butt internationally, but we kind of ran into a wall when 'Avengers' refused to go away," he told MTV News. " 'The Avengers' outperformed everything. It was impossible for 'Battleship' to get any oxygen."Asked if he would do anything differently with the "Battleship" release knowing what he knows now, Berg had one idea in mind."I would have loved to have come out three weeks before 'The Avengers' domestically, like we did internationally," he said. "We did OK, but in hindsight — which my grandmother used to say is worth about a bucket of spit — we would have [released the movie] ahead of 'The Avengers,' not realizing it would have become, I think, the second biggest film in history behind 'Avatar.' ""Avengers" is actually the third-highest-grossing film of all time behind "Titanic," but who's counting? Berg is. When asked if he'd be interested in filming a "Battleship" sequel, he had a numbers-oriented answer in mind."What I need everyone to do is go see 'Battleship' now that they've seen 'Avengers' five times. If they do that, we can definitely make a sequel," he said. " 'Battleship' is a film that I would definitely like to do a sequel to. I loved making that film. I had a great time with it."Do you want to see a "Battleship" sequel? Tell us in the comments below!
