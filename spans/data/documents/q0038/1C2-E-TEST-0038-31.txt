Avatar has broken another record .
James Cameron ’s futuristic fantasy  earned another $16.4 million at the domestic box office on Monday , bringing its  total to $93.4 million after just four days in release. It’s the biggest Monday take in December ever (not adjusted for inflation or 3D/IMAX ticket-price premiums).
Does that mean Avatar will have the sturdy legs of a soccer player? Not necessarily.
Spider-Man 2, which made nearly twice as much — $27.6m — as Avatar on a Monday in July, went on to gross $373.4 at the US/Canada box office. That’s not bad at all, but it’s probably not good enough for the costlier Avatar.
Also, Pearl Harbor, considered a disappointment thanks to its high production costs, made only slightly less than Avatar on a Monday back in 2001 (a time when movie-ticket prices were cheaper than today). The Ben Affleck vehicle eventually grossed a total of $198.5m domestically.
Among the 10 movies that had better Mondays at the box office than Avatar — though some of those Mondays may have been holidays — are The Dark Knight, Shrek 2, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, X Men: The Last Stand, Bruce Almighty, and The Day After Tomorrow.
According to Box Office Mojo , Avatar’s current worldwide box-office take stands at $285.2m.
