Bypassing the usual tradition of having standup comedians present the awards actors Anne Hathaway and James Franco are set to present next February’s Academy Awards in LA.
Last year comedians Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin presented.
The fact that Hathaway and Franco are presenting the awards may just mean that they are going to pick up a gong themselves. James Franco is already tipped for Best Actor award from his role in Danny Boyle ’s shocking “ 127 Hours ”. Hathaway could also be in with a shot for the Best Actress gong for her role in alongside Jake Gythenhall in “Love and Other Drugs”.
The Oscar’s producers, Bruce Cohen and Don Mischer, said they wanted the pair to present to bring something "fresh, exciting and multitalented" to the show.
In a statement they said “James Franco and Anne Hathaway personify the next generation of Hollywood icons ... We hope to create an Oscar broadcast that will both showcase their incredible talents and entertain the world on 27 February.
"We are completely thrilled that James and Anne will be joining forces with our brilliant creative team to do just that."
This is the first time since 1986 that two non-comedians will present the show.
The 83rd Academy Awards will take place on February 27, 2011.
