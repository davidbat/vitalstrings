James Cameron did a very painstaking reenactment of a real ship that sank in 1912.  Many of the characters in the movie were based on real people (the ship's officers, Mr. Andrews and Molly Brown to name a few) but Rose, Jack and their families were fictional.
James Cameron did an awesome job of sticking to the historical facts while weaving his fictional story in to real events.  He even recreated the weave of the real ship's first class dining room carpet!  There are a few historical inaccuracies, but a lot of what you saw in the movie really happened.
