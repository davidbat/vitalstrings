Incredible film. Surprised it didn't open higher.

Ok, the story was predictable as balls. I knew exactly what was gonna happen in this movie the first time i saw the trailer. I won't say, because i don't want to ruin it for people who might be seeing it, but like a comment i saw on a different post on this site, it's pretty much Dances With Smurfs.

I love the people who try desperately to come up with negative comments about this film.  They need to just keep watching their favorite films like "The Philadelphia Experiment ", "Broke Back Mountian" or the "Producer" Avatar is the best movie you will see simply because of the groundbreaking technology and the great imagination of the one of the BEST director's of all time.  Anyone reading this blog needs to see this movie.  Don't listen to the people giving this movie a negative or low rating.  IT IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Now, if Brokeback is your kind of movie, don't even go and see this movie.  Save your comments for the Brokeback forums like these people should.

I'm 72 – see a lot of movies, and have been a few in my lifetime that I've walked out of.  So I'm not real critical of movies.  Avatar,3-D, is a great, great movie.  I can't grasp the creativity that comes from Hollywood … I was awe stuck and just about spell-bound with Pandora.  I'll probably have to get someone to explain the the relevance of the wheelchair bound character.  The female natives (can't remember their names) were so feminine and graceful … Pandora is a beautiful conception.  Was so very, very entertaining for me.

Avatar is just one of the best films I have ever seen in years. James Cameron did it again; its creativity dancing waltz with 3D technology. There was never a dull moment from start to finish!

Wow – alot of hating the haters from Jack –
My sense is that "these movies" – Dark Knight, Iron Man, Avatar do really well with the general populace because they become "event" movies amongst people that don't go to movies much, or certainly many genre movies.  I liked Avatar, but am honest enough to say that the plot was simplistic and that Cameron is rehashing his other movies here.  Good movie – but for the folks who are all BESTESTMOVIEEVAAAAH – either you don't go to many movies or have short memories

I have to say that I loved Brokeback Mountain as well as small indy films and usually roll my eyes at the "event" movies (although Iron Man and the X-Men movies are some of my favorites). I was not a James Cameron fan until I saw this movie. It has surpassed the Matrix and American Beauty to become my new favorite of all time. I guess it's kinda like the "Star Wars" of this generation with the amazing technology and ability with the 3-D viewing to literally transport you to Pandora. As far as the plot, I agree there were some cheesy moments and predictability, but this time, I was so engrossed I actually enjoyed those parts of it as well. To the haters, I honestly don't know what will impress you if this doesn't.

When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was saying, "Wow, this looks really stupid, I am not gonna see this movie" Then at school a couple of friends were talking about it. I decided to look it up on the internet and watch a few clips. It looked amazing so I went to the theaters. I was not let down. It is an amazing movie. One of the better ones Ive seen in the past few years along with The Dark Knight and X-Men 3

Absolutely the best movie I have ever seen. It was truly amazing. You must see it at the IMAX for the full experience. I am like Clarence-a lively senior with lots of movies under my belt. Prior to this picture, Aliens, was my all time favorite-another James Cameron movie. He is "the king of the world!!!
I will see it at least 2 more times!!!! Than buy the Video….Can't believe someone would not like this film. If you haven't see it, go and see for yourself than make a decision….bet you will be hooked like the rest of us…Na'vis followers………..

Ever seen Fern Gulley? look it up at imdb.com
It's a cartoon set in a lush jungle, where a man gets transformed into one of the native pixies, befriends the local (flying) wildlife, realizes the error in human slash-and-burn tactics, joins in the battle against the machines to save the rainforest?
This is that movie, intended for 6-10 year olds, but with better graphics.  That's it.  James Cameron came up with the idea for this movie while watching Fern Gulley with his grandkids.

I find it really funny when people get all worked up about how simple the plot is and how it's so much like "dances with wolves" or whatever. Well you know what i am pretty sure if you pick any movie made in the last decade we can find another movie before it that had a similar storyline. Do people not realize the concept of an age-old tale?!

I had not walked out of a theater feeling like I did after Avatar since walking out after Star Wars in 1977.

My family and I knew we wanted to see Avatar the moment we saw the 1st glimpes of it's trailer….It was absolutely worth every penney (quite a few) we spent to see it! Being a 'graphics/artist/type of guy' I was amazed by how 'natural' everything looked and 'felt.' Although I'm a HUGE fan of the Marvel/DC/Hasbro movies, this piece of work is in a class all by itself. As I've read, Mr. Cameron wanted the viewers to 'experience' this movie. What an experience it was! Indeed!

Great movie.  What an experience.  It will go along side the Star Wars Films, and Lord of the Rings Series, and the Best Sci-Fi films ever made.
