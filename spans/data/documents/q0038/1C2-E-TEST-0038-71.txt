From the Back Cover
It was WWII's most fearsome ship.  A ship so powerful, it sank the pride of the British fleet with a single salvo.  Hearing the news, Winston Churchill saw no choice.  He sent nearly the entire Royal Navy to hunt and destroy the Bismarck.  But what really happened to this German legend?  Was she sunk?  Or was she scuttled?  Now Titanic director James Cameron returns to the high seas to tell the tale and search for the truth.  Leading a team of explorers, historians and Bismarck survivors, Cameron examines the wreck three miles down and discovers the answers that may finally end the debate.  With revolutionary production techniques and high-tech Remotely Operated Vehicles, Cameron lights up this dark world and gives us the first glimpse inside the Bismarck in more than 60 years.  Stunning high-definition footage shows underwater images with cinematic clarity.  And cutting-edge animation and ultra-realistic reenactments bring the survivors' stories to life.  Join the expedition and relive the dramatic final days of the DKM Bismarck.
