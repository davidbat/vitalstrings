am too lazy to blog these days, but want to shout this out, i know its late n of no use, still
its about a year and they are planning more, i am saying about Sherlock Holmes movie, many of yours favourite n as a movie i enjoyed it too. but its a cheat, the cheapest marketing ever, just using the name for money.
and what u have seen is not any real Holmes,
am a huge fan of Holmes, n the movie depicts not the one we been reading from Sir.Arthur Conan Doyle.
he is not that funny as he is, though he knows baritsu, he is not into boxing or mere fighting often, and about Watson, he is just not like that any,
The movie had everything.action,drama,love,comedy. and there was no such story in whole Holmes collections, but must say nicely made to entertain everyone,
Holes must have been reproduced in the real style, thats what i want to say,the things they been loyal was his Address,Name and age.
He is the greatest ever in Detective novels, personally i love more than Poirot ,Perry Mason,Father Brown or any, n guys do read the classics n know the real star,
just my view, n to be frank i enjoyed the movie over all this
