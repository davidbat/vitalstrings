Legendary "Ghost Town Gunfighters" ...park. Many of the original actors have ...returned for roles in the film. Former "...Ghost Town Gunfighters" Robert ... as "The Apache Kid," Herbert Cowboy ...," and Harry Valentine "The Golden Voice... of Ghost Town" play pivotal roles in ...the film as does Alaska ... was one of the original park founders. ...Dean Teaster reprises the role of "...Digger" made famous by... his father. This movie was created ...to offset many of the... "Hillbilly" stereotypes ...often depicted with this area. The ...movie paints a picture of this ...beautiful mountain region that was ...by the overseas Celtic people. These ... were full of rich traditions and a ...true grit that allowed them ...to survive and thrive during the rugged... 1800's period of US History ...often shown in western films. ...This movie may well be the ...birth of a sub genre ... as "The Eastern."
