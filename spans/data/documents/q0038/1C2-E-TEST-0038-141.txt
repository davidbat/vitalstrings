The Palio di Siena is a barbarian horse-race who takes place in Italy, this race is very, very hard for the horses which are thorough beyond their limit, all the blows are allowed there, during this race it is not rare to see falling from the horses.
The production of the next James Bond intends to make a scene action which proceeds during this race.
This race thus will benefit from a formidable blow of publicity.
This petition ask this movie scene not be in the final cut of the film, this race is already sadly famous, it is necessary fight cruelties which surround us, not to encourage them and make their promotion.
