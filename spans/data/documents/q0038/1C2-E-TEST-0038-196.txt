It has been suggested to me several times that the only way to save apes is to move them to an island somewhere. My immediate reaction is always the conservation "party line" which is nicely outlined in the article below (its bad for endemic wildlife, the wrong type of foods will exist on the island so the animals won't be able to survive unassisted, where will you even get enough individuals to make a viable population, the money is better spent doing on the ground conservation, you aren't protecting biodiveristy just a single species with a translocation, etc etc). But at the same time, so many of these animals live in the harshest environments in the sense that they are being attacked from all directions, especially from anthropogenic effects, and from the poorest people who simply cannot afford the luxury of nature conservation. I have no idea what Mr. Branson's true intentions are, maybe he isn't trying to save a species and this is all for tourism and dollars, but I am keen on seeing what happens with this lemur translocation.
I know there are a lot of hopeful people and there have been many conservation success stories achieved by all the hard working NGOs out there. I hope that I am just too cynical, but I just don't see how wildlife in equatorial Africa is going to survive over the next 50 years if today's current trends continue. Despite heavy conservation efforts I have friends and colleagues coming back from the field (DRC, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, to name a few) where they say the forests are empty. Beautifully pristine and protected forests devoid of any wildlife. I think the chips are stacked against Mr. Branson but he is one of the few with the money and will to try something like this. It will either be the nail in the translocation argument's coffin or he will be a primate conservation pioneer. -MA

Richard Branson's lemur plan raises alarm
Sir Richard Branson is to import lemurs to the Caribbean, where they will live wild in the forest on his islands.
The project has alarmed conservation scientists, who point out that many previous species introductions have proved disastrous to native wildlife.
But Sir Richard's team maintains that both the lemurs, which will come from zoos, and native animals will be fine.
Introducing species found on one continent into another for conservation purposes is virtually unprecedented.
Lemurs are found only on the African island of Madagascar and many species are threatened, largely because of deforestation.
The threat has grown worse since the toppling of President Marc Ravalomanana's government two years ago, which allowed illegal logging to flourish.
"We've been helping to try and preserve lemurs, and sadly in Madagascar because of the government being overthrown the space for lemurs is getting less and less," Sir Richard told BBC News from his Caribbean property.
"Here on Moskito Island we've got a beautiful rainforest - we brought in experts from South Africa, and they say it would be an absolutely perfect place where lemurs can be protected and breed."
Ring-tailed and red ruffed lemurs are two of the species in the plan. Both are on the Red List of Threatened Species.
Moskito (also spelled Mosquito) Island is one of two that Sir Richard owns in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Several luxury houses, including one for the boss of the Virgin business empire himself, are being built on it.
His other island is Necker, home to an eco-tourism resort where a stay is priced at around $2,000 (£1,200) per day.

It's crucial that this move does not send the wrong message to people that it may be a good idea to keep lemurs as pets”
End Quote Christoph Schwitzer IUCN Primate Specialist Group
The plan has aroused a lot if interest locally, with the bulletin boards of BVI news websites buzzing with comments for and against, and politicians locking horns.
And it concerned conservation scientists contacted by BBC News.
"Maybe [Sir Richard] has got some people to say it is alright - but what else lives on the island, and how might they be affected?" asked Simon Stuart, chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission (IUCN SSC).
"It's pretty weird - I would be alarmed about it and would want some reassurances."
Dr Stuart suggested the project could contravene the IUCN's code for translocations - designed to prevent the repetition of disastrous events such as the introduction of rabbits and cane toads to Australia.
Among other things, it says that translocations should never happen into natural ecosystems.
When they do happen into areas that have already been altered by human hand, there should be a controlled trial period with continual assessment.
In the past, it says: "The damage done by harmful introductions to natural systems far outweighs the benefit derived from them".
Sifaka Sifakas can jump, but not swim - still, some local people are concerned about them escaping
And Christoph Schwitzer, who co-ordinates the Madagascar work of the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group, said the lemurs should really be kept in some kind of confinement.
"The project would only be acceptable if he intended to keep them in a controlled environment - that is, in some kind of fenced-in enclosure where they cannot become a problem to the native fauna and flora," he said.
"It's crucial that this move does not send the wrong message to people that it may be a good idea to keep lemurs as pets for their own personal pleasure."
And he warned that there could be impacts on local wildlife.
While some species of lemur are faithful to a diet of fruit, others will grab whatever is around, including lizards and other small animals.
"There may be birds nesting, and if there are some of the lemurs would attempt to predate on their eggs - or there may be small invertebrates that they'd go for," said Dr Schwitzer.
Necker and Moskito Island are home to reptiles such as the stout iguana, the turnip-tailed gecko and the dwarf gecko that local conservationists have identified as being of specific concern.
Sir Richard told BBC News that an environmental impact assessment had been carried out for Moskito Island; but critics in the BVI said it did not include evaluation of "introduced exotic species".
Welfare benefits
Sir Richard's motivation for wanting to introduce the animals is not entirely clear.
They seem unlikely to make a significant difference to his eco-tourism business.
Ring-tailed lemurs Ring-tailed lemurs will be the first arrivals - adaptable feeders with a taste for bird eggs
One of his principal advisors is Lara Mostert, one of the managers of the Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary, a South African facility where many species of monkey and lemur live together in a patch of forest.
She said Sir Richard's lemurs would have a much better life than in the zoos where they currently live - some, she said, in "horrific" conditions.
"Unfortunately, primates have become rather like a business - the animals are seen as a commodity and apart from that they don't really have an identity," she said.
"And that's one of the things I like about Sir Richard's plan - he's not going to sell them."
She thinks the animals will thrive on Moskito Island.
Sir Richard sees the project as bringing conservation benefits, envisaging that at some point in the future, lemurs could be re-introduced from Moskito Island to Madagascar.
But captive breeding programmes already exist for this purpose.
Lara Mostert suggested Sir Richard's son "wanted a lemur after seeing the movie 'Madagascar'".
Despite the concerns, the plan has been approved by the BVI government and appears to be going ahead.
The first consignment, consisting of about 30 ring-tailed lemurs, is due to arrive within a few weeks, moved from zoos in Sweden, South Africa and Canada.
The much more imperilled red ruffed lemur may follow, possibly alongside some of the sifakas, famed for their calls and their jumping, may follow.
As threats to natural diversity multiply around the world, transporting species from place to place for conservation is one of the "extreme schemes" that conservationists are talking about and even beginning to implement.
But almost without exception, these translocations are taking place within the ecological region where the animal originated, rather than halfway across the planet.

The Associated Press
Facts about oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, as it holds its presidential election Saturday:
___
GEOGRAPHY: Nigeria is twice the size of California, with an area of nearly 360,000 square miles (579,000 square kilometers). It is set on the Gulf of Guinea on the West African coast and borders Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
___
PEOPLE: Nigeria is home to an estimated 150 million people, making it Africa's most populous nation. Of more than 250 ethnic groups, the population is split between a predominantly Christian south and Muslim north. A small percentage practices indigenous beliefs. Twelve northern states have implemented Shariah law, an Islamic code of conduct, though the governments remain secular.
___
LANGUAGE: English is Nigeria's official language; more than 500 local languages and dialects are widely spoken. The main three language groups are Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo.
___
ECONOMY: Crude oil drives Nigeria's economy, accounting for about 80 of all government spending. Statistics suggest that 80 percent of Nigerians live on $2 or less a day. Despite endemic corruption, more foreign firms are looking to invest in Nigeria and consider it a growing frontier market.
___
THE ELECTION: President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian who came to power after the death of the country's elected Muslim leader in May 2010, remains the front-runner in the presidential election. However, Muslim candidates like former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari have gained support in a dissatisfied north. If no clear winner emerges in the presidential poll, a runoff will be held.
___
HISTORY: Nigeria gained independence from Britain in 1960. In 1967, the oil-rich eastern region tried to gain independence in a 30-month civil war that left more than 1 million dead. Peace and an oil boom in the 1970s brought in billions of dollars, but corruption undermined prosperity. After decades of coups and military rule, Nigeria became a democracy in 1999.

This Week in DVD & Blu-ray is a column that compiles all the latest info regarding new DVD and Blu-ray releases, sales, and exclusive deals from stores including Target, Best Buy and Fry’s. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 (Releases on Friday, April 15 — Blu-ray available as single-disc and Blu-ray+DVD+digital copy) I'm still not convinced that the final installment of the Harry Potter franchise needed to be separated into two films, but perhaps that's a discussion better reserved for Part 2. Is it fair to judge this as a standalone film, or should it be taken as only half of a whole (which in itself is only one seventh of an even greater whole)? Director David Yates seems to want it both ways, while also attempting to appease both hardcore fans of the books and more casual viewers of the movies. The effort is admirably ambitious, though not always successful, often servicing fans at the cost of narrative flow. I'll hold off on casting any judgments on how the film fits into the grander story at play — something that could very easily make or break the film in retrospect — but as a continuation of what's essentially evolved into a serialized big screen mini-series, this entry is as problematic as it is utterly compelling [1]. As a devoted fan of the films, it's fascinating to see how these characters (and actors) have grown and matured, and Yates does a tremendous job portraying the toll that these inherited responsibilities have taken on their relationships. Where the film falters is finding a satisfying way to properly set up and condense subplots from the book, leading to many awkward moments where characters and MacGuffins appear at random. I'm also terribly conflicted about the ending, because as much as I recognize the need to offer some sort of emotional climax, it doesn't register as an organic progression, and is treated with such gravitas that it inadvertently undercuts a far more significant occurrence at the end of The Half-Blood Prince. Criticisms aside, I have to respect Yates for endeavoring a near impossible task and not losing sight of the characters and their journey amidst the commotion. There lies the strength of the film, and that's exactly the way it should be. Available on Blu-ray? Yes. Notable Extras: Blu-ray – Includes a copy of the DVD and a digital copy of the film, as well as a sneak peek of an opening scene from the final film, a Maximum Movie Mode, Focus Points ("The Last Days of Privet Drive", "Hagrid's Motorbike", "Amazing (or) Magical Tents!", "Deatheaters attack Cafe", "Creating Dobby and Kreacher", "Godric's Hollow", "The Harry And Nagini Battle", "The Frozen Lake", "The Return of Griphook"), featurettes ("On the Green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver and James", "The Seven Harry’s", "Dan, Rupert, and Emma’s Running Competition", "Behind The Soundtrack"), and additional scenes.

Blu-ray with 24-page book: A Look at the Making of The Tale of the Three Brothers ($27.99). Where? Best Buy. WHITE MATERIAL (CRITERION COLLECTION) [Also available on Netflix Watch Instantly] White Material is a powerful and appropriately confounding viewing experience, but one that leaves the viewer wondering what it's trying to say — if it is indeed trying to say anything at all. It's a tale of a white woman whose steadfast loyalty to an unnamed, war-torn African country is at odds with its native occupants desire to take it back from people like her. Shot with an artful eye and a lingering sense of portent, we're left to witness the collapse of colonialism as a family fails to pay heed to the chaos around them. It's devastating to watch, and equally as frustrating. The paths that these characters choose for themselves are handled with great directorial conviction, although there's little to invest in emotionally. Should there be? Their actions defy all reason, so maybe not. This is also what makes it so difficult to decipher what point the film is trying to make. It's unrelenting in its gradual depiction of the 'what', but doesn't seem concerned with the 'why'. Then again, maybe its pointlessness is exactly the point. Maybe the 'why' is beyond comprehension. Maybe we're just hopeless and mad, and we will be to the very end. Scary thought. Scary movie. Available on Blu-ray? Yes. Notable Extras: DVD & Blu-ray – Interviews with Denis and actors Isabelle Huppert and Isaach de Bankolé, a short documentary by Denis on the film’s premiere at the Écrans Noirs Film Festival 2010 in Cameroon, a deleted scene, a new and improved English subtitle translation, PLUS: A booklet featuring a new essay by film writer Amy Taubin. DVD PRICE Amazon [5] – $19.99 BLU-RAY PRICE Amazon [6] – $27.99 HEARTLESS [Also available on Netflix Watch Instantly] The legend of Faust's deal with the devil gets an intriguing update in Heartless, a frequently clumsy yet weirdly engaging mixture of supernatural horror, socio-realism, romance and morality play tragedy. As silly and sentimental as it sometimes is, there's a palpable thrill in seeing which outlandish direction the story will take next. Jim Sturgess' moping about grows a little tiresome, but regular appearances by otherworldly characters liven up the material with an amusing undercurrent of grim comedy. Love it or hate it, it's at least a dozen times more imaginative than most of what's being released in theaters nowadays. Available on Blu-ray? No. Notable Extras: None. DVD PRICE Amazon [7] – $18.99 COUNTRY STRONG If there was any chance of me sitting through Country Strong after learning it was destroyed by critics [8], that possibility was quashed upon viewing "singing sensation and country music's newest star" Gwyneth Paltrow perform one of its songs at the Oscars. Never again. Available on Blu-ray? Yes. Notable Extras: DVD & Blu-ray – The Country Strong Soundtrack, a extended performance of "Shake That Thing", the original ending, deleted scenes, a "Country Strong" music video with Gwyneth Paltrow, and "A Little Bit Stronger" music video by Sara Evans.

While investment is critical for agriculture, the rush into long-term land leases is a dramatic step with many risks and substantial social and environmental costs
New research on the global rush for agricultural land shows small-scale farmers increasingly at risk as land deals ignore local tenure rights.
Fresh evidence from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union was presented last week at an international conference on "global land grabbing" convened by the Land Deal Politics Initiative and hosted by the Future Agricultures Consortium at the Institute of Development Studies, where researchers revealed documentation of land deals amounting to over 80m hectares – almost twice what was previously estimated.
The stakes are high for displaced small farmers, women and children, as well as national governments where land is being leased in large amounts. With land deals accelerating, particularly in Africa, it is essential that the fine print of such deals is subject to careful scrutiny, and that transparent and accountable governance mechanisms are put in place. And securing land rights is central to ensuring equitable agricultural development.
The rush to acquire land is driven by four factors: food price volatility and unreliable markets; the energy crisis and interest in agro-energy/biofuels; the global financial crisis; and a new market for carbon trading. Proponents of these deals say they are competitive, that they economise on labour, and that they produce food for export at prices low enough for poor consumers. But, as research from Cambodia to Cameroon to Colombia shows, the social and environmental costs of such deals are rarely taken into account.
"Small-scale family agriculture, on which most of the world's rural poor still depend, is threatened by large-scale plantations, export-led agriculture and the production not of food but commodities," said Olivier de Schutter , the UN rapporteur on the right to food, in his opening speech at the conference.
Policies that can curb the power of investors while securing rights for farmers must precede land deal negotiations. "The establishment of regulations and norms at multilateral levels is critical," said Ruth Hall of the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies in South Africa. "Small-scale farmers need national level regulations and institutions – the African Union's Land Policy Guidelines can help in this regard."
These policies must also deliver on human rights, said Sofía Monsalve from Fian International, as "forced evictions, the foreclosure of land, the denial of information about deals and the prevention of local participation in political decisions" violate land users human rights.
Last week's conference highlighted ways to increase the options of smallholder farmers. One strategy is to reorient agricultural investment away from land deals for large plantations or estates and towards highly productive and efficient small-scale family agriculture and markets, supported by stronger farmer voices.
Land grabs, either through economic or physical means, are, as Teo Ballvé from University of California, Berkeley put it, actually the "last step in a long chain of violent events" perpetrated against small farmers and pastoralists. The commodification and privatisation of land and the dispossession of farmers and herders is seldom taken into account in the boardrooms of corporations or in high-level meetings with governments.
Yet, some researchers at the conference argued that with the right international regulatory mechanisms, national government commitment to land rights, and stronger farmer voices holding governments and investors to account, there are ways that local food security and responsible land deals can coexist.
However, this will only happen if the deals are effectively negotiated; something that rarely happens today. Mahnaz Malik from the International Institute for Sustainable Development pointed out that "the fine print – no matter how boring – has major implications". This applies to specific land deal contracts, but also wider investment treaties. For example, certain clauses are highly restrictive, meaning that states are locked in to particular agreements over long periods. New laws to protect the environment or labour rights, for instance, cannot be implemented, as they may be subject to disputes and prohibitive compensation payments.
Bilateral treaties meant to attract much-needed investment to developing countries are particularly problematic, Malik argued. Globally, there are over 3,000 of these treaties across 183 counties, with many emerging from European countries, including Germany, Netherlands and the UK. These treaties allow private individuals or companies to bring claims against governments in international tribunals, where the scales are balanced very much in favour of the investor. By contrast, the rights of landholders affected by land deals are currently governed only by voluntary agreements and overarching principles, with no legally binding requirements.
Governments and communities must negotiate land deals with extreme caution. The track record to date has been poor, and while investment is critical for agriculture, the rush into long-term land leases is a dramatic step with numerous risks and often substantial costs.
