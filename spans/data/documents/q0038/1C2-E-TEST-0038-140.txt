Earlier this week, we heard rumblings coming out of Comic-Con about director James Cameron talking about bringing Titanic to the big screen in 3D. At that point, it was brushed off as an off-the-cuff comment. And really, why would they release Titanic in 3D?
The why appears to no longer be relevant, as Cameron talked to Empire and made a very serious gesture toward a Titanic 3D release. In fact, they’ve already started working on it, according to the director:
“We’re going to do Titanic in 3-D! We’ve already done a 90 second clip of it and it’s phenomenal and gorgeous, so that’s going to be the project for next year. It’s a conversion of it, not native photography; we can’t go back.”
When I brought this up on this past week’s episode of Reject Radio , I was laughed at. Well, take that Rob Hunter and Dr. Cole Abaius, looks like Cameron wasn’t just joking around. Cameron also mentioned that there was talk around brining Terminator 2 to the 3D medium, but nothing has evolved beyond early talks. Titanic 3D is very much in the works.
I suppose we should as why, but we all know the answer. Cameron has a movie that made $600 million domestically, the highest grossing film of all-time. There’s definitely a market for a re-release. Does that make it any less of a cash-grab? No. But it does make it a smart business move, one that will continue to fund Cameron’s ever-growing list of big-budget sci-fi ideas. So why not, let the fans of Jack and Rose cry 3D tears to an epic 3D love story.
Would you go see Titanic in 3D?
