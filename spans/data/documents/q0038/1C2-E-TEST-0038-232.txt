Memorial Day is right around the corner, which can only mean one thing – the 2012 summer movie season is about to kick off! This year is already expected to be one of the biggest yet with Men In Black III, The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises being just a few of the blockbuster titles being released. So now that the summer movie season is only weeks away, why should an indoor theater be the only place for you to see a movie?
 
It's a question that many have pondered, yet few have ever done anything about… until now! Because starting May 26 and continuing every Saturday until September 17, The Open Air Society will present Eat|See|Hear, an affordable event that will bring together classic movies, live music, and some of L.A.'s best food trucks to various communities all throughout Los Angeles. Movies will be screened on a three story high inflatable screen, spanning an amazing 52 feet in width, thus making it one of the largest movie screens on the West Coast. Some of the movies on this year's schedule include The Wedding Singer, The Big Lebowski, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Goonies and plenty more. Local bands from all across Southern California will be providing the pre-show entertainment, with over 80 food trucks on hand to satisfy whatever craving you might have.  
 
The summer-long event begins at the Memorial Greek Theater at Santa Monica High School on Saturday, May 26 at 5:30 p.m. with a screening of the hilarious Will Ferrell comedy, Anchorman. Tickets are $10, which only includes the price of admission. For a detailed schedule of the dates, times and places of all the other movies being screened please visit the website at www.eatseehear.com .
