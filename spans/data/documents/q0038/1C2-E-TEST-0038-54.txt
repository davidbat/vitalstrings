While Hollywood’s bean counters are all in a tizzy, scrambling to predict whether Avatar has a chance of smashing Titanic‘s record as the biggest box-office hit of all time, we here at EW are preoccupied with more esoteric questions — questions that reach beyond the mere philistine accounting of dollars and cents! Namely, is Avatar James Cameron’s best film? We realize there’s a lot of love out there right now for the visionary director’s brand new 3-D sci-fi-apalooza. And I think we can all agree that it’s a helluva lot better than 1981′s Piranha 2: The Spawning. But is Avatar a better movie than Aliens or Terminator 2 or even The Abyss?
Take a few moments to re-familiarize yourself with Cameron’s resume below and then let us know how you’d rank ‘em! (For the record, here’s how I’d vote — from best to worst: T2, Aliens, Terminator, Avatar, Titanic, True Lies, The Abyss.)
The Terminator (1984)
