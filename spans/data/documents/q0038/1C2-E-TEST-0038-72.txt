We owe a large debt to this one.  If it weren’t for the insane popularity of Titanic Two there wouldn’t be so many of us working on our own re-cuts.  I don’t intend to sound hyperbolic when I call this one the Citizen Kane of trailer mash-ups.

Me and my friend are outraged by this ridiculous, appaling movie that has wrecked the titanic forever. Leonardo DiCaprio/Jack Dawson deserves more respect than to be put in this awful disgraceful crap of a movie. The Titanic shall never be the same again! No words can describe our anger. The person who came up with such an idiotic movie is a complete and utter SPUD!!!!!!!!!!! And by the way how the hell can Jack be trapped in a big ice block if he sunk to the bottom of the ocean?Also, if you actually watched the first Titanic Rose actually changed her last name and Jack had no record of his foundings. I shall say it again. SPUDS!! The least you could do was have some more imagination to how Jack was found. And of course more respect. If your going to make a sequal to a movie, you at least keep the story line going, not have the forst movie based on true events then have the second completely fictional and utterly appaling. So yes, I hope this movie leaves you a very bankrupt person who ends up in the gutters as you deserve! You sad sad SPUD/POTATOE FACE! Now for our goodbyes……………….Farewell, I hope you die in hell! Our regards to all the other pitiful people who agree with us. P.S HI RINGO!!!! IF YOUR READING THIS……..YOUR POTATOE FACE WOULD DEFINENTLY WIN THE FUGLIEST SPUD OF THE YEAR AWARD!!!!!!! WE LOVE YOU ALWAYS xoxoxoxoxoxoxo
