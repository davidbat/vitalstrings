Is this one of those sites?
I dont see any African country in the list. Yet Nigeria, South Africa & Ghana produce loads of movies.
In fact Nollywood (Nigeria) produces more movies than Hollywood.

This list ignores Nigeria, which outpaces the US in films/year.

I am amazed how India made the most movies. I thought the USA would have the most movies.

The Internet Movie Database ( IMDB ) started as a hobby project by an international group of movie fans and has kept that sensibility. The site has over 400,000 movies catalogued complete with trivia. However, the database is not a complete record of all movies made in all countries, and as the staff is spread over Europe and the United States there is a bias towards movies from those regions. The statistic is best viewed as the number of movies from each country that are shown in those regions.
