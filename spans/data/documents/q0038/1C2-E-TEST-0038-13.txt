One of the the greatest African Actors of today is  Majid Michel…After conquering the African Movie Industry and having grabbed numerous Awards, Majid Michel is seriously looking for the next big challenge. It seems he is bored with playing same roles he has fully mastered.
In a recent chit chat with Golden Icons, Majid Michel talked about his desire for something great, something hollywood, something directed by one of the biggest world movie directors-James Cameroon…
Majid Michel may seem over ambitious, but is good to be over ambitious than have no ambition at all…And from the video below, Majid Michel goes on and on about wanting to be in a blockbuster Martial Art Action movie. So I guess he must love Kungfu!
Check out the video below

I am a blogger who created this site as a hobby. And oh yes, I am biased. I only report on artists/celebrities that I like or find interesting so DON'T remind me of that.....  BBM pin: 27CC18A6
