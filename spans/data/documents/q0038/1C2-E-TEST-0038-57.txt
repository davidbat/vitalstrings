Boasting stunning looks and an adorably goofy persona, Diaz started out as a teen model before bursting onto the cinema scene as a torch-singing sexpot in 1994's The Mask. Over the next few years, she gave nuanced supporting turns in blockbusters (My Best Friend's Wedding) as well as indie flicks (Last Supper), proving she was more than just a pretty face and perfect body. In 1998 she graduated to leading lady when she won the hearts of a trio of dysfunctional men (not to mention audiences) in the outrageous romantic comedy There's Something About Mary, which made great use of her natural wackiness and screen-wide smile. Subsequently, Diaz took on a number of serious roles, including a homely wife in Being John Malkovich and a 19th-century pickpocket in Gangs of New York. But she never abandoned her silly side, appearing as a scantily clad detective in Charlie's Angels and voicing the princess in the beloved animated fairy-tale series Shrek. Off screen, the plucky blonde has enjoyed a party-filled life with a succession of celebrity boyfriends, including Jared Leto, Matt Dillon and Justin Timberlake.
