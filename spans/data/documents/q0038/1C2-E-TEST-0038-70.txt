Yes it would make an excellent movie....but a movie based on a game..? Very possible, but I don't want to see Starship Trooper like props on the Zerg..
and I bet the Protoss would look so cool.
but if a hardcore StarCraft fan (like us) would be disappointed in the story line gets changed even by a little bit, just like how most Harry Potter fans and Twilight fans felt when the movie came out, hot looks wouldn't make up for the distortion of the story line. I'd watch it for the story line, not the graphics and not the actors and the others...

Let's not destroy this game with a movie, even less with a movie trilogy. The story in Starcraft is well made for a game, and it would need some change and filling to make it good as a movie. In general, movie based on video games suck, and vice versa. Leave SC as a game and enjoy it as it is.
And about the best storyline in video games, be cautious there, don't over hype the thing too much. It is among the good ones, but there are countless contenders for this award. You know there are a shit load of games out there do you?
Anyways, my view on this topic stays. I hope no one will ever make a movie about Starcraft or Warcraft Universe. Let them stay in the video games Universe.
