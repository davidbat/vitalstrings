Birthplace: Kapuasking, Canada
Best known as: The director of Titanic and Avatar
A self-made giant of Hollywood, James Cameron went from set-builder to art director (for 1981's Escape From New York) to writer and then on to director of some of the biggest films of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He directed Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-making role in The Terminator (1984) and its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron also directed Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (1986) and Ed Harris in The Abyss (1989). His 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet , broke box office records and won 11 Oscars, including awards for best picture and best director.  After the success of Titanic Cameron worked on a variety of non-feature projects, including the TV series Dark Angel (2000-02, starring Jessica Alba ) and documentaries based on his love of diving and the ocean, including Ghosts of the Abyss (2003) and Aliens of the Deep (2005). After 12 years away from feature films, he made a spectacular return in 2009 with the effects-heavy film Avatar. The sci-fi epic was nominated for an Oscar as best film (eventually losing out to The Hurt Locker), and in only its second month of release surpassed Titanic as the highest-grossing movie of all time.
Extra credit: Cameron was married to actress Linda Hamilton, the star of his movie Terminator 2, from 1997-1999...

Bigelow directed the 2009 film The Hurt Locker, which beat Avatar for the Oscar as the year's best picture. Bigelow and Cameron were both nominated as best director as well, and Bigelow won the Oscar there, too... The love theme from Titanic, "My Heart Will Go On," was a huge hit for Celine Dion .
