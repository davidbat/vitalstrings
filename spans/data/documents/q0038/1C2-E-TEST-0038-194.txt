What is Wixi?
Wixi is a social media network where users interact with each other by privately watching, posting and sharing content to all media types, including photos, audio and video.
The site offers a unique interface, where media can be managed the same way files are organized on a computer desktop.
Uploaded files automatically convert to be played in a high definition with one universal flash player that can be privately used or shared with friends, fellow Wixi members , through email, IM; mobile phones or embedded on blogs or other web sites.
