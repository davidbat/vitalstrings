LOS ANGELES, Calif.
“Titanic” is steaming back into theaters in April (this time in 3-D) to celebrate the blockbuster’s 15th anniversary, and Kate Winslet says having a new crop of audiences watch her work from 1997 is slightly embarrassing.
“It is like somebody saying, ‘You know that home video we made of you 16 years ago that took seven-and-a-half months to make? Well, we’re going to bring it out again and we’re going to ask everybody to watch it,’” the Oscar-winning star told Access Hollywood correspondent Tim Vincent at a junket for “Titanic 3D” in London on Monday.
