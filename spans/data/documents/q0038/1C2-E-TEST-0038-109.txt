"Avatar" - BEHIND THE SCENES
"Avatar Movie " - Oscar winning director James Cameron's return to the big screen with "Avatar Movie," was twelve years in the making. James Cameron, who was responsible for the biggest movie box office - until Avatar came along - and (almost) Oscar winning film in history, "Titanic," presented the 3D CG animated film "Avatar" as his follow up to "Titanic" - to movie theaters in December 2009.
"Avatar" is the story of an ex-Marine who finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an "Avatar," a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people. More than ten years in the making, "Avatar" marks Cameron's return to feature directing since helming 1997's Titanic, the highest grossing film of all time and winner of eleven Oscars including Best Picture. WETA Digital, renowned for its work in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong, incorporated new intuitive CGI technologies to transform the environments and characters into photorealistic 3D imagery that transports the audience into the alien world rich with imaginative vistas, creatures and characters.
"Avatar" eclipsed "Titanic" at the movie box office, domestically and internationally and is the highest grossing movie of all time.
It is getting a rerelease in movie theaters, August 27, 2010, with 9 extra minutes of footage. 20th Century Fox, the film's distributor, hoping that with the added revenue at the North American movie box office, "Avatar" will eclipse the $800 million mark. As of August 26, 2010, "Avatar's" North American movie box office gross is just over $750 million.
