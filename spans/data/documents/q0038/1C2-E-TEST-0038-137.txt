  Former CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) has been calling Social Security worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) to complain about his pension check and, in the process, is becoming romantically attracted to her. After Frank's home is attacked by a team of assassins, Frank kidnaps Sarah because he fears that she may also be targeted. Next, he rounds up his retired CIA co-horts–Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren)–and leads them on a cross-country mission to break into CIA headquarters to find out what was behind the attack. When they do arrive at CIA headquarters, they uncover a huge government conspiracy and cover-up.     3 User Reviews

Awesome Movie

  This is a must see movie if you want old fashioned action with a great cast. I have always loved Bruce Willis and teamed up with Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and John Malkovitch was brilliant. I saw this at the movie theater when it first came out and bought the DVD and have watched it at least 10 times since. I never get tired of seeing the performance of all of these fine actors. Whoever thought of this idea for a movie and casting it should be given a medal. With all the stupid movies there are today, this one stands out as good fun, good action and will make you cheering on the team. As Morgan Freeman says in the movie, "We got the band back together" they sure did and it's fantastic
great action and halirous movie
