Why, when movies like the Terminator series have different directors instead of the same, from the beginning? Like, for example, can instead of any other director, who to play, and play a movie series like I said, this is the Terminator T3 and the Immigration Office and films like Alien 3.4 and the AVP series, why dont they have the same director as keep Jame Cameron contributed to making this film started and made it right to come than with any other director and the exhibition of the series and currently a one of the most important black buster beat as before. What if Terminator 4 was James Cameron had directed the film, it would've complete what we really want to know, and if not full of emotion emoitional type film like T2 did, and it would've been a hit. Well, in the Ain &#39; t Talkin about the Terminator movies and all, im just wondering sayin in general, and therefore correct when films by the director, how and what to do with the film is being made the other series the same, if they knew dont get prepared to make the call, the film series?
