Avatar DVD release
The biggest releases of the year have some basic points in common.  They share the basic strategy that makes a movie successful – romance, cruelty and revenge. Avatar has been in the news for quite a long time but unfortunately I failed to understand the reason. I have watched the film in 3D and I think similar things have been shown even before. AVATAR definitely combines the real action with the animated scenes extremely well but should not be considered to be a new trend setter.
Overall, a wonderful film to watch.
