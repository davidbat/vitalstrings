[ change ] Seedings
In every tennis competition, players are given a seed to help decide their place in the draw. At Wimbledon, they use a player's performances (whether good or bad) on grass to help decide the seed. At other tennis competitions, seedings are chosen based only on rankings.
[ change ] Clothing
The umpires (referees) and linesmen all have to wear special dark green and mauve clothing. The players have to wear all white .
[ change ] Etiquette
Female players used to have their names announced with "Miss" or "Mrs"; this was unlike any other Grand Slam tournament. However, this changed for the 2009 tournament. In this tournament, only the surnames were used. If The Queen is in the audience, it is normal for players to bow to her.
