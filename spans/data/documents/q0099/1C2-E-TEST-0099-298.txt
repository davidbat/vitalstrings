Croydon Tramlink : Tram Stops
Croydon Tramlink has 39 stops, the newest of which ( Centrale ) opened in December 2005. Most are off-street, with some on former railway lines replacing railway stations, but there are also a small number of on-street stops in and around Croydon town centre.
Stops they share a similar design, with low-height platforms the length on a single tram. Each platform has a shelter, passenger information display (next trams indicator) and information boards with system and local area maps, timetable information etc. The only exceptions are Elmers End and Wimbledon , where trams use a platform in mainline railway stations with the trackbed raised to maintain step-free access. Stops are fitted out with signage in the Tramlink variant of the Transport for London house style. There is step-free access to each platform, with lifts at Wimbledon linking the tram platform to street level and to other parts of the railway station.
Each stop also has at least one ticket machine (usually there is one per platform) and an Oyster card reader, which Oyster Pre-Pay users must use to 'Touch In' and 'Touch Out'.
