Team news for Saturday's League Two clash between AFC Wimbledon and Shrewsbury Town at the Fans' Stadium Kingsmeadow.
AFC Wimbledon will be without midfielder Ricky Wellard for their final fixture of the season.
Wellard's season has ended a week early after he picked up a hamstring problem during last weekend's 4-0 defeat at Barnet.
Left-back Gareth Gwillim is struggling with a virus and will be assessed before kick-off but striker Christian Jolley should be fit after a shin injury.
Seb Brown is poised to return in goal after youngster Jack Turner got the run-out he was promised at Underhill.
Rookie midfielder Reece Jones could make his Football League debut while veteran defender Jamie Stuart is in line to make his final appearance for the club.
Defender Callum McNaughton (knee) and forward Jason Prior (broken leg) are long-term absentees.
Meanwhile, Shrewsbury are likely to take a fully-fit squad as they look to round off a promotion-winning season with victory.
Town clinched second place in League Two with last weekend's 1-0 victory over Dagenham and will want to end a memorable campaign with a flourish ahead of Sunday's open-top bus parade through the Shropshire town.
Manager Graham Turner has named an unchanged XI for the last six matches, with Shrews winning five and drawing one.
He could be tempted to stick to the same team yet again on the final day of the season or make one or two changes to give game time to the likes of Marvin Morgan, Sean McAllister and Jon Taylor.
Shrewsbury will also be looking to extend a nine-match unbeaten run until the end of the season.
