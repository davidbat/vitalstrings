All Wimbledon tournaments are simultaneously held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for Gentlemen’s Singles, Ladies’ Singles, Gentlemen’s Doubles, Ladies’ Doubles and Mixed Doubles. Youth tournaments – Boys’ Singles, Girls’ Singles, Boys’ Doubles and Girls’ Doubles – are also held. Additionally, special invitational tournaments are held: the 35 and over Gentlemen’s Doubles, 45 and over Gentlemen’s Doubles, 35 and over Ladies’ Doubles and wheelchair doubles.
The main show courts, Centre Court and No. 1 Court, are normally used only for two weeks a year, during the Wimbledon Championships. The show courts will, however, be pressed into action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon will host the tennis events of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Tickets are available for all sessions and rounds of the Wimbledon tournament. Tennis Ticket News offers men’s singles tennis tickets, men’s doubles tennis tickets, women’s singles tennis tickets, women’s doubles tennis tickets, quarterfinal tennis tickets, semifinal tennis tickets, and final tennis tickets. Tickets are also available for Wimbledon tennis packages and tournament tickets.
