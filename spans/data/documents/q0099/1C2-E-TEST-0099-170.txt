Wimbledon tram stop is within the National Rail station, occupying one end of Platform 10. This was formerly used by mainline trains on Wimbledon–West Croydon line services; the other end of the platform is still in use by mainline trains to Tooting and Blackfriars. Access to the tram stop is through the railway station booking office and across the booking office; as such it is the only tram stop where passengers must pass through a ticket barrier.
As well as National Rail services to Waterloo, Blackfriars and the south west, there is interchange with London Underground's District Line.
