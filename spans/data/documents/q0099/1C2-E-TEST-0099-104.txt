I see my contacts are also getting hooked in this tennis section.
Wimbledon's center court has no lights. One man's backwardness is another man's tradition. The French Open doesn't have lights either. They don't cater for night matches. But the US Open and the Australian open have lights.
It's hard to say the lights really affected the outcome of the match. I read that if Federer had broken Nadal in that last game to make it 8-8, they would have resumed the match the next day. But that's it exactly. Federer never looked like breaking Nadal's serve. And it was only a matter of time before Nadal broke his serve. With no tie breaks in the final set, there was only one way that match could have ended. Nadal would have had to sustain some kind of bullet wound injury to lose that match.

Asker's Comment:
I'm fine with tradition.  If they can schedule everything during the day, that's cool.  And the players didn't seem to be asking for play to stop.
I've played plenty of tennis at dusk, though, and experienced the slow but steady deterioration of play.  You don't realize it as it's happening.
