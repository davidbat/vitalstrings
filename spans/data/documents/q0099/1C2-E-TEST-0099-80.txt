The Laurels was inaugurated at Wimbledon in     1930 with the first winner being Kilbrean Boy. The medal shown above was presented to one     of the 1937 finalists, Derby winner Wattle Bark. He was owned by Mrs R H Dent and set a     record 29.26 secs over the 525 yards of the 1937 Greyhound Derby. However, despite     reaching the final of the Laurels he was no match for the favourite Ballyhennessy     Sandills.
The second medal was presented to the owner of finalists Wise Carey but, once     again, he was no match for the favourite Ballyhennessy Sandills who completed back to back     wins.

Trap 6 Goopy Gear who won the heat in 28.87 by six lengths from Brave     Enough with Queen of the Suir back in third. Goopy Gear was highly fancied for the     following years Derby at White city but was disqualified for fighting Future Cutlet in one     of the heats
Goopy Gear went on to win the final of the     Champion stakes in 28.89 when beating Brave Enough. For some reason or other neither Wild     Woolley nor Beef Cutlet were entered for the competition.
 
The final of the Christmas Vase; Does anyone     know who won?  Scallywag was an outstanding dog on his day. Also entered, but     eliminated in the heats, were two national winners Rule the Roost and Long Hop.
