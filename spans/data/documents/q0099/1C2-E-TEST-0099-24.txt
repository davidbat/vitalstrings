A night at the dogs entails an awful lot of whiling away time in between very brief races, so a sit-down dinner instead of hotdogs and tea out of plastic cups makes good sense. Star Attraction is the main restaurant here. Seating is tiered, overlooking the racetrack, and once booked, the table is yours for the evening. The three-course set meal is good value at £24.95 on a weeknight, and even includes lobster (£5 supplement). There's a fast-food takeaway stand, too, and another restaurant, the Bistro, used for private parties. Various corporate packages and executive suites are available, see the website for details.
