Wimbledon Information
Wimbledon is the third major of the year in professional tennis and is arguably the cream of the crop of this classic sport. Joining the Australian Open , French Open and the US Open as the four majors of professional tennis, Wimbledon takes place in late June/early July at the All England Tennis Club in London, England.
Taking place on grass, Wimbledon offers fans some of the most electrifying action of the four tennis majors. The grass surface highly elevates the velocity the ball travels, allowing players an opportunity to reach incredible speed on their serves, and making play at the net and a serve-and-volley game a formula for success. The tradition at Wimbledon is second to none, with players required to either wear all-white clothing or white clothes with subtle color accents. In addition, players are required to bow or curtsy if Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales is present at the Royal Box at Centre Court.
The tradition simply adds to the spendor of this event, and the fact the best tennis players in the world are competing for the title make this an even more impressive event. TickCo has great seats available to you today with your purchase of Wimbledon tickets at TickCo.com!
