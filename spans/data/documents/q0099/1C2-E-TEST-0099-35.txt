Yarmouth
The cut and thrust of the fastest sport in the world, coupled with the luxurious surroundings of the finest purpose built venue in South London – you’ve just got to come greyhound racing at Wimbledon Stadium.
Wimbledon have the Silver Service Star Attraction Restaurant, the less formal Broadway Diner or you might prefer to grab something on the run from one of our excellent fast-food outlets. Then again what about taking a party to one of the four highly acclaimed Executive Boxes.
If you want to experience the unique feel of the atmosphere on the terraces, that’s available too. Then afterwards why not have a drink in the new state-of-the-art Paddock Lounge area or absorb the continental feel of the Diamond Room, which now features the acclaimed Diamond Diner serving hot Carvery meals on a walk-in basis.
It is hard to believe so much can fit under one roof, but then Wimbledon Stadium is the product of £3.5million investment by GRA, the biggest and most experienced greyhound promoter in the business.
