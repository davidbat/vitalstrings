[ edit ] Understand
Wimbledon is a well-known and affluent suburb in the southwest of London , England and is part of the London Borough of Merton [3] . It is, of course, best known for the All England Lawn Tennis Championships (or often just referred to as Wimbledon) held every summer and which form part of the worldwide tennis grand slam series. This is the oldest tennis championship in the entire world.
[ edit ] By tube
Wimbledon is serviced by the following stations:
Wimbledon (District line). During the Tennis Championships, direct buses run from outside for a small charge.
South Wimbledon (Northern line).
Southfields (District line). This is the most convenient station for the tennis club.
Please note that the quickest route into Wimbledon from central London is usually via a combination of Tube and the National Rail. Though the District Line is the most obvious choice from central London, it is usually the least efficient. Trains depart every 3-5 minutes from Waterloo to Wimbledon during week days with a journey time of about 15 minutes (South West Trains operates this service.)
[ edit ] By train
Wimbledon Station is the most important transport hub in the area. Located in central Wimbledon, it is well served by South West Trains [4] and First Capital Connect [5] train companies.
Services run from London Waterloo via Clapham Junction to Wimbledon Station (about 15 min). Trains from Wimbledon go to Guildford , Hampton Court , Dorking, Shepperton and Woking . Change at Clapham Junction to get to Brighton , Epsom , Gatwick , Reading , Portsmouth and further afield.
Wimbledon Station has two entrances, one at the front of the station serving as a drop off point for cars and a taxi stop and one to the side that leads to buses and a shopping mall. Disabled access to the 10 platforms are by lifts. Public toilets can be found near the tube District Line platforms. There are food and drink shops within the station complex.
[ edit ] By plane
Wimbledon is almost equidistant between the two major London Airports, Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airport .
The quickest way from Gatwick is to catch a fast [6] Southern train for Victoria and get off at Clapham Junction. Here, change onto a South West Trains service south bound to Wimbledon (weekdays: 15 an hour).
From Heathrow, you can either catch the London Underground Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to Earls Court and change onto the District Line to Wimbledon, or you can catch the Heathrow Express (or Heathrow Connect) service to London Paddington Station and then catch a Wimbledon bound District line train from there. Both of these require luggage movement through underground stations.
[ edit ] By tram
Wimbledon is served by the Wimbledon to Croydon tramlink which terminates at Wimbledon Station (route 3), other tram stops in the area include Dundonald Road and Merton Park. A route map can be found here [7]
[ edit ] By car
The A219 runs through Wimbledon Hill Road, Wimbledon Bridge to the Broadway and beyond. The A3 is the main route to Wimbledon when coming in from the M25 Motorway or Heathrow Airport. From Gatwick Airport follow the M23/M25/A217. The nearest petrol station is an Esso Garage with a Tesco Metro (Open 24 hours) found along the Broadway towards South Wimbledon underground station.
[ edit ] Get around
