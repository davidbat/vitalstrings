Other Info:
The track was originally cinder and had a narrow 3 foot inside lane. It was upgraded to synthetic in 1990 and is set in a very pleasant environment with trees surrounding it. The track is under the jurisdiction of Merton council although the boundary between Merton and Wandsworth councils bisects the track which means that planning permission from both councils is required before any development can take place. Track only floodlights were installed in October 2000. In April 2001, a new DT/HT cage was installed and the PV runway was relaid. There are disused sand pits at both ends of the back straight. In the summer of 2005, the back straight was resurfaced and a new HT cage, new areas for LJ/TJ/PV/HJ and new SC barriers were provided. The track reopened on 14th Nov 2005.
