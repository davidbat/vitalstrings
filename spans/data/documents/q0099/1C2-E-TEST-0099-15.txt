Wimbledon Stadium
Wimbledon is one of the most followed sports of all         time. It has come a long way since 1877, when it was first inaugurated.         With the passage of time it has become one of the most prestigious         events in the world of professional tennis. Professional lawn tennis         players from more than 60 countries participate in the Wimbledon, and it         is watched by millions of people worldwide.
The Wimbledon stadium is known as the All England Lawn Tennis Club or         AELTC. It is a beautiful, 42-acre tennis club which hosts the         Championship. It is one of the most elegant venues of the world, simply         because of the fact that it is just about 15 minutes away from central         London. Its grand stature coupled with easy accessibility has made it         one of the most famous locations for the Championship.
The stadium was established in the year 1868 as a private club in         Wimbledon, England. Just nine years after it was founded, it went on to         hold the first tournament. In 1922, the Club relocated to Church-road,         Wimbledon from its earlier location at Worple Road and has stayed in         this location ever since. There are various plans of renovations in         place, to be made in the year 2009. At present, the Wimbledon stadium         has 19 grass courts, 5 red shale, 3 continental clay, 1 American clay, 5         indoor courts, more than 20 practice courts and one non-regulation field         as well.
The members of the club can use all the facilities of the stadium,         throughout the year. The total members of the club stand at less than         400, which makes it one of the most selective clubs in the whole world.         It is not easy at all to get a membership of the club. It is considered         to be a very grueling process which takes a little more than a couple of         weeks. Although the stadium has always held only the Wimbledon         Championships, it has also held events apart from the Wimbledon         Championship as well, like the Wightman Cup in 1972 and the Davis Cup,         in 2000. Every year the Wimbledon stadium attracts more than 450,000         fans of tennis.
However, there are not only the matches to keep the visitors glued to         the ground. Apart from the Wimbledon matches, the stadium also has 3         restaurants, a museum which has memorabilia which dates back to the year         1555, various art galleries, concession stands, private lounges, pubs         and even an extensive library. For emergency requirements, there is also         a bank, a pharmacy, medical supplies, medical stations and shops that         are present at the stadium.
Tickets to the Wimbledon stadium are relatively cheap, ranging from £24         to £79, and one gets much more to enjoy than just the Wimbledon         matches. With a host of other things to do, visitors are sure to enjoy         themselves to the fullest. The fans that attend the Wimbledon         Championship are also granted an all-access pass for the Wimbledon         stadium as well.
