In DiRT Showdown, you'll be able to enjoy some destructive 8 Ball racing on a figure-of-eight track, where crashing is pretty much inevitable. So, to demonstrate exactly what 8 Ball mode is all about, Codemasters recently put on an event at Wimbledon Stadium in London, where professional banger racers engaged in some bumper-to-bumper action.
We were there and shot our own video, which you can watch here . But if you want to see our very own Dan Webb giving his opinion of DiRT Showdown, then this is the video for you. It's "brilliant stuff", apparently. You can have that one for the box, Codemasters!
You'll also catch a glimpse of myself at 1:06, but it's a blink and you'll miss it appearance. Not that you should actually care about that when there's smashing and crashing to watch. Check out the 'buzz' trailer for DiRT Showdown's 8 Ball below, then get ready to floor it, when DiRT Showdown launches on May 24th in the UK and Europe and June 12th in North America.
