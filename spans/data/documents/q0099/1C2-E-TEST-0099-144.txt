The Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum was opened in 2006 by H.R.H the Duke Of Kent. This state-of-the-art tennis museum in London has since received thousands of visitors from all over the world.
Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, London visitors to the Wimbledon museum can experience the atmosphere in the 1980’s Gentleman’s Dressing Room and watch John McEnroe guide you through normally off-limits areas and reminisce about how he first met Jimmy Connors and how he prepared himself for matches.
Interactive touch screen consoles throughout the tennis museum in London take you through the history of the game and this world famous tennis club – not to mention the inside story on the tournament that has become one of the highlights of the summer sporting calendar.
You can also view the Whites Of Wimbledon exhibition and see the extensive collection of tennis attire through the ages from the 1880’s right up to the present day.
London Pass holders should note that the Wimbledon Experience tour is also available free and features VIP access to restricted areas including No 1 Court and the Press Interview Room as well as informative commentary from a trained Blue Badge guide.
If you enjoy your visit to Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum why not consider another London sporting tour such as the Chelsea FC Stadium tour or the Twickenham Stadium Tour & Museum Of Rugby?
