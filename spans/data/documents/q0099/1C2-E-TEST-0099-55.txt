As a regular customer of this car boot sale,I am absolutely appalled by the vile language used by the people attending the car park.Upon asking one of the attendants to moderate is language ,i was told to mind my business or i would have my head shoved up

Please don't call the number on this listing as it is a mistake and a residential number.  I have asked the administrator of this website to remove it
