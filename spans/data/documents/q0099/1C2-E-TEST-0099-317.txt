“In riding a horse we borrow freedom” Helen Thomson
One hour rides (hacks) If you are an experienced rider you can join a small group of riders and, accompanied by a knowledgeable Instructor, explore the wonderful riding terrain of Wimbledon Common. The rides are varied and interesting and the Common changes beautifully with every season so you can be sure that you’ll never get bored. Riding in the open also offers fantastic opportunities to experience what real riding is all about and it’s a great way to improve your fitness levels.

“When you are on a great horse, you have the best seat you will ever have” Sir Winston Churchill
One hour training hacks – like the above but different! Your Instructor will train you while hacking to help improve your control. A challenging, but enjoyable, alternative to ring lessons – engaging your horse’s attention on the track is much more demanding than it is in the arena! You will learn about distances, control, independent working, changing pace and tempo and much, much more. Also recommended for riders wanting to join one hour rides in the future.

“The horse is God’s gift to mankind” Arabian Proverb
One hour class lesson – Your short hack to one of the two all weather schooling arenas in the heart of the Common offers the ideal opportunity to warm up for your lesson and get to know your horse. Your lesson will include riders of a similar ability with similar ambitions but your Instructor will ensure that you receive individual attention. The ride home is the perfect way to cool down and relax after the class and catch up with the other riders and your instructor (session time includes ride to and from the arena).

One hour private lessons for beginners or novice riders. If you’re new to riding or a complete beginner you will be taught on the tracks with a mounted Instructor either leading you, or riding beside you if you are able to ride off the lead rein. Your Instructor will ensure that you progress at a speed which is safe and comfortable for you, making this the perfect introduction to horse riding.

Semi-private rides or lessons are also available if you specifically wish to ride with a friend or partner. They can include some time in the schooling arena or be based solely on the riding tracks. For reasons of safety they are always taken at pace that suits the least experienced rider.

“the horse lends you his strength, speed and grace” Lucy Rees
Two hour riding sessions are available on weekdays and we have some well established groups on weekday mornings at 10.15. You are able to spend longer in the arena and so they are very popular if you want to work towards your BHS exams or concentrate on your dressage or riding technique. See Training and Courses for a full programme of two hour sessions. Private and semi-private two hour sessions are also very popular and can be tailor made to suit you.

“The wind of heaven is that which blows between a horse’s ears” Arabian Proverb
Two hour rides to Richmond Park. For a change of scene why not combine the sheltered wooded tracks of Wimbledon Common with the wide open space of Richmond Park and book a two hour ride. Experienced riders can join a small group or you can book to go privately or semi-privately if you wish.
All this and more….
