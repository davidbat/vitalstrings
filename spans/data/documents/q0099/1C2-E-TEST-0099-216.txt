 
 
Players                   are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the                   recommendations of their national tennis associations, and, in                   the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying                   competition. The Committee of Management determines which                   players may enter the four invitational events.
 
The                   Committee seeds the top players and pairs (thirty-two players                   in each main singles events, and sixteen pairs in each main                   doubles event) on the basis of their rankings. The defending                   champion is normally, but not always, seeded first. A majority                   of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have                   ever won the Gentlemen's Singles Championship: Boris Becker in                   1985 and Goran Ivanisevic in 2001. No unseeded player has                   captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female                   champion was Venus Williams, who won in 2005 as the fourteenth                   seed. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous                   occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not                   only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.
 
Grounds
 
The                   nineteen courts used for Wimbledon are all composed purely of                   rye grass. The speed and the low bounce of grass courts                   favours serve and volley players. Serve and volleyers such as                   Rod Laver, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, and Pete                   Sampras have all won the Championships. However, baseliners                   such as Björn Borg have also performed very well, as have                   all-court players like Roger Federer. Among women, the serve                   and volley strategy is less common; one of the few female                   serve and volleyers, Martina Navrátilová, won Wimbledon on a                   record nine occasions.
 
The                   main show courts, Centre Court and No. 1 Court, are used only                   for two weeks a year, during the Championships. The remaining                   seventeen courts, however, are regularly used for other events                   hosted by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.                   Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts.                   At one time, all of the other Grand Slam events were played on                   grass. The French Open abandoned grass for its current red clay in 1928, while the                   U.S. and Australian Opens stayed with grass decades longer.                   The U.S.                   Open abandoned grass for a synthetic clay surface in 1975,                   and changed again to a hard surface with its 1978 move to its                   current venue. The Australian Open abandoned grass for a different type of hard surface in                   1988.
 
The                   main court, Centre Court, was opened in 1922 when the All                   England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club moved from Worple Road to                   Church Road. Due to possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a                   retractable roof is planned for the court; it is expected to                   be completed in 2009. The court has a capacity of almost                   14,000; at its south end is the Royal Box, from which members                   of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches.                   Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the                   main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds                   involving top-seeded players.
 
The                   second most important court is No. 1 Court. The court was                   constructed in 1997 to replace the old No. 1 Court, which was                   adjacent to Centre Court, but was demolished because its                   capacity for spectators was too low. The original No. 1 Court                   was said to have a unique, more intimate atmosphere, and was a                   favourite of many players. The new No. 1 Court has a capacity                   of approximately 11,000. The third-largest court, No. 2 Court,                   has been dubbed the "Graveyard of Champions" due to                   its reputation as the court on which many seeded players have                   been eliminated during the early rounds. Famous players who                   have lost on the Graveyard during early round play include                   John McEnroe, Pete Sampras, and Serena Williams. The court has                   a capacity of about 3,000.
 
At                   the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen                   on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an                   area of grass officially known as Aorangi Park, but more                   commonly called Henman Hill. The "hill" takes its                   name from local favourite Tim Henman, whom many fans hope will                   become the first British man to win the tournament since Fred                   Perry did so in 1936. Due to Tim Henman's early exit and                   British newcomer Andy Murray's relative success in the 2005                   Championship, the hill may be renamed as Murray Mound, Mount                   Murray, or Murray Field (after the Scottish rugby stadium).
