The Australian Open is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments held each year. The other 3 Grand Slam tennis tournaments are the French Open, the US Open, and Wimbledon. Dates for the Australian Open will be January 14 through January 27, 2013.
The Australian Open tennis tournament was in danger of fading into irrelevance before being revived in 1988 with a shift to Melbourne Park, which is where it has been held ever since. Like the other three Grand Slam tournaments, it was contested by top-ranked amateur players.
Name: Australian Open
