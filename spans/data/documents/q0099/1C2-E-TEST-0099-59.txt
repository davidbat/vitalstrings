Would like to leave some positive feedback for your team.   I have have flowers from other companies in the past which have been nice but very exspensive. Arena flowers are value for money and the receivers of the flowers are very happy :) Other companies send you a conformation email of payment, but dont seem to state when your flowers have been delievered. The communication between your company and the custuomer is excellent!!! I always know exactly when my flowers have been delivered. I will contuine to use your service for all occassions.   Would just like to thank you and i will and have reccommended you to friends and family.   Sarah x
