About
Back in July 1926 few of the 1700 spectators at the first greyhound race could have predicted how so many people would love the dogs.
Now one of the country’s most popular spectator events, a £20 million modernisation programme has transformed the six GRA stadia nationwide and the latest in technology provides a fun-filled night out with a difference for you and your party.
As soon as the doors open at around 6.15pm, the electric atmosphere is unleashed even before the racing begins, the buzz of the stadium is infectious wherever you choose to catch the race action.
