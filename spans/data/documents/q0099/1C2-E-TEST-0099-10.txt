About Wimbledon Stadium
Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium attracts a large cross-section  of people. The young 'trendy' set rubs shoulders with racing 'purists' to watch races that take place every 15  minutes from the glass fronted, air conditioned grandstand, one of the Executive Suites or the Mick the Miller stand.
