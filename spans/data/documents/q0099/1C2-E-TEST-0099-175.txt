Abstract
The development of football stadiums are no easy job. The planning of such a large scale development must be extremely thorough and prudent. AFC Wimbledon are one of many non-league football clubs who have experienced being relocated or having to ground-share with other clubs while they attempt to find a suitable home. Since the club were formed they have ground-shared and never played in Wimbledon, however they do now own their own ground. This research project aimed to discover the major issues involved in building a new stadium and the feasibility of AFC Wimbledon building a new stadium in order to cater for the clubs needs and provide potential for them to achieve their aims. With interviews carried out with club officials, this project highlights the major challenges and opportunities that AFC Wimbledon will face as they attempt to return the club to its spiritual home and identifies ways in which these issues can be dealt with.
