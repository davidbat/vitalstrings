About Wimbledon
Due to Wimbledon's location, namely, in one of the most important cities in Europe, if not the world, there is a great choice of Wimbledon hotels. Here is just a brief overview of some Wimbledon hotels you might like to stay at.
Nearby are the four-star Wimbledon hotels Canizaro House and the Best Western Lodge Hotel.
Both these Wimbledon hotels offer high-quality accommodation relatively close to Wimbledon, being a mile and a mile and a half from there respectively.
Other truly budget (i.e. one star) Wimbledon hotels are over 3 miles away, and are as such not really viable to be picked out here.
