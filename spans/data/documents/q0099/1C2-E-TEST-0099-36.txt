What's The Ground                     Like?
Kingsmeadow                   is a small but tidy stadium that has seen investment in                 recent years since AFC Wimbledon took over the lease                 from Kingstonian FC, who still groundshare with the                 Dons. On one side is the Paul Strank Stand. This                 covered, all seated Main Stand looks fairly modern,                 having recently been extended. It accommodates 1,265                 spectators and although only eight rows high, it is free                 of supporting pillars, resulting in uninterrupted views                 of the pitch. Surprisingly the team dugouts are not                 located in front of this Main Stand, but opposite in                 front of the John Smiths Terrace, which leads to a                 procession of players and club officials, at half and at                 full time. This terrace is partly covered to the rear                 and has open flanks to either side.
At one end is the Tempest End Terrace (aka the Athletics                 End, from the Athletics Stadium that sits behind), where                 the majority of the home supporters stand. This newish                 looking covered terrace is located quite close to the edge of the playing area, giving a reasonable view of                 the game. Opposite is the Kingston Road End Stand. A                 former terrace this is currently being replaced with a                 new covered, 1,000 seat capacity stand. In addition the                 stadium has a set of four rather plain looking                 floodlights.
Future Ground                     Developments
Michael Field informs                   me; 'The Club are in the progress of building a new                   1,000 all seater stand to replace the existingÂ  Kingston Road terrace. This should be open in                   September/October of this year'. This is mainly being                   undertaken to ensure that the ground complies with                   League regulations.
