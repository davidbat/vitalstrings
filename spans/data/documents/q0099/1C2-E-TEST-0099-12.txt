If you are one of the overwhelming number of visitors who are able to enjoy this site while showing respect for everyone else, then carry on in and have fun.
If you are one of the tiny minority who insist on using offensive names or can't have a disagrement without being aggressive or abusive to other Wimbledon fans - don't do it. And if a steward asks you politely to stop doing something, there will be a good reason why - so please stop it without complaining. If you can't accept this, you will be kicked out and not allowed back in. Please don't try to push the limits of this policy because there will be no second chance.
Entry to the stadium means you are agreeing to accept these rules.

Welcome to the virtual stadium for 2011/12.
We'd like to extend a warm welcome to fans of AFC Wimbledon, and to any opponents who also find their way here. Aggressive and abusive behaviour are not acceptable, but beyond that there are no set rules - apart from on Saturdays please don't post Premiership scores. Please also respect the fact that there are often children watching with their parents. Virtual stewards are on hand with fearsome powers, but they'd much rather not have to use them!
Please email us to let us know of any issues or problems you encounter with this version.
Radio WDON and iPloughLane are funded entirely by your donations for season tickets, and through generous sponsorship from Dons fan Mike Richardson.
