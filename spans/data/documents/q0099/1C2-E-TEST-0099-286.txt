Under Loan Program, Bills, NFL may Help Foot Ralph        Wilson Stadium Bill
The        last time the Buffalo Bills worked out a new lease deal        for Ralph Wilson Stadium, in 1998, New York State was on        the hook for the whole $63 million in renovations. The        Bills paid none of it. This time around, the Bills are        asking for stadium renovations costing between $200        million and $220 million, according to Erie County        Executive Mark C. Poloncarz. But now the Bills -- along        with the National Football League -- are being asked to        provide tens of millions of dollars for the        improvements. Having an NFL team pay a sizable amount        for stadium renovations is far from unprecedented.
