The buzz surrounding the Williamhill.com Greyhound Derby Grand Final at Wimbledon Stadium tomorrow is being marred by fans’ concerns the stadium may close.
Merton Council is believed to be considering proposals to demolish the track at Plough Lane – which is the centre of greyhound racing in London.
“This news has all been blown out of proportion,” a spokeswoman for Galliard Homes, who part own the stadium, said.
“We are a development company and an architect released some plans for the stadium online which had nothing to do with us and has since withdrawn them. It is all nonsense.”
Paschal Taggart, the former chairman of in Irish Greyhound Board, is keen to revolutionise London’s greyhound industry.
He submitted plans to Merton Council at the beginning of May to renovate Wimbledon Stadium into a £30million four-tier stadium with hospitality suites, restaurants and concourse bars – accessible by escalators and lifts – with a capacity of 6,000.

The spokeswoman added that greyhound racing fans should enjoy the greyhound derby without worry of losing the stadium.
Six dogs are racing in the final tomorrow for first prize of £125,000.
Lovethedogs.co.uk list their favorites’ as:
Razldazl Jayfkay -  a consistent 28.30 dog and reliable runner
Bubbly Phoenix - has clocked Impressive Trial Times at a time of 28.33 for the 4 race bends
Boher Paddy - Beat Razldazl Jayfkay previously  and so has plenty of potential
The one to beat is Charlie Lister’s dog, Taylors Sky, who won last year. He is a strong favourite to take home the williamhill.com Greyhound Derby 2012 crown again on Saturday achieving the double.
