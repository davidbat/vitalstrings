Experience the beauty of Wimbledon through data
IBM helps inform the science of tennis at Wimbledon, providing players, coaches, spectators and millions of people worldwide with a richer experience. We start by providing the most basic piece of data: the score. From here, a vast sea of information - from schedules to player statistics, serve speeds and match insights - is captured, analysed and distributed to media, officials and fans, both in the arena and around the world. This year, working closely with the All England Club, we've designed and built a brand new website at wimbledon.com .   The new website is designed to better reflect the beauty and atmosphere at Wimbledon, and offers new features.  For example, for the first time, visitors to the site will be able to watch Live@Wimbledon â€“ live highlights of matches as they happen, streamed directly to your device.
