Stadium Info
The Fans Stadium Kingsmeadow has three terraced stands with only the Paul Strank Main Stand being all seated. The gradiant on the John Smiths and Tempest End terraces allow for good views of the action and there are no supporting pillars throughout the ground. All stands are covered and the Kingston Road End roof has been extended to cover more than 90% of the stand whilst the steps have been raised to improve the view.

Away Fans
Visiting fans are situated at the north end of the John Smiths Terrace. Upto 900 fans can be accomodated here although a very small amount of seats can be made available for elderly or partialy disabled. The views from this section are very good. There are two bars in the ground and unless the game is all ticket, away fans are welcome.
Food and Drink
There are a number of pubs in the surrounding areas. A lot of visiting fans tend to drink in Kingston town centre and get the bus to the ground. In the immediate vacinity you may want to try The Peel. It's situated on Kingston Road and does allow away fans in. The Cambridge Fish Bar also on Kingston Road and a 2 minute stroll from the ground, is definately worth a visit. Alternatively, the club now sell fresh hot pizza within the stadium.
