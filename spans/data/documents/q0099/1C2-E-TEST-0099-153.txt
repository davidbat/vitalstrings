NOTES
As a poor student in the 1970's, buying programs was a little too extravagant! However, I've got some, and that's what the * means.
Special thanks to Rick Young for taking considerable trouble getting me lots of information for this page, Ian Silver for typing up lots of fixture info from '75 and '76, and Jon Driscoll for filling in some fine detail. Many thanks too go to Nigel Anderson for very many fixture and result details.

Thanks to John Nunn for spotting his mate John Shields (SCOTA 254) on his side after colliding with team mate Alan Thatcher (44). The front of Al's car is just in the pic. Apparantly, John said he was blinded by the dust, but the view is he was making a roll-up and lost control!
