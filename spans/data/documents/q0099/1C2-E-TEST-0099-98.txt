Stadium Info
The Fans Stadium Kingsmeadow has three terraced stands with only the Paul Strank Main Stand being all seated. The gradiant on the John Smiths and Tempest End terraces allow for good views of the action and there are no supporting pillars throughout the ground. All stands are covered and the Kingston Road End roof has been extended to cover more than 90% of the stand whilst the steps have been raised to improve the view.
