Few tears will be shed by the sprinkling of well-wishers who bother to turn up at Selhurst Park, but Sunday will be one of the saddest days in my football career.
It will be more of a wake than a farewell party as Wimbledon play their final game in London - against Burnley - laying to rest the spirit of the Crazy Gang before heading for a new life in Milton Keynes.
I scored on my debut in the club's first 'home' game at Selhurst Park, in 1991 against West Ham and, 345 appearances later, it is sure to be an emotional occasion when I watch Wimbledon's final match there from the stands.
Then on Monday I'll watch the other Wimbledon - AFC - take on Raynes Park Vale in their final game of the season at Kingsmeadow ... a roller-coaster 24 hours in the lives of old and new clubs.
Selhurst was never home but while we remained as temporary guests of Crystal Palace there was always the faint hope the club might one day return to its Merton heartland.
Come 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon Wimbledon will no longer be a London club and I can't help feeling upset that more wasn't done to keep the club here.
Wimbledon should be based in the borough of Merton and, if people at the club and the council had done their jobs properly over the years, then they still would be.

The Dons Trust have voted to buy Kingsmeadow. Reports The Big Tissue. The vote which came after two hours of presentation and debate was overwhelmingly in favour, though many people that voted yes have misgivings about what we've committed ourselves to.
And what they have committed themselves to is daunting - effectively having to raise £10,000 EVERY DAY for the next nine months. No surprise then that financial director Erik Samuelson asked those voting to consider the question 'Can YOU afford it?' during his presentation of the financial implications.
The vote approved the purchase of Kingsmeadow, the ground and stadium (NOT Kingstonian FC) for £2.5 million from Mr Khosla on a 110-year lease. With various taxes and legal fees the total cost of the deal will probably amount to almost £3million leaving the club to raise another £2.7 million.
An initial deposit of £270,000 has to be paid on exchange of contract (this Wednesday.) A further payment of £350,000 has to be made on 30th June with regular staged payments to be made from them on until 31st December 2003.
And if they fail to make any of those payments there is a strong chance that they will lose all the money raised thus far. (Though, like much else to do with this deal, there is a fair amount of uncertainty over this and there may be ways to safeguard the money.)
Pretty daunting. Basically they have staked the whole future of the club on this one move. But voted for it because after 11 years at Selhurst how could they turn it down? They just couldn't vote for a continued ground share when the chance to buy a ground (and hopefully helping another club to survive and prosper at the same time) at a knock down price had presented itself.

Press Release by the Dons Trust
In the programme notes for the recent game (Saturday 8th February 2003) between Franchise FC and Bradford City played at Selhurst Park, Mr Koppel Chairman of Wimbledon FC Ltd made a number of derogatory remarks about the supporters and organisations of AFC Wimbledon and wrote the following:
'What I find totally unacceptable is the fact that some are intent on pursuing the destruction of Wimbledon Football Club. They scaremonger with talk of franchising and precedent setting and they continue to do as much as possible to try to damage our Club. AFC Wimbledon claim our history and heritage as their own, but if they think that we will just give up the long, difficult struggle for the survival against the odds of this Club, they are sorely mistaken. WISA, the Dons Trust and AFC Wimbledon have some intelligent and hard working people who spend far too much of their energies on us.'
In response Louise Carton-Kelly, Chair of The Dons Trust had this to say:
'I would like to make it clear that on behalf of The Dons Trust or indeed as a director of AFC Wimbledon I spend no time whatsoever expending any energy on Franchise FC - let alone attacking a club that I no longer want to be a part of. However, I am extremely glad that WISA continue to pursue what is rightfully ours through law abiding well thought out and well structured routes.'
Louise went on to add:
'The supporters of AFC Wimbledon believe that the club is a continuation of the spirit which formed Wimbledon Old Centrals in 1889 and kept Wimbledon Football Club alive until May 2002. We consider a football club is not simply the legal entity which controls it, but that it is the community formed by the fans and players working towards a common goal.'

A dark cloud is on the horizon reports The Big Tissue Web site.
Once all the facts become available, the decision on where AFC Wimbledon are to play next season, and the one's beyond, is going to be a tough one to make. What is clear is that they are going to have to take the decision before all the facts are known.
To be eligible for promotion to the Ryman's next season a three-year ground share deal needs to be in place. The deadline for this is towards the end of February.
They  have to decide between staying at Kingsmeadow (and extending the existing three deal for another season) or moving to Tooting & Mitcham's Imperial Field's. (Ryman's rules do allow for a deal that names two stadiums in the deal, so there is the possibility that some third option could be negotiated.)
The Problems: Brentford have the option of replacing AFC at Kingsmeadow next season or the season after. The deadline for them taking up that option falls after the Ryman's application deadline.
If AFC leave Kingsmeadow voluntarily before the end of the deal, there is a penalty clause written into the agreement, which will have to be paid.
A deal is in place with Tooting and Mitcham, but there isn't yet planning permission for two teams to share Imperial Fields and there is no guarantee that a decision on planning permission will be made before the Ryman's deadline.
All in all, the logical conclusion is that next month they are going to have to make the biggest decision in the club's history based on incomplete evidence and gut instincts, and then hope to fortune that they get it right.
================== Previously ==================
AFC Wimbledon and Tooting & Mitcham United FC are working together on a 3-year ground share agreement. Subject to finalising the deal and obtaining planning approval, AFC Wimbledon will join Tooting & Mitcham United FC in its brand new, 3,500-capacity stadium at the Imperial Sports Ground, Bishopsford Road, Merton.
Chairman of AFC Wimbledon, Kris Stewart said:
'We're still looking for a permanent home but this would provide a first-class base in the meantime. An agreement for us to share the excellent facilities at Bishopsford Road would be great for AFC Wimbledon, for Tooting & Mitcham United FC and for the community here in Merton. I am very hopeful that we could develop a mutually beneficial relationship during the initial 3-year term of the deal.'
The Clubs are applying to Merton Council to extend the seating capacity of the stadium from 650 to 1,650 and convert wasteland behind the stadium in to an enclosed, floodlit, practice pitch. The aim is for AFC Wimbledon to move into office accommodation during February 2003, ready for the start of the new season in August.
=================== Previously ===================
Dons fans are not discouraged by the news that Wimbledon FC's former Plough Lane stadium has been sold to a housing developer - and their search for a permanent home continues unaffected by the deal.
Fans have been campaigning for a return to their traditional home and last year the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA) came up with architect's plans for a 20,000-seater stadium on the site as part of the campaign to stop the club moving to Milton Keynes.
Nicole Hammond, Chair of WISA, said:'After Sam Hammam sold the family silver, Safeway owned the site for five years and couldn't get permission to develop it - and there's no guarantee the new owners will get planning permission for their scheme either.
'The change in ownership of the land doesn't necessarily change the situation we're in. 'Although we'd love a return to Plough Lane, our campaign has always been aimed at bringing the Dons back to Merton or as close as possible. The only change is that it's now AFC Wimbledon who we're looking for a home for and we're helping the Dons Trust in their efforts to achieve that aim.'
Louise Carton-Kelly, Chair of The Dons Trust - the owners of AFC Wimbledon, said:'The Dons Trust continues to strengthen the links between the club and the community of Wimbledon and the surrounding areas - and a crucial part of that is to have a permanent home in that community.
'We have a group of highly qualified people working hard behind the scenes, exploring every opportunity for a return to Merton, or nearby. Plough Lane is one of the sites under consideration, along with others which may prove to be more suitable for AFC Wimbledon.'

Press release from WISA
The record low crowd in division 1 for last night's Wimbledon game against Rotherham - and the third worst in over 114 years of League football - proves that not only have Wimbledon FC Ltd lost have lost over 90% of their fans but have lost the moral high ground too.
The official figure of 849 was the lowest ever in the division and is in the all-time low crowd for the club. even that official figure is in doubt though, as WISA had posted counters with clickers on each turnstile and counted just 493 fans entering the stadium.
Wimbledon FC Chairman Charles Koppel has constantly derided critics of his plans to move the club to Milton Keynes as a minority and that 'true fans' would stick with him and the club.
WISA Vice-Chair Lee Willett said
'We've suspected that the gate figures from the club have been inflated all season - last night was just further proof. They must have added on the stewards, the police, reporters and the catering staff selling the 12 pies they had on sale and probably added the pies and the half-time oranges to the gate aswell.'
'Charles Koppel said that we'd all walked away to AFC Wimbledon but the truth is that the only people moving away are Wimbledon FC Ltd who are trying to get 70 miles away from their historic base in London. He says the club must move forward, but the crowd last night shows they're in reverse.'
In repeated statements, the club have always said that fans would follow them to Milton Keynes, but nobody from Milton Keynes is coming down to watch Wimbledon. And, with no date announced for moving to a temporary stadium let alone a permanent venue in Milton Keynes, the noose is tightening around the Club.
Manager Stuart Murdoch's comments that 'the crowds are not the reason why we are in trouble financially' also fuel speculation that all is not well behind the scenes at the club. Last night crowd will do nothing to dampen rumours that the club's Norwegian owners are thinking of pulling the plug on the club and this record low indicates a nosedive not just in crowds but in confidence over the proposed move and the future of the club as a whole.
The club claimed that they had to move Milton Keynes as they couldn't afford to go on playing in South-West London given Wimbledon's crowds, and yet now the club manager claims that there is no link between the crowds and the club's finances. WISA has urged the FA Commission that approved the move to examine the manager's statement which contradicts everything the club said at the time.
Willett added 'The club died as a club on May 28th when they got permission to ditch their history and their supporters and move away. Now it looks like they'll soon be dying as a business too if their backers ditch them in turn. I hate to say we told you so when we're talking about what was our football club, but it's not as if we didn't warn that this would happen.'

Wimbledon could move to Milton Keynes within eight weeks after they were granted planning permission at the National Hockey Stadium. reports the BBC
They are still to decide whether to build a temporary ground there after the local council granted permission to redevelop the site.
Ultimately the club hope to make a permanent move to a brand new stadium at the Milton Keynes Bowl, but their application for planning permission is still outstanding.
The Hockey Stadium would require extensive redvelopment to meet Football League standards. This includes 2,000 extra seats, turnstiles, a new pitch and CCTV cameras, and Wimbledon have yet to secure a land agreement on the site.
But the club are confident they could deliver a temporary ground there within eight weeks if they can raise the money.
Dons spokesman Graham Thorley said: 'The club's intention is to play in Milton Keynes as soon as possible and we are looking at all options.'
Just how many people attended Wimbledon FC's first game of the season is not clear, an official attendance of around 2400 is exactly what was predicted by Mr Koppel although independant views were that only around 1000 people were inside the ground. This number was easily beaten by the protesting fans outside the ground.
With Gillingham bringing over 800 this figure shows how little local support there is for the frenchise driven move to MK.
It is now up to the visiting clubs to show their support for Wimbledon fans by also boycotting the games until this decision is reversed.
Brighton & Hove Albion fans have joined many other clubs by voting to boycot Selhurst and many will go to Kingsmedow on the day to support AFC Wimbledon.
I urge all fans to try to do the same.
==================== Previously ====================
From The BBC :
AFC Wimbledon started life in style when 4,652 fans turned out to watch them play Sutton United in their first ever match.
The 'new Dons' may have lost 4-0 at Gander Green Lane, but they were undoubtedly winners as fans turned out in force to support them.
Meanwhile, First Division Wimbledon FC called off their friendly against Carshalton, which was also due to be played on Wednesday.
From The Big Tissue :
'Over four and a half thousand fans crammed into Gander Green Lane last night for the first ever AFC Wimbledon game. Despite conceding four second half goals the final whistle saw a mini pitch invasion as fans rushed on to thank and congratulate their new team'.
Brilliant! Well done to Kris Stewart and all true Wimbledon fans, also for the new sponsorship deal and wonderful season-ticket sales.

Following their rejection by the Ryman League AFC Wimbledon have been elected to the Combined Counties League. This is a feeder league to the Ryman 2nd Division
AFC Wimbledon has been set up by a group of Dons supporters angry at FA's decision to allow Wimbledon's relocation to Milton Keynes.
AFC Wimbledon statement
'The work starts today on building a club the supporters can be proud of, The Dons Trust has raised £75,000 to fund their project. And they have agreed a deal to groundshare with Kingstonian at their Kingsmeadow Stadium next season.
Former Wimbledon player Terry Eames has been appointed as director of football.
==================== Previously ====================
As reported on the WISA site:-
On June 14th 2002 AFC Wimbledon was accepted as the 'real' Wimbledon. A packed Wimbledon Community Centre, cameras present, saw the unveiling of the ground for next season - Kingstonian's Kingsmeadow - the new kit (old style royal blue and yellow) and the new manager, old Womble Terry Eames, who has the confidence and a collection of profanities to match dear old Harry Bassett.
Biggest surprise of the night was the owner of 'real' Milton Keynes City FC (and, by the way, Koppel, you can forget about buying the name) - a Merton resident no less - speaking out against Dr Evil and his property consortium.
However, after the exuberance and sheer joy of the night, one thing all Dons need to remember is that the members voted for a new club AND to keep fighting WFC Ltd. The promise will be kept, but your help is needed. The football world expects.
===================== Previously =====================
The Dons Trust has issued a statement outlining what has to be done and how Wimbledon fans can help form a club, AFC Wimbledon, to play in the Rymans Division 2 next season, in particular a £200 advance on their AFC Wimbledon season ticket. The trust is going to hold a Special General meeting on 13th June.
====================== Previously ======================
With an incredible disregard of the fans of Wimbledon (and all other clubs) the FA Commission has ruled that the Wimbledon Board are able to take the club to Milton Keynes for their new home.
This has more to do with finding a football team for a town without a top club rather than finding Wimbledon their own home.
The FA should be ashamed of themselves to allow this to happen. I suggest we all write to both the FA and the Football League to explain our disgust at this decision today it is Wimbledon but tomorrow it could be your club. The email addresses of these people are on our links page.
Perhaps we could also contact Wimbledon FC to say we will not attend matches in Milton Keynes.

Press Release from WISA
Subject: Season Ticket Ballot Result
An excellent response from members of WISA to the ballot has seen an endorsement of the EGM Motion and this is now deemed WISA policy.
The balloted motion read:
'Should WISA call upon Wimbledon supporters not to buy a season ticket in protest at the continued attempts to move to Milton Keynes?'
Over 80% of members who returned completed ballot papers voted in favour of the motion and therefore all supporters of Wimbledon Football Club will be called upon NOT to buy season tickets for matches next season until Charles Koppel renounces all plans to relocate to Milton Keynes.
Members recognise that by paying up front supporters were providing a monetary war chest for Charles Koppel and his lawyers to continue with their campaign to rip the heart out of the club and have its remains dispatched to Milton Keynes. This show of solidarity is another landmark in the ongoing campaign to save the 113 year history and tradition that is
Wimbledon Football Club.
Wimbledon supporters are taking a further step in reclaiming their club from the corporate puppeteers and returning it to the community where it belongs and with the assistance of Merton Council and commercial partners will seek to build a new home and stadium in Merton.
Kris Stewart commenting on the result said:
'This overwhelming vote, more than 5 to 1 in favour of not buying season tickets, shows the depth and strength of feeling against Charles Koppel's plans to destroy our club. I will be joining the boycott with other Wimbledon fans by not renewing my long held season ticket.'
=================== Previously ===================
Merton Council have said that they intend to build a new stadium on the old Plough Lane site even if Wimbledon choose not to return to the site. The statement went on to say that if Wimbledon FC do not wish to move into the site then the Council will seek an alternative club to move in. The statement must give hope to the long suffering fans of Wimbledon as it proves Charles Koppel wrong when he claims there is not a suitable site in the local borough.
