Description:
Wimbledon Centre Court is arguably the most prestigious and famous tennis court in history. It was built in 1922 and has a capacity of 13,800 spectators.
For the Wimbledon Championships 2007, the centre court will be uncovered and be bowl-shaped as a consequence. This is because the Wimbledon organisers are in the process of adding a fully covered retractable roof to the court which will be ready for the 2009 championships. The stadium will have a temporary roof surface for the 2008 games. The capacity of the centre court will also be increased to 15,000 for 2009 by adding six rows of seats to the north, west and east sides of the court.
The Wimbledon Centre Court is only in use for two weeks a year during the Wimbledon Championship. If the championship overruns due to rain, it will be open for a third week.
In 2012 Wimbledon will be used to host the tennis events of the London Olympic Games.
