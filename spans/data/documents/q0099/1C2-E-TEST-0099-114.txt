Team news for Saturday's League Two clash between Barnet and AFC Wimbledon at Underhill Stadium.
Martin Allen will consider making changes for this crucial League Two clash.
The Bees have no new injury worries but are still without defenders Darren Dennehy (foot) and Danny Senda (knee), and striker Steve Kabba (knee).
Winger Mark Marshall is also unavailable as he remains suspended following a failed drugs test on Boxing Day.
Allen could tinker with his side after his first match back in charge ended in a 3-0 defeat at Southend last Friday night.
A defensive reshuffle saw Allen send on Jack Saville for Michael Hector during the first half while veteran striker Scott McGleish and midfieder Alessane N'Diaye came on after the interval.
The Bees are just one place and two points above the relegation zone.
Meanwhile, AFC Wimbledon will check on goalkeeper Jack Turner.
Manager Terry Brown plans to give Turner a rare chance in the side ahead of regular number one Seb Brown, but only if the 19-year-old can shake off the knee injury he suffered in the warm-up prior to last Saturday's win over Torquay.
Brown is also considering handing rookie midfielder Reece Jones his Football League debut following a loan spell with Hampton and Richmond Borough.
Top scorer Jack Midson needed six stitches in a hand injury after the Torquay game but he is back in full training and will be available.
Fellow striker Jason Prior is recovering from a broken leg and defender Callum McNaughton has a knee injury.
