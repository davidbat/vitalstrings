Some                                    tickets are sold in advance, by lottery, by                                    memberships etc. Rest have to be bought on the                                    day.
I                                    queued from 5:30 a.m. and there must have been                                    10000 people ahead of me already. Many were                                    with their tents clearly indicating they had                                    fun. Met a few friends as well.

I                                    went to see the tournament again in 2002. England's                                    Tim Henman lost (again!) much to the disappointment                                    of local fans.
The                                    small hill within the premises which has a huge                                    screen to watch the matches having beer, is                                    called Henman Hill in the honour of current                                    best British Player.
I                                    think from 1997 onwards it will be called 'Murray'                                    hill in honour of next best player 'Andy Murray'.                                    Hope he doesn't disappoint us.
I got an opportunity to rub shoulders (literally) with who's who in tennis - Martina, Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, A. Sanchez, Roger Federer, Patrick Rafter, Lisa Raymond, Elena Likhovtseva and many more.
Walk between courts
An                            interesting incident:
I saw a crowd, barged in, took an autograph, did not                            realise who it was from. He did not look like a tennis                            player!
Asked                            my next person who said it was ‘Sir Steve Redgrave’.                            I nodded claiming ‘oh! That’s great’.                            After going home in the evening, searched on the internet                            to see who he was.
In case you are like me when it comes to other sports                            and do not know who he is, here is what wikipedia says:
Sir Stephen Geoffrey Redgrave CBE (born on                            23 March 1962, in Marlow, England) is a British rower                            who won a gold medal at five consecutive Olympic Games                            from 1984 to 2000, as well as an additional bronze medal                            in 1988.
As the only Briton ever to achieve this feat, he is                            widely considered to be Britain's greatest Olympian.                            Redgrave also won a bronze medal with Andy Holmes in                            the coxed pairs in 1988. He has won nine Rowing World                            Championship gold medals.

Wimbledon                                    Travel: You can travel to Wimbledon by train                                    from London. Other way that I prefer is to go                                    to East Croydon (underground station) and from                                    there take a tram to Wimbledon (20 minutes)
