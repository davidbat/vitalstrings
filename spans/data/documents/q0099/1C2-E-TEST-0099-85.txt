Wimbledon Car Boot sale opens at Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium
Posted at 1:00 pm, June 10, 2011 in Shopping & Style
We recently hailed it as one of London’s best car boot sales and now, thankfully, it’s back: the Wimbledon Car Boot takes place this weekend (from 7am daily) and every following Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday to September. It offers pretty much everything a bargain hunter would wish to hunt, from second-hand magazines, books and records to clothing, crockery, furniture and toys. Early birds get the best merch.
