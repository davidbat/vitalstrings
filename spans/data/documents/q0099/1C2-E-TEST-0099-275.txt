Wimbledon Tennis Championships
The Wimbledon Championships, officially called “The Lawn Tennis Championships”, is the oldest and arguably most prestigious event in the sport of tennis. It is held annually at the All  England Club in Wimbledon, a suburb of London, in June or July every year. The tournament starts 6 weeks before the first Monday in August, and lasts for two weeks subject to extensions for rain.
