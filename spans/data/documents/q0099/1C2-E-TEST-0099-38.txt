See behind the scenes at the home of tennis in the UK with the award-winning Wimbledon Tour Experience.
The Wimbledon London tour gives you V.I.P access to restricted areas where even tournament ticket holders are forbidden to enter and is led by specially trained Blue Badge Guides who bring to life the colourful history of the world’s most famous tennis club.
The Wimbledon Tour Experience includes entry to the hallowed ground of No 1. Court, the Millennium Building and the Press Interview Room, where you can almost sense the presence of the world’s best tennis players at their most elated or deflated, (depending on their performance!)
During your visit, London Pass recommends visiting the enchanting Water Gardens, a little known feature of the club with stunning views of over the city; the tour also includes entry to the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum.
Visitors should note: the Wimbledon Tour Experience may change depending on scheduled events and tournaments. Pre-booking is strongly advised at any time of year. Please also note there is no access to Centre Court at the current time due to ongoing construction work.
If you enjoy your visit to Wimbledon, other sightseeing tours available with the London Pass include the Chelsea FC Stadium tour.
