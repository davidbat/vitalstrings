US Open Tennis Travel Package
Even though Wimbledon is a little older than the US Open, there is no doubt that the event at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, New York, achieves much higher attendance numbers. More than $20 million prize money will be awarded at this year’s US Open, and more than 700,000 people will be there to see it all happen. Even though that’s certainly a lot of US Open tickets, they can be extremely hard to come by, especially for the Men’s and Women’s finals. But with one of our 2012 US Open Tennis packages , you will get tickets, transportation to the USTA Billie Jean National Tennis Center, hotel accommodations and more. We can customize a US Open package for you based on what sessions you want to see.
The last of the four Grand Slam events, the US Open is played at a variety of venues at the USTA National Tennis Center. The centerpiece of the complex is Arthur Ashe Stadium, which holds approximately 24,000 fans. There is also the 10,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, which formerly was the primary court until Arthur Ashe Stadium debuted in 1997. There are also several side courts, and it’s very easy to get around the grounds and check in on several different matches during the same day.
In recent years Roger Federer has dominated the men’s side of the US Open, except for the ’09 victory by Juan Martin del Porto. There have been a variety of recent winners on the women’s side with Kim Clijsters, Serena Williams and Justine Henin trading turns as the champion. US Opens of the past have featured some of the most legendary names in tennis, such as John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Chris Evert, Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova.
