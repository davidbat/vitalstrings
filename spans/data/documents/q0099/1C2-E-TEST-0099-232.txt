Wimbledon Debenture Seating Allocation
Debenture seats are the finest tickets on Centre and Number One Courts and offer a very special experience. They are valid for the full day and also provide access to all outside courts on a first come-first served basis. What's more, they are also the only seats that are available for sale before the tournament.
All Debenture tickets come with special badges which provide access to the relevant Debenture Lounge, which includes a bar, restaurant, and special cloakroom facilties very close to the court.
Wimbledon Debenture tickets are normally issued in pairs and as such only 'even' numbered Wimbledon bookings are usually accepted by us. Please call Wimbledon sales on +44 (0) 870 1999 742 for bookings of odd numbers of tickets (1,3, 5, 7 etc.) and larger group bookings.
PLEASE NOTE: We guarantee to allocate Wimbledon Debenture tickets in minimum of pairs together, but every effort is made to keep larger bookings together. Where this service is unavailable Ticketstosee.com cannot be held responsible.
