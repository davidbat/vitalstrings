Our Verdict/Review:
There was talk some time back that the greyhound dog racing track at Wimbledon was going to be shut down for good. As with horse racing, dog racing has been a slow decline over the years, but it’s still a very fun day out, even if you have no clue about the actual race itself. And it’s good to see these group-buying websites helping out struggling businesses to reach out to new audiences.
A pint in a pub already costs £2.50 (at least), so for this price you get your pint, free admission to the Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, as well as a free £2 bet (which, depending on your luck, might actually bring you a profit for the night!).
If you’ve never been dog racing before, this is a great opportunity to find out what it’s all about and experience it for the first time. Even if you end up not liking it, at least you had your money’s worth in beer, as well as a free £2 bet which might return something. And if Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium ever does shut down for good, at least you’ll never regret not having gone there!
