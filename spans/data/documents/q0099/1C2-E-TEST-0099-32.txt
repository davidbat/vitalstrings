A night at the dogs used to be as appealing as a trip down to the local Bridge club - but it's making a resurgence amongst the younger generation in the capital. It is especially popular with birthday parties and stag or hen parties - although for how much longer, it's anyone's guess, for dog racing is a dying breed. You wouldn't think it at the 6,000-capacity Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, however, which has just received a ?3.5 million facelift by the Greyhound Racing Association. With Walthamstow Greyhound Stadium now closed and sold to redevelopers, this is the most central venue for dog racing in London. There are race nights on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays and the Super Six Pack offers admission, a racecard, a drink, one Tote bet, a serving of food (typically scampi and chips) and a return visit voucher for just ?10.
