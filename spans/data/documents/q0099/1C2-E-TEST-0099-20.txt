Wimbledon Stadium staged its final speedway meeting  this week - after a        colourful history which stretches back 63 years.
 In        today’s South London Press John Hyam - who went to his first speedway        meeting in 1946 - looks back at the magical
moments which helped make Wimbledon one of speedway’s top clubs.   
 
THE lights dimmed on a south London sporting tradition this week when        Wimbledon staged its last speedway race.
After 63 years - interrupted on by World War Two between 1939 and 1945 -        the tapes have risen for the last time at
Plough Lane. Wimbledon’s was the sport’s oldest surviving speedway stadium        - although fittingly perhaps last Wednesday’s
visitors Belle Vue are speedway’s oldest club.
Both can trace their origins back to 1928, when the sport which started in        Australia, spread to this country.
But although Belle Vue started a few months before Wimbledon, they moved        to a new stadium in Manchester a couple
of years ago.
During the 1980s Wimbledon’s future was threatened on a handful of        occasions, but the sport survived.
This time though there is no knight in shining armour poised to bring a        speedway salvation at Plough Lane. At the end of
the month, the club will start racing on either Fridays or Sundays at        Eastbourne - a track owned by 1960s Dons’ rider
Bobby Dugard.
The Dugards have had links with Wimbledon since 1946, when Bobby’s father        Charlie had a brief spell in Dons’ colours. 
Ironically, Charlie’s Wimbledon career ended when he crashed with West Ham        rider George Bason. The accident left
both men with broken legs and happened only after they had been involved        in an exchange transfer deal.
For a couple of days before being sent home, they were in adjoining beds        at nearby St George’s Hospital.
In the late 1970s, Bobby’s younger brother Eric had a brief spell in        Wimbledon colours - on loan from Eastbourne, which had
been bought freehold by Charlie in 1947. 
Bobby has given Dons a special low rent to continue operations at the        Sussex track and they will be known as
‘Wimbledon at Eastbourne’ until the end of the season. The long term        future of the club depends on how things work out
during the next few months.
Wimbledon’s current troubles are a long way from the many years of        speedway that has thrilled, delighted and amazed
followers of the sport.  Some will say the rot at Plough Lane set in        when spectacular young Swede Tommy Jansson was killed while
competing in his homeland in a mid-1970s World Championship qualifying        round. Tommy was a real personality who drew
the fans, and after his death much of the magic and attendances went out        of meetings at Plough Lane   There are others
who will see speedway’s decline on the decision to switch from the high        standard British League, with its colourful
international stars, to the more domesticated National League in the        mid-1980s.
On the other hand, had the club not lowered its standards then, there may        not have been a further six seasons of racing at
Plough Lane.
Tommy Jansson’s death though was, in my opinion, the beginning of the end        for speedway at Wimbledon - even if it took 
some 15 more seasons for the end to finally arrive.
Tommy is not the only Wimbledon rider to have been killed on the track.  Back in 1937 Reg Vigor, who had been on loan to
Wimbledon’s nursery track at Bristol, died in a horrific smash.  And in        1952, Italian-American Ernie Roccio, a great crowd
pleaser was killed at West Ham.
Wimbledon have had links with American speedway riders since the        mid-1930s, when Miny Waln and Byrd McKinney
briefly raced for them in 1937. Then came the legendary Wilbur Lamoreaux,        one of the sport’s all-time greats. He was later
joined by New Yorker Benny Kaufmann - who could race as fast as he could        talk!  Also another familiar figure around
Plough Lane in the late 1930s was the dapper little Texan with the        Spanish-sounding name Manuel Trujillo, who is still
regarded as one of speedway’s most spectacular ever riders. And, unlike        his fellow North Americans who pioneered the
now conventional foot-forward style, Trujillo leg-trailed more        spectacularly than anyone else.
When speedway restarted in 1946 after the war, riders were pooled and        Wimbledon were allocated Oliver Hart, whose
legtrailing broadsiding skill was enough to lift one’s heart into the        mouth. Lloyd Goffe was another of the great, spectacular
legtrailers who carved a niche in Wimbledon colours in the post-war        seasons, before moving on for spells with Harringay and
St Austell. In 1947, Hart moved on to Bradford in a three-way transfer        that took Australian Bill Longley back to his pre-war
club New Cross and their star Les Wotton to Wimbledon.
