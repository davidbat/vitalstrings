was not keen on it at all not allowed to stand on the pit gate bend anymore so everyone is shoved into that bend above the toilets.so if your racing and want to watch a race after your one has finished you have a 5 min run to get back in to watch, cant see why they cant keep the same gate open in the pit area so once you have raced you can just nip in and take a look at the other formulas instead of trying to find your way around the rat run of the new set up.
when it was the old set up up you could smoke on the concrete steps or at the front near the fence but i noticed the security were pushing the smokers in front of the grandstand to smoke so if the smokers were on a bend they would have to walk in front of the grandstand to smoke the walk back.
BRING BACK SMOKING ON THE CONCRETE ANYWHERE,,MOST OF ALL PIT BEND CORNER AND THE GATE IN THE PITS TO PIT GATE CORNER.....
