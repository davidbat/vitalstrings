Internet Football Ground Guide - Plough Lane. Wimbledon
Plough Lane - Wimbledon
The last league game played at Plough Lane was in May 1991. It was first opened in 1912. The record attendance for the ground was 18,000 in 1935.
 As it was shortly before it was demolished in 2001:
Wandle End
South Stand
West Bank
If anyone can provide me with some photos of Plough Lane in it's heyday, then please e-mail me.
