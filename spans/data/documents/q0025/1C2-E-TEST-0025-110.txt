Read: Tuki Brando: from tragedy to top model
Tuki is joined by fellow stylish celebrity offspring Ethan Peck (the actor grandson of Gregory Peck), and Logan Plant (son of Robert Plant), for online men's fashion boutique, MRPORTER.COM's spring/summer 2012 ad campaign in which the three upstarts discuss the style legacy their famous ancestors bestowed upon them.
Ethan shares that his grandfather "taught me you can wear anything and be a gentleman" and that his "crispest" memory of Peck was sitting on his lap as a child with him wearing soft cashmere.
Tuki meanwhile reminisces about being in the swimming pool with his grandfather "talking about everything he saw in his life". It also seems Brando passed on some nuggets of wisdom to his young grandson, but, alas, they remain a mystery.
"He taught me how to [?] my abs in the swimming pool" says Tuki in his strong French accent.
We're going to have to open source this one I'm afraid as we've all drawn a blank. Did he teach him how to work his abs? Wash his abs? Watch his abs? Wurst his abs?
Whatever he taught him about his abs, it clearly worked. So long as Tuki doesn't follow his grandfather down the road of feeding Wurst to his abs, we predict a bright modelling future.
