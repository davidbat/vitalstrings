For obvious reasons - he died last July - Marlon Brando isn't on accused child molester Michael Jackson's star-glutted witness list.
But even if the legendary actor were alive and well, he might not have offered the strongest testimony for the defense.
According to a transcript of a taped 1993 interview with French-born cooks Philippe and Stella LeMarque, a married couple who spent 10 months in 1991 and 1992 on the staff of Jackson's Neverland Ranch, Brando was deeply troubled by the King of Pop's behavior with children.
"The only one who ever said something was Marlon Brando," Stella LeMarque said in an interview with freelance investigator Paul Barresi, according to a transcript provided by Barresi.
"He would come to the ranch and always see Michael playing, [and] disappear with the children," Stella went on. "Michael would never spend time with the adults who came to the ranch."
Philippe LeMarque added: "Brando didn't like it."
Stella continued: "He was the only one. ... He said, 'What the hell is Michael doing with those kids?' "
Barresi told me he ended up working for Jackson's defense team in the original molestation case, which was settled for a reported $15.3 million in January 1994.
For the past decade, Barresi said, the LeMarque tape has been in the possession of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. Last week, Barresi added, the tape was given to the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office, which is gathering prosecution evidence for the trial.
When I reached Philippe LeMarque - a potential witness for the prosecution - he declined to comment on Brando.
"I can't talk to you; I'm under the gag order," LeMarque told me in a brief conversation.
Meanwhile, Barresi's interview transcript indicates that while Brando was disturbed, Elizabeth Taylor was not.
"She never complained about it," Philippe told Barresi.
"Never," Stella agreed.
