Marlon Brando was, according to David Thomson, brilliant and a genius when it came to acting but, the reader is repeatedly told, not very smart intellectually. In fact he was rather dim. So dim that he didn't really understand his own films or indeed his own life. So it is a good job we have film critics like Thomson to explain how wrong about everything Brando was. For example, when Brando said his childhood was rather unhappy because both his parents were alcoholics he was mistaken. Why? Because when Thomson looks at Brando family photos young Marlon is (albeit in a rather dim way) always smiling.
The only evidence that Thomson gives for Brando's lack of intelligence is his academic failure at school. The fact that he was dyslexic (a condition which wasn't even known at the time) is dismissed out of hand as a possibly relevant factor. Elia Kazan, on the other hand, was a college graduate so obviously he can't be dim. No he is, instead, ugly - again the reader is told this repeatedly.
Brando's weight problems, another cause of constant sniping, also appear to be connected to his lack of intelligence because, apparently, he was too dim to realise that he should be seeing nutritionists rather than psychiatrists. Which brings me to my main objection to this book: the constant sneering at Brando as a self indulgent fool because he went to see psychiatrists. What is the self indulgence in a person with mental or emotional problems seeking professional help to overcome them?
I have always thought that Brando suffered from some form of Bipolar disorder (which is to a large extent genetic). If he did it would explain so many of the things that happened in his life. It is also a condition which is almost invariably associated with above average intelligence.
