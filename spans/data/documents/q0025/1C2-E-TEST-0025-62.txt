Relationships and family
 
In Songs My Mother Taught Me, Brando claimed he met         Marilyn Monroe at a party where she played piano,         unnoticed by anybody else there, and they had an         affair and maintained an intermittent relationship         for many years, receiving a telephone call from her         several days before she died. He also claimed         numerous other romances, although he did not discuss         his marriages, his wives, or his children in his         autobiography.
 
Brando married actress Anna Kashfi in 1957. Kashfi         was born in Calcutta and moved to Wales from India         in 1947. She is said to have been the daughter of a         Welsh steel worker of Irish descent, William         O'Callaghan, who had been superintendent on the         Indian State railways. However, in her book, Brando         for Breakfast, she claimed that she really is half         Indian and that the press incorrectly thought that         her stepfather, O'Callaghan, was her real father.         She said her real father was Indian and that she was         the result of an "unregistered alliance" between her         parents. Brando and Kashfi had a son, Christian         Brando, on May 11, 1958; they divorced in 1959.
 
In 1960, Brando married Movita Castaneda, a         Mexican-American actress seven years his senior;         they were divorced in 1962. Castaneda had appeared         in the first Mutiny on the Bounty film in 1935, some         27 years before the 1962 remake with Brando as         Fletcher Christian. They had two children together,         Miko Castaneda Brando (born 1961) and Rebecca Brando         (born 1966).
 
Tahitian actress Tarita Teriipia, who played his         love interest in Mutiny on the Bounty, became         Brando's third wife on August 10, 1962. She was 20         years old, 18 years younger than Brando, who was         reportedly delighted by her naiveté.[33] Because         Teriipia was a native French speaker, Brando became         fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews         in French.[34][35] Teriipia became the mother of two         of his children, Simon Teihotu Brando (born 1963)         and Tarita Cheyenne Brando. Brando also adopted         Teriipia's daughters Maimiti Brando (born 1977) and         Raiatua Brando (born 1982). Brando and Teriipia         divorced in July 1972.
 
Brando had a longterm relationship with his         housekeeper Maria Christina Ruiz, by whom he had         three children, Ninna Priscilla Brando (born May 13,         1989), Myles Jonathan Brando (born January 16,         1992), and Timothy Gahan Brando (born January 6,         1994). He had four more children by unidentified         women, Stefano Brando (born 1967),[36][37] Dylan         Brando (born 1968), Angelique Brando, and Michael         Gilman (born 1967; adopted by longtime Brando friend         Sam Gilman). Brando also adopted Petra Brando-Corval         (born 1972), the daughter of his assistant Caroline         Barrett and novelist James Clavell.
 
Tuki Brando, one of Brando's numerous grandchildren,         is a famous Tahitian fashion model in his own right.         Brando's grandchildren also include Michael Brando         (b. 1988), son of Christian Brando, in addition to         Prudence Brando, and Shane Brando, children of Miko         C. Brando, the three children of Teihotu Brando,[38]         and many others. Courtney Love claimed to be the         granddaughter of Marlon Brando.[39] The current         exact number of Brando's descendents is unknown.
 
Death of Dag Drollet
 
In May 1990, Dag Drollet, the Tahitian lover of         Brando's daughter Cheyenne, died of a gunshot wound         after a confrontation with Cheyenne's half-brother         Christian at the family's hilltop home above Beverly         Hills. Christian, then 31 years old, claimed he was         drunk and the shooting was accidental. After heavily         publicized pre-trial proceedings, Christian pleaded         guilty to voluntary manslaughter and use of a gun.         He was sentenced to ten years in prison. Before the         sentence, Brando delivered an hour of testimony, in         which he said he and his former wife had failed         Christian. He commented softly to members of the         Drollet family: "I'm sorry... If I could trade         places with Dag, I would. I'm prepared for the         consequences." Afterward, Drollet's father, Jacques,         said he thought Brando was acting and his son was "getting away with murder." The tragedy was         compounded in 1995, when Cheyenne, suffering from         lingering effects of a serious car accident and said         to still be depressed over Drollet's death,         committed suicide by hanging herself in Tahiti.         Christian Brando died of pneumonia at age 49, on         January 26, 2008.
 
Lifestyle
 
Marlon Brando earned a "bad boy" reputation for his         public outbursts and antics. According to Los         Angeles magazine, "Brando was rock and roll before         anybody knew what rock and roll was".[40] His         behavior during the filming of Mutiny on the Bounty         (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a         difficult star. He was blamed for a change in         director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed         responsibility for either. On June 12, 1973, Brando         broke paparazzo Ron Galella's jaw. Galella had         followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show         host Dick Cavett, after a taping of The Dick Cavett         Show in New York City. He reportedly paid a $40,000         out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected         hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the         next time he photographed Brando at a gala         benefiting the American Indians Development         Association.
 
Brando was bisexual, and said in an interview with         Gary Carey, for his 1976 biography The Only         Contender, "Homosexuality is so much in fashion it         no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I,         too, have had homosexual experiences and I am not         ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what         people think about me. But if there is someone who         is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers,         may they continue to do so. I find it amusing."[41]
 
The filming of Mutiny on the Bounty affected         Brando's life in a profound way, as he fell in love         with Tahiti and its people. He bought a         twelve-island atoll, Tetiaroa, which he intended to         make partly an environmental laboratory and partly a         resort. Brando eventually had a now-closed hotel         built on Tetiaroa, which went through many redesigns         as a result of changes demanded by Brando over the         years.[42] His son Simon is the only inhabitant of         Tetiaroa. Brando was an active ham radio operator,         with the call signs KE6PZH and FO5GJ (the latter         from his island). He was listed in the Federal         Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin         Brandeaux to preserve his privacy.[43]
 
Final years and death
 
Brando's notoriety, his troubled family life, and         his obesity attracted more attention than his late         acting career. He gained a great deal of weight in         the 1980s and by the mid 1990s he weighed over 300         lbs. (136 kg) and suffered from diabetes. Like Orson         Welles or Elvis Presley, he had a history of weight         fluctuations through his career, attributed to his         years of stress-related overeating followed by         compensatory dieting. He also earned a reputation         for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or         unable to memorize his lines and less interested in         taking direction than in confronting the film         director with odd demands. Brando also dabbled with         some innovation in his last years. Brando had         several patents issued in his name from the U.S.         Patent and Trademark Office, all of which involve a         method of tensioning drum heads, in June 2002 –         November 2004. For example, see U.S. Patent         6,812,392 and its equivalents.
 
The actor was a longtime close friend of entertainer         Michael Jackson and paid regular visits to his         Neverland Ranch, resting there for weeks at a time.         Brando also participated in the singer's two-day         solo career thirtieth-anniversary celebration         concerts in 2001, and starred in his 13-minute-long         music video, "You Rock My World," in the same year.         The actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's bodyguard and         assistant for several years, and was a friend of the         singer. He stated "The last time my father left his         house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time...         was with Michael Jackson. He loved it... He had a         24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help,         24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service."[44] On         Jackson's 30th anniversary concert, Brando gave a         speech to the audience on humanitarian work which         received a poor reaction from the audience and was         unaired.
 
On July 1, 2004, Brando died, aged 80. He left         behind eleven children as well as over thirty         grandchildren. The cause of death was intentionally         withheld, his lawyer citing privacy concerns. It was         later revealed that he had died at UCLA Medical         Center of respiratory failure brought on by         pulmonary fibrosis. He also suffered from congestive         heart failure,[45] failing eyesight caused by         diabetes, and liver cancer.[46] Shortly before his         death and despite needing an oxygen mask to breathe,         he recorded his voice to appear in The Godfather:         The Game, once again as Don Vito Corleone. However,         due to his health problems his voice was too weak to         be used in the game.
 
Karl Malden, Brando's fellow actor in A Streetcar         Named Desire, On The Waterfront, and One-Eyed Jacks         (the only film directed by Brando), talks in a         documentary accompanying the DVD of A Streetcar         Named Desire about a phone call he received from         Brando shortly before Brando's death. A distressed         Brando told Malden he kept falling over. Malden         wanted to come over, but Brando put him off telling         him there was no point. Three weeks later, Brando         was dead. Shortly before his death, Brando had         apparently refused permission for tubes carrying         oxygen to be inserted into his lungs, which, he was         told, was the only way to prolong his life.
 
Brando was cremated, and his ashes were put in with         those of his childhood friend Wally Cox and another         longtime friend Sam Gilman.[47] They were then         scattered partly in Tahiti and partly in Death         Valley.[48]
 
In 2007, a 165-minute biopic of Brando, Brando: The         Documentary, produced by Mike Medavoy (the executor         of Brando's will) for Turner Classic Movies, was         released.[49]
 
Politics
 
In 1946, Brando showed his dedication to the Jewish         desire for a homeland by performing in Ben Hecht's         Zionist play "A Flag is Born." Brando's involvement         had an impact on three of the most contentious         issues of the early postwar period: the fight to         establish a Jewish state, the smuggling of Holocaust         survivors to Israel, and the battle against racial         segregation in the United States.
 
Brando attended some fundraisers for John F. Kennedy         in the 1960 presidential election.
 
In August 1963, Brando participated in the March on         Washington along with fellow celebrities Harry         Belafonte, James Garner, Charlton Heston, Burt         Lancaster, and Sidney Poitier.[50] Brando also,         along with Paul Newman, participated in the freedom         rides.
 
In the aftermath of the 1968 slaying of Dr. Martin         Luther King Jr., Brando made one of the strongest         commitments to furthering Dr. King's work. Shortly         after Dr. King's death, Brando announced that he was         bowing out of the lead role of a major film (The         Arrangement) which was about to begin production, in         order to devote himself to the civil rights         movement. "I felt I’d better go find out where it         is; what it is to be black in this country; what         this rage is all about," Brando said on the late         night ABC-TV Joey Bishop Show.
 
The actor's participation in the African-American         civil rights movement actually began well before         King's death. In the early 1960s Brando contributed         thousands of dollars to both the Southern Christian         Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to a         scholarship fund established for the children of         slain Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers. By         this time, Brando was already involved in films that         carried messages about human rights: Sayonara, which         addressed interracial romance, and The Ugly         American, depicting the conduct of US officials         abroad and its deleterious effect on the citizens of         foreign countries. For a time Brando was also         donating money to the Black Panther Party and         considered himself a friend of founder Bobby         Seale.[51] However, Brando ended his financial         support for the group over his perception of its         increasing radicalization, specifically a passage in         a Panther pamphlet put out by Eldridge Cleaver         advocating indiscriminate violence, "for the         Revolution."
 
At the 1973 Academy Awards ceremony, Brando refused         to accept the Oscar for his performance in The         Godfather. Sacheen Littlefeather represented Mr.         Brando at the ceremony. She appeared in full Apache         clothing. She stated that owing to the "poor         treatment of Native Americans in the film industry" Mr. Brando would not accept the award.[52] At this         time the 1973 standoff at Wounded Knee occurred,         causing rising tensions between the government and         Native American activists. The event grabbed the         attention of the US and the world media. This was         considered a major event and victory for the         movement by its supporters and participants.
 
Outside of his film work, Brando not only appeared         before the California Assembly in support of a fair         housing law, but personally joined picket lines in         demonstrations protesting discrimination in housing         developments.
