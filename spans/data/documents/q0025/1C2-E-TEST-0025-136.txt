Youth and early acting career
Brando was born in Omaha, Nebraska . In 1935 his parents separated, and his mother moved with her three children to Santa Ana, California . In 1937 his parents reconciled, and the family moved to Libertyville, Illinois , north of Chicago . He was of Dutch , French and Irish stock; the original family name was Brandeau. His mother, a kind and talented woman with a drinking problem , was involved in local theater, and this first interested him in stage acting . Brando was a gifted mimic from early childhood and developed a rare ability to absorb the tics and mannerisms of people he played and to display those traits dramatically while staying in character.
Brando had a tumultuous childhood, in which he was expelled from several schools. His father was largely critical of his son, but encouraged him to seek his own direction. Brando left Illinois for New York City , where he studied at the American Theatre Wing Professional School , New School Dramatic Workshop, and the Actors' Studio . It was at the New School's Dramatic Workshop that he studied with Stella Adler and learned the revolutionary techniques of the Stanislavski System .
Brando used his Stanislavski System skills in summer-stock roles in Sayville, New York . He was expelled from his acting school in Sayville but was discovered in another play there and then made it to Broadway in the bittersweet drama, I Remember Mama, in 1944 . Critics voted him "Broadway's Most Promising Actor" for his role as an anguished, paraplegic veteran in Truckline Cafï¿½, although the play was a commercial failure. He achieved real stardom, however, as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947 , directed by Elia Kazan . Brando sought out that role, driving out to Provincetown, Massachusetts where Williams was spending the summer to audition for the part. Williams recalled that he opened the screen door and knew, instantly, that he had his Stanley Kowalski.

On the screen
Brando's first screen role was the bitter crippled veteran in The Men in 1950 .  True to his method, Brando spent a month in bed at a veterans' hospital to prepare for the role.
He made a much larger impression the following year when he brought his performance as Stanley Kowalski to the screen in Kazan's adaptation of "Streetcar" in 1951 . He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for that role, and again in each of the next three years for his roles in Viva Zapata! in 1952 , Julius Caesar in 1953 and On the Waterfront in 1954 .
Brando finally won the Oscar for his role of Terry Malloy in On The Waterfront. Under Kazan's direction, and with a talented ensemble around him, Brando used his Stanislavski System training and improvisational skills to produce a performance that continues to display new facets on each viewing. Brando claimed that he improvised much of his dialogue with Rod Steiger in the famous, much-quoted scene with him in the back of a taxicab (Kazan disputed this).
Brando followed that triumph by a variety of roles in the 1950s that defied expectations: as Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls , where he managed to carry off a singing role; as Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar Japan in The Teahouse of the August Moon ; as an Air Force officer in Sayonara , and a Nazi officer in The Young Lions. While he won an Oscar nomination for his acting in Sayonara, his acting had lost much of its energy and direction by the end of the 1950s.
Brando's star sank even further in the 1960s as he turned in increasingly uninspired performances in Mutiny on the Bounty and several other forgettable films. Though even at this professional low point, Brando still managed to produce a few exceptional films; such as One-Eyed Jacks , a western that would be the only film Brando would ever direct as well as Burn! which Brando would later claim as his personal favourite of his movies.  Nonetheless, his career had gone into almost complete eclipse by the end of the decade thanks to his reputation as a difficult star and his record in overbudget or marginal movies.
