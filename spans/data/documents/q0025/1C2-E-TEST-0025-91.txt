BIOGRAPHY
Dying as one of the world's truly fat men and more prominent eccentrics, Marlon Brando's behavior in later life nearly overshadowed his earlier standard for postwar actors; a standard against which he often came up wanting.  But during his glory period, from 1950 to 1972, he did manage to stamp himself the greatest screen actor of all time.
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Brando had two sisters and alcoholic parents.  His father was frequently absent and his mother, who was artistically inclined, was often broken down drunk.  In 1943, after being expelled from high school and failing to join the army because of a damaged knee, he moved to New York with his sisters, partly to strike out on his own and partly to show up his father's low expectations for his future.
Enrolling in drama workshops at the New School, he was mentored by Stella Adler, who was then applying Stanislavsky technique and emphasizing an actor's ability to draw on important emotional experiences to imbue performances with authenticity.  Undertaking the "Method," perhaps not as his true style but as a guiding influence, Brando made his Broadway debut in 1944 in I Remember Mama; terrific reviews brought him Hollywood invitations, which he declined due to the limitations of long-term contracts.
After six years, though, he relented and made his feature debut in The Men (1950), a story about paraplegic soldiers.  Thereafter he forsook the stage for the screen and offered some of the most remarkable, galvanizing, and difficult performances any actor had yet presented to audiences.  Titles in the early 1950s alone include A Streetcar Named Desire (1951); his first Oscar nomination, Viva Zapata! (1952); Julius Caesar (1953); The Wild One (1953); and On the Waterfront (1954), his first Oscar for Best Actor.  From 1955 to 1962, Brando was box-office gold.  Importantly, he was also among the best-paid actors in the industry, setting new records for a single-picture salary with a staggering $1.25 million payout for Mutiny on the Bounty in 1962.  The pressure generated by this high commercial esteem, combined with the license generally granted him as the recognized pioneer of "acting as serious craft," meant that he started behaving erratically.  Such behavior led to the breakdown of productions (One-Eyed Jacks, 1961), hurt feelings among collaborators, and an overall sense that Brando was wasting himself in the pursuit of varied appetites - food and women foremost among them - and not in the further development of his prodigious talents.
Reviving the Brando "brand"
This critical attitude took firm hold with a batch of commercial flops in the 1960s (The Ugly American, 1963; The Chase, 1966).  Then Brando was reborn in Francis Ford Coppola 's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather (1972), which made his Don Corleone an instant icon and winner of another Oscar and a Golden Globe .  Brando annoyed many of his Hollywood peers by refusing to accept this Academy Award .  Even so, 1972 may be best remembered for his most significant performance of all, in Ultimo tango a Parigi (Last Tango in Paris).
In his final years, he worked sporadically in often laughable, extraordinarily overpaid roles ( Superman , 1978; The Formula, 1980; Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, 1992; The Island of Dr. Moreau, 1996), alongside a few gems that acknowledged his age and outsider status (The Missouri Breaks, 1976; Apocalypse Now, 1979; The Freshman, 1990), and he even did one star turn in the TV miniseries Roots (1979).  But the main theme running through his last decade, which included the much-publicized death of his daughter, is waste.
By recognizing the frustrating choices and habits of genius, we also have to acknowledge that Brando's truly earth-shattering influence over the performance arts is real.  As standard bearer, he developed space not just for a distinctly American school of acting, but also for a distinctly American kind of manhood, one that combined masculine and feminine traits with class consciousness.
The Myth of Brando
Marlon Brando is widely recognized to be one of the greatest screen actors who has ever lived.  By the age of thirty his style had revolutionized American acting.
Many of his iconic characters - Stanley Kowalski and Don Corleone, among others - achieved this status as a result of Brando's improvisation on set.  He was the role model for the likes of James Dean , Paul Newman , and Robert Redford , and the standard by which all U.S. actors are measured.  Here are some of the things that have been said about the great man:
- "He gave us our freedom." - Jack Nicholson on Brando, the "Method," and his astonishing impact on acting styles.
- "He loves the light! See how the light shines through him?...I shouldn't be partial, but he is my favorite one." - Playwright Tennessee Williams.
- "I wanted either an Italian-American or an actor who's so great that he can portray an Italian-American.  So, they said, "Who do you suggest?" I said, 'Lookit, I don't know, but who are the two greatest actors in the world? Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando...[And] Brando is my hero of heroes.  I'd do anything to just meet him." - Francis Ford Coppola on casting the Godfather.
- "He and I had much in common.  He too had made many enemies.  He too is a perfectionist." - Bette Davis , thrilled that a like-minded being had won an Oscar.
