THE GODFATHER
MARLON BRANDO
Critically Marlon Brando is considered as the most important actor in modern American Cinema. He is widely considered as one of the greatest and most influential actors of the 20th century. Brando had a significant impact on film acting, and was the foremost example of the  “method” acting  style. He initially gained popularity for recreating the role as  Stanley Kowalski  in  A Streetcar Named Desire  (1951), his other iconic roles include  On the Waterfront  (1954) and  my favourit Brando film, rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in  The Wild One  (1953). His later work included the Godfather ,   Apocalypse Now  (1979) and a cameo in  (1978) Superman. Brando wasnt just a great actor, he had charm and a swagger different from the other actors. His on screen presence and style was  cool, relaxed and rebellious.
Few men have had as much of an impact on cinema and celebrity as Brando did.  In addition, he also cultivated a sophisticated, classy 1950s look for himself that men today still strive to achieve. His style was effortless and he pulled it off well. Brando and James Dean are perhaps the only two people who could pull off the effertless, cool and rebellious style.
His style was Tailored Suit On the red carpet, in his movies, White Tee On his casual days, Plaid Scarf and  Button-down Shirt.  Marlon Brando made looking cool effortless, if any guy is attempting the effortless cool look, not no further than Marlon Brando, a true style icon.
