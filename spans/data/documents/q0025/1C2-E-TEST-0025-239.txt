Marlon Brando, Jr. (April 3, 1924 – July 1, 2004) was an Oscar-winning American actor who is widely regarded as one of the greatest film actors of the 20th century. He brought the techniques of either the Stanislavski System or method acting (commonly mistaken for the same acting technique) to prominence in the films A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront, both directed by Elia Kazan in the early 1950s. His acting style, combined with his public persona as an outsider uninterested in the Hollywood of the early 1950s, had a profound effect on a generation of actors that would come after him.
Brando was also an activist, lending his presence to many issues, including the American Indian Movement.
