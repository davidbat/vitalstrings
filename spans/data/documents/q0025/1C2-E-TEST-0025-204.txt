Critics’ Picks Video: ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’
By MEKADO MURPHY
In this week’s Critics’ Picks video, A. O. Scott considers Elia Kazan’s film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams  play “ A Streetcar Named Desire .” He discusses how Marlon Brando ‘s performance as Stanley Kowalski both on Broadway and in the film shifted the focus of the work away from the character of Blanche DuBois and on to Stanley, and signaled the arrival of Method acting. “It was based on emotional intuition, psychological exploration and the search for a character’s inner truth,” Mr. Scott says.
We would like your thoughts on  Brando’s acting in this film and others. What do you consider to be his best performance?
