BRANDO
by              Maggie Van Ostrand
April              3 is Marlon Brando's birthday and, if you ask any actor, it should              be declared a national holiday.
Brando was the best film actor this country has ever produced. He              was a river of talent, itself producing great tributaries: McQueen,              Dean, Nicholson, Newman, DiNiro, Pacino, and it looks as if Edward              Norton and Kiefer Sutherland might eventually join their ranks.
As a movie fan and one-time trivia expert in the field of motion pictures,              I've seen hundreds of films of all genres, through all generations,              and all societal trends, and no actor has what Brando had. Julie Harris              said that he tried to destroy his immense gift because he didn't know what to do with it. She said he could eat himself into a huge size,              he could denigrate acting, he could choose bad pictures to make, but              still, he could not destroy his immense talent.
Never in the history of movies has a presence been as intense as Brando's.              Never has an actor been so "present," and never has an actor been              so creative as Brando. When he's onscreen, try to keep your eyes on              anyone else. You just can't. Sure, he sometimes upstaged and could              be a pain in the ass, but he never did it when he respected the story.              Sure, he often refused to learn his lines, but he explained to Francis              Ford Coppola during The Godfather that it was a necessary part of              his naturalistic acting style. "You said you liked me in Waterfront,              right?" Brando argued. "Well I'm doing the same thing now that I did              then. Real people don't know what they're going to say. Their words              often come as a surprise to them. That's how it should be in a movie."              John Huston also agreed that Brando's seeming failure to memorize              lines was really responsible for his enormous gift of spontaniety.
From              the moment Brando first trod the boards in Truckline Cafe, he was              the focal point and elicited raves for his five-minute bit. When Elia              "Gadge" Kazan, who had seen Brando in Truckline, suggested to Tennessee              Williams that Brando play Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire              and sent Brando to Connecticut to meet the playwright, it changed              the entire concept of the play. Originally, Stanley was to have been              considerably older and more of a brute but when Tennessee met Brando,              he phoned Kazan "... in a voice near hysteria. Brando had overwhelmed              him," said Kazan in his autobiography, A Life.

Elia Kazan: A Life
Jessica Tandy,              a talented stage and screen actress, was cast as the original Blanche              DuBois. Kazan states in his book: "My secretary has dug up research              in which Jessie is quoted as saying Brando was 'an impossble, psychopathic              bastard.' There may have been days when she felt that, but there were              more days when she felt what everyone else in the cast felt, admiration              for the scorching power of this man-boy.... and that she had to be              very good indeed to hold stage with Marlon." When Tandy's husband,              character actor Hume Cronyn, came to Kazan and asked "Don't give up              on her. Keep after her. She can do it," Kazan thought perhaps Hume              meant that by contrast with Marlon, whose every word seemed not something              memorized but the spontaneous expression of an intense inner experience              -- which is the level of work all actors strive to reach ... was that              enough for this play?... Hers seemed to be a performance; Marlon was              living on stage... Marlon, working "from the inside," rode his emotion              wherever it took him; his performance was full of surprises and exceeded              what Williams and I had expected."
Brando              himself preferred the screen version of Streetcar to the stage version.              He said Vivien Leigh was a better Blanche, a "broken flower," and              held the sympathies of the audience equal to Stanley. That made, he              said, a better balance.
Fans              and critics alike assumed Brando was really like the mumbling Stanley              Kowalski and all were therefore stunned at his performance as Marc              Antony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, directed by Joe Mankiewicz.              By enunciating perfect English, after much diligent studying of the              vocal cadences and pronounciations of classical actors like Barrymore,              Olivier and Gielgud, opinions had to be revised. He was so good, that              John Gielgud, who played Cassius in the film, invited him to come              to England to costar with Paul Scofield in a classical season that              he was planning to direct at Hammersmith. "I do remember begging him              to play Hamlet," Gielgud later expained. "He said he had no wish to              act in the theater again."

For              Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Brando realized he would have to deny              his Method acting style. "I realize now that you've got to play the              text," Brando said. "You can't play under it, or above it, or around              it, as we do in contemporary theater. The text is everything."
"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears," he leaned into it,              as the extras fell silent. The speech went on unbroken for its thirty-four              lines, Brando's voice rising like a torrent until reaching its climax.              With the director's "Cut!" nobody moved. Then from every corner of              MGM's stage 24, the crew burst into applause. "I felt a fucking chill              go up my spine," Mankiewicz recalled. "It was the greatest moment              I have ever felt as a director ... It's what made [my] whole career              worthwhile."

Brando              chose his next movie because it satisfied his social conscience, says              Peter Manso in his book, Brando: The Biography. It would prove to              be the coming of age of an entire generation, and cause the establishment              to recoil. It was Stanley Kramer's The Wild One, based on the true              story of a leather-jacketed motorcycle gang that had terrorized a              small town. One line made cultural history. When Brando's character,              Johnnie Strabler, was asked "What are you rebelling against?" he replied              simply, "What've ya got?"
An example of Brando's improvisational genius is the scene in which              he sits at the lunch counter about to be waited on by Mary Murphy's              character. He puts a quarter on the counter and as she reaches for              it, he pulls it back, taunting her, then pushes it towards her again,              playing, teasing. There's something inherently sensual in Brando's              action, not only to Murphy, but to the entire audience.

The Wild One
On              The Waterfront, directed by Kazan, certainly deserves mention here,              not only as Brando's first Oscar-winning performance (he was nominated              eight times, won twice) but as another outstanding example of his              improvisational work. Written by Budd Schulberg and directed by Elia              Kazan, Brando's favorite director at the time, Brando was happily              surrounded with Actors Studio pals: Karl Malden who had appeared with              him in Truckline, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam and Rudy Bond. Roger              Donoghue, former light heavyweight boxer, was hired to tutor Brando              in the art of prizefighting so that, as former boxer Terry Malloy,              he would more easily adopt a fighter's attitude and even a fighter's              walk. He and Brando practiced at Stillman's Gym, at the Actors Studio,              and on Hoboken rooftops. Donoghue picked up on Brando's concentration              and attention to the smallest detail. The boxer recalled, "Whenever              I'd vary my footwork, he noticed it right away.... He was terrific,              but I realized he was always studying me."
Brando, dressed as Terry Malloy in a plaid jacket, rode the subway              to work for even more authenticity. He missed nothing. It was so freezing              cold on that New Jersey waterfront production that Brando joked it was "too cold to overact." Eva Marie Saint wore thermal underwear.              Saint, new to motion pictures in 1953, described what it was like              for her to do a scene with Brando: "He was very seductive, and I remember              ending up dancing with him. In those days we wore full skirts and              leather belts, and I remember he took my skirt and went whoosh, like              spinning me around in order to fan it out after the dance. The hem              of the skirt just kind of whipped around. I remember crying, because              it was very emotional. Whatever Kazan saw that convinced him to cast              me, Marlon had provoked it in me. I would have had to work for weeks              with another actor to get what we got, because like Kazan, he knew              how to touch certain buttons."
Brando's genius was again apparent in the glove scene with Saint.              "The glove scene happened," she explained, "because I actually accidentally              dropped the glove. When Marlon picked it up and put it on his hand,              that became the catalyst for me to stay in the scene. Before, I'd              felt awkward, dishonest, wondering why I was talking to him, thinking              I ought to just walk off. Once he had the glove, i wanted it back,              so there was a reason for me to stay."
Manso's book describes Brando's inventiveness. "In the bar, as she              questions Terry about her brother's death, she elicited the same unspoken              gentleness, something so deep, so melancholy and untutored that her              openness is the only response possible. ... what made it work in front              of the camera was Marlon's understanding that one character's innocence              could only be the reciprocal of the other's."
At              the approach of the famous taxicab scene with his brother Charley,              played by Rod Steiger, Brando expressed his unhappiness to Schulberg.              "I just can't do it, I just can't." "Why?" demanded Schulberg, who              was proud of the scene. "I can't. the scene won't work. ... If someone              has a gun, if somebody actually ... like Charley pulls a gun on me,              actually has a gun, I'm not going to say all those things. I can't              have all that to say, 'I could have been this or I could have been              that.' I can't say all that if somebody is aiming a gun at me." Kazan              said, "Look why don't you just reach out and put the gun down? Then              could you say it?" Brando nodded. "Yes, then I could say it fine."              In this scene, Brando's problem of interpretation solved, he had never              been so fluent, so in command of his body. Inside the mock-up cab,              he responded to Steiger's weapon with an ensemble of tiny movements              consisting of his eyes, the roll of his head, the slope of his shoulders,              and even the lift of his lip, all of it mirroring a pain and surprise              more telling than the agonized "Wow" that follows.

The body language              is inspired, as is the agonized pause before he launches into the              unforgettable "contender" lines that subvert the gun. The phrasing              was exquisite, the modulation, accent, and pacing all flawless. He              delivered the lines as if he'd shrunk into himself.
In Kazan's words, "I've been highly praised for the direction of this              scene, but the truth is I didn't direct it ... the extraordinary element              in that scene and in the whole picture was Brando, and what was extraordinary              about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front              and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other              actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something              shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the              gentleness of a caress? Who else could read "Oh, Charlie!" in a tone              of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests that              terrific depth of pain? I didn't direct that; Marlon showed me, as              he often did, how the scene should be performed. I could never have              told him how to do that scene as well as he did it."
In              Patricia Bosworth's biography, Marlon Brando, she talks about interviewing              people in a School for the Deaf. When asked who was their favorite              actor, one hundred per cent of the people answered, "Marlon Brando!"              When asked why, they said, "It doesn't matter that we can't hear him.              We know what he's feeling just the same."
I talked with John Huston in the mid-80s at the American Film Institute's              Lifetime Achievement Award honoring him. A small, portable oxygen              tank at his side did not deter him from affectionately talking about              Reflections in a Golden Eye, which he believed was one of his (Huston's)              best. He talked about Brando's amazing presence and mentioned asking              him at the beginning of the shoot if he could ride a horse. Brando              said yes. But, said Huston, Brando was so nervous around the horse              that even Elizabeth Taylor, a superb horsewoman, began to feel fear.              It wasn't till long after the scene where the spooked horse runs off              wildly, Brando clinging to his back, terror evident on his wind-whipped              face, that Huston realized, of course Brando knew how to ride (Viva              Zapata! One-Eyed Jacks, The Appaloosa) but the character he was portraying,              Major Weldon Penderson, an uptight army officer with repressed homosexual              desires, was terrified of horses.

Brando's              concentration and total immersion were legendary. So were his scene-stealing              habits of using whatever was at hand to clarify his character. Remember              the gray cat Brando stroked while supplicants asked him for favors              on his daughter's wedding day in The Godfather? Didn't that indicate              the Don's soft side better than any dialog could have? The cat purred              so loudly, it covered the dialog and Brando had to do some looping              at the end of filming. Coppola said that Brando had many great ideas              and every one he used improved the picture. It was Brando's idea to              have the godfather slap the singer, Johnny Fontaine, because singer              Al Martino, playing the role, was not giving the desired reaction.              The reason Martino's reaction finally looked perfect was because he              was actually dazed by Brando's unexpected slap.
The Godfather's producer, Al Ruddy, said he was impressed with those              improvised turns that lent the powerful and ruthless don a gentler              side. "It's in those little shticks of the godfather that you get              the totality of the film as well as the character. It was Brando who              came up with them. Like stopping to smell a rose between the first              part of his line, 'After all, we're not murderers,' and the second,              'whatever that undertaker thinks." (I reran the film yesterday, and              he smelled the rose after the entire line and not in the middle.)
Brando was revered by other actors, who regarded him as a god and              who became so awestruck when he came onstage that they practically              turned to stone. Brando took time to put them at ease, sometimes joking              and sometimes mooning. In the scene in The Godfather where Don Vito              Corleone comes home from the hospital and his stretcher must be carried              upstairs, Brando had the prop department load the stretcher down with              300 pounds of hidden extra weight, and even Coppola, despite the added              cost, had to laugh at the straining actors trying to lift the don.
The don's death scene was also made memorable by Brando's idea of              cutting an orange peel and putting it in his mouth to "frighten" his              little grandson in order to elicit the desired reaction for the camera.              Prior to this, the boy playing the grandson simply was unable to adequately              animate. That scene is arguably the one best remembered by most fans.

Few actors have              such charisma, talent, and technical proficiency as Brando. This last              impressed even the great cinematographer, Gordon Willis, on The Godfather.              In the Manso book, Willis says "He was entirely cooperative. His concern              -- and rightly so -- was that with all that age makeup on, he had              to be lighted properly or it would look like shit. I knew that if I simply put light directly in front of him, the effect of the makeup              would be neutralized. So I had to come up with the kind of lighting              that would not only be right for him, but also right for the rest              of the movie. I explained this and he immediately understood. He seemed              to have an intuitive grasp of what had to be done technically and              how to function within those limitations."
Before each take, Brando even asked Willis which lens would be used              and how much of his body would be appearing in the frame. "He was              aware of having to determine how big or small the field size of the              screen would be," said Willis, "and he adjusted his movements accordingly.              From that first makeup and lighting test, I saw that he had a very              attuned sense of visual containment."
Last              Tango in Paris illustrates more fully the genius of Brando's improvisational              work. It is the closest thing to actually getting Brando to talk about              himself in depth, something not even his closest friends were privy              to. This Bernardo Bertolucci film was extremely daring at the time              and set the critics atwitter with praise and amazement. The presence              of Brando kept Tango, Oscar nominated despite an NC 17 rating (for              explicit sexual content) from being considered pornography. No other              major star of Brando's caliber would have dared to so expose himself,              not only physically, but psychically. His on-screen reminiscenses,              in the character of expatriate Paul, are anecdotes from Brando's own              unhappy childhood, and the dialog Paul speaks at the coffin of his              dead wife, eerily expresses Brando's feelings at the passing of his              beloved mother, Dorothy Pennebaker Brando.

It doesn't              seem that Brando had much happiness in his life, due to failed marriages,              troubled children, and bad business judgment, and he might not have              completely pleased colleagues who felt strongly that his gift should              be honed on the stage, and that he had "sold out" to the big money              studios. There is some truth to this, which fits his self-destructiveness.              Unlike today's celebrities (a celeb being far different from a star)              who are often dipsos and dopers, Brando, son of two alcoholics, chose              food instead, like Elvis. He also got himself involved in some pretty              awful movies in order to pay off debts of alimony, lawsuits and ecological              research on his private island near Tahiti.
It's usually interesting and sometimes pleasurable to view and review              current films; yet if I want to be surprised, stunned, and inspired,              I return to the genius of Brando.
