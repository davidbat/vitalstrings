Style Icon : Marlon Brando
With James Dean , Marlon Brando is one of the Hollywoodian stars who became famous in the fifties and now considered as legends.
Member of the Actor Studio, Marlon Brando has a very long filmography : Mutiny on the Bounty, Julius Caesar, Apocalypse now…
But it is with his performances inThe wild one, A streetcar named desire, On the waterfront and The Godfather that his style was the most remarkable.
A streetcar named desire
Inspired by the play by Tennessee Williams, A streetcar named desire is the movie which made  Marlon Brando a star… And a sex symbol.
Simply dressed with a white or light grey tee-shirt or with atight-fitting tank top, he plays a violent and rough, but sensual character who drives his sister-in-law crazy, with Vivien Leigh as Blanche Dubois.
He became the embodiment of manhood.
White Tee-shirt, 100% cotton
The wild one
One of the most memorable Marlon Brando’s looks was taken out of this 1953 movie, inspired by a true story.
While playing arebel biker leading a gang, Marlon Brando wears a leather jacket, a cap, leather gloves, and a denim rolled up over his boots.
Try to look wild, lean nonchalantly on a bike : here you go, you look just like Brando.
Leather boots
On the waterfront
A new Elia Kazan – Marlon Brando collaboration, with the docks of New York as background, where a rebellion takes place.
The movie is awarded with 8 oscars, 1954.
Marlon Brando wears a checked jacket in an “American worker” style.
Out of the film set
OK, we have seen striped shirts over and over this whole summer…
But why wouldn’t we take the horizontal stripes out of the closets this fall again, and wear them with a basic blazer and light trousers ?
The result is a very chic yet casual look : gentleman on the seaside.
Approved by Marlon Brando ! (and what is good for Marlon is good for you !)
