Josh Brolin has admitted to once checking out Scientology in what he called a “moment of real desperation,” RadarOnline.com has learned.  But he decided it wasn’t for him after witnessing what he described as a “bizarre” scene of John Travolta performing a hands-on healing of Marlon Brando.
The anecdote is part of an extraordinary story about Scientology in the current issue of The New Yorker .

Most of the article is about acclaimed producer/director/writer Paul Haggis’ decision to quit Scientology after 34 years; a public falling out that RadarOnline.com reported last year.
Brolin  recalled that as he was checking out Scientology he went to the  Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles and took part in “auditing” sessions.

He was then included in a dinner party where John Travolta and Marlon Brando were also guests.  Brando arrived with a painful cut on his leg, Brolin  said, and Travolta offered to help, saying he’d just “reached a new  level” of Scientology.  He put his hand over the injured area and Brando  closed his eyes.
“I watched this process going on – it was very  physical,” Brolin recounted.  “I was thinking, ‘this is f**king  bizarre!’  Then after 10 minutes, Brando opens his eyes and says, ‘That  really helped’.”
Travolta’s rep told the magazine the incident never happened but Brolin did not back away from the story.
