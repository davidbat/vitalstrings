Tuki Brando, grandson of legend Marlon Brando, struck a pose for watch brand TechnoMarine, Women's Wear Daily reports . CEO Jacques-Philippe Auriol explained the timepiece-meets-pirate approach, telling the fashion newspaper, "The brand was at a stage where this renewal of communication was really needed. We are in a storytelling business, and unfortunately, I think the brand had little to say these last years." Arrr-ighty, then.
This isn't Tuki's first modeling gig -- the 20-year-old previously posed for Versace and L'Uomo Vogue, among others. The Telegraph notes that he's "no 'trustafarian' casually dipping his toe in the modeling world," and that Tuki has, in fact, had a difficult youth:
His father Dag Drollet was shot dead by his uncle Christian Brando (Malron Brando's son) while his mother Cheyenne was pregnant with him. Plagued by mental health problems, Cheyenne then took her own life aged 25, when Tuki was five. While being raised by his maternal grandmother in Tahiti, his actor grandfather died when he was 13, and Tuki was omitted from his will.
