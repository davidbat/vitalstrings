Two Hollywood legends – Marlon Brando and Pink’s Hot Dogs – were showcased Friday when the La Brea Avenue landmark unveiled a hot dog in honor what would have been the iconic actor’s 88th birthday.
Pink’s, one of Brando’s favorite restaurants, debuted “The Brando Hot Dog,” a 10-inch all-beef hot dog topped with chili, mustard and onions.
 
Pink's also gave people an offer they could refuse: a free Brando hot dog to anyone dressed like one of the actor’s famous movie characters 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. No one appeared dressed as Vito Corleone of Stanley Kowalski when a camera crew was at the hot dog stand Friday morning.
In attendance were Miko and Rebecca, two of Brando’s adult children.
Also featured in front of Pink’s, where hundreds of people wait daily in long lines to try one of their hot dogs, was a 1949 Lancia Ardea, the same car that was destroyed in Brando’s “The Godfather: Part II.”
