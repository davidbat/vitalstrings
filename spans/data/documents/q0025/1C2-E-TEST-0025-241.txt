State leaders reach deal on remaining budget bills 06.22.12
(04-18) 04:00 PDT Papeete -- Actor Marlon Brando's daughter Cheyenne committed suicide by  hanging herself at her home on the South Pacific island of Tahiti on  Sunday, her family said yesterday.
Relatives said Cheyenne Brando, 25, had been depressed ever since  the slaying of her boyfriend Dag Drollet by her half-brother  Christian four years ago and had made three previous suicide  attempts.
She was found hanging in her bedroom at her home in Punaauia, on  the west coast of Tahiti, a relative said.
Cheyenne Brando, who had a 5-year-old son by Drollet, was the  daughter of Marlon Brando and Tarita Teriipaia, a Polynesian who  acted with Brando in the 1962 film ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
The relatives said Marlon Brando, 71, had been taken to a  hospital in Los Angeles after hearing the news.
Christian Brando was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for the  murder of Drollet but could be paroled in two or three weeks for good  behavior, they said.
