LOS ANGELES  — Anyone could imitate Marlon Brando — it was as simple as a scowl, a nasal voice and a scratch of the cheek — but few could copy the skill that made him an icon.
The two-time Oscar winner, who died at age 80, popularized the Method style of performing, which stripped away grandiose theatricality in favor of a deeper psychological approach to inhabiting a character.
Generations of young actors were electrified by Brando’s work as conflicted characters in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “On the Waterfront” and “The Wild One,” men who were emotionally vulnerable but savagely dangerous at the same time.
He was the bridge between the heroic screen purity of earlier stars such as Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda and a generation of gritty, conflicted anti-heroes played by the likes of Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman.
“He was like a godfather to many young actors worldwide but particularly in this country,” said Robert Duvall, Brando’s “Godfather” co-star.
Even directors who never worked with him benefited indirectly — actors were more willing to push themselves, delve deeper into their own psyches, and submit to endless retakes of scenes both to get it right and try things different ways.
“For my generation and for generations to come, he virtually defined truth and honesty, as an actor and then as a public persona,” “Taxi Driver” director Martin Scorsese said Friday. “Everything that we know about the power of great screen acting relates back to him: when you watch his work in ‘On the Waterfront’ or ‘Last Tango in Paris,’ you’re watching the purest poetry imaginable, in dynamic motion.”
