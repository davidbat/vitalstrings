the man
Widely considered the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando took the world by storm. His raging stillness, graceful masculinity and staggering sex appeal electrified audiences and critics alike.
With eight Academy Award nominations and two wins, his body of work spanned over half of a century, inspiring almost every great actor that came after him including Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and Sean Penn.
An infamous ladies' man, a style tastemaker, and an advocate for civil rights and eco-conscious living, his thirst for knowledge and strength to defy conventionality led him to become one of the most unforgettable icons of the 20th century.
Rebel. Lover. Legend.
