Acting
PRESENTATIONAL ANDREPRESENTATIONAL ACTING
Acting styles also exist on a continuum, with extreme presentational         styles at one end and extreme representational styles at the other. The         distinction between the two is not clear-cut. Viewers' knowledge,         experience, and expectations help to determine whether or not a         particular performance will be seen as presentational or         representational. Moreover, the two styles appear in different films         made during the same period, and are often found in the same film.         Gradations of presentational and representational styles exist even in         the earliest years of film performance. While a presentational style         marks performances in single-scene novelty pieces such as The May Irwin Kiss (1896) and Fatima's Coochee-Coochee Dance (1901) and single-scene trick films such as The Lady Vanishes (1896) and How It Feels to Be Run Over (1901), other types of single-scene films seem to capture the "natural" behavior of individual human beings. For         example, many slice-of-life actualités produced by thère         Company are staged to suggest scenes of individuals engaged in familiar         activities and are crafted so that the actions of selected individuals disclose discernible personality traits. In actualités such as La Sortie des usines Lumière ( Leaving the Lumière Factory , 1895) and Bataille de boules de neige ( Snowball Fight , 1896), the men singled out riding a bicycle through the crowd in each         film seem to enjoy the opportunity to clown around. In Enfants pêchant des crevettes ( Children Digging for Clams , 1896) a young woman in the foreground seems to be a bit anxious about         being photographed. While these individuals reveal their awareness of         the camera, in contrast to the novelty pieces or trick films, the         individuals are not presented as if they are onstage but instead as if         they are reenacting scenes from daily life and inadvertently revealing         aspects of their individual personalities.
The acting style or styles featured in a film reflect the conception of         character and the conception of cinema at the heart of that specific         film. Put in the simplest terms, presentational acting styles are used         to present character types or social types, while representational         acting styles are used to represent characters with ostensibly unique         personality traits. For example, the presentational acting style found         in Making of an American Citizen (Alice Guy Blaché, 1912) illuminates identifiable social types,         while the representational style of Lillian Gish's         (1893–1993) performance in The Mothering Heart (1913) suggests a character with certain individual qualities.         Presentational acting styles can also be found in modernist films that         are designed according to pictorial or graphic principles. In a film         such as Oktyabr ( Ten Days that Shook the World and October , 1927), Eisenstein uses the evocative power of the stage picture and         the polemical power of the social tableau to make his directorial         statement. By comparison, representational acting styles are often found         in mainstream films that are designed according to novelistic         principles. In Wuthering Heights (1939), William Wyler uses the cinematic frame to create a window on a         verisimilar world that invites audiences to locate occasions for         emotional resonance.
Studies of acting in early cinema often discuss the presentational         performance styles in American and European films produced before 1913.         Scholars agree
BERTOLT BRECHT
b. Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht, Augsburg, Germany,
10 February 1898, d. 14 August 1956
Bertolt Brecht is a central figure in twentieth-century theater. A           playwright who moved into directing to have an influence in the           production of his own work, Brecht's first plays reflected the           influence of dadaism and expressionism. He began directing in 1924 and           had his first success in 1928 with The Threepenny Opera . Active in German theater until Hitler's rise to power in           1933, Brecht spent the next fifteen years in exile. During this period           Brecht wrote the plays for which he is best remembered, but his work           was rarely produced until he returned to (East) Germany. In the 1950s           touring productions of Brecht's plays had a salient influence           on Roland Barthes, Jean-Luc Godard, and others interested in modernist           aesthetics and left-leaning politics.
Brecht's writing on theater practice also had a profound           influence on theater and film. By the 1970s, Brecht's critique           of conventional theater provided a model for politically engaged           cinema that featured aesthetic experimentation. Sustained interest in           Brecht's call for experimental stage practice still prompts           filmmakers and stage practitioners to explore alternative           relationships between performer, director, and audience.
Brecht is best known for defining distinctions between epic theater           and mainstream dramatic theater. According to Brecht, the two types of           theater have different objectives—epic theater is designed to           illuminate the operations of social and political power, while           dramatic theater accommodates people to existing social realities.           Epic theater does not have a fixed style or set of techniques, and the           logic for selecting and combining aesthetic elements is different from           that used in dramatic theater. In epic theater, dramatic, visual, and           aural/musical elements are placed in counterpoint to emphasize the           constructed nature of representation itself. By comparison, dramatic           theater orchestrates dramatic, visual, and aural/musical elements to           create a coherent and emotionally engaging reflection of the world as           it is defined by the traditions and myths that serve the interests of           those in power.
In Brecht's productions, actors' gestures and vocal           expressions were presented in spatial and/or temporal counterpoint to           other performance and staging elements. At any moment, disparities           between lighting, scenic, musical, and performance elements called           attention to the concrete reality of the elements themselves. Rather           than coming together to create a seamless stage picture, the disparate           performance and staging elements kept meaning in play and made the           entire theater event strange. Building on Russian formalists' concept of "making strange" and the Prague           School's theories on the social function of art's "foregrounding effect," Brecht used the term " verfremdungseffekt " (alienation) to describe the effect of visual, aural, and           comedic/dramatic collage techniques that keep audiences attentive to           connections between social realities and the situations presented           onstage.
Throughout his career, collaboration was integral to Brecht's           work as a playwright and director. He worked closely with individuals           such as director Erwin Piscator, composer Kurt Weill, actress Lotte           Lenya, and actress Helene Weigl, with whom he founded the Berliner           Ensemble in 1949. The Threepenny Opera (1928), Life of Galileo (1937), Mother Courage and Her Children (1941), The Good Person of Setzuan (1943), and The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1948) are among his best-known plays. After fleeing from           German-occupied countries in Europe, Brecht lived in southern           California from 1941 to 1947. During that time, he collaborated           occasionally with actors, directors, and screenwriters working in           Hollywood. He chose to leave the United States in 1947 after turning           in a remarkable performance before the House Un-American Activities           Committee as the eleventh unfriendly witness in a group that later           became known as the Hollywood Ten.

that presentational styles were dominant in films produced before 1908,         and they have used various terms, including "histrionic," "melodramatic," and "romantic," to describe         acting in early cinema. The salient point in their studies is that the         early years of Anglo-European cinema often featured performances with         emphatic and highly expressive postures and gestures. Linked to         theatrical traditions in which tableaux were important, early film         performances were marked by poses that forcefully embodied the emotional         or narrative situation.
Many scholars see a transition in the 1910s from presentational to         representational acting styles. The change in acting style is linked to         the rise of naturalism in late-nineteenth-century theater and to         developments in film practice as the movies became an entertainment form         for middle-class audiences. Scholars have used terms such as "verisimilar acting," "naturalistic         performance," and "realistic acting" to describe         the representational styles that accompanied the transition to         feature-length films and the rise of the star system. In contrast to the         emphatic poses featured in presentational acting styles,         representational acting involves extensive use of props, blocking, and         stage business to reveal dramatic conflict and characters' inner         experiences.
By the 1920s representational acting styles were the norm in         Anglo-European filmmaking, and thus an aspect of film practice open to         challenge. While mainstream cinema continued to feature representational         acting styles, filmmakers inspired by Soviet cinema rejected them on the         grounds that they were one of the culture industry's more         insidious methods for instilling false consciousness in mass audiences.         Turning instead to epic theater and documentary forms, leftist         filmmakers produced work such as Kuhle Wampe (1932) and Native Land (1942). Creating work that sometimes is compared to surrealist films of         the 1920s and 1930s, experimental artists began using presentational         acting styles to illustrate archetypical figures in dreamlike narratives         such as Meshes in the Afternoon (1943).
Impatient with the conventions of commercial film and theater,         modernists such as Jean-Luc Godard (b. 1930) found inspiration in stage         productions mounted by Bertolt Brecht's (1898–1956)         Berliner Ensemble in the 1950s. The influence of Brecht's views         on dramatic art is visible in films directed by Godard and in the work         of filmmakers such as Danièle Huillet (b. 1936) and Jean-Marie         Straub (b. 1933), who were influenced by Godard's contributions         to the French New Wave. In this line of modernist cinema, characters are         presented as social types or stereotypes. Dispassionate performances         obscure access to characters' inner experiences. Functioning as         news readers more than characters, actors break the illusion of the         fictional world by using direct address; working as cultural or media         images more than characters, actors become pieces of the film's         graphic design.
In Godard's films, performance elements are just one part of an         audiovisual collage. Performances function independently of or in         counterpoint to framing, editing, camera movement, and other cinematic         elements. As models of social types, Godard's actors display         little or no emotion. They often convey information about their         characters' social and narrative situation by reenacting a         gesture or assuming a pose drawn from film and media culture. For         example, in a scene in Àbout de souffle ( Breathless , 1960), Jean-Paul Belmondo (b. 1933) pensively draws his thumb across         his lips, emulating a gesture his character has seen on a poster of         Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957).
Brecht's writing on epic theater prompted film critics to see the         truncated performance style in modernist films as "Brechtian." The term served to differentiate the         minimalist presentation of social types from the more histrionic style         used in early cinema. With impassive performances in modernist films         identified as Brechtian, expressive performances in a representational         style came to be seen as "Stanislavskian." The connection         between representational performance styles and the Russian         actor-director-theorist Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky         (1863–1938) is not surprising. In 1906 the Moscow Art         Theatre's first European tour prompted theater critics to discuss         the marvelous details of the actors' stage business. Their         reviews called attention to the actors' ability to create the         impression of everyday life. During the Moscow Art Theatre's         tours in America in 1923 and 1924, which featured productions from the         company's 1906 tour ( Tsar Fyodor , The Lower Depths , The Cherry Orchard , and The Three Sisters ), American critics were
MARLON BRANDO
b. Omaha, Nebraska, 3 April 1924, d. 1 July 2004
Marlon Brando is often considered by many to be America's           greatest actor. He made his stage debut in 1944 and won acclaim for           his 1947 performance in A Streetcar Named Desire , directed by Elia Kazan. Following his film debut in 1950 Brando           quickly became the preeminent actor in postwar America. He received           Academy Award ® nominations for his performances in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Viva Zapata! (1952), and Julius Caesar (1953), and an Oscar ® for his performance in On the Waterfront (1954).
Publicity surrounding these films helped to establish the idea that           Brando's acclaimed performances represented the arrival of           Method acting in Hollywood. To understand Brando's work as a           Method actor, however, it is important to recognize that the           principles of acting and actor training associated with the Method           were developed by three different individuals: Lee Strasberg, Stella           Adler, and Sanford Meisner. Each focused on different methods of           preparation and character development: Strasberg focused on affective           memory, Adler emphasized imagination, and Meisner stressed the           importance of actors' connection. Brando took classes at the           Actors Studio when it opened in New York in 1947, but he did not study           with Strasberg, who joined the Actors Studio in 1948 and became its           artistic director in 1951. Instead, beginning in 1942, Brando studied with Adler at the New School in New York. The New School's           Dramatic Workshop, established by Erwin Piscator, who established the           principles of epic theater that Bertolt Brecht would make famous, gave           Brando the chance to perform in Shakespearean and symbolist           productions. Studying with Adler, Brando was trained not to use memory           and personal history as the basis for developing characterizations,           but to enter into a character's fictional world by studying the           script and historical accounts that would shed light on the           character's given circumstances.
Working with Adler also instilled in Brando the belief that actors           were not isolated artists, but instead citizens who should have a           point of view about society. Brando's decision to protest           Hollywood's representations of Native Americans by declining           the Academy Award ® for his performance in The Godfather (1972) is seen by many critics as a flamboyant gesture of a           short-lived political stance. Yet, careful review of the roles Brando           selected throughout his career reveal an engaged and long-standing           interest in decrying the unchecked exercise of power. Brando's           characterizations in Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) and Burn! (1969) are especially rich for their depiction of power's           devastating effects. His portrayals in The Ugly American (1963), The Godfather , and Apocalypse Now (1979) are good examples of his ability to craft performances that           suggest the allure and the ruthlessness of men who operate beyond the           boundary of social norms. While he is often associated with the rebel           characters he portrayed, Brando is best understood as a gifted actor,           skilled enough to create performances that also invariably exposed the           downside of rogue masculinity.

equally impressed by the simplicity and naturalness of the         actors' performances.
There is a connection between the multidimensional "System" Stanislavsky developed over the course of his         career and representational performance styles because the System         included new methods that actors could use to prepare for and execute         performances suited to the demands of late-nineteenth-century         naturalism. For example, in place of studying painting or sculpture to         create poses that would reveal characters' emotional states,         actors using Stanislavsky's System learned to use script analysis         to understand a character's circumstances and a script's         fictional world. Rather than working to create certain images in their         performances, Stanislavsky's actors turned to historical research         and observation of everyday life. This research provided the basis for         actors' imaginative creation of details about their         characters' life history and social environment. When combined         with exercises that enhanced actors' ability to relax on stage         and focus their attention on fellow actors, the process of script         analysis devised by Stanislavsky made it possible for actors to create         performances that seemed to be lifted from everyday life.
From the 1920s forward, most actors in the United States have approached         performance using strategies based on their understanding of the         approach to actor training, character development, and performance         outlined in the Stanislavsky System. In the 1930s dialogue directors,         who worked with film actors to develop characterizations, and drama         coaches, who developed actor-training programs for the studios, became         an integral part of Hollywood's industrial production process. At         institutions such as the American Academy of Dramatic Art and the         Pasadena Playhouse, actors working in film learned scientific, modern,         and systematic methods for developing characterizations and working in         film. Many film actors took classes at the Actors Laboratory in         Hollywood, which was established in 1941 by Group Theatre actors Morris         Carnovsky (1897–1992), Roman Bohnen (1894–1949), J. Edward         Bromberg (1903–1951), and Phoebe Brand (1907–2004) (all of         whom shared Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner's opposition to Lee         Strasberg's interpretation of Stanislavsky). Courses at the         Actors Lab and at long-established institutions, and working sessions         with drama coaches such as Sophie Rosenstein, were all grounded in         Stanislavsky's view that actors must ask what the character would         do in the given circumstances. In the late 1940s, when studios reduced         their investment in contract players and communist-front allegations         forced the Actors Lab to close, Robert Lewis (1909–1997), Elia         Kazan (1909–2003), and Cheryl Crawford (1902–1986) established the Actors Studio in New York. Soon after, Lee Strasberg         (1901–1982) assumed the role of artistic director, and in the         decades that followed, Strasberg popularized the American Method, which         inverts Stanislavsky's System by encouraging the actor to ask how         he or she would feel in the character's situation.
The distinction scholars seek to describe by referring to Brechtian and         Stanislavskian performance styles is an important one, but it is better         understood as a contrast between presentational and representational         styles. In a Hollywood studio–era film such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (Frank Capra, 1939), editing and framing choices are subordinate to         actors' movements and facial expressions. Like the film's         musical score and sound design, they serve to enhance audience access to         characters' subjective experience and desires. Actors' performances are designed to disclose the inner lives of their         characters. By comparison, in a modernist film such as Godard's Weekend (1967), editing and frame compositions often exclude close-ups. That         approach eliminates cathartic or emotion-laden moments from the screen. Weekend 's editing, framing, sound design, and camera movement also are         often unrelated to actors' movements or interactions, serving         instead to provide commentary on the film's polemical vignettes.         The figures in the film are not defined by their personality traits, but         instead represent social types shaped entirely by external forces.
As shorthand, it might make sense to discuss Stanislavskian performances         in films such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Brechtian performances in films such as Weekend , but doing that obscures important information about the multifaceted         system Stanislavsky developed. Today, scholars and practitioners alike         recognize that Stanislavsky's System can be used to create a         range of performances styles. They see the value of analyzing scripts to         understand (1) the problems characters need to solve to reach their         goals, (2) the specific actions characters will use to reach their         goals, and (3) the structure of scenes that arises from the actions         characters take in pursuit of their goals. Many scholars now recognize         that Brecht actually used Stanislavsky's System to develop         performances and that Brecht's approach to staging required         actors to use direct address, truncated performances, and animated         acting styles imbued with the dynamic energy of circus and music hall         performances.
Describing performances in mainstream Hollywood films as Stanislavskian         and performances in modernist European films as Brechtian dissuades         observers from seeing that even in largely representational         performances, actors step outside their characters to comment on their         characters and on their performances. What makes performances so         compelling in Cassavetes's films, for example, is the fact that         they not only create memorable characters, but also contain moments when         actors seem to comment on the narrative and on their participation in         the film. The Brechtian potential of Stanislavskian performances is also         disclosed by many of Orson Welles's performances. His portrayals         in Jane Eyre (1944), The Third Man (1949), The Long Hot Summer (1958), Touch of Evil (1958), and Campanadas a medianoche ( Chimes at Midnight , 1965) do not simply present audiences with a character, or even the         star performance of a character. Instead, Welles's portrayals         enlist sympathy for the characters, critique the social and economic         conditions the characters exemplify, and comment on Welles as an artist         working in a capital-intensive industry.
