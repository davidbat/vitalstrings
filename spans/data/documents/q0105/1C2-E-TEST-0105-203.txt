When did Home Depot start hiring people who know nothing about their job?   (Posted on 6/9/12 at 5:27 p.m.)
so i went into home depot because i have to patch a small hole in the wall at my apartment before i move out.  now i will be the first to admit, i know nothing about home repairs, and im not a handy man, so i went in there with a picture of what i was trying to fix.... asked 3 people what i needed... they said "uhhh i dont know bra, leme ask this dude when he gets off break"
eventually i looked it up online and got what i needed, with zero help from the staff.
why the hell would home depot hire someone who doesnt know anything about the field they are working in?
i know jack shite about home repair and i know for a fact i was more qualified to work at home depot then those jackasses.
yea im mad
