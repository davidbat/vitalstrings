★★★☆☆ Sometimes Big Isn't the Best
Jim S. 3 Home Depot
Although Home Depot is the recognized leader in discount home builder supplies, their stores lack the basic consumer needs to be a 4- or 5-star rated business.
Here are my personal observations:
Prices
If you find a product at Home Depot and the same product at Wal Mart, you'll find the cheaper deal at Wal Mart 99% of the time.  Sure, they offer a 10% low price guarantee, but sometimes, its not worth the hassle.
Selection
Home Depot is the tops when it comes to selection.  Now, the store in Los Lunas is not a "full size" store compared to their big city brothers.  That being said, they are willing to order anything for you from their catalog.
Home Delivery/Installation
Home Depot consistenly comes in pricier than Lowes when it comes to installation.  That includes Lowes' extra fee to come out to Los Lunas from Albuquerque.  Home delivery is definitely a shame.  It takes longer to get stuff from the Los Lunas store (ie: Appliances) than it does other big box stores from Albuquerque.
Customer Service
Even though it's not a specifically listed item on their "We won't cut" list, they won't cut MDF boards.  Not because of OSHA, but because they say it wears their blades too quickly.  Thanks.  Pass the burden to my blades.
Lines
This is the most irritating problem with Home Depot.  There are almost NEVER enough lines to reduce long waits.  This is very very irritating.  There are more people holding flags in front of fork lifts than people taking money.
PROS: Selection of lumber & supplies, helpful floor staff
CONS: SLOW lines, not the best prices.
