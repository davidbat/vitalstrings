★★☆☆☆ Contractor sales dept
Darla r. 2 Lowe's
Recently moved into the area from Dallas. I went with my husband to Lowes to establish account for company. We were met by a woman in the commercial sales dept and by her unprofessional style of dress ,appearance and attitude , we left the store and immediately went to Home Depot. She was dressed in very inappropriately revealing top and tattooed . When I asked questions of her she proceeded to lean over the counter towards my husband and tell him" don't worry honey, I know my way around this store." I am the office manage for my husbands business and I am the one who will be handling orders and such. It became very clear that she would be difficult to work with. The store however seemed very clean and orderly. It is regrettable that she is representing Lowes.

Granbury HandyMan.com uses Lowes in Granbury, Texas. It is a convenient improvement warehouse to shop for me, and my customers. They generally have the supplies I need. If they do not have the items that I am looking for, then I go to Home Depot just down the street.

When entering the store, Nothing really grabs my attention, just does not have the warm greeting entrance.  Another factor that I experienced is that there is no psychological, salable pitch saying
"BUY ME or NEW PRODUCT FRONT stating your items on sale, new item, displays for eye catchers, the customers.  Owning my own business has helped me to be more flexable.  I buy most, 90 % of my supplies from Lowes.  I go to Home depo for items your store does not carry..I do appreciate the greeting and assistance I get in the Lowes department stores verses Home Depo.
