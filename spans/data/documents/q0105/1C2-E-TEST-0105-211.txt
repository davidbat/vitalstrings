Re: Who has the best pole barns Menards Home Depot Lowes Carter in Ohio
I have a Menards pole barn. Built about 7 years ago. Has eves, wainscotting, sky lights, windows, roll up door, sliding end door and 2 walk in doors. No complaints. Most pole barn are very similar in steel. Some differences in use of laminated posts ect but most can be priced with nearly the same design materials. Menards will design the pole barn based on your local codes and requirements. You can upgrade to screws, rafter spacing, windows, skylight ect on their store computer. I required certified snow and wind loads for my location. Menards can get those for you if required. I had it delivered to my place.
I would opt for laminated beams, all screw attachment, best paint available as standard features regardless of who you use.
The crew who puts up you pole barn is as important as who you buy it from. A bad crew can make a miserable experience and make anyone's pole barn look poor.
