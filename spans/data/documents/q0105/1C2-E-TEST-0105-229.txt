Sam’s Club, Costco or BJ’s.  The area is ripe for this – the nearest one is in Jacksonville or Greenville, nearly an hour in either direction. With all the military families and vacant land, this seems like a no-brainer.
Lowe’s or Home Depot – another no brainer.  The nearest Lowe’s is in Moorehead City, again, 30 miles. In a hurricane, that’s forever away. For every day stuff, I don’t want to have to travel, or shop WalMart for project materials.
I wonder if there’s any plans to solicit these companies from our town officials.  Not only would they be an employment boom in a bad economy, but it’d be helpful to the residents of Havelock and surrounding communities (Beaufort, New Bern, etc).
