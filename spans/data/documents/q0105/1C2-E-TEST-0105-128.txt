sears, is a rip off, plain and simple. It may be different over there but i installed simonton(sears) windows built out of the Vacaville, CA plant for years and couldn't believe the problems they were having. about half, yes half, of our orders were shipped either incomplete or damaged. every delivery would have at least two busted retro fins. plus their service was two months out at best. you can get the same low quality window from a small shop for half the price in some cases. just do some research and see what companies in your area are growing and will be around for a while. if you find a good window company - not a department store - you will get better service, period. not saying all small companies are great-most aren't, just saying you should do research in finding a company because all three stores you are considering are way overpriced, don't employ any of there own installers or check out installers previous work before hiring, and just don't have the capability of offering the level of service you should expect when updating your home. also, andersons are great windows - it would be an insult to compare them to simonton(sears)
