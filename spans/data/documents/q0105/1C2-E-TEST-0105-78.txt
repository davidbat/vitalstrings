Home Depot also noted that half of its 2011 seasonal hires ended up staying on in permanent positions.  2012 hire's will likely see the same thing happening.
Frank Blake, the new CEO for The Home Depot, stated their 2012 goals to improve their stores.  Actions speak louder than words about where they seem to think the economy is going in 2012.
Here are some things they are doing:
Increasing general staffing in stores.  Launching a nationwide program to recruit
and hire skilled master tradespeople to staff their stores and, investing significantly in the appearance of stores to make them easier and more fun places to shop.
Now, if they just got rid Spanish signs in their stores and acknowledge that in this country, we speak English.
I currently have HD stocks I bought last  August at their low.  Now they are up from their low of $29 to almost $43 today.  Interestingly, Lowe's is tracking along the same lines up from $18 to $26 during the same time frame.  What is even more interesting is that HD stocks started recovering as far back as 2009 despite the bad economy.
My take is that 2012 will have it's ups and downs but that by years end, things will have improved for many Americans.  Sadly though, there is serious doubt that many of the middle class, blue collar jobs will return in significant quantities and this class has literaly been decimated the last few years.
