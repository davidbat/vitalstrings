Home improvement giant Home Depot (HD) announced today that it would be hiring 60,000 seasonal employees nationwide as the company gears up for its busiest season, which is springtime.
Every year the company boosts its employees to deal with its peak season, and makes the hires in February and March to get the new workers ready when springtime rolls around and traffic really picks up at the company's retail stores across the nation.
In addition to the 60,000 seasonal employees, Home Deport also announced plans to add some full and part time jobs, but did not specify the exact number of these hires.
The seasonal workers will be employed for roughly 90 days between March and June. While these jobs are just seasonal, Home Depot did state that some of the positions could switch to full time based on employee performance.
Home Depot also announced that it will continue its "Spring Black Friday" promotion that it began last year. We all know that the typical Black Friday sales are done the day after Thanksgiving, but with springtime being the company's busiest season, Home Depot will be running its Black Friday sales in the spring.
Last year the company ran the promotions two weekends, but is going to expand the promotions to four weekends this year.
The exact dates that each store will be having its door busting sales will vary depending on its geographic locations, so your best bet will be to visit your local Home Depot store and find out when they will be having their deals so you can take advantage of all the specials that will be offered.
