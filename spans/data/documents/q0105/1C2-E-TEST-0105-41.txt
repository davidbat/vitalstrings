EAST MEADOW (WABC) -- The sun is out the snow is melting and at Home Depot, they're ready for spring.
Barbecues and patio furniture are on display.  Now the hunt is on for people to sell them.
"Spring is our Christmas. It's our number one selling season. We're trying to get ready for the spring and for our customers and we're gonna be hiring a bunch of part time associates for seasonal areas," Jim Balduzzi said.
You could call it Jim's Black Friday. It's the busiest time of the year for home improvement chains like Home Depot and Lowe's, which together are hiring a hundred thousand people nationwide.

Analysts say big box stores are relying more and more on seasonal workers than before the economy went south, but with national unemployment still hovering around 9 percent, every little bit helps.
Home Depot alone is looking for over three thousand people in the New York area, including 600 on Long Island, 600 in the five boroughs, 1100 in New Jersey and 850 in Connecticut.
The openings are a godsend for people who have spent months out of work and looking for a job.
The jobs available right now here at Home Depot and at Lowe's are not full time. They're seasonal for the 90 busiest days of the home improvement business, but they are jobs.
