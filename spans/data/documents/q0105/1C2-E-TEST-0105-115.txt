So you have read this far and are wondering what the big secret is, ok, here it is.  Both Home Depot and Lowes offer a 10% discount option.  I have included the links to sign up for these below.  You can basically get one coupon per e-mail address  every 6 or 12 months.  These are the same coupons that used to come with the USPS moving packets.  The big difference is that they are sent via e-mail and you print them out.  All of them have a unique bar code that allows them to only be used once. HOWEVER, since each store will accept the others coupons, you can just make as many copies as you want of one and use it at the other since they would have no way to verify it had not already been used!!
Step #1 - Go to the links below and register to get your 10% coupon e-mailed to you.  Just do it with one e-mail address for now.

Step #2 - When you get the coupons, print them out AND make about 10 to 15 copies of each one.
Step #3 - When you go to Home Depot, take one of your 10% off Lowes coupons with you, at checkout, just hand them the coupon and say "I was told you would honor this from Home Depot."  Do the opposite for Lowes. Copy and repeat.
**Extra tip - Watch for special "$10 of $50+ purchase" coupons as well.  These are also great as you just make sure your purchases are for JUST over $50 and you end up getting 20% off!  Copy and repeat!!!
