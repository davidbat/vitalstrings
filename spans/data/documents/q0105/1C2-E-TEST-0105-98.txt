Davenport borders the Mississippi River and is part of the area known as the "Quad Cities". The city serves as a commercial, industrial and rail center.

While Davenport is located in the center of "Tornado Alley" the city has seen more damage due to flooding of the Mississippi River than tornadoes. Davenport has no levees or flood walls to protect the city when the river swells. The city prefers open access to the Mississippi for its residents. To protect businesses and homes from flood waters, the city has started to implement building codes which requires new construction projects to be elevated above the flood level.
