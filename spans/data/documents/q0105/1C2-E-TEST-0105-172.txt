To attract the best candidates, many companies now offer at least some benefits for part-time employees. These can range from health insurance and paid time off to employee discounts or free merchandise.
Here are some companies with a lot of part-time openings available right now:

The Inside Scoop: If you’re a do-it-yourself type (or wish you were), this could be the perfect job for you.

For some positions, heavy lifting might be required.
