14% Q: Do anyone know if Lowes uses the Unicru personality test for employment? Does anyone have any tips on it ?
A:Yes.  Lowes does use this system. I'd say just lie and tell them what you think they want to hear. I got hired by them about a year ago. However, like the girl said earlier leave a lasting impression. Like all customer service related jobs make sure that you let them know that you like to make people smile, even if you don't say it directly.
