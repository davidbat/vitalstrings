To all you disgruntled employees, you all were probably losers who wanted a paycheck for doing absolutely nothing so you deserved what you got! To all those former customers who don't shop there anymore, YOU are the problem, be nicer and show more respect for the human race and stop thinking you are the #1 priority when you shop there and you won't have a problem! stop coming in with an attitude like you are better than everone who works there and maybe you'll get the help you need! Hey tools, do you know all the Lowes employees are former Home Depot employee's who were fired for stealing,or harassment,or physical abuse of another employee and customer? So the next time you shop at Lowe's remember they only hire felons, that's criminal's to the under educated.

Home Depot wasstarted by good people with good intentions. These men have helped countless families. They have grown older and are no loger running the company. Now it is Big Business, like most others, making money for there stockholders. But like them or not, they still help alot of people. I'm glad there are places like this website for you all to vent your hatred, but I think you should just go shop somewhere else and move on with life. It's amazingly short, trust me, I'm very old, and it went by too quick. I wouldn't suggest wasting too much time being bitter or angry.

the overall home depot is not a bad place , its the fuking management that couldnt manage there way out of a paper bag!  if they hired some managers with experience of retail business, it would make the job 100% easier , but having morons as store managers, not knowing whats going on , on the sales floor and thinking little pep ralleys are going to solve all, but dosent solve anything...BOTTOM FUKING LINE, HIRE MORE KNOWELEGABLE PEOPLE, SCREEN THE MANAGEMENT BEFORE YOU PUT KEYS IN THERE HANDS , AND REWORK THIS SO CALLED INFOCUS TEAM SAFETY CRAP THAT DOSENT WORK FOR CRAP!!

Full timers are scheduled 40 hours for the full week including the weekend. Management makes them work 10 hours during the week and cuts their scheduled hours on the weekend. Problem is they don't get O.T. after 8 hours and not enough coverage on Saturday & Sunday. I heard that there is a potential class action suit against H.D. in the state of Michigan and the state government is definitely looking at this one. Heard that one store in Detroit Michigan closed its doors due to high theft from both customers and employes and poor salesmanship.

They've got to stop putting the damaged/incomplete merchandise back on the shelf. When someone returns an item that is broken or incomplete the store should mark it down and put in a special discounted section. I estimate that for every 3 trips I go to HD I have to make 1 return trip due to something being incomplete or broken. You'd think they'd get tired of paying 3-4 people 8 hours a day (and this is not enough) just to check returned items back in. You really have to wonder what management is thinking. I've got many more gripes about HD but I don't have time to list them right now because I have to go return a $60 paint sprayer that had already been opened, used, returned, taped shut and then put back on the shelf for me to purchase. Real nice. Home Depot your fired! I'm gonna give Lowes a shot and see what the return rate is there.

the contractors that homedepot handles are the bottom feeders(the lowest bidding contractor or the handyman). On the other hand , homedepot tries to sell itself as being a legit warehouse/supply house while selling second rate uncommercial products. The staff consist of low payed unknowledgable sales associates who do not belong selling expensive projects to paying customers. Who in their right mind would have "at home services" or the specialty departs do an install/build for them? no homeowner that i know ...and thats a fact. They also have this new credit card/esp program going on. who needs to be harrassed about this stuff when you are trying to buy a roll of tape?  the company from the top to the bottom is a huge ugly catch 22, plain and simple.  One example is the staffing/poor customer service issues as of late.  Homedepot has a new system in place called a pay band(a ranking of wages based on position..not experience) so what that means is that guy in elctrical who is there every morning to meet you(a familiar face for renta contractors) is making a grand total of 9 dollars an hour, 4 years ago that guy would have been replaced w/a retired electrician w/a wealth of knowledge who was payed for his skill in that trade.  That is why the customer service is down.    you get what you pay for and lowes is the same way....any big box retail company is the same as a matter of fact, retail is about money. if you want excellent customer service and good products then you go to a wholesale company (lumber yard/plumbing supply/electrical supply/landscape supply/kitchen and bath supply.............they all equal good. stop being dumb and use your brain s people

Don't ever ask home depot to install ANYTHING.  The installation fee is much higher than the kitchen cabinet itself.  I installed all the kitchen counter stuff myself, but made the mistake of allowing home depot to handle the countertop.  That was a nightmare.  They refuse to install it because we didn't remove the kitchen sink.  First off, they were very, very late, so we need to use the damn sink, and we thought, these guys would come in, simply remove the sink (two minutes), and install the countery top.  They refuse, and charged us another $100 just to come back.  We decided to install the counter top ourselves, but they refuse to do that.  They kept our counter top hostage, and would only released it once we paid the crook another $100.  Home depot is the most absolute bullshit.  Customer service is in India, and when you finally reached a U.S. customer service, they repeat the same bull shit.

the head cashiers are not very productive.  Tanya is the worst one of them all.  She is never available when called upon from cashiers. I've been in cashiers lines and she nevers came when called.  Back in June of 2004 a cashier i believe her name was april had a hand put within inches of her face from tonya and then basically told not only in from of myself but several other customers that she doesn't know what she was doing on self=checkout and she has problems with all head cashiers. I have been in april's lines numerous times and she is one of the best cashiers you have: polite,friendly and helpfull. She should be promoted to head cashier, plus a raise and be on more days.  other friends and people i know agree with this.

Their corporate offices could care less about their call center reps either.  They talk about working with people on schedules then turn around and say take it or leave it, you're expendable.  They treat everyone like children and do hire anybody with a pulse.  They can't get their shit together training wise as no one can come up with a straight answer on procedures.  They have inadequate exits and make employees leave or enter through the back doors like servants.  They promise benefits from day 1 in the beginning then turn arund and say, "we never said that!".

I work for one of those service companies that THD forced the suppliers to hire. I work very hard to make my department the best it can be only to have the assholeociates pull the price tags off on new bays sets so that they can keep from having to put excess stock in the overhead. They dont care that they just removed the home of a selling item. Then when the item comes in, they mark "no home" and leave it on the floor. Then they get pissed becasuse I spend all my time fixing the mess they make and cant give them the other fluff and puff services. And, most times, we are the only ones in the freeeking stoire that IS helping customers. For example, the department had one ass. and she was sent to garden and the only one there was me! I am not floor coverage. No, we are not as knowledgeable as the real vendor reps. We have zero contact with the comapnies we "rep". I try like hell to make my dept better so that they look good, and are shoppable. I have them sell the displays and then wonder why sales drop on that item, then I get my ass ripped by the mngmt for not having put up a fixture.....Home depot used to be the bomb, it is sad to see what has happened.

I have been to all 5 Home Depots in my area (Vermont) and plenty more across the East Coast and they ALL SUCK.  I have NEVER been able to get any employee to assist me without a hassle. It's like hunting for deer. You have to very quietly sneak up on them and corner them. If you just try to walk up and ask for help, they scatter like rats. The last time I cornered one to try to get a piece of copper flashing, he told me to go to the front of the store and ask a cashier to get me help. I have finally given up on this pathetic excuse for a store and I only go in there when I need something I can grab off the shelf. I also go in prepared to not get what I came for and ready to abandon my cart if the line stops. Home Depot makes Walmart look good. Hell, HD makes G. W. Bush look good!!

I wish to make it known that customer service at the Chapel Hill store has some major problems. This is the second time this year that I have had a problem with this store and its employees. Today I could not find any help in the lumber department to help me load a piece of plywood. The employee was no where to be found. I had the service desk call for someone. The person that arrived said they do not work in that department. They helped me load this lumber. I then went to the check out. I had a 10.00 coupon that was sent to me in the mail. The coupon required some management code. I waited for 15 min for the manager to arrive. While waiting the cashier made statements about customers. Its not my job to load your cart" "I cant help you I am busy" "you want me to pull that order for you? Thats not my job." after some one showed up and cleared my coupon my gift card from giant eagle would not work. I left that area and went to customer service. Stephan told me that these behaviors were not acceptable. No Kidding. He told me there was nothing else that could be done maybe I should come back tomorrow. Customer service? I don't believe that this store wants to have any customers. I will drive further to use a store that cares about people.
