I get Home Depot coupons emailed to me all the time.  What are you talking about?  Home Depot does send online coupons.  The ones posted above were emailed to me??????  Another misinformed employee or person.  Making up there own rules because they can't stand to see a customer save a little money.

be aware that the person who posted as a home depot employee can be a lie just to drive bids down on ebay. ive bought home depot coupons on ebay countless times and never had a problem, ive also printed some from this site on several occasions a while back and no problems whatsoever.
cheers

Home Depot 20% off coupons are real.  I've used 3 so far.  They give them to the employees at various times...

Home Depot in Florida are all
uptight and are rude to customers in general so it does not suprise me that they would not take a coupon. Heck one time I had a $8 per hr checker tell me I should have shopped a menards if I wanted the discount.

I have tried every possible way to get a 10% off coupon online from Home Depot and nothing works.  Even trying to sign up for their "moving club" does not work.  You can fill in all the blanks and then you cannot "submit".

The coupon for the hanging baskets has already been redeemed
when you scan the coupon the computer states "this coupon has been redeemed in a previous purchase"

i work at home depot and have for 10 years. they used to give out 20% coupons to the employees at christmas. but last christmas they stopped. they gave us more money for our holiday party instead. so any 20% coupons you see now are fakes and if you were to use them in my store we would think you are a fraud. i dont recommend them anymore.

I used the BOGO hanging flower basket coupon yesterday but it took forever for the cashier to get it to go through.  She had to call the manager and they ended up charging me a penny for it because it said the coupon had already been used.  She said some people will use the coupon and then try and return one of the baskets for cash.  There is always somebody out there to ruin it for the rest of us!   In the ned though she did get it to go through but there was a long line of miffed people behind me!  Thanks for the coupon.  I now have two beautiful hanging baskets in my backyard thanks to this site!  Keep up the good work!  I love this site!

I tried to use the BOGO Hanging flower basket coupon and they wouldn't let me use it becuase it said it had been used before. She said they can't force it thru.
Bummer....

To get the coupon mailed to you, do not use the link above, but go to www.homedepotmoving.com and proceed through the steps. The flash site needs to load completely to process your registration.

The 20% HD coupons ARE REAL. The deal is that they are ONLY given to HD employees for special occassions like during the holidays. You cannot use the HD 20% off coupons at HD unless you can verify your employment there but Lowes WILL accept them everytime. I have used the 10 and 20% off coupons dozens of times as I flip homes for a living and have never had a problem. You just have to remember to only use the 20% off coupons at Lowes only.

Yes as a Home Depot employee we did get 20% off coupons once a year for the holidays, but thanx to all you scam artists and I am sure you are on hear, because some of you have admitted to using those on multiple occations , they took them away from us. So any one who has them it's a fake, if those loser managers at slows want to get conned that's their choice.

HAS ANYONE BEEN ABLE TO USE THE HOME DEPOT BOGO FOR A SHRUB?  I WOULD LIKE TO USE IT BUT I HOPE IT IS LEGITIMATE.  I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF BEING A "CHEATER."
ANY HELPFUL RESPONSES WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.
THANKS....
