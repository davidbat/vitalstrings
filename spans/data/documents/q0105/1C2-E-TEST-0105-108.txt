Home Depot is the worst place to work Loss Prevention. I worked there for two years. I couldn't even count how  many people i caught.  Pretty much your whole day was filled with shoplifters. There is so many people stealing from Home Depot you could catch a two people on the hour. I left home depot because they told me that there were doing away with the Investigators. Then i find out a couple months later they were hiring again. On top that they don't promote within. So while you busting your but working everyday and then trying to get promoted they don't care. The pay was good but why would I want to just spend my life catching criminals all day. Going to court and getting into altercations, thats what Police officers are for.

I spent the last year as an investigator for 50+ locations statewide for a 500+ chain of specialty retail stores. When I took the job my lowest shrink store was running at about 6.2% and my highest shrink store was at 14.8% shrink.
We inventory every 90 says.
First Inventory - 23 of 50 store came in below 3.5% the rest ran from 3.6% to 10.25%
Second Inventory 37 of 50 stores came in below 3.5%. the rest ran 3.6% to 6.15%
Third Inventory 46 of 50 store came in below 3.5%.  4 stores closed and 3 stores left came in at 3.78%, 4.14%, 5.10%
I re-wrote policy and operational controls to account for my sucess in reducing the shrink and submitted it to the home office. The in turn, handed it to the auditor since she was in the stores anyway, and eliminated my position. Not be letting me go, but by writing me up for turning in expense reports late, and then terminating me for a second offence. thus disqualifying me for unemployment insurance.

Last year I was fired for reporting a security violation.  Here is the story.  A male associate of Lowe's came in the store on his day off.  He was dressed as a female.  So what right.  Well after he walked thruout the store, he walked behind a service counter.  Well I had been instructed to report all safety and security violations to the manager on duty.  So I showed the video of the incident to the managers on duty.  Needless to say, they went to my supervisor and told her that I showed them the video.  Three days later I was fired for sexual harrasment and discrimination.  How the @#$% is that possible.

I worked for Home Depot as a Loss Prevention Investigator. I resigned recently because the company had policies and supervisors who maintained a "quota" for apprehending shoplifters. They called it a "metrics", but it was a quota. There have been numerous "bad stops" because of this, however, many are not reported. Recent stories indicate this to be the case, especially the recent stop in Massachusetts for a "pencil thief". They pressure LPI's to make stops, regardless of the amount. They recently changed a policy to not make stops for less than $5.00 --- just let it go. Well, duh, now people can just go and take anything and stick it in their pocket for free as long as it only adds up to $4.99. So go to Home Depot and grab that pipe fitting and then go back tomorrow and get another one...sooner or later, you can re-plumb your whole house.
Funny thing is, they allow a guy to grab a pencil lifter, but they didn't prosecute a manager I caught stealing $100 sunglasses. This was by far the worst job I have ever had in my 20+ years in the field. Worst of all, the LP managers were the most dishonest people I ever worked with. I resigned when they stated that we should bust black gang bangers for stealing sodas, but don't bust a guy in a 3 piece business suit for not buying for that soda...can you say  PROFILING????

Hey Everyone,
I am a former Home Depot Manager. The federal Sceurity & Exchange Commission (SEC) is now investigating trhe company nationwide after an RTV clerk who was fired claimed that they were forced to fake vendor credits and returns.  So if a store was allowed, say, $2000 a month they took that even if it was really $100.  This ended up faking inventory numbers and shrink.  They already fired the RLPM in New York and the complaint came from MD.
If any of you can shed light on this, and especially if you can give specific store or district info, I will get the info the the proper authorities.

Sounds like you had a rough time!!!  Where was your boss, and his boss?  Sounds like your pretty pissed but you can forget about depot going our of buisiness.  Though Lowes outperformed them vs plan last year, depot will always be a power house in the industry.  I agree that depot runs a crappy business, but what company doesnt have some type of shady stuff going on.  Good Luck in the future.

I am not surprised by this.  I was fired from Lowe's for what they call "willful" misconduct.  Lowe's does not post policies and procedures and I didn't even know I was violating them - Milliethebeagledog.

Lowe's is just as bad as Home Depot or worse.  They fire people who cost them money on their insurance and do not post store policies.  They are located either on myLoweslife.com or in a binder under the desk.  Who has time to read them?  We were too busy being harassed, threatened and such.  At least you had LP people doing their jobs.  That's better than Lowe's.  Customes stole the store I worked at near the Canadian border in Washington state blind.  I was also fired for doing my job.  They defined me begging to get out of customer service as "willful" misconduct.  In 2007 I had a major accident in which I could have died, become paraplegic or quardraplegic.  I was deeply depressed and did not know it.  Lowe's monitored my behavior at home when I sent an e-mail to the insurance co. that administered our FSA and used what they defined as a "vulgar" word.  I was on pain killers trying to recover and deal with a mountain of bills.  This company called the area HR manager's boss and I got written up after being off for 12 weeks.  They also refused a stool as a short-term accommodation and I was also informed that depression is a choice; I chose to be depressed.

After that, I was written up for poor job performance for supposedly throwing a pen at a customer.  That was a set up.  Two witnesses said I didn't do it, but my so-called front end manager insisted I did, threw me in an office, shoved the code of ethics and a write up at me and said sign this.  He was extremely hostile as was my department manager.  That store had people who were drunk walking around the front end and the power equipment person was drunk most of the time.  They used the excuse that they could not prove the cashier was drunk.  Yet I got fired because I was so frustrated, fed up, etc. that I got angry because I could not get out of this job and transferred to the lumber cashier position or another cashier position that I made a really rude comment and I also repeated a not so good rumor in order to try to tell someone they were being talked about in response to them complaining about being talked about.  I and three other people got fired because we were a certain age and too expensive.  Now, I have no unemployment, no money.  Destitute.  How do you like that?

So, in all, Lowe's employees need to read company policies, make sure not to repeat any rumors, don't send any e-mails, stay off face book and other social sites or risk getting fired  Watch your attendance and don't have any major operations if you are full-time.  The managers think the store's money is their money.  They also can scream, harass you, use foul language and get away with it.  You cannot.

The part about policies, rumors, e-mails, and facebook seem pretty normal.  As a former government employee and a person who's worked for numerous corporations I know that rumors, e-mail, and facebook are all just a one stop source for rumors and gossip, both of which are counter-productive to the work place.  I took this from your argument:
You used to be a good employee but had an accident, asked for some accommodations, they didn't give them (Probably wrong on their part), so then you got frustrated and took it out on customers and employees and used vulgar language.  So in my eyes having an accident doesn't give you the right to act abusive or negligent in your duties.  As a military person I've hated about 90% of the things I've been tasked with doing and we don't have sick days in the military... I worked whether I had the flu or it was pouring rain outside and I still had to perform adequately.  I've just left the military and accepted a job at Lowes and while some of these stories especially about the leadership troubles me, I find most of your complaints really trivial and self inflicted.
What I would have done is use the open door policies that I'm sure the store has and if your direct manager didn't give you a stool or a transfer I'd have asked to see the next level of management and continue up until I got a satisfactory result.  There is always a chain of command and although I'm the type of leader that works with employees and treats them like they are human beings I realize that some managers just see the numbers as the bottom line.  I feel like if you work with your employers you get better results but even I realize there are assholes out there, and when that happens to be the case take it to somebody else.  I can't imagine every manager in the store would be unwilling to help you.
I've seen a lot of hurt people in the military and some bounce back quickly while others linger on for years, sometimes well after their pain has truly subsided, which makes a lot of leadership cautious about giving special accommodations to employees... while I don't necessarily agree with this I understand it.  The worst thing in the world is a person who's malingering and won't take the initiative to get the help they need.  IF you were depressed you should seek help, depression is real but it is very treatable.  As an Iraqi war veteran I understand fully how depression works and the military is the worst organization in the world about helping with depression because it has such a negative stigma, but in the end it's your health and your life.  What I hate seeing in your post though is you simply wanted to let it pass rather than actively seek help for it and it caused you to become angry and bitter, which ultimately led to your being let go.  That isn't Lowe's fault... that's your own.
