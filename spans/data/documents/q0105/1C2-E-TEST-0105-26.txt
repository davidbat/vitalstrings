Home Improvement Stores Begin Seasonal Hiring
It's finally Spring! And you know what that means... house cleaning, blooming flowers, warmer weather and most importantly, an increase in hiring at home improvement and gardening stores. Companies such as Home Depot and Lowe's have announced they will be hiring seasonal workers to prepare for the spring rush of do-it-yourself handypeople looking to make home improvements and spruce up their yards.
Home Depot was reportedly hiring and training 60,000 workers nationwide to meet the demands of consumers (search jobs at Home Depot ). In addition, Lowe's is planning to hire 50,000 temporary workers for the spring and summer months (search jobs at Lowe's ). While many of these positions will last only a few months, some will have the option to stay on as a full-time employee.
Spring on these jobs while they're still hot!
