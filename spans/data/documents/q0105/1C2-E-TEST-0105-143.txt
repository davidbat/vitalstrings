Wondering if anyone else has noticed a major decline in Home Depot or if it's just our local store...
Customer Service was horrid for awhile and although it's now obviously they are trying to improve by virtue of the number of "hello's"...they still seem to miss the mark when it comes to real service.
For example, went in to purchase a couple pallets of retaining wall blocks plus a dozen fence panels since price per retaining wall brick was lower than Lowes. Home Depot is running an online promotion for free delivery if you buy large items online (including garden) so we if the store would honor that...they wouldn't....mind you, this is a larger purchase with 2 full pallets. So, we drove across the street to Lowes where they matched the lower price of the blocks then discounted an additional 10% plus gave free delivery (they were running same promo online and the store would honor it). On top of that they had sent another $25 off coupon in the mail...something Home Depot never does.
Getting so I"m not even looking at Home Depot any longer. Anyone else notice this trend? It worked out well for us as we saved even more by going to Lowes but I'm surprised Home Depot won't even honor their online promo when you visit the store. HD sucks in our town but wondering what others think...Home depot or Lowes and why?
