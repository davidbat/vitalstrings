Re: Kitchen Installation Cost? (lowes vs home depot)
Posted by julybride0706
well, we're interested in this house but the kitchen need to be done (with other things).  just wondering how much we need to factor in as renovation expense or just move on to the next house
house hunting is such PITA!!
We did the same thing - we bought our house knowing the kitchen would need to be replaced.  However, once we started really investigating what needed to be done, turns out the entire thing needs to be gutted, not just cosmetic work to replace the materials.  We're not expanding the walls, but things like existing soffits are being taken out, as well as floor replaced etc.
the cost really depends on how much labor is needed - the materials can vary on where you go also.  In general however, i've seen that HD is not as cheap as you'd assume
We priced out with HD and Lowes, and with another contractor for the labor.  Both HD and Lowes were expensive and they didn't do nearly as thorough of an examination of the room and what needed to be done as the private contractor did, which leaves me to believe that there would definitely have been unforseen 'additional' costs that would have popped up when the job was in progress.
Our contractor took the time to poke a hole in the soffets to make sure there was nothing in them that would prevent their removal, he went into the basement and checked out the pipes to see if he'd have to move anything.. in general he was way more thorough and came in less expensive than HD.
Just something to think about as it might not be just cosmetic work that you need done.
good luck!
yes, its a PITA, but well worth it in the end.
we don't have a new kitchen yet, but i'm hoping by end of summer to have it done.
