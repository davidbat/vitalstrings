A: The best remodelers will provide the best quality and service
It is impossible for a big box store to provide consistant quality and service in home improvements much less high quality.  You will on average get the best overall results from the most experienced, best trained and most committed people.  This of course is surprise but do any of those people work at a big box store, at least for any length of time?  In our market the big box stores are where the people go to work who have no experience, were part of a failed business and now need to get a job, or are from the labor pool whom has do always be the low price because they lack the ability to do higher quality work.  There are some exceptions, as always, but if i had to bet money on a getting a high quality job and good service, I know where I wouldn't look.
Is this answer helpful?
