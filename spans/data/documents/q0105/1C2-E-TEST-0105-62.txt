As an employee of The Home Depot, I know that all associates are well-trained in customer service, and can get written up or even fired if their bad customer service skills are brought to a manager's attention. Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of people slipping through the cracks. It is unfair that those of us who excel at what we do get a bad reputation because of the few that don't. As far as product knowledge goes, I think people need to be more reasonable and understand that not every employee in the entire store can be an expert in every area of home improvement. I understand that it may be frustrating when you're in a rush and need an answer and the nearest person in orange can't give you one. We are all trained to greet every singe customer that we encounter, regardless of whether we're in our own department or not. So that person that said hello to you in the electrical department and couldn't give you advice on ceiling fan installation may have been a flooring or lumber associate on their way to the bathroom. That having been said, when you come across someone who is unable to help you, they are supposed to find someone who can and that's usually where the problem occurs.
