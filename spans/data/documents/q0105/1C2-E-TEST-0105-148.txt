Jobs at Home Depot
The Home  Depot has in business since 1978. The first store opened for business in  Atlanta, Georgia, on June 22, 1979.
From the beginning, this company  distinguished itself from hardware stores by offering a much larger number of  products under one roof.
The staff  working at Home Depot were provided with in-depth training. They also had the  know-how to offer clinics on popular Do It Yourself projects for customers.  That strategy has paid off handsomely; the company is now the fastest-growing  retailer in the United States. Home Depot has over 2,240 stores in the United  States, Canada, Mexico, China, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
