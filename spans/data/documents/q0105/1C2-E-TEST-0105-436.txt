STEP  1:  Know your closet space and your  needs.
Here  are a few questions to consider that will help you get started with your storage  project.
Measure your closet from front to back (depth),       side to side (width) and floor to ceiling (height).
Do you have longer hanging items like dresses  and coats (section B below), or more short items like shirts and blouses (section  E below)? (Determines how much hanging space is needed.).
Do you need shelves for boxes, sweaters or  linens (sections A & C)? (Determines how much stacking space is needed).
How many shoes do you have? (section D).
Do you need drawer space? (not shown)
STEP  2:  Choose a wire or laminate option to meet your needs, style and budget.
