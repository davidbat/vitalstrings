Yeah, I went to their web-site.
They appear to be a mid-Western deal.
I actuall prefer real hardware stores to the big-box ones.
This is a cool one in Dallas-no national affiliation (Tru-Value, etc), 60+ years in business, three employee-owned stores,

We have a really old hardware store in our town that has managed to survive.  If you ever need anything you can't find anywhere else ... they will have it!  That place is like a museum and a lot of fun to just look around in.  They have the same tough old ladies working there that have been there for decades ... they know exactly where every nut and bolt is.  I love that place!  I guess I'm a cheap date!  :)

@Mrs-You're sounding more attractive every minute. But I don't want Mr. Cleaver coming after me with, well, a cleaver.
