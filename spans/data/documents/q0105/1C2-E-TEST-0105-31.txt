Not to be outdone by Home Depot , which announced yesterday it will hire more than 60,000 seasonal workers, Lowe's, the smaller home improvement store chain, is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for its retail stores. That's up from the 43,000 temporary workers they brought in last year, and represents a 16 percent increase, according to various newspaper reports .
Most of those jobs will be part-time weekend positions, to accommodate the retailer's busiest days. But at least it's a foot in the door.
This announcement comes on the heels of Lowe's announcement two weeks ago that it would bring on 8,000 to 10,000 additional permanent part-time employees, averaging four to eight in each of its 1,725 stores. Some of their middle managers have been given the boot, however; Lowe's recently cut 1,700 of them.
In addition, Lowe's will add 275 more employees to the 700 already on the job at its corporate call center in Wilkesboro, N.C. Larry Stone, Lowe's president and chief operating officer, said there will be additional hiring at the North Carolina corporate facility, and they hope to have more than 2,000 employees there by the end of next year.
"It takes great people to provide our customers with outstanding service, whether they visit one of our stores, shop our website or contact us," said Maureen K. Ausura, Lowe's executive vice president of human resources . "The addition of new jobs ensures customers contacting Lowe's will receive speedy service from knowledgeable and well-trained associates."
In addition to the opportunities listed above, you'll find more in the Lowe's distribution centers as well, but you have to be able to lift up to 70 lbs; be 18 older and pass a drug screening and criminal background check .
One of the perks Lowe's offers employees is a mobile health unit that pulls right up to the stores and gives employees free basic health screenings and guidance about how to improve and maintain their health.
To find out more about job opportunities at Lowe's, you can log onto their website , where you'll find out more about the corporate culture, benefits, job openings , etc. You can apply online, but it's recommended that you show up in person at the Lowe's retail outlet, so you can meet the people who do the hiring in person. Run, don't walk down there, because they want their new seasonal employees to be in place by March.
