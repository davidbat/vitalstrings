Home Depot is associated with plans to build 5 dams on two rivers and more than 1500 miles of transmission wires through Chile's Patagonia region. Each year, Home Depot purchases $50 million worth of timber products from the Matte Group, which is the de facto owner of the  Chilean energy company involved in the dam construction project.  Despite pressure from many environmental organizations, shareholders, and consumers, Home Depot has yet to respond to this issue or distance itself from the Matte Group.

In April 2007, Home Depot introduced Eco Options, a line of products that they're promoting as environmentally friendly, including energy efficient lightbulbs and natural insect repellants.  The line currently includes 3,000 products but Home Depot hopes to increase it to 6,000 products by 2009, which would represent 12 percent of the company's sales. Unlike established certification sytems for environmental products which rely on third party evaluation, Home Depot will have complete control over what can be accepted into its Eco Options line.

In November 2001 Lowe's and Home Depot were called upon to stop selling arsenic-treated lumber to the public because of the wood's cancer-causing capabilities. According to the Healthy Building Network and Environmental working Group (EWG), pressure treated wood products sold by the retailers and sampled in 13 states contained an average of 120 times the amount of arsenic allowed in a 6 ounce glass of water by the U.S. EPA. The wood is treated with arsenic as a pesticide and to avoid rot, however according to the National Academy of Sciences exposure to arsenic causes lung, bladder, and skin cancer in humans, and is suspected as a cause of kidney, prostate, and nasal passage cancer.

In a formal letter to Home Depot’s Compensation Committee Chair, the AFL-CIO asked the company to take necessary measures to recover any improper stock option grants to executive directors. Additionally, the AFL-CIO is urging the resignation of co-founder and director Ken Langone, who oversaw the improper stock option grants from 1999 to 2000. These grants were made in violation of Home Depot’s stock option plan. Inquires about Home Depot’s stock options began in June of 2006 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In as many as five instances prior to December 2000, directors retroactively approved stock option grants to executives. Home Depot’s internal review found about $10 million of unrecorded stock option expense.

In August 2004 Home Depot agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle discrimination claims brought by workers at stores in Colorado. A complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleged female and minority employees were paid less and disciplined more severely than white males, and were passed over for promotion. Some employees who reported discrimination suffered retaliation and managers failed to investigate complaints, the EEOC said in its complaint. Home Depot denied any kind of misconduct but said it agreed to the payout as part of a voluntary mediation with the EEOC to avoid protracted and costly litigation.

In October 2002, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit against Home Depot alleging the company discriminated  against a black employee. The employee was fired from the company's Newport News Virginia store after she agreed to a plan to pay a new employee "under the table" in violation of the company's rules. However, according to the EEOC complaint,  another white employee, who was more responsible for the irregular payment, was promoted. The EEOC alleged that the black employee, who was a human resource manager,  should not have been fired before the white assistant store manager, who had a previous discipline record and helped come up with the plan to pay the new employee off the books.
