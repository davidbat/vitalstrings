With their enormous          advertising budgets even the most loyal hardware store patron can’t          resist purchasing from a Home Depot or Lowe’s. In the Big Box          Store or Local Lumber Yard article, I wrote about the          advantages of each from a purchasing experience. This article addresses          the installation services of these home improvement giants and          how they compare to your local contractor.
 
 
 
   Do Lowe’s and          Home Depot charge more than most local contractors for installation          services? I have found that the teaser price is just that, and the          actual cost is usually higher.
   Let's look at          a simple example. Suppose you want to replace your front door with          a new one. The basic installation price from either of these two box          stores is around $380. This is to remove the old door and install the          new one. However, you need to  consider the extra charges for          incidental work. If  you need someone to double check the size of          the door or the handing of the door, expect to pay another $25.00 to          35.00. To have someone come to your home and measure and check the          handing is done at for additional fee.
   Okay, so you          ordered the door from Lowe’s or Home Depot and paid the extra fee for          someone to come and measure the door. The employee arrives, replaces          the door, re-uses the old trim and casing. Wait, did you want to replace          the old water stained casing, too? That’s not included in the price          either. Expect another $95 to $100 for new casing.
   With a new          door and replaced casing, you’re set. You thank the Lowe’s contractor          and you’re so happy that forgot about the extra charges and you offer to          help him load the old door into his truck. He gives you a puzzled look -          he's not going to remove the old door for free...disposal of the old          door is an extra $30.00-$40.00. You realize you can’t load it into your          Prius and haul it to the recycling center, so you are now stuck for the          disposal charges. Let's see...no initial measure, advice, insulation,          caulking, door casing, touch-up painting, disposal or any other          incidental task related to the bargain door install you signed for. So          your basic install was just that…the installation.
   A reputable          contractor would never charge extra for looking at the job and offering          advice to a client.  Casings would be an extra as they are not always          needed - but disposal is always included, and never added on after the          job. You can expect to pay no more than $350 for a door install,          including measuring, caulking, insulating, and yes, disposal too.
   The Home          Depot or Lowe’s makes money on the product and the installer, so          common sense dictates the higher price. You haven’t escaped one of the          universal laws of value this time either…you get what you pay for - period.
