I prefer Lowe's  and given a choice will stop there before Home Depot.   I find help really hard to find at Home Depot and good help even harder.  I really think the only qualification for becoming an Orange Apron Guy is to fog a mirror and pass the pee in a cup test.
One thing I like about Lowe's is that they have "need help" buttons and they are apparently rated on them, as I've never had to wait more than 20 seconds for someone to show up.
I do service work in 5 counties so I get to visit a lot of each.
In my local two or three stores, I know the people who are knowledgeable and won't just give me a dumb look.
All that aside, I have a number of specialty stores that I frequent even more often.  Most are locally owned, one is a chain of small stores.  I'd be lost without them.  Their service is way beyond what you can find at the big box.  They greet me by name when I walk in the door.
Before the big boys moved in town we were plagued with one big box home center after another. God, they were all dreadful and I'm glad they all went bankrupt.
I confess: I'm a hardware store and tool junkie.

Don't believe just me, look at the 600 pages of replies here, including one by HD's CEO:
There are also innumerable stories of screw ups by Home Depot's approved contractors.
You can do it; we can't help.
