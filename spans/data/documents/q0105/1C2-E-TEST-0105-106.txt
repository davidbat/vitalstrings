Purchases through Deals.Woot don't count, because in that case you're not buying anything from us. And we don't have your account information for those purchases.
If you think you've bought something from Woot before and still can't vote, make sure you're logged in with the same account you used to buy from us.
Geez, why so negative?
You have to vote up more before you can vote down.
Don't get us wrong. Negativity has its place. And downvotes are just as essential as upvotes when it comes to making Deals.Woot a useful place to find deals.
But when your votes lean so heavily toward the dark side, we have to wonder. Go vote up a few things. Accentuate the positive for a little while. It'll do you some good, and it'll do the site some good, too. Then you can get back to dealing out the smackdowns, OK?
Too late, we all heard you!
Hmm... you're wanting to take your vote back?
Well, that's a bit tricky. See, we do a lot of stuff with your vote, using it to work out the popularity of what you voted for, compare that to all the other things voted on, tally up our leaderboard , work out your reputation. Someday we'll do a little cartoon showing just how hard your vote is working.
Anyway, taking votes back messes all that up, so we give you five minutes, in case you just mis-clicked. After that we've got to say no take-backs. Luckily, votes are free, so feel free to throw them around left and right wherever you see fit.
