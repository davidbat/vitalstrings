Home improvement retailer Home Depot said Thursday it has started to hire 70,000 seasonal workers for the spring , the company’s busiest selling and hiring season.
Spring is the busiest season for all home improvement retailers as home owners work on projects for their homes, gardens and lawns.
Job seekers can begin applying online now at this website . Hiring will begin ramping up over the next several weeks on a market-by-market basis, based on the needs of individual stores and as spring climates begin to approach, the company said.
Temporary positions can lead to permanent jobs, according to Tim Crow, executive vice president for Human Resources.
About half of The Home Depot’s 2011 seasonal hires stayed on in permanent positions as cashiers, sales associates, lot associates and garden associates, he said.
