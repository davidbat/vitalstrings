Home Depot, Lowes hiring for spring garden season
The Home Depot has announced it will hire more than 60,000 seasonal associates in Feburary and March -- in time for its second annual Spring Black Friday event.
Like the traditional Black Friday that occurs the day after Thanksgiving to unofficially start the holiday shopping season, Spring Black Friday marks the start of home improvement's busiest shopping season -- the spring.
(The date will vary dependingÂ on climate and geography. Check with your local store.)
During four different weekends in spring, prices on hundreds of spring products will be reduced, including a variety of live goods and lawn care, outdoor power, eco-friendly gardening products, and patio and grills.
The 60,000 part-timers are about the same number that were hired to ramp up for spring in 2010. Additionally, The Home Depot said it will be adding net new permanent full-time and part-time positions to its stores for the second year in a row.
Mooresville, N.C.-based Lowe's will also be hiring of part-time workers. According to various press reports, the company will hire 50,000 seasonal positions at its 1,750 stores. That's about 16% more hires than last year's spring ramp up.
