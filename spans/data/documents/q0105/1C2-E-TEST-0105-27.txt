The Home Depot is cranking up its hiring machine and plans to bring 60,000 workers on board in February and March in anticipation of the spring home-improvement rush, the retailer said today.
The company likened the spring home-improvement season to Black Friday after Thanksgiving for holiday sales.
“As we have stated in the past, spring is our Christmas and traffic is at its highest during this season,” said Craig Menear, executive vice president for merchandising, in a company statement.
It is the second year in a row the company will be adding net new full- and part-time positions, the company said.
Home Depot said its Spring Black Friday will be implemented on a market-by-market basis based on climate by geography.
The company did not say how many people it would be hiring per store. It has 2,247 stores and 300,000 employees around the world, including 20 stores in Orange County.
