I thinks it's about $9 to $10 an hour for regular associates, depending on your experience.
I remember something about Customer Service Specialists or some sort of name like that. They're like a department head and are supposed to know more info than I guess the typical workers in that department. They start out at about $11 to $12 an hour I think. Again, depending on experience.
