HD is ridiculous. But I hear Costco is pretty good.
Yes you are mostly right. Home Depot is not a very nice place to work for. Lowes does treat their employees better, way better. Both pay crappy unless you are in specialty sales. Lowes pretty much went to a lot of part timers so they dont have to pay benifits while HD still has all full time staff. Benefits are just about the same. They both use the same software to screen job applicants.
You are also right about HD used to pay good. Back in the 80s when they were a new company. They proudly advertised that they only hired ex contractors who knew their depts. They hired plumbers to work the plumbing dept and electicians to work the electrical dept. Today they all just hire any uneducated dumbo from the street who if asked a technical question would run for the hills.
Both stores have employees who the closest they ever came to home improvement was to hang a curtain rod for dear ol mom. Yet I hear customers ask them technical questions and Im just a nearby customer who listens to the blind leading the blind. I usually butt in and help the customers and Im only a customer myself.
And I agree that Costco is a good company to work for but probably nearly impossible to get into.
