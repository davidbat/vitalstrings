Seasonal hiring is over for retailers. Not so for home improvement chains. Their season is just beginning.
Home Depot and Lowe's are hiring tens of thousands of temporary workers for the spring, the Columbus Dispatch reported.
Home Depot plans to hire 70,000 seasonal workers for the majority of its 2,252 stores around the country, while Lowe's plans to hire 40,000 seasonal workers across its 1,714 U.S. stores.
"We have already begun hiring in warmer climates such as Florida," Stacy Lentz, a Lowe's spokesperson, told FINS. "We will continue to hire in other markets as the seasons get warmer."
Some of the open positions at Lowe's and Home Depot have been posted on the career pages of their websites. Both companies will add more positions in the upcoming months.
"Just as the Christmas rush and holiday hiring ends for many retailers, we begin recruiting for spring seasonal associates to help customers during our busiest selling season," Tim Crow, Home Depot's executive vice president for human resources, said in a company press release. "A seasonal job at the Home Depot can often lead to a regular position if you're passionate about customer service."
About half of Home Depot's 2011 seasonal hires stayed on in permanent positions, according to the Columbus Dispatch.
