WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Went to lighting and ask the worker, a ignorant man. His answer was a laugh since he had no common sense to give me an answer...he laughed. Typical of Home Depot hiring stupid people that cannot answer a simple question. I wanted to report him to the store manager but wasted enough time trying yo find help and get my supplies.
The man in hardware told us that  Dremel will cut thru nails, no it does not returned to Seguin store. Where Bud was very helpful in finding the correct tool.
Back to Lowe's for me!â€¦
