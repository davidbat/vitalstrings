Very poor customer service at this location.  The inventory is in dis-order, especially small items (different items mixed up in each box), torn packages, items not in marked slots.  Long check on lines or too few lines open.  No regard for customers time, they close down areas and don't allow customers to get the items they need.  Management unavailable to work out problems.  Next time I will choose another location (Grand Parkway) or Lowes.  Please start hiring associates with experience in their assigned areas and not just clerks to stock the shelves.  Plus consider doing stocking during non business hours.
Cons:Â Long lines, poor associate service, areas closed during reg. business hours
