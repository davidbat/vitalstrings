Be careful of whom you partner with!!!! See the following about the big splash Mr. Holmes was supposed to make with HD that has fizzled to zip.....zero....nada.

Getting Mike Holmes' stamp of approval would be a huge coup for any contractor. Landing him as a spokesperson for a roster of over 3,000 contractors is nothing short of brilliant. Home Depot's director of marketing Pat Wilkinson has managed to do just that.
Beginning this fall, the trustworthy star of HGTV's Holmes on Homes will be featured in Home Depot's campaign to raise awareness about its Installation Services team. The campaign was Wilkinson's brainchild and leverages Holmes' reputation perfectly. The resulting campaign includes TV spots featuring Holmes talking about the importance of hiring proper contractors - like the licensed members of the Home Depot team.
