Sponsorship
Giving back to the community
Being New Zealand’s favourite pizza delivery company is not just about delivering pizzas.                  It's also about giving back to the community. Domino's Pizza invests time and resources                  into assisting young Kiwis, and believes in supporting the local community and organisations                  that our customers care about. Please use the application form below to submit your sponsorship                  proposal. Your proposal will be forwarded on to your local Franchisee or if it is a national                  sponsorship proposal, to the Domino’s National Marketing Team.
Please note, it is at Domino's Pizza's discretion as to how/why it makes decisions                 whether to enter into a sponsorship agreement with particular parties. Compliance                 with the sponsorship guidelines does not automatically guarantee Domino's Pizza's                 commitment to a proposal.
