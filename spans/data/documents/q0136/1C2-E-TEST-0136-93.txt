It's a no go for me, the wife has been telling me to try this and how good they used to be and.....................nope no good, the bread was way overcooked and half a$$ed. The pizza had way to much sauce and wasnt good. We also had buffalo zingers and those tasted worse thawn tyson frozen chicken nuggets.  Ingredients - 2 stars Execution - 1 star Least favorite chain pizza
