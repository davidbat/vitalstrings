Of delivery areas, Because no one will deliver to me, each saying I belong to the others stores route.
I try to explain to them that the other store won't deliver ether but they wont deliver.
So I refuse to buy from them.
PROS: n/a
CONS: Won't deliver in my area

★☆☆☆☆ DO NOT ORDER HERE-IF YOU WANT TO EAT SOON

Not only 2 hours to deliver, but the first thing the half a retard of a delivery guy says is do you have a pen. No, can you go back upstairs and get one? seriously. Heres the best opening line for the future:"I am sorry i work for a completely incompetent organization here is the menu for your local pizza place." Also could not get anyone on the phone at homebase just to see if the order was ever coming
Pros: none
