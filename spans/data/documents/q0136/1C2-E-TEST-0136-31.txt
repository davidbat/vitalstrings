Internet Explorer 6, eh? Sadly, we can no longer support your outdated internet cruiser.
Why? Because it's old. Older than the iPod, older than Windows XP, even older than East Timor. So we're pulling the plug, and some site                 features might not work for you. Switch over to Firefox , Google Chrome , or the latest version of IE .
Sadly, we're no longer supporting IE7.
Why? It's old, and it just can't keep up with us anymore so we're pulling the plug. This means some site                 features might not work for you anymore. We recommend taking a look at Firefox , Google Chrome , or the latest version of IE .
