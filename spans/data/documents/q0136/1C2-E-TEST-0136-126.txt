CINCINNATI â€” Domino's Pizza Inc. says it's delivering around the clock in southwestern Ohio, where a franchise store is one of its first U.S. locations to remain open 24 hours a day.
A manager of the store near the University of Dayton campus says it began staying open 24 hours about a month ago. Manager Steve Martin says the store is offering a breakfast pizza with toppings like eggs, cheese and bacon.
Domino's spokesman Tim McIntyre says the first of the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based stores to remain open 24 hours also opened about a month ago in Manchester, England, and two other stores in England have since gone to 24-hour schedules.
McIntyre says company officials will be watching the performance of the stores closely in areas including sales and product offerings.
