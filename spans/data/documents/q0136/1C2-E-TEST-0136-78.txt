Police are using the same statute to go after Anthony Setzer, 32, as they would for someone accused of tampering with Halloween candy.

A gross video posted on YouTube showing a Domino's Pizza worker stuffing cheese up his nostril and waving salami under his rear end as he is making sandwiches has led to charges against him and a co-worker who recorded him, authorities said Wednesday.
Kristy Lynn Hammonds , 31, of Taylorsville and Michael Anthony Setzer , 32, of Conover are each charged with distributing prohibited foods. Police chief Gary Lafone says it is the same North Carolina statute that forbids any tampering with Halloween candy.
In the video, Setzer is making sandwiches while a giggling Hammonds narrates and urges him to "do it again, do it again" in putting the cheese up his nose. It appears he threw some of the cheese in the garbage but some went on a sandwich.
Setzer says: "This is Michael's special Italian sandwich."
