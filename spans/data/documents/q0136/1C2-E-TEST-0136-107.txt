Starting April 30, participating Domino's Pizza restaurants will offer an Artisan Pizza for free, as noted on its Facebook page. (If you miss it one day, check back, there will be more given away each day; limit one pizza per person.) That's tied with our mention from three weeks ago as the first free product we've seen from Domino's Pizza that didn't require a meal purchase. (We've seen several buy one get one deals in the past year.) Deal ends May 6.
