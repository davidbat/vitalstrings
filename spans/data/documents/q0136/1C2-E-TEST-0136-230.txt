THE MAGNETIC FIELDS
Songwriter Stephin Merritt enjoys working with themes: escape, country roads, vampires, miniatures. The Magnetic Fields’ House of Tomorrow (1992) featured all “loop” songs.

And, famously, there was 1999’s 69 Love Songs, a three-disc meditation on love.
There is no official theme for The Magnetic Fields’ tenth full-length release, Love at the Bottom of the Sea, but Merritt describes it as a return to their roots (synths!). In it, he challenged himself to use synthesizers...
