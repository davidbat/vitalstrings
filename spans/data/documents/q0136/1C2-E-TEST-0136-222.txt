UNHUMBLE PIE
Just as "all natural" has lost all meaning in packaged foods, the term "artisan" no longer signifies anything about a meal. Blame Domino's for delivering the death blow.
From the Los Angeles Times:
This week, Domino's Pizza introduced its Artisan Pizza line at its nearly 5,000 outlets across the country. It joined the trend of major companies in describing products as artisan.
Wendy's has its Artisan Egg Sandwich, Ralphs markets offers Private Selection Artisan Breads and Starbucks sells Artisan Breakfast Sandwiches.
Long ago, the term had old-world connotations: handmade, in small batches, perhaps with locally sourced ingredients. And it seems just recently we had a national consensus that anything assembled by minimum-wage burger-flippers wasn't properly described as artisanal. No longer: As the Times notes, Panera Bread is billing itself as "artisan fast food."
And now Domino's -- the chain that only a couple years ago launched its "Our Pizzas Are No Longer Completely Inedible" marketing push -- is getting in on the act.
"Russell Weiner, (Domino's) chief marketing officer, conceded that the new pizzas do not use specialty flours or wood-fired ovens associated with artisan baking," the Times reports. But he insisted ingredients like feta cheese and "Tuscan" salami put the new pies on a higher plane, making them "pizzas you have with a bottle of wine."
Maybe he meant to say a box of wine? If so, then yeah, that sounds about right.
POSITION:Â  No positions in stocks mentioned.
