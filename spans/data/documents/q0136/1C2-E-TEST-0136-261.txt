In a large bowl, dissolve sugar and salt in water.
Add oil and           flour and stir with heavy spoon for 1 minute.
Turn out to a lightly floured surface and           press into a circle.
Sprinkle yeast evenly over dough and             knead for 12 minutes.
Divide dough into portions: 6 oz. for Calzones,  18 oz. for 12 inch, 25 oz. for 15 inch
Roll each portion into a ball. You want a dough ball without visible seams except the bottom.
Place dough balls in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to proof for 1−2 hours             at room temperature to use the same day, or store in refrigerator to use the next           day.
Place dough ball on lightly floured surface, and lightly             flour the top. Use fingertips to evenly flatten out the dough ball. Work from the             edges to the center press dough into a 12" circle. Place both hands within the shell edge and stretch with fingertips and palms maintaining an even pressure. Or, use a lightly floured           rolling pin to stretch to desired shape.
Sprinkle cornmeal or             semolina on pizza peel (a wooden paddle with a handle to slide the pizza in             the oven) or a cutting board. The cornmeal allows the pizza to slide onto the           stone easily.
After topping the pizza, when you are ready to cook it. Shake the peel or cutting board to make sure none of the dough is sticking.
Carefully slide           the pizza into the oven.
Bake in a 500 degree oven for 20-25 minutes, until crust is golden.
 
Additional Information
Cooking pizzas with this dough should be done on a baking stone. Using a pan             will produce a very soft "doughy" crust. The stone in the oven should be             preheated to 500F for an hour prior to baking, and should be placed in the middle of the oven.
