If the Law Blog existed in 1993, we would’ve had a field day with this one. Back then Domino’s promised a discounted or free pizza if the delivery person didn’t arrive within 30 minutes of an order? Well a St. Louis woman involved in a car wreck with a Domino’s delivery person sued the company on the grounds that the 30-minute pledge led to accidents. Domino’s settled the lawsuit for what it says was in the seven-figure range, and, fearing a wave of similar lawsuits, abandoned the promise.
According to a story in today’s WSJ , Domino’s plans to bring the 30-minute gimmick back. Next weeks ads are slated to run carrying the tagline “You Got 30 Minutes” — meaning, you have 30 extra minutes to do what you will rather than having to prepare a meal.
But don’t run to the courthouse just yet, plaintiffs lawyers — the ad stops short of promising a thirty-minute delivery. The agency creating the campaign said there was no legally safe way to do it. “We knew the historical baggage that surrounded it, so the mission became, how do we use the equity that takes advantage of the historical link,” but is “appropriate” legally, said ad agency’s CEO. They’re now buttoned up legally: Domino’s lawyers have carefully vetted the new campaign and drivers are reminded to drive under the speed limit. Said Domino’s CEO: “I don’t want to be the captain of the ship that goes back into court.”
This isn’t the first time Domino’s has made an appearance on the Law Blog. The company’s founder is Thomas Monaghan , the founder of the controversial Ave Maria Law (click here for Law Blog Background on the controversial school).
