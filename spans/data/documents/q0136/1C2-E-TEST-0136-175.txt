THe Dominos in our small town does not honor this promotion. I do see the commercial on TV everday( several times I might add ) Commercial doesn't say this promotion is good in only certain areas. Then I feel all Dominos should honor this . Our coupons we receive ae for the New Artesian Pizzas, which I do not care for.So I don't get coupons for the 3 for $7.99 any more.
