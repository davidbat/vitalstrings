Get to the Chase:
Pros:
1) As usual...their pizza was delicious! Soft and yet firm on the crust, with delicious toppings and the right amount of sauce. TOO GOOD nommers
2) Their online website is AMAAAAZING! It tracks in real-time the progress of your order from prep, baking, quality check, to delivery!
3) Their website lists all the best deals for the day, so you can save $$ instead of paying their pricey regular options
Cons:
1) Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the pizza was not hot enough and the hot wings were terrible (all fat, no meat, and cold)
