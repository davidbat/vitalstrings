Burger King might be hogging all the attention recently with the death of that creepy king and the birth of its new California Whopper . But elsewhere in the world of fast food, Domino's seems to be readying for a pretty spectacular image transformation. The pizza chain is spreading the word about a new "Artisan Pizza" via (what else?) a pizza-box whisper campaign. A photo of said box is above. Domino's wants you to know, first and foremost, that they're not "black beret"-wearing artisans or anything like that... But that doesn't mean that they can't make artisan pizza, or personally sign your "handmade" pizza box as if it's a pair of New & Lingwood loafers. Let's just say it's a conceptually tricky campaign.
Anyway, back to the important details: According to GrubGrade's sources , the new menu item will be a rectangular, thin-crust pizza available in three varieties (Spinach and Feta, Sausage and Peppers, and Salami and Roasted Vegetables), and it's pretty damned good as well as cheap. Domino's is already training kitchen staff to make it, and the process involves actual rolling pins. Once this puppy gets released, you better believe we'll be back with a taste test.
