I leave in Lake Charles, La an I ordered a pizza @ 10:28pm, but when we got there @ 10:42pm they said they didn't have the order, but would make us another one. So we go back to the window @ 10:52pm they told us they didn't have our order an they shut down the ovens @ 10:30pm because they were ready to go home. All we ordered was a large 3 toppings pizza. For a multi million dollar company you would think they would have better service.

I ordered a large pizza, wings, garlic bread. The quality of the food was very poor. The pizza was cold and hard to bite into. The bread was also cold and hard to bite into. The wings tasted burnt.

Poor customer service.  Staff was rude and out of controle.  My order was incorrect and I called the store to explaine. The staff was rude and did'nt even acknowledge their mistake.  I then returned the incorrect order to the store and the staff was completely unprofessional.  At that point I no longer wanted my original order and I wanted my money returned.  The sales person slamed the money on the counter and told me to leave the store.  What was that!!! I have never encountered such outrageous, ridiculos, customer service.  Where was management??? Everyone makes mistakes but rude, inaproiate behavior is just unexcusable and unprofessional. Those employees need serious customer service training and or need to be fired.

I ordered 2 medium pizzas and a portion of cheesy bread at 7.46 pm and it was delivered at 8.52 pm and they were luke warm and the person whom took my order had a very bad attitude answering my questions and the matter was not dealt in a proffecianal manner and considering the economic situation  , you need to be a lot nicer to your guests as I am to mine.By the time we erceived the pizzas both my kids have already left home and could not wait any longer and this a horrible experience and we have been regular customers for years at this location(2389 King george Hwy) and I have not always been  very happy about the service. I hope for you business sake you improve your services
