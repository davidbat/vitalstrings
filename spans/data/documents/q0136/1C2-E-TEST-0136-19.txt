When they do it right, their food is good. But the service is horrible, they're very rude, and the folks at this location routinely completely mess up orders. Do yourself a favor and get pizza from a good place instead.

My order took over an hour to arrive, and when it got here, they tried to charge me for it again.  And they gave me the wrong soda.

Food was cold and 45 mins late. The delivery man refused to come up the stairs to deliver also. That's what I get for ordering dominos in the land of actual GOOD NY pizza!

Whenever I call Domino's it arrives within 20 minutes, and ever since the revamp their pizza is also delicious. Nothing to complain. Pretty impressive in my opinion.
