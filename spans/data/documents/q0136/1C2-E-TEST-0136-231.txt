Domino’s Pizza is my second favorite pizza place next to Pizza Hut. Their pizza isn’t too bad tasting, especially for the price. And the cheesy bread and chicken kickers are actually alright. I often order Domino’s Pizza online, their deliverly service is very good. Every time I order, there at my house within 20 minutes. Sometimes, they arrive in 10 minutes.
