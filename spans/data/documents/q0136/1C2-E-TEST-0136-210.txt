Social media is a powerful tool that marketers must master.
As everyone now knows, it doesn't take much to damage a brand in today's world of powerful social media tools. The scope, reach and speed with which harmful content can ricochet around the Web are truly alarming. Just like the Somali pirates at sea armed with automatic weapons, disgruntled users can leverage social media to hijack your company and take everyone aboard hostage.
Because of the interconnectedness of social media platforms and the rapidly growing expansion of personal-cluster networks, management teams can be tied up for weeks in such a crisis (metaphorically speaking), unable to do anything besides try to contain the damage. While the near-term harm can be localized to lost sales and productivity, the long-term damage can be severe and far-reaching, causing serious brand repercussions. This can affect brand trust, reputation and customer loyalty.
