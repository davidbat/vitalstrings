Alleged Domino's Pizza Arsonist Arrested
It took 60 firefighters to extinguish an early morning fire that engulfed a Domino's Pizza on Boston Road in the Bronx in August, but no one was injured. On Sunday, September 5th at 4:42 a.m., another Domino's on White Plains Road went up in flames, and once again it took 60 firefighters to bring the fire under control. But nobody was hurt, and the borough's intestines were unburdened of one more Domino's location. The anti-Domino's vigilante behind the fires melted back into the night, leaving Gotham's sinister "pizza" cartel wondering where he'd strike next.
However, before more Domino's could be reduced to ash (rendering them indistinguishable from their "pizza's" flavor), Fire Marshals arrested the alleged culprit, 24-year-old Jamal Thomas. They say Thomas had recently been training to be an Assistant Manager at Domino’s until he was terminated for violating company security protocols. The FDNY's press release doesn't say why Thomas was terminated, but Thomas subsequently returned several times to Domino’s locations in uniform "claiming to be a member of a secret Domino’s unit that measured employee satisfaction." At the time of his arrest, Thomas was carrying a loaded .357 stainless steel revolver, which is probably standard issue for all members of the Secret Unit.
Thomas is  charged with multiple counts of arson, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and a host of other charges. He faces up to 25 years in prison, and Domino's estimates the damages to both location totals over one million dollars.
