Where Did Kickers Go?
I loved Kickers. Why did you decide to get rid of them?
We wanted to give you the opportunity to customize the level of heat to your liking with one of our delicious dipping sauces. If you like the heat and flavor of Kickers, we recommend ordering our new Boneless Chicken with our Kicker Hot Sauce. If you prefer less heat, try our new Sweet Mango Habanero or BBQ Dipping Sauce.
We'd Like You To Know...
Domino's pizza made with a Gluten Free Crust is prepared in a common kitchen with the risk of gluten exposure. The National Foundation for Celiac Awareness supports the availability of Domino's Gluten Free Crust, but CANNOT recommend the pizza for customers with celiac disease. Customers with gluten sensitivities should exercise judgment in consuming this pizza.
Please note that our Philly Steak and Alfredo sauce are the only pizza toppings that contain gluten. For more info, click here.
