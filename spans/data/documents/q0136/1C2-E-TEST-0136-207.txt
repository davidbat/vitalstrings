I’ll be ordering this new one ASAP. My family is greedy for the Domino’s
2 Henry // Dec 16, 2009 at 9:38 pm
Too spicy or herby for me.  Maybe amount of change cut in half. Classic dominos was alright.
3 Meldo Laplard // Dec 16, 2009 at 11:03 pm
What took these putzes so long?  Geez, their pizza has sucked for years.
4 Brian // Dec 17, 2009 at 9:38 pm
A sweeter sauce? I haven’t had Domino’s in awhile, but the last time I did I remember thinking their sauce was already too sweet.
5 Rob // Dec 20, 2009 at 7:18 pm
I tried it tonight.  It will be my last pizza from Dominos.  Disgusting!
6 Alex // Dec 20, 2009 at 10:10 pm
My parents and I agree that the new sauce is WAY too spicy.We think that the old recipe was WAY better.GO BACK TO THE OLD RECIPE!!!!!!!
7 Lis // Dec 22, 2009 at 8:34 pm
If many people think it sucks, maybe they’ll try to pull a “new coke.”
8 Rich // Dec 24, 2009 at 4:18 pm
No way this pizza was amazing, just as how I’d like it.
9 Diane // Dec 30, 2009 at 12:15 am
Had the new pizza tonight. It was horrible. Very greasy and nasty taste!! Felt sick to my stomach after eating it. Was like they poured seasoned oil all over the pizza after it came out of the oven. I have loved Domino’s pizza since I worked there over 20 years ago. Not anymore!! We’ll drive to the next town to get Papa John’s for now on!!!!!!!
10 Arthur Bloberger // Dec 30, 2009 at 3:17 pm
Look, you can quibble about the subtleties of the crust and sauce if you want, but the problem with Domino’s has always really been the cheese. They’ve always said it was “100″ real, but God only knows what kind. It never even really melted properly before – you know how hot pizza cheese should be kind of stringy when you grab a slice? Their cheese has always been more like soft globules. And now they’re saying it’s “made with” 100% mozzarella with a hint of provolone. Well, what ELSE is it made with? I want 100% MOZZARELLA and PROVOLONE, not “made with.” I doubt I’ll give these deceivers a second chance, because I wonder how long it would take to get our money back if we actually asked for it?
11 Courtney // Dec 30, 2009 at 9:09 pm
I always thought Pizza Hut’s pizza sauce was too sweet, so I always ordered from Dominos. I wonder if they found out PH’s recipe and copied it, because the new sauce tasted just as sweet. In any case, there goes my favorite pizza.
12 Chris // Dec 31, 2009 at 12:26 am
Two years of focus groups and this is what they came up with. Same pizza covered with some seasoning and the crust brushed with garlic butter. Honestly there are some better quality frozen pizzas.
13 Zaxe Zoro! // Dec 31, 2009 at 12:50 am
My real name is Robert.
umm so i can’t believe that these comments are like soooo negative. 4 hrs after i saw that youtube ad i knew i just had to get it. cauz for me the old pizza was pretty good, but it got boring after a while and the crust wasn’t much fun eating.
so i got my pizza, a Medium Extra Pepperoni Pie and I gotta say that the crust was good
14 bloodlinefresh // Jan 1, 2010 at 11:09 pm
i’m officially a fan. loved it!
15 Albert // Jan 2, 2010 at 9:37 pm
I love thier new pizza it was excellent. Also, the crust is sweet and very good. That is one of the best crust on the market. I am digging the new pizza.
16 Anon-e-mouse // Jan 3, 2010 at 5:52 pm
The new sauce is waaaay to spicy for me and my family.  We ended up throwing out half of the pizza.
17 ken colorado // Jan 4, 2010 at 12:36 am
I got two of dominos pizzas today and was not at all impreesed. The pizza was greasy and did not have much in the way of flavor. The crust was soggy (under the toppings). was promised the pizza in 25 to thirty minutes and it almost an hour. The pizzza was almost cold. I did get my money back. Can’t say if the pizza would be any good if it was delivered hot and fresh. If I worked for Dominos I would quit. I could not work for a company that sold crap like this.
18 Laura // Jan 4, 2010 at 1:59 pm
It’s still chain-quality, but better than the old recipe.  The cheese is still gobbly but has a little more flavor.  The sauce has kick, but might be too much for a lot of people.  The crust ends taste like garlic bread.
19 Terri // Jan 4, 2010 at 8:29 pm
I was really excited to try the new recipe pizza at Domino’s and then I bit into it.  Ick!  We actually gave away our second pizza.  Neither my son nor I liked any of it.  The sauce was not sweet at all and actually too spicy!  The crust was blah!  Sad and disappointing!
20 tom // Jan 4, 2010 at 11:37 pm
i no doubt wasin th e minority not knowing about the change before i last ordered one, the new sauce blows really. guess i will be getting more pizza from PH or local places now.
21 Pizzaguy // Jan 5, 2010 at 2:36 pm
My family and I tried it last week and it the spices are overpowering.  Too garlicy and way too many herbs.  Go to a NY pizzeria and you won’t find garlic and herbs brushed all over the crust.  Why can’t you fast food pizza places get it right????  Dough, sauce, cheese (real cheese)… Doesn’t sound too difficult.
22 Charles // Jan 5, 2010 at 5:09 pm
Sauce is too spicy. I don’t like the red pepper.
23 Kevin Kau // Jan 6, 2010 at 2:50 pm
I am not sure why people don’t like it the old pizza used to taste like cardboard & this new pizza is awesome we love the crust..
24 Fuck This Pizza. // Jan 6, 2010 at 7:11 pm
No Joke. This new pizza is pathetic. The sause was decent at best. But the crust? It’s like a fatass was in charge of designing the new texture and taste. I feel SICK to my stomach after eating 2 slices. It is absolutly disgusting. Take a look at it. It is so god damn greasy, and it seems as if it makes the whole pizza is grasier as well. and I will be eating Papa John’s till they change it back.
25 ph dom papa // Jan 6, 2010 at 7:34 pm
i actually liked it pretty much. if you get extra cheese, you will not notice the sweet sauce. crust is more fun to eat. its like eating garlic breac. B+ for this.
26 Grimmbear // Jan 6, 2010 at 8:27 pm
I loved the new Pizza. Granted I can’t eat the red sauce so I got a white Pizza but I really enjoyed it and I can’t remember EVER saying that about Domino’s before.
27 WeiÃŸer Tee // Jan 7, 2010 at 12:32 am
That looks nice. I love Domino’s pizzas. Moreover, Domino’s has opened a new outlet nearby my abode. So was wondering to visit it for new year’s new pizza.
28 madison // Jan 8, 2010 at 1:06 am
VERY GOOD!!  The sauce is not “too sweet” as others bemoan.  The herbs and light spice balance any sugar in the sauce.  The crust is a bit greasier than the original, but no where near as greasy as Pizza Hut.  Additionally, the crust is seasoned well, so you actually want to eat the entire crust and not leave the ends.  You really can taste the overall quality in the ingedients.  Bravo Domino’s.  I am a fan again.  ALL THE NAYSAYERS ARE HYPER SENSITIVE CURMUDGEONS.
29 Eick // Jan 8, 2010 at 12:33 pm
For anyone who isn’t crazy about the new sauce or garlic crust I just wanted to give you a heads up on options available:
sauce – if the new sauce has a little too much kick for you, trying ordering with “hearty marinara” its more similar to the old sauce.
crust – if you are a vampire or have a hot date and don’t want garlic on the crust, you can call the store and request a pizza without the new garlic seasoning.
30 sunny // Jan 9, 2010 at 4:43 pm
Way too spicy…..very hot and I actually like hot stuff….this new sauce sucks……
What is Dominoes doing……I predict this will go the way of “New Coke”
31 Spencer // Jan 9, 2010 at 8:43 pm
I just finished trying to eat the new pizza.  It tasted like italian sausage which I hate.  Won’t eat there again until they realize they screwed up and change back to the original.
32 98Grand // Jan 9, 2010 at 10:18 pm
Too spicy… The new recipe is a train wreck.  No more Domino’s for me.  Too bad.  I had been customer for 25 years.
33 Norm // Jan 10, 2010 at 11:07 am
The new pizza still suck, you can buy better frozen pizza cheaper.
34 baby spice // Jan 10, 2010 at 5:50 pm
I don’t see how the sauce was “too spicy” at all.
I liked the new sauce and cheese, but the garlic crust wasn’t that great… It was good on the first slice, then it just got kind of annoying after a while.
I love the new pizza, but next time I’ll definitely be ordering it without the garlic crust..
35 sevenalive // Jan 11, 2010 at 12:06 pm
I haven’t ordered pizza from a chain in 3 years. Ask your friends about their favorite local pizza place. I found 3 great local places that know how to make a pizza and i found my perfect place and they also have killer wings.
I won’t bother trying the new dominoes, they suck just like the old dominoes. All of the pizza places went downhill 12 years ago.
36 Mah Dixie Wrecked // Jan 11, 2010 at 2:56 pm
I loved Dominoe’s pizza for the last 4 years, so I ordered from them around the 19th of December. I was absolutley startled when I opened the box. It was all brown and smelled quite different than the normal pizza. I took a slice and ate it, and the best thing to say was thank goodness I only ordered a medium. I got to the crust it was waaay to overpowering. If I wanted fuckin garlic smeared on my crust, I would’ve just ordered garlic bread.
37 PoopStewart // Jan 11, 2010 at 9:09 pm
It was okay pizza.  Sauce was pretty good, it seemed pretty neutral with a teency bit of a spicy kick.
Only problem is the dillholes did not put the garlic on the crust so it was dry..
38 becbud // Jan 12, 2010 at 10:36 am
New crust…not a fan. Everything else was ok, and really typical dominos. We order from there because it’s cheap, and with 5 kids we need cheap pizza. And for those that say try the local joints…we do have 2 decent ones in our small town, but the others, are like cardboard crusts with ketchup for sauce and they actually use american cheese! What’s up with that, it’s like cafeteria food! (And Nasty at that!)
39 Adrian // Jan 13, 2010 at 1:05 am
I actually didn’t mind Dominos before this change.  The new pizza is bloated, smothered with garlic and parmesan, and loaded with grease.  I still detected the same flavor from the old pizza but did think the sauce was a bit spicier.  Overall, it was nothing spectacular and I will avoid it because of how messy it is to eat.
40 chompchomp // Jan 13, 2010 at 8:02 pm
Not really a fan of the new Dominos pizza.  The old recipe wasn’t fantastic but it wasn’t really all that bad.
The taste seems like they’re trying to mask sub-par ingredients (likely the same base sauce and crust recipes as before) with spices and gimmicks.  And that’s just it.. it didn’t seem like an improvement.  Even if I thought it tasted better (which I didn’t) it just seems like the “new recipe” is a gimmick.
Use good quality ingredients, keep it simple and don’t try to jazz it up by turning your pizza into garlic bread.  If they wanted to revamp their recipe, they’d use better quality ingredients.  But I guess that just isn’t profitable enough..
41 Barbara // Jan 15, 2010 at 11:00 pm
WAY TOO GARLICKY. HAD TO RE-ORDER
AND THEN THE SAUCE WAS TOO SPICY
42 eric // Jan 16, 2010 at 11:10 pm
JUST GOT THE NEW PIZZA TONIGHT, I MADE SURE IT WAS THE NEW PIZZA AND BEHOLD NOTHING WAS DIFFERENT, NO GARLIC BUTTER ON CRUST NO DIFFERENT TASTE AT ALL, CALLED THEM ON THE PHONE AND THEY JUST PLAYED DUMB.
I BELIEVE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF ALL THERE OLD CRAP AND MIX IT WITH THE NEW CRAP. SO BEWARE.
43 Pizza King // Jan 17, 2010 at 6:10 pm
The old pizza tasted like ketchup, cardboard with some cheese thrown on top, this pizza is 100 times better.
44 Steph // Jan 19, 2010 at 8:38 pm
WOW I used to enjoy the old pizza and I tried the new pizza late last night AWFUL! there were soooo many different spices on the damn thing I couldn’t enjoy it not to mention when I woke up this morning I started throwing up soo much. all of the freaking spices they used on the pizza and the crust had soooooon much garlic on it I only ate 1 piece and brought the rest back …. I Still feel  sick … They almost didn’t give my money back but I made sure they did I can promise you 1 thing … I’m NEVER eating Dominos crap AGAIN! Bring the old pizza back and then we can talk.
45 GGsquared // Jan 21, 2010 at 12:10 am
New recipe is awful.  Way too spicy!  The old recipe wasn’t great, but it was better than this mess!
46 byrdseyevue // Jan 21, 2010 at 7:54 pm
Not bad at all. I liked the spice. The only problem is that the new sauce is way too sweet. If that weren’t the case I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’d order from Dominos. You can even do it on-line and watch a time line from prep through delivery. I live in a bit of a hard to find place and they beat their ealiest estimate by 10 minutes. I haven’t tried the Marinara sauce- any thoughts?
47 Molly // Jan 22, 2010 at 9:51 pm
Hate the new pizza.  I really liked the old one– i liked the sweet sauce.  Now the sauce is too spicy (not too hot for me, but it doesn’t fit for what i want in a pizza sauce).  the cheese was okay– but it didn’t really seem to melt, it just congealed.  I didn’t even make it to the crust because everything seemed to too greasy, so I just gave up.  Probably won’t return the pizzas, but won’t be ordering again
48 JimmyG // Jan 23, 2010 at 2:29 am
I thought it was great! Tasted wonderful and way better than before! However, after eating it I had diarhea and stomach cramps and some fierce gas for the rest of the day and the next. So, I don’t think I will ever eat Domino’s again. Even if they change back.  I never liked the old pizza. The new pizza tasted great it just played hell with my insides! :-X
49 james // Jan 25, 2010 at 5:27 pm
dominos has ruined their pizza! Gave it a 2nd try last night..horrible!   ordered it this time without the garlic on crust.  just as bad as first experience.  cheese has no flavor and doesn’t melt right.  stomach cramps all night.  Sad..have been a dominos customer for 25 years. It is really stupid to change a winning game plan.
50 Jason // Jan 26, 2010 at 10:01 am
The sauce is way too spicy… The old sauce was much better.  For 50 years the old recipe kept them in business.  I think this was a bad move!
51 RobertL // Jan 28, 2010 at 2:52 am
For all the naysayers of New Domino’s Pizza, take a quick look at your other options from major chains.  Papa Johns is Ok and you say the new Pizza is greasy…come on.  Pizza Hut is Greasy.  As a former Pizza Hut lover, the New Domino’s Pizza is good enough to pull me away from Pizza Hut.  Great Job Domino’s.  Also, the sauce is not too spicy, its one component of what was needed to fix a bland piece of cardboard

Awful! Way too much garlic and salt! Couldn’t tell if it was sweet or not or spicy hot or not… couldn’t get past the garlic. My husband and I had 2 slices each out of a large and thrw the rest away. YUCK!
54 Kevin // Feb 4, 2010 at 7:20 pm
Too spicy?  The pizza I got was incredibly bland.   The sauce is completely without flavor.  Domino’s has just sealed it’s fate.  They’re done.
55 Emile // Feb 7, 2010 at 1:41 pm
The pizza is a huge disappointment. It’s funny how their the adds say their pizza taste like cardboard but they decided not to change the recipe. They just doused it in garlic sauce. It’s kinda like putting steak sauce on a bad steak.
56 Ellen // Feb 12, 2010 at 10:11 pm
I love the new pizza!  I don’t understand why people think it’s too “spicy” or “garlicky”, but then again, these are the same people who grew up on bland food.  The crust really makes this pizza a notch above the other chains.
57 Nicki // Feb 14, 2010 at 7:38 pm
Holy Spicy and gritty….each bite your teeth grit on nothing but crushed red pepper out of a can….horrible!  Will never order again.
58 Wade // Feb 14, 2010 at 7:43 pm
OMG… the sauce is WAY too sweet! I have never tasted a sauce that sweet. It ruins the whole experience. Too bad.
59 ejp // Feb 14, 2010 at 8:46 pm
For 20 years I was a loyal Dominos customer precisely BECAUSE I liked the fact their crust wasn’t greasy like every cheap hole in the wall pizza joint I was familiar with.    Those who call it “Cardboard” must have an obsession with wanting to come away with bad breath all the time and slimy fingers, beacuse I absolutely hate the new crust, so much that I will never order a Dominos Pizza again for the rest of my life.    And I frankly find it insulting to be told by Dominos in their advertising that for 20 years I’ve been enjoying a lousy product.
60 Pete // Mar 5, 2010 at 2:01 am
I loved the old pizza for 20 years and now they ruined. I ordered the Dominos for ever friday night for the past 20 years and will never order again. I’m switching to Pappa Johns until they bring back the old recipe.
61 Chris // Mar 5, 2010 at 8:23 am
beware…I ate dominos 2 days ago, and im still shitting OIL !!!
62 Jorge // Mar 6, 2010 at 9:48 pm
The folks who are saying that the pizza is too spicy have no taste whatsoever and should stick to wonder bread and ketchup
“pizzas”… maybe those disgusting mass market frozen “pizza roll” things.  The new pizza is simply awesome and tastes like something you would get at one of your better neighborhood mom and pop pizzarias.  I am actually really surprised that they changed the pizza from the bland fare for the mindless sheep to something that is actually delicious!!  Hope it lasts.
63 Peter // Mar 14, 2010 at 10:59 am
We decided to give Domino’s a try last night, we haven’t eaten Domino’s for years because the pizza was, well not very good bad sauce, cheese was not very good, and very greasy. So we ordered it last night and it has improved alot! We enjoyed it and the change, changed my perception of Dominos unless they go back to the old recipe ofcourse. Way to go Dominos you are atleast trying and have surpassed greasy Pizza Hut and the terrible tasting Papa John’s.
64 stew // Apr 18, 2010 at 10:37 pm
Hands down the worst pizza ever. too garlicky, oily and smells horrible. made me sh*t the whole next day, and only had a slice and a half! I threw the rest out.
get a spinning pizza cooker and a frozen or homemade pizza, great $ saver.
65 vicki // Apr 21, 2010 at 5:13 pm
Me and my husband were excited to try the new Dominos pizza. It was all over the commercials, and so many people were trying it, so might as well give it a try. We were both surprised! Not in a good way. It was very greasy, and the cheese was very weird. I only ate about 2 slices, and I couldn’t eat anymore.
So we wanted a refund, and they happily gave it to us. I am disappointed, because I thought this was a good change. The pizza overall tastes very very greasy, and the cheese didnt taste like real cheese.
Ever since then, me and my husband haven’t ordered at Dominos….
66 Me // Jun 22, 2010 at 11:36 am
Dominos still gives you the option (via their website and over the phone as well I’m sure) to choose the original sauce. Gotta give them props for trying something new, and getting rid of the cardboard crust..so I have heard anyways, I still have not tried it. But, I have pulled up the site to order, and there was the 2 options you could choose for the sauce. So, yeah maybe I’ll try it later , but I â™¥ Pizza Hutâ™¥ so uh…yep
67 Jim // Oct 12, 2010 at 8:03 am
I don’t know what half of these people are talking about… I hated Dominos old pizza recipe, but their new specialty pizzas are some of the best pizzas that I have tasted in awhile, and coming from New York, and being a New Yorker,  I know good pizza! Good work Dominos! The new crusts and pizzas are excellent! Your Philly Cheese Steak, Pacific Veggie, and Buffalo Chicken pizzas are heaven! Quality ingredients, quality taste, and great new recipes! I usually hate BBQ sauce, but was shocked at how good your BBQ Chicken specialty pizza was… A good decision, to change from that crap you were selling as pizza before, this stuff is excellent…
And for those who are claiming their sauce is too this, or this is too greasy, go to their website, you can literally customize your pizza in any way imaginable! And their pasta bread bowls… Mmmm!
I just can’t believe how many negative reviews there are, considering everyone I have gotten to try it… ALL NEW YORKERS, who live and breed pizza, loved it!
68 ejp // Nov 4, 2010 at 4:21 pm
Sorry, the new pizza sucks and is only good for those with an obsession for wanting bad breath and slimy fingers.
69 Scott // Jan 17, 2011 at 3:49 am
I have eatin’ alot of pizza. I did like Domino’s pizza at one time. When ya’ll re-did the sauce your pizza SUCKS. I ate it for a long time with the old sauce now it is too sweet. You should offer the old sauce to what was a loyal comuster. Everytime I ask for old sauce the places say we don’t have it anymore. I have tried it several times since ya’ll changed the sauce. I will never eat it again with the new sauce. And another thing is it kinda’ sucks you tell me that you made a bad pizza for so long how did ya’ll stay in business. Now, it is a; sweet, greasy, round piles of dough. People and places make choices your SUCKS and you lost a comuster for life or what is the rest of mine.
70 Vonni // Feb 10, 2011 at 12:15 am
I never really ate Domino’s before their makeover, and it’s… alright.
I’m not a fan of the sauce, it’s got a little too much spicy and sweet for a pizza sauce. Whatever happened to savory?
The cheese is skimped on and the toppings, (PARTICULARLY BACON) seem to fall off.
Also, the pizza always seems as though the toppings have been carelessly skewn onto the pizza, so that they burn. I shouldn’t really be able to see the sauce clearly.
The crust is the only good and unique thing, really. It’s decent, but I’d order Papa John’s instead. It’s just so much cheaper at Domino’s.
71 rk // Nov 5, 2011 at 2:03 am
during the summer i decided to get Domino’s, i use to love it as a kid but when i moved i switched to Double Double and haven’t had Domino’s for 10 years.  Over all it was horrible, the sauce is nowhere near as good as it use to be, way too sweet, and whatever oven they use doesn’t melt the cheese properly.
I’m from Canada, so i don’t know if their recipe is the same as in the sates, but it’s definitely not the same one they use to have.
