The service here is beyond appalling. The staff is rude. I live in the neighborhood and I've eaten here and gave this place 3 chances on different occasions when I'm in a rush, in need of a quick bite out of hunger. I pointed to and order a simple pizza, I just want to get it and go, instead he gets the pizza type wrong anyway even though it's staring straight at him in the face and I'm pointing directly at it, takes his sweet time getting it and putting it in the oven and taking it out in between chatting with his pals, I'm getting irritated, guy gives me attitude and talks back to me when I tell him he's getting me the wrong pizza and charges me the wrong price then tries to blame me for the error and makes snide remarks. Second ocassion similar thing, bad attitude by the same guy and slow service, non of his co-workers seem quick to correct the situation. The first time I went there I didn't get attitude but they took at least 10 minutes to get me a cheese pizza and walked around half the time doing nothing when there's a line of customers.  There's always plenty of staff so I see no excuse for a slow service and standing around doing nothing.
