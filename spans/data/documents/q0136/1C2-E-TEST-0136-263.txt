You just know they wanted to call this one Pizza Ninja. Domino's mobile game for the iPad, Pizza Hero , lets players rise through the cheesier pizza making ranks and become a Pizza Hero.
The challenge: "Make top quality pizzas by kneading dough, spreading sauce, sprinkling cheese, placing toppings and more as you race against the clock. Compete against other pizza makers on the Game Center Leaderboards. Share your achievements, scores, and pizza maker profile on Facebook and Twitter. Even make a pizza and order it from Domino's," as pizza-lovers have been doing in the U.K. since August .
