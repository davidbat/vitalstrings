* Paid Training with Potential Bonus Earnings
* Career Advancement Opportunities
* Meal Discounts
* Health/Dental/Life Insurance
Most of us only know a couple of things about the Dominos Pizza chain. We know that a phone call to the local Dominos will get us a pizza, hot and fresh, maybe some wings and bread sticks and possibly a couple liters of Coke.
What we generally fail to think about is that there are other people working there besides the person who shows up with a sign on the top of his or her car expecting a fair tip for their speedy service. Someone has to answer the phone, order the supplies, set up the schedule, make that pizza, cook those wings and keep the store clean and tidy.
There are managers, team leaders, cooks, bookkeepers and oftentimes an outside service that maintains the facilities sanitation. They all pitch in and do all the various tasks that make it possible for us to make a call and get that round delight delivered to us in a timely manner.
When you consider some of the benefits, you realize it's not hard to attract quality employees. Here are some of the benefits that are offered:
* Flexible Schedules
* Paid Training with Potential Bonus Earnings
* Career Advancement Opportunities
* Meal Discounts
* Health/Dental/Life Insurance
Managers set the schedule, order the products and supplies and give general over site to the entire operation. Team leaders run the shifts, make sure that all aspects of the restaurant are covered during their shift. If someone is unable to come in for some reason or other, they have to find a replacement to work their shift.
The cooks are trained in the proper methods to make sure that the food comes out the exact same way each and every time and the same as every other Dominos store as consistency in the product is uber important to a restaurant chain and your trusty bookeeper makes sure you have that paycheck on Friday.
If you were to go to ezinearticles (google it if you are unfamiliar with them), you'll see some articles written by Will Stone.  That's a ghost name under which we write.  You'll find articles about Dominos Jobs as well as the other companies with which we have a relationship.  The following article was written and published a while back.
Enjoy.

Domino's Pizza Delivers On Fire Trucks
National Fire Safety Program Expands to College Campuses This Year
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- That's right! Domino's Pizza, the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, is continuing their partnership with the National Fire Protection Association in an effort to deliver the message of fire safety to homeowners, and now college students, with the help of America's Dairy Producers, across the nation.
"By teaming up with Domino's, we have been able to reach more people with important fire safety information to help them learn about what they can do to prevent fires," said Lorraine Carli, vice president of Communications for NFPA. "It's hard not to pay attention to safety tips when they are delivered to your door with pizza!"
Every year, Domino's encourages consumers to change the batteries on their home smoke alarms during Daylight Savings Time. As part of the campaign, customers who order from participating Domino's Pizza stores in October may be surprised when their delivery arrives aboard a fire engine. If all the smoke alarms in the home are working, the pizza is free. If a smoke alarm is not working, the firefighters will replace the batteries and/or smoke alarm and leave the home with a fully functioning fire safety device.
This year, Domino's is kicking-off their annual fire safety program in conjunction with Fire Prevention Week, Oct. 4 - Oct. 10. Participating markets across the nation, including Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Green Bay, Houston, Los Angeles, Louisville, New York City, Orlando and San Diego areas, will deliver the message of fire safety throughout the entire month of October.
"Domino's Pizza stores across the country are more excited than ever to team up with their local fire department," said Domino's spokesperson Jenny Fouracre. "In fact, there will be more fire truck deliveries made this October than all of the deliveries made last year for Domino's fire safety program."
But, it doesn't stop there! Domino's continues to expand the fire safety program and this year, they began reaching out to college students. As college campuses around the U.S. celebrated Fire Safety Day and executed mock dorm room burns, Domino's delivered pizza with dorm room fire safety tips. Together with the NFPA, Center for Campus Fire Safety and America's Dairy Producers., including local state and regional organizations such as the American Dairy Association and Dairy Council, Domino's delivered pizza to over 5,000 students on seven college campuses, including Arizona State University, Babson College, Georgia Tech, Northwestern University, Texas A & M, University of California Los Angeles and University of Southern California.
"The Center for Campus Fire Safety could not be happier with the commitment that Domino's Pizza has made to the young adults in our colleges", said Paul D. Martin, President, Center for Campus Fire Safety, "By providing these pizza parties in conjunction with our educational Campus Fire Safety events, Domino's is providing added incentive for the students to participate and ultimately learn these vital safety messages.

Hungry? Just pick up your remote.
Domino’s Pizza (DPZ: 7.65, -0.3, -3.77%) and TiVo (TIVO: 9.09, -1.68, -15.6%) have teamed up to let subscribers order pies right from their televisions.
Launched Monday, this new free service for TiVo subscribers with a broadband Internet connection lets users order pizza and even track delivery timing all from their remote.
"This is the first step in the future of customer interactions with the brands they seek to engage with and buy from. This is the first time in history that the 'on-demand' generation will be able to fully experience couch commerce by ordering pizza directly through their television set. You'll see a television ad for Domino's and you'll click 'I want it' through your remote. In about 30 minutes, your pizza will show up at your door,” said VP of precision and print marketing at Domino's Rob Weisberg.
Think it might be hard to type in your address on that tiny remote? Subscribers also have the option to go to Dominos.com and register for an account for a login they can just enter instead.

And for those feeling too much like a couch potato, there’s also an option for in-store pickup.
TiVo has other interactive features as well, including the ability to shop Amazon.com (AMZN: 79.32, -2.28, -2.79%), said Bressner, or look up movie listings and order the tickets on Fandango.
This is not the first landline-ordering alternative for Domino's Pizza, which also allows customers to order pies over the web or from their cell phones.
Pizza Hut, one of Domino’s competitors, also allows online and mobile ordering of pizza, but takes it a step further with text-message ordering.  Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands (YUM: 34.49, -0.56, -1.6%).
TiVo is a digital video recording service that lets subscribers tape their favorite shows and pause live TV.
