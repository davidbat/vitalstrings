Burger King's Pizza Burger vs Dominos Cheeseburger Pizza
So the battle stage has been set as Burger King unveiled their Pizza Burger at their Whopper Bar in New York.
"This premium sandwich is designed to be shared and pays homage to the city it calls home"
Now Im not from New York, but I would venture to say most New Yorkers would not appreciate this homage. I dont know why but the thought of a 2,520 calorie burger (even if it is meant to be shared) with Burger King grade peperoni just doesnt sound appealing. Also I think its the fact that this food looks like fake plastic kids food. I know fast food never looks like its supposed to in the ads, but at least it generally looks appetizing.
In fact the Dominos Cheeseburger Pizza that debuted a while back actually sounded and looked more appealing.
I mean its really not that big of a stretch to make a pizza into a cheeseburger. Its already got cheese, tomatoes and bread...all it needs is ground beef and youre good to go. But a burger into pizza?!?! Thats just madness!!!
But I think we all know what needs to happen...someone needs to purchase both of these and have a hybrid fast food taste test. I would do it myself but not eating beef and not living in New York makes it pretty impossible...plus I want to live to see 30.
Anyone want to man up and put their arteries on the line in the name of science?
