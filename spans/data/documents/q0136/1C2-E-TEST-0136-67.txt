Lauryn Hill: I Didn't Pay Taxes Because I Faced "Danger" And Went "Underground"
Domino's Gets All Artisan On Your Pizza
Is Domino's having an identity crisis? First they admitted their pizzas taste like cardboard , then they brought back the Noid , and now they're trying the artisan hat on for size...sort of. The chain is introducing a new line of "Artisan" pizzas, promoting them with a pizza box campaign insisting "We are NOT artisans" (No black berets or wood-fired ovens here, no sir!)—they just have enough "passion and integrity" to trick you into thinking they are. The most ridiculous touch? Each box comes signed by the pimple-faced 19-year-old who made it, like some kind of Picasso print.
As for the taste, well, here's what to expect : A rectangular shaped-thin crust pie ("Don’t expect char or bubbling or anything like thatit’s still Domino's"), with less cheese than normal, in three flavors (no substitutions allowed!): spinach and feta, sausage and peppers, and salami and roasted vegetables. Overall, the $8 pie was "pretty darn good," so who knows? Maybe the chain will replace the dearly departed Motorino in the hearts of artisanal-anything-loving Brooklynites. [via Esquire ]
