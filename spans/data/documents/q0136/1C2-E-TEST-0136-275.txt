Bringing a taste of New York to North Carolina
Our focus is making the best pizza possible.
Here at The Original N. Y. Pizza we make pizza just like they do up in the big apple. Why travel several miles when you take a short drive to the best pizza place in town. We offer a wide variety of selection from our Calzones to Pizza Wraps and even our popular Sicilian pizza. So if you craving some New York style pizza just stop in and experience the taste. We pride ourselves in using the finest cheese and the best tomatoes for that fresh taste that our customers have come to expect. All our vegetables are fresh, not in a can and our dough is made daily on our premises. We opened our first N. Y. Pizza in 1991 and due to our great pizza we have opened 4 additional locations since then. We now have a total of 5 locations which include 3 in Cary 1 in Holly Springs and 1 in North Raleigh. Go to our Locations Page to find directions to our stores.
