Domino's in the Netherlands thought they'd go ahead and be all green and whatever by buying a bunch of electric pizza delivery scooters, but then it turned out the things were totally silent when running and were dangerous for pedestrians and bikers. Way to save the environment, guys. Anyway, their solution to the problem was to record a guy saying things like "vroom" and "pizza" and "lekker" (Dutch for yummy) and "Dominos Dominos Dominos" and play the audio as the scooter tooled around town. Watch below as the so-called Safe Sound scooter surprises unsuspecting Dutch bikers.
