"DOMINO'S DELIVERS"?!
Sure, if its for an every day order for Pizza.
But for my daughters very special 4 yr old birthday party, not only did they NOT deliver, but did NOT call me prior to let me know so i could make other plans!!
Area parents: DON'T CALL DOMINO'S FOR PARTIES - THEY WILL LET YOU DOWN!!
