BTW if only the "new" domino's pizzas looked like the ones in this commercial with theï»¿ stretchy cheese and all that. but they obviously made that special for the commercial. What they don't realize is that once you get it and realize "Oh wait, it's not that different from before" it will likely be the last time you waist your time with domino's... It's sad too, that was my favorate pizza as a kid.
