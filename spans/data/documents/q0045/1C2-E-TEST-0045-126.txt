Due to "lack of room" NYC Police Officers, Port Authority Police Officers, FDNY Firefighters and EMS Personnel are not invited to the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 at Ground Zero.
This is a painful insult for many of the approximately 3,000 men and women who risked their lives, limbs and lungs on that monumental day, puncturing another hole in a still searing wound.
Please tell Mayor Bloomberg that this is so wrong, in so many ways and to reverse this decision immediately!
We the undersigned are dismayed at your recent announcement that NYC Police Officers, Port Authority Police officers, FDNY Firefighters and EMS personnel would not be invited to the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 at Ground Zero. This is so wrong in so many ways.Â 
This is a painful insult for many of the approximately 3,000 men and women who risked their lives, limbs and lungs on that monumental day, puncturing another hole in a still searing wound. Planning"other activities for them elsewhere" is not an acceptable alternative and is in fact even more degrading.
Please reverse this decision immediately and "make room" for these individuals who without regard to their own safety responded to this horrifying event to help others.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
