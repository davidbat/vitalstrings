Ground Zero Mosque Mayor Bloomberg Partners with Saudi Prince in New Muslim News Channel
Is it any wonder that Mayor Gloomberg was such a shameless shill for the Ground Zero mega mosque on sacrd ground? Selling out his country to our civilizational executioners. The Bloomberg Administration wrote the letters and vetted the apps for the Ground Zero mosqueteers. Quisling. Traitor.
Prince Al-Waleed Unveils ‘Alarab’ Cable News Channel with Bloomberg as Partner, What About News Corp.? TV News (hat tip Urban Infidel)
Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has announced that his upcoming Middle East cable news channel will be  called “Alarab” and will launch in 2012. He also announced that  Bloomberg News will provide five hours of programming a day for the  channel, and would also provide analysis and expertise.
“Our alliance with Bloomberg and its credible source of financial and  economic data, together with its extensive media experience, will  provide the Alarab news channel with a strong and comprehensive economic  platform to accurately cover Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Arab  world,” said Al-Waleed in a statement.
Alarab is the same channel that was announced in July 2010 with News Corp. as a financial backer . No mention of News Corp. is made in the release, instead there is a statement noting:
“The Alarab news channel is an  independent venture from Kingdom Holding  Company and the Rotana group  and is privately owned by Prince Alwaleed  Bin Talal.”
It is unclear whether News Corp. remains an investor in the network.  Al-Waleed remains as the largest investor in News Corp. outside of the  Murdoch family.
Perhaps Murdoch wasn't dhimmi enough. FOX personalities were not cheerleading for the Ground Zero mosque.
