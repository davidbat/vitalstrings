New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) said Friday that the “single biggest” thing President Obama can do right now to spur job creation in the United States is to allow more immigration.
“Most importantly, we want to get immigrants from around the world to come to America,” Bloomberg said in an interview with the “CBS Early Show.” 
“That’s the single biggest thing that the president could do with Congress, is open up the borders to those that will create jobs here.”
Bloomberg said unemployment was lower in New York City than in other parts of the country because of his administration’s focusing on small business, using training programs and providing angel funds.
He told CBS that immigrants “don’t take away jobs” but rather they create jobs for people already living in the United States.
