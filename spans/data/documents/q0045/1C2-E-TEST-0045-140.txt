Tenure exists to protect teachers from vindictive dictators(principals and chancellors) like Bloomberg

Not mincing his words here evidently… I’ll comply with the new law that allowed Bloomberg to serve this term, but I don’t have to like it.  Actually that may be a little different…
“writing papers about things that are very controversial” 
Wow – that’s a gross oversimplification there.  If I were teaching at a nyc public school I’d seek tenure just to make sure Bloomberg or some other ‘ed reform’ mayor doesn’t change whatever test is keeping me, my students and my school accountable down the road.

The mayor would have more credibility regarding tenure if anything else he says about schools were actually true.  Once again, in order to keep the spotlight off of his failed policies, he’s attacking teacher.

Bloomberg either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that teachers are being fired arbitrarily across New York and across the country. Good teaching requires experienced educators who are protected from arbitrary firings.

Where is the UFT in all this.  It would seem to me that a class action grievance invoking the principle of past practices would show that there were illegal quotas set up if not on the Principals than on the lackey Superintendents who in many cases simply ignored the recvommendations of the Principals to grant individual teachers tenure.  It would seem to me to be a worthwhile grievance to try to make the Emperor defend.  Also I note CSA finally opened its mouth on this issue.  Where is CSA defending the Principals who in many cases were made to look bad by lackey Superintendent overruling their recommendations?
As Neville Chamberlain learned in 1938, appeasement never works.It’s time for the UFT and CSA to begin protecting their members and not worry about the public perceptions.  The public is going to be against whatever the two unions say in any event.

Bloomie needs to check up on his history. Yes, tenure was first granted to college professors to allow academic freedom. However, around the early 1900′s it was extended to public school teachers. (Who were primarily women) Many female teachers at the time were fired for things such as getting pregnant, wearing certain clothing, or teaching from texts that the school systems did not approve of. Tenure was crucial then and it is just as important now. If a principal does his or her job correctly, tenure works just fine.

Probationary teachers can be dismissed by the DoE and are entitled to an “in-house” review, the results of which are only a recommendation to the chancellor. They are never overturned. This policy has been in effect for many decades. 
Under the expedited procedures tenured teachers may be “brought up on charges” for a range of issues, the entire hearing process must be completed within four months.
If very few teachers are brought up on charges whose fault is it?
Tenure only means you are entitled to a due process hearing in front of a neutral arbitrator selected by the State Ed Department.
Tenure only means due process, and orderly impartial process.
I suspect when the new Teacher-Principal Evaluation law is fully implemented the number of teachers brought up on charges will significantly increase.

Wow he lies what a surprise. He wants to destroy teaching in New York City.What do you think he wants to do?
Joe klein will come in and fill the void with all his 40 day wonders with no job security no tenue but who will make all the money.He got a third term and is using it to get even.

unlike in the early 1900′s, it’s illegal to fire a woman for being pregnant, so you probably should delete that example from your talking points.

Isn’t the mayors business Bloomberg L.P. in court regarding charges brought by female employees claiming discrimination. If I recall correctly one plaintiff filed charges that she was denied promotion due to a pregnancy. Maybe tenure should be afforded employees at his former company the one that he has NO INVOLVEMENT IN ANY LONGER!!!!!!
Vote NO!
Tenure  should  be extended  to  every  worker  in  this  country.  Employers  should  be  heavily  fined  for  outsourcing.  If  you  do  these  two  things  the  economy  will  “take  off.”  Unemployment,  the  lack  of  worker  security,  wages,  and  benefits  are  the  problems  that  are  killing  this  economy.

Well if Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor are sure the #’s will go up–to 5-10% denials  50%+ delays that is not a good gamble for a young person –now is it?

Are you saying that women are never fired for being pregnant? And if they are, that the law will typically provide a satisfactory and timely remedy?
Even an open-and-shut case of true discrimination can become a toss-up against an entity with unlimited amounts of lawyers, money, and time.

Bloomberg Gets Pissy During Gender Discrimination DepositionIn a case filed in 2007, the EEOC charged the mayor’s company with a pattern of discrimination against women, pregnant women in particular. The mayor is Bloomberg LP’s biggest shareholder but hasn’t run the day-to-day operations in years, so the focus has been more on whom he left in charge. According to one plaintiff, Bloomberg News editor Matthew Winkler complained of pregnant employees who didn’t come back after maternity leave, “It’s like stealing money from Mike Bloomberg’s wallet. It’s theft. They should be arrested.” At issue is what happened when they came back, including the company’s approach to accommodating parents:  At one  point in his testimony, Mr. Bloomberg mocked flexible work schedules and telecommuting by suggesting an alternative to videotaping his remarks from the discomfort of his lawyers’ offices.  “Could we continue this via phone conference so that I can be back in my office, or do you believe that that’s not acceptable?” Mr. Bloomberg said. “I’m just asking. I’d be happy to do it if you want.”  So accommodating! A judge is expected to rule in the coming months on Bloomberg LP’s motion to dismiss the case. A separate suit, filed in 1997, alleged that Bloomberg told a pregnant employee, “Kill it!” and accused him and colleagues of sexual harassment. That case was settled in 2000, though Bloomberg denied the charges.jezebel.com

Tenure didn’t start in the McCarthy era. It began in the 1880s as civil service reform, intended to protect civil servants against the spoils system and political firings. the idea was to have a cadre of nonpolitical government workers who would not be replaced by political hacks with each new election.

Thanks to Breezy for reminding us all:
1. that tenure was meant to protect public workers from over political who weren’t particularly interested in fairness, but more interested int their own political agenda2. how incredibly unintelligent, and unintelligible our mayor can sound when he opens his mouth with regard to the reasons for tenure. This guy leaves office on Wednesday, January 1, 2014. I just need to hold on to my job until that Thursday. 
Michael Fiorillo
The mayor is not only wrong about the chronology of tenure, as many commenters have pointed out, but also about its workings during the McCarthy era itself. In fact, over 1,000 teachers were investigated and over 375 dismissed or forced out of their jobs by the withhhunts of the 1950′s. Many of those forced out had tenure.
Tenure also did not protect professors at City College when the 
Dies Committee, the first version House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was formed in 1938, and sought to expose so-called Communist infiltration of higher education. 
The mayor should also be asked about McCarthyism and the DOE’s treatment of Debbie Almontaser, who, along her students, was viciously smeared by Joel Klein’s current employer and legal client, Rupert Murdoch, leading to her removal.

So, are you getting why firing for being pregnant should NOT be out of Stevie A’s talking points?

Many top corporations, last time I checked, have protections resembling tenure for people doing complex though perhaps entry-level jobs. In general, employees don’t get canned after one poor rating on an annual review. There would be questions and recommendations. After the second poor rating, there would be strong suggestions or orders to either transfer to a different group or department or risk clearly articulated and immediate disciplinary actions for further sub-par performance. And THAT’s when you could get fired for poor performance.
Also, in regard to tenure being too easy to get: It should be easy to get a meager protection, especially given the outrageously high percentages of inept and/or warped supervisors out there, the complexity of the job, the lack of a general consensus about what modern education should be and the failure to fix the system. Tenure, as it is now, is extremely meager when you really contemplate the ugly truth of those givens.
John G
And yet so important because of those givens.

The Mayor and his corporate friends should get the hell out of education and start creating jobs instead of outsourcing them.  When are we going to expose these hypocrites?  They do nothing, and I mean nothing, to combat unemployment in this country.  It’s time to steal the ball from out of their hands.

If only tenure could be bought in the same way third terms are.

The Mayor’s a throwback and should be thrown out for making us throw up.

Hey Flerpo. I worked in a charter school for a year and I saw administrators who treated pregnant teachers like garbage. (Giving them unpopular classes, extra duties, etc) They did not have tenure. The secret at the school was “don’t get pregnant”.

Yes, crucial, but should not be an additional hurdle beyond say 3 or 4 years of good ratings — in this system! The E4E people are too idealistic, reactionary and naive. If it’s only Uber-Teachers that can get it, it should only be Uber-Ed Experts who should be running things, but they’re all busy taking down the degenerate deformers.

The problem with you is that you have never taught and you are in a discussion that doesn’t mean a thing to you. Bloomberg and his flunkies do what they want to all the time. He is in the process of destroying education in New York and replacing it with his friends. It is all about the money. He is all about money and he doesn’t care one bit about who he hurts.
Spend some time helping out in a school and then what you will say after will have some value.
No sane person will become a teacher with all thats going on. People who post here have experience teaching and their opinion counts. They have walked the walk and can talk the talk.

Just an aside:that rhetoric of ‘the best and brightest’ is so silly- Everyone must realize that society requires a great deal of people to become teachers. 
So how is it possible, given the numbers required and the pay scale ,that teachng can ever be a profession of the ‘best and brightest?Teachers in my school are great, but probably it is more realistic to call them ‘bright and competent’. That first term, when used by reformers, serves nefarious purposes. It seems to want to emotionally wring from parents, the thought that ‘gee, my kids deserve only the very best’! and this current system is set up to somehow deny them that(selfish uft!)

Teachers, in particular, deserve tenure because they are in a position where it is understood that they  do not move up to more complex jobs with diff responsibilities, as opposed to workers in a corporation, but instead stay as ‘teacher’, and work on perfecting a very nuanced skill set.in Thereforel,it should be especially understood that they require protection because society requires them to stay in the same position of ‘teacher’.With no tenure, they will always be subject to situations where less costly workers are found to replace them.

I have no problem with your analysis, though some trs do go admin.
Also, what some trs and schools have to do within a broken system, under hugely adverse conditions, could be viewed as controversial. The Mayor, like most people who have never worked in those specific kinds of conditions, is oblivious to this.
Flerpo
“With no tenure, they will always be subject to situations where less costly workers are found to replace them.”
And I care about this as a taxpayer why?  Your sob story is based on the premise that you can’t justify your worth to your employer. Enough said.  And “society requires” this of you, that’s rich.
Flerpo
It was. That’s how it exists.

You seemed to have miss my point that teachers develop a nuanced skill set and that takes time.That is what society needs them to do, for the sake of the children- this isnt a job at McDonalds-it is anart and a science, and society requires experienced teachers. If they are gotten rid of willy nilly, we are all losing.
Flerpo
The law provides a remedy. The same remedy the rest of us have. Use it. You don’t deserve better than the general public, particularly when you work in a field that is far less hostile to women than many if not most other fields.  You want to get fired for getting pregnant, go work for Goldman Sach.
I have taught. University level, not K-12.  And I tend to think that those who benefit personally from tenure (for example) are the least credible people in any argument about tenure. You want tenure because it benefits you. That’s fine–we all tend to like things that benefit us–but don’t mistake personal bias for valuable insight and credibility.
Personally I think tenure does more harm good, but I also think the system could be modified in productive ways that would still give teachers a sense if security. It’s the pensions that need to go. And they will go eventually, trust me.

So u see a society with no pensions, and an end to tenure?What kind of a country do u anticipate? We all do see it coming, with rich getting richer, while middle class become poor- But many of us want to stop it.

I have been teaching at the college level and at the secondary level for 30 years. Your statement is very insulting and in fact it shows a complete ignorance of the politics and the personality clashes that exist in any University department. Tenure is an absolute necessity in academia.

He is a friend of Larry Littlefield and all he is doing is stirring the pot. He is a shill for people who want to destroy our profession. Your so right he is insulting and so very ignorant. He has no life and only is in this discussion to get under our skin.There are so many people who made choices in their lives and they spend the rest of the time so very jealous of these choices.

This is a website for people who teach, parents or anyone involved in education. He is only here to spew his agenda. Have him spend some time working in a school and then his words will have some meaning. Trying to reason with someone like this is a waste of time and energy.

Never met Mr. Littlefield. I do like his blog. I’m a parent and a NYC resident and a taxpayer. Tolerate my presence and you might come away with a sense of what people other than your colleagues think.
Tiredofyou
Your a parent and you agree to whats happening to teachers across the country? You agree to what Bloomberg is doing to the NYC education system?? Its ok with you that Millions of dollars are going to programs and consultants that have little or no effect on educating students??? I will tolerate your presence because you have a right to your opinion but I am a member of the system which you will never destroy. Go to work in a school and then talk.
