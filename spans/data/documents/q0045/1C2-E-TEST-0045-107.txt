Michael Bloomberg Biography
Business Personality
Michael Bloomberg succeeded Rudy Giuliani as mayor of New York City in 2002. Bloomberg graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, then earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1966. He was a general partner at Salomon Brothers when he was let go in 1981 (after a merger), and that same year he founded Innovative Market Systems (later Bloomberg LP). The new subscription service wired real-time financial data, research and news reports directly into dedicated terminals in business offices. As these "Bloomberg terminals" flourished, he expanded into television, radio, publishing and the Internet; Bloomberg News, launched in 1990, became a prominent financial news source. His successes made Bloomberg a billionaire and made his name synonymous with business information. He shifted gears in 2001 and ran for New York mayor as a Republican; he defeated Democrat Michael Green just two months after the attacks of 11 September 2001. Bloomberg was reelected in 2005 and again in 2009 (after the New York city council overturned a two-term mayoral limit). His 1997 autobiography was titled Bloomberg by Bloomberg.
