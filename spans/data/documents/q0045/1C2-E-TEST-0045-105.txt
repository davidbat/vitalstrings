Nanny Bloomberg is the guy who said the Times Square bomber was probably somebody upset about Obamacare , implying the Tea Party .
Miguelito . The rioters that you are talking about were Muslim ‘youths’ for the most part .
What Obama is doing is playing games and demagoguing . And that’s no secret , even to you .

Ain’t nobody gets themselfs a college degree and then riots because they can’t find no job .
 Once again Bloomberg has come up short .

Way to go with the preemptive pep talk jerkoff.
You, like your Azshole buddy obama always seem to know just what ( Not ) to say.

Ya, the riots will be from union goons and entitlement junkies. Just like Beck has predicted for a couple years now.

The only riots will be riots by liberals demanding more things for free.

“NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg: Jobs Crisis Could Cause European-Style Riots”
Well, that’s an old prediction. Glenn Beck was mocked for saying the same thing.

 the increasing difficulty for recent college graduates in getting jobs could lead to riots in America.
These are the same kids that thought it would be cool to have a black president. Welcome to reality kids.

“In Madrid and Cairo (as well as Athens and, to a lesser extent, London) the riots seen were partially caused by the desperation youth felt at double-digit unemployment numbers in nations where the government had a significant hand in providing school and job efforts.”
Much like what Obama wants to do in America.

First, he tells you you can’t have a gun.

HOW TO DESTROY A DEMOCRACY
Put Conservative Republicans in Total Control of your government
Since 1980, they had control of the Executive for 20 years, the Senate for 18 years, the House for 12 years and a Total Control for 6 horrid years that decimated our Housing Industry and the World Financial Industry while increasing the transfer of Wealth and Income to the top few.
FACT CHECK
In 1980, 1% owned 20% of total Financial Wealth and 43% in 2009
In 1980, 1% took 10% of individual Income and 20% in 2009..
In 1980-2009, the top 1% had a 281% increase in after tax income and the middle 20% had a 25% increase or below the rate of inflation for a cut in income.
Today:
5% own 62% of Net Wealth
80% own 15% 62/15
20% own 93% of Financial Wealth
80% own 7% 93/7
25% get 67% of Individual Income
70,000,000 get 13% 67/13
That ratio is like distribution of $100 with 20 having $86 and 80 having $14
or each of the 20 have $4.36 and each of the 80 have $0.17
Inequality? What else can one call it? $4.36 to $0.17 is disgraceful and will end our Democracy
Since 1980, it has been a deliberate policy implementations by conservative republicans
who believe if you shift wealth upward it will increase the wealth of those below.
Increase the wealth at the top will create huge numbers of jobs.
FACT CHECK
2001-2009 had a huge increase in wealth and Income of the top 10%.
The job creation was lowest since Hoover.
Since 1980, the three conservative presidents created 99,000 net new jobs per month or just enough to cover new entries into the work force. They took over in 1981 when job creation had been 218,000 per month. Those three initiated our involvement in ten foreign conflicts in which tens of thousands of innocents were killed. They destroyed our Savings and Loan Industry; created a Monopoly in banking where today ten banks control 80% of the deposits in all 7600 banks; created a worldwide financial disaster by deregulating the Casino Derivative Of America; destroyed our housing industry by allowing the big banks to, willingly, finance junk loans to millions who could not afford them. They increased the Fannie-Freddie maximum amount they could pay for mortgages from $300,000 to $729,000.
This allowed the banks to promote $500,000 plus mortgages for more profit on the securities they sold worldwide as triple A values. Profits were huge. Fraud was huge.
The Congress and the White House are reluctant to indict their campaign fund sugar daddies on Wall Street. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ BUYS $$$$$$$$$$$$ ANYONE

MAYOR BLOOMBERG,
YOU…are a riot!!  As the Mayor of New York City, you are attempting to instill fear in Americans.  If you have a riot in your city….take care of it.   That is YOUR job.  Your job is NOT to threaten or incite Americans.  If you can’t handle it….resign or shut up.  Get this through your thick Progressive or Marxist head.  Americans do not fear anything with your spitting up Obama’s talking points.  Americans see through every false statement that comes from you, Obama or George Soros.  We are not stupid to fall for your fear tactics or “call for violence,” nor are we blind to see that you are pushing Obama’s Jobs’ Act.  Bloomberg, this is my country, and I will make certain that anyone like you who is stirring up Americans to demean our nation…will be charged with TREASON.  Count on it!

He’s an idiot.  No, perhaps a retard.  With no proof to back up the absurdness of his claims, he continues making baseless assumptions and accusations.  If there are riots in America, and that’s a big IF, it’ll be those union jackasses.  No matter how much he and his ilk want us to be like Europe, we won’t be.

So you would charge people with treason for advocating that which you advocate against?
” I will make certain that anyone like you who is stirring up Americans to demean our nation…will be charged with TREASON”.
Does talk of secession by REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVES qualify?????????????
Do acts and actions in support or VOTER SUPPRESSION qualify????????
Do persons advocating the ASSASSINATION of Judges and elected officials (by CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS) qualify??????
Do calls for sworn military officers to refuse the orders of the CinC by CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS qualify??????
Do calls from REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVES to take up arms against the Government qualify
???? THIS ONE IS AN ACTUAL ACT OF TREASON AS DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION.
I could do this all day, but that would not matter to CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS like……YOU.
You want people who do not say the things you want to hear to SHUT UP, well lady (AND I use that term loosely) I want you and those of your ill tempered ilk to STFU.

Attacking the public schools and those who are educated, and attacking the efforts to increase jobs???

You had no problem with republicans taking 5 weeks off while people are suffering but went bat shit crazy over President Obama taking 4 days off with his kids while he worked some part of every day of his family vacation.
Something is wrong with the real double faced standard problem mentally deficient CONSERVATIVES have.

You’ll hear what you want to in order to start ad hominem and hyperbole. How do you know? You don’t. Go away. Pick on someone your own size.

How do you know?  What are your sources?  If a person has just received a degree and they aren’t filing for unemployment because you can’t if you were a student, what source do you have to determine the number of unemployed?  Well, I know which end you took that figure from and it wasn’t from the “brain” end.
Thomas G Williams
Provide proof of a planned mosque on the GROUND ZERO site.
As for “ad hominem and hyperbole” you need to check the definition of the terms , you will find that it is what you are doing and that I am in fact countering exactly that by you.
I took Latin and I passed it, or are you just being……Conservative? Showing off your required credentials by being willfully ignorant?
they have a term that may be included in future dictionary definitions for people like your self: IGNORATTY CONSERVATAS.

This nation was founded by people who didn’t think the state owed you anything, dickbrain.
Thomas G Williams
Actually they spelled out what the state owed you in the Constitution and they specified how the state was to deliver on those requirements and gave the state the authority to do just that, MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS TO THE GOVERNED.
And if you are incapable of under standing the words and the intent of the founders in enumerating the powers of the government then you will just have to trust that they got it right and that it has the force of law to back it up.

Keep in mind that this doesn’t mean they’re doing the jobs they want or were educated to do. It doesn’t mean that they’re earning what they expected to earn. If you’re doing the hiring, and all other things are equal, do you hire the college grad or the non-college grad?

Yay! Another page in the Libs’ ‘Fear-Mongering 101 Handbook’
1.) Neighborhoods will burn down if you don’t give firefighters a HUGE new contract
2.) Streets will be crime-ridden if you don’t do the same for the P’lice.
3.) Riots if you don’t pass OBAMO’s bill NOW!
4.) Bridges will collapse if you don’t pass OBAMO’s bill NOW!
