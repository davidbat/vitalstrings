The whole thing should be “cancelled”.
And the Mayor “escorted” to New Jersey.

What is he going to do, have everyone arrested and thrown in detention camps? That would be good for his political career. /s

The NYPD Police Chaplain was murdered on 9/11 when Tower 2 collapsed. He'll be there Bloomie, you self righteous prick.

This says a lot more about New Yorkers than anything about this pos. Neither Hot nor Cold. So God spits them out of His mouth.

The “Bloom” is definitely off the rose!
Wasn’t this the same clown who rushed in front of the cameras immediately after the Times Sq. bomber-wannabe incident and blamed it on someone who was opposed to Obamacare??
Read the NY Post - big kerfluffle up in NYC as good ol’ Bloomie apparently hid the fact that 1 of his top aides beat the snot out of his wife. He didn’t want to “hurt the family”...
And while Bloom-Nero fiddles, Rome is burning. NYC had, as of last count, more than 40 shootings this weekend alone!
I don’t live in NY, but I sure miss Guiliani.

Anyone can sign up online and take part in this prayer vigil, organized by those two sisters, who sang so beautifully at TEA party rally in Iowa, over the weekend. It's call the 911 Prayer Team.

The one thought that soothes my soul is knowing that all that perished that day (EXCEPT THE TERRORISTS) are in Heaven and there is nothing anyone on earth can do or say to hurt them. What is sad is the pain Bloomberg is causing the families of the victims and the first responders. He has turned this into a po;itical dog and pony show. I sincerely hope he pays for this at the next election cycle.
I personally am going to pray for the innocent souls lost. I will even pray for Bloomberg because his belief in earthly power over heavenly eternity is very sad.

There was a lot of Irish Catholic fireman who died in that pit - and they aren’t allowed to have a priest there to commemorate the day? The NYFD should boycott this ceremony and have their own.
Bloomberg is a secular progressive, but a complete hypocrite as he ran around all last year saying Muslims have a right to build a mosque on Ground Zero, but now he says that these dead Irish Catholic fireman cannot have a priest say a few prayers on their behalf.

Yes. And he doesn’t want the first responders there, either. So. Bloomberg is a retard, as well as a really bad mayor? This is what happens when you put a silver-spoon, trust-fund baby with NO concept of the real world in power...we sure ducked a bullet with Gore, didn’t we?
Perhaps it is time for REAL Americans to show up to these leftie shindigs. I would LOVE to see the ministers and priests, the families, and the first responders show up, surround Ground Zero, and during Bloomie’s gassy speech, stand up, hold hands, say a prayer and break into the Star Spangled Banner. Wouldn’t THAT be a wonderful sight!

So no first responders, no clergy. Who do they want there? Other pond scum pols? “Celebrities”? I’m officially ignoring their “memorial service”.

I hope that scores of people break into the Lord's Prayer at the Memorial service. About the time the first plane crashed into the first tower. The powers that be cannot squelch our religious heritage. It isn't right!

I don’t think these events are appropriate. Clearly, they are being run to advance current political/special interest agendas. Then you have orgs like the NFL seeking to horn in ultimately for no other reason than to assuage their guilt over playing games on Sept 11. Just play the games and skip the guilt trip “ceremonies.”
What happened on that day was horrible and will always BE horrible and the idea that an “anniversary” can be made of it and then used by slimebags like Bloomberg to advance their secular fantasies...
No.

Who’s memorial is this anyway?!?! Bloomberg is turning this into a politically correct event which means he has politicized it, which in most peoples’ view is a sacrilege ... tell ya what, how bout some devout believers in the area go and kneel in silence, as a group, and sincerely pray that blue ice falls from the sky and smacks Bloomberg in the head...

Pray anyway and dare this weasel to arrest you.
For Bloomie, I guess the mask is off. He's comfortable being his evil self in public without even a pretense of goodness.

I’m not going to participate in a 9/11 memorial of any kind. Soros and the Democrats and their lying media have completely destroyed any sense of shame or honor in this country.
