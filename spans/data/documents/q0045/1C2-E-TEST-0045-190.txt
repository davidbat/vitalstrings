Please, Mayor Bloomberg, will you just shut your pie hole? Do you really think Wall Street is going to pack up and leave, especially when you do such a stellar job shining their shoes with your tongue? And let's not forget how the NYPD was bought off to be Wall Street's own Rent-A-Cops. Quit the pissing and moaning and quit while you're ahead:
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg accused anti-Wall Street protesters on Friday of trying to destroy jobs in the city, even as he said he was sympathetic to some of their complaints.
Protesters complaining about what they view as corporate greed have been camped out in Zuccotti Park in Manhattan since last month, staging rallies and marches that have mostly proceeded peacefully but sometimes resulted in confrontations with police.
"What they're trying to do is take the jobs away from people working in this city," Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show, adding that the protests "aren't productive" and weren't good for tourism.
"If the jobs they are trying to get rid of in this city -- the people that work in finance, which is a big part of our economy -- go away, we're not going to have any money to pay our municipal employees or clean our parks or anything else."
Really, Mayor Bloomberg? Nothing else happens in NYC? How about the other 87 percent of your revenue base?
