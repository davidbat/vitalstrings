Mayor Bloomberg: ‘I Have My Own Army In The NYPD’ | Last night, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the MIT speech, he explained why he didn’t want to run for president, which included boasting of having his own army in the NYPD. “I have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh biggest army in the world. I have my own State Department, much to Foggy Bottom’s annoyance. We have the United Nations in New York, and so we have an entree into the diplomatic world that Washington does not have ,” said Bloomberg. (HT: @resnikoff )
