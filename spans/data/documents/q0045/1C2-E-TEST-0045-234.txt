More than 170,000 people have signed up for Codecademy’s challenge to learn how to code in 2012, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is one of them.
The challenge, Code Year , was launched by New York-based startup Codecademy on Sunday and quickly took off as Twitter and Facebook users adopted it as their New Years resolution.
Codecademy turns learning JavaScript into an interactive game. Anybody who signs up for Code Year will receive one of these programming lessons each week in their email inbox. Mayor Bloomberg tweeted on Thursday afternoon that he had signed up for the challenge.

“I think it just goes to show the importance of what we’re doing – and the growing emphasis NYC is putting on technology,” Codecademy co-founder Zach Sims tells Mashable. “It’s too awesome for words.”
Bloomberg has taken a large interest in the New York technology scene, showing up everywhere from TechStars demo day to a Facebook press event. It’s not a surprise that he also showed up when a NYC startup signed up 170,000 people for a tech challenge in less than a week. Who knows? After he finishes the course, maybe he’ll start attending hackathons, too.
