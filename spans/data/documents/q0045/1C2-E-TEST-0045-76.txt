Yes!! Wake up people! Laws are not susposed to be about what you believe or what I believe. They are to be based on what someone else is allowed to tell you or me to believe or how to live.  You can not legislate morality. It just does not work. Look at prohibition in the 20's, or the current war on drugs, and you can see the folly in trying. Laws and legislation should not restrict how anyone lives, instead, they should set penalties for harming others because of that choice. Drugs should be legalized and treated like alcohol and tobacco. Same sex marriage should be legal(I personally do not agree, but have no right to tell others they can't).  This is what the far right has forgotten. If you look close at their agenda, you will find their concept of freedom and liberty is their right to make the laws and restrict the freedom of anyone who disagrees with them. The same goes for the far left. As for libertarianism, it works in a perfect world where everyone looks out for and believes in the common good. Unfortunately this world is far from perfect and too many people are willing to take advantage of the less fortunate. This makes certain legislation restricting wall street necessary. Again look at the past. The sweet shops and unsafe work places of the late 1800's-early1900's did exist. The wall street crash and great depression did happen. The restrictions that were put in place and laws against unfair labor practices were passed for a reason, but if you actually think about it, they follow the unwritten constitutional guideline(Laws are to prevent one persons free choice from infringeing on of harming anyone elses!!). So again yes, this goes well beyond what should be the governments reach.
