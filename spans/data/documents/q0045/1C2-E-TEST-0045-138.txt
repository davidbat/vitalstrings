Mayor Michael Bloomberg helps serve Thanksgiving meals at the Peter Cardella Senior Center in Ridgewood
Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the Peter Cardella Senior Center in Ridgewood to don an apron and help prepare a Thanksgiving feast.
Two hundred elderly Queens residents gobbled up a Thanksgiving feast complete with turkey, stuffing, butternut squash soup, cranberry sauce, baked sweet potatoes, corn on the cob and pumpkin pie.
“The Peter Cardella Senior Center in Queens is the very first place I visited as a candidate for Mayor in 2001, and as families across the five boroughs gather again to reflect on what they’re thankful for, I am grateful for the opportunity to come back at work at the Cardella Center again,” said Bloomberg.
More than 200 Citymeals-on-Wheels volunteers provided meals to 5,400 shut-ins across the city for the Thanksgiving holiday.
“New York City has the strongest and most generous social safety net in the country, and for three decades now Citymeals-on-Wheels has been an integral part of that,” the mayor said.
