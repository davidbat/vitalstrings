Hello,
This web site has been created to bring information about NYC Public Schools to the parents and guardians of NYC Public School children. As parents we have been kicked off the bus when it comes time to play our part in decisions that affect our children. The Bloomberg administration has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on NO-BID CONTRACTS, yet they want to fire teachers. The Bloomberg administration has no accountability in the decisions to spend the school budget, yet they want to fire teachers and increase class size. They Bloomberg administration is rushing to close failing schools but they did not give these schools the tools they needed to serve their students, yet they want to fire teachers, increase class size and ignore parents. The Department of Education has six Deputy Chancellors, too many lawyers and too many administrators, yet they want to fire teachers, increase class size, ignore parents and they say they are doing a good job.
Fortunately there are parents who do not believe the HYPE coming from the DOE. We are parents from the Bronx to Staten Island. We are from the West Side to Queens and we can tell you the Bloomberg management system does not work.
Unfortunately NYC does not have a recall law, so we are stuck with Mayor Bloomberg for the next few years, unless of course he decides to allow himself to run for Mayor again. 
From NYC CHARTER:   
Removal of mayor. The mayor may be removed from office by the governor upon charges and after service upon him of a copy of the charges and an opportunity to be heard in his defense. Pending the preparation and disposition of charges, the governor may suspend the mayor for a period not exceeding thirty days.
