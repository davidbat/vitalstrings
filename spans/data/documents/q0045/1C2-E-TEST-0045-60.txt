New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (R), on Tuesday, announced an ambitious plan for New York City to regain its historic role as “the technology capital of the United States — and the world” — and eclipse Silicon Valley. He is offering subsidized real estate and $100 million in infrastructure upgrades to any institution, university or consortium that builds a world-class science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island, Governors Island or Brooklyn Navy Yard. Bloomberg projects that, within the first 30 years, this school will spin-off 400 new companies and create more than 22,000 permanent jobs.
Bloomberg has the right idea, but he’s going about it the wrong way. The mayor should indeed improve New York’s crumbling infrastructure, but the key to building innovation is not a new educational institution — it’ll take much more. If the presence of world-class universities could provide New York with a substantial advantage, then, as I’ve written before , Silicon Valley wouldn’t have left Boston’s Route 128 in the dust. And New York would not have raced ahead of Boston to become the second largest recipient of venture-capital funds in the United States, placing behind California.
