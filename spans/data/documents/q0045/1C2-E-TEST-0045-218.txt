Update: Mayor Bloomberg & Police Defy Court Order Allowing Protesters Back into Zuccotti Park
At 1:00am in New York, a massive police force clad in riot gear raided Liberty Square evicting the Occupiers resulting in the arrest of 200 protesters, falling into the pattern which is sweeping across the States, in Austin, Denver and Portland as well as other states.
While naysayers are claiming laws have been broken by protesters, another important law has been broken today by the police.
A city judge late this morning granted the protesters a temporary restraining order which allows them back into the park. Occupy Wall Street protesters returned to the park with printed copies of a court order which legally allows them to return with their tents.
Demonstrators demanded reentry, however, the police with billionaire Mayor ‘1%’ Bloomberg thus far have defied the court order.
In Bloomberg’s own words , he states, ‘some hoped cold weather would drive them out’ which confirms that the ‘Powers that Be’ are frightened, especially while claiming lawlessness is prevalent while at the same time his own police force defies a court order.
While Bloomberg claims Freedom of Speech has its limits, citing health concerns, his words ring hollow once again. The Constitution allows it as our right and no Wall Street mogul should be able to withdraw our rights selectively to meet his own special interests which are all too obvious.
Bloomberg is awaiting clarification of the court order.  Or perhaps he’s awaiting the wrath of the American people which will ensue then measure his options. I vote for the latter choice.
I am so thankful I did not vote for

Update:
Occupy protesters just got word that Judge Michael Stallman has overturned the temporary restraining order which ordered the reopening of Zuccotti Park issued earlier this morning after Michael Bloomberg’s late night raid on the Occupy Wall Street protesters.
