As for Bloomberg doing 'exactly what a mayor should do', I'm not so sure.
Why did mass transit have to close at noon on Saturday?
I can't speak about the decision to close bus lines, but as for the subway .... shutting down the subway system isn't like turning off your lights -- just flick a switch and you're done -- it takes a good chunk of the day to accomplish. If they decided right now "Let's shut down the subways" it could be more than eight hours for all the trains in the system to run their courses and get into their proper storage places. And since early forecasts predicted the storm would get bad in New York City on Saturday night, closing the subway at noon that day was actually cutting it a little close.
Apparently unrelated personal anecdote: once, when I was about seven, I thoughtlessly ran into the street to retrieve a ball. Nothing bad happened: the driver hit his brakes in time to not hit me, no other driver hit him, I didn't even lose my ball. Still, even as a seven-year-old stupid enough to run into traffic, I was nonetheless smart enough to consider the situation afterwards and conclude "Wow, I got really lucky," rather than figure "Hmm, I ran into traffic and nothing bad happened. Clearly, those 'don't run into traffic' warnings I hear are just hype and bullshit used by authority figures to CONTROL ME."
