Blackstone President Stephen Schwarzman, Richard LeFrak, Equity International Chairman Sam Zell and Related Companies Chairman Stephen Ross were just some of the big players in New York City real estate to make Forbes’ list of the world’s 1,226 billionaires released yesterday.
But none can match the wealth of the man who has the final say on whether many of their ambitious city projects ultimately get built: Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Bloomberg is worth $22 billion, according to Forbes, good for the 20th spot on the international list. Meanwhile, no New York City real estate magnate came within 150 spots or $15 billion of the mayor. Schwarzman, whose Blackstone Group invests in real estate assets and loans throughout the city and country, was the next wealthiest individual with ties to the industry, placing 184th in the world with a net worth of $5.5 billion.
He’s followed by Richard LeFrak and family, which finished 205th for its $5 billion of wealth, Sam Zell, who placed 216th for his $4.9 billion and Leonard Stern, who earned the 255th spot for his $4.2 billion in wealth.
