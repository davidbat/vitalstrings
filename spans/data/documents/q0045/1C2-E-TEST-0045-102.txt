You obviously have no idea what yu just regurgitated. Pretending to be smart around smart people will only further embarras you.

Highest energy density collider is RHIC at Brookhaven.... the goal of which is to recreate and study the quark-gluon plasma....
At max luminosity, the LHC will have about ~25 collisions every 26 ns (I may be off slightly, been a while since I did any LHC related stuff)... effective maximum CoM energy between consituents is about 10 TeV (and those will be very rare
Pinched from Wiki:
The first observation of a cosmic ray with an energy exceeding 1.0×1020 eV (~15  J ) was made by John Linsley and Livio Scarsi at the Volcano Ranch experiment in New Mexico in 1962. [1] [2]
Cosmic rays with even higher energies have since been observed. Among them was the Oh-My-God particle observed on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground , Utah. Its observation was a shock to astrophysicists , who estimated its energy to be approximately 3×1020 eV [3] (50  joules )—in other words, a subatomic particle with kinetic energy equal to that of a baseball (142 g or 5 oz) traveling at 100 km/h (60 mph). It was most probably a proton with a speed very close to the speed of light , so close, in fact, [(1 ? 5×10?24) × c], that in a year-long race between light and the cosmic ray, the ray would fall behind only 46 nanometers (5×10?24 light-years ), or 0.15 femtoseconds (1.5×10?16 s). [4]
The energy of this particle is some 40 million times that of the highest energy protons that can currently be produced in any particle accelerator . However only a small fraction of this energy would be available for an interaction with a proton or neutron on Earth, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the products of the interaction. The effective energy available for such a collision is the square root of double the product of the particle's energy and the mass energy of the proton, which for this particle gives 7.5×1014 eV, roughly 50 times the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider .
Since the first observation, by the University of Utah 's Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector , at least fifteen similar events have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These very high energy cosmic rays are very rare; the energy of most cosmic rays is between 10 MeV and 10 GeV 
As an aside, the name Fly's Eye made me want to build an experiment to do a precision measurement (1 part in 10^5) of pion beta decay.... the name would be Gnat's Ass.

Now that's amazing.  Perhaps Jimmy Hoffa caught one of those.  Or its big brother.

It's all quite simple actually.
If you trade, I hope you understand fractals. The rest, as they say, is all dependent on your angle of repose! ;-)

yes,.. discovery of the Higgs Boson occurs in low probability world history branches.  So each time the Large Hadron Collider searches for the discovery of it @ higher energy levels, it phases (wave function collapse) our world time-lines to these low probability world timelines. 
 
And it is in these timelines where greater 6 sigma events occur more frequently.  rare events like an earthquake in Virginia.  A hurricane dissemating NYC.  end of EMU.

The Heart of Gold was the prototype ship for infinitely improbable travel. It is the infinite improbability drive in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that saves Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect from very probable death by asphyxiation in deep space after being thrown out of the Vogon ship; the improbable odds against being rescued being 22079460347 to one; the superscripted number incidentally being the telephone  number of the Islington flat where Arthur went to a fancy dress party  and first met Trillian. Incidentally, Adams explained in the annotated  volume of the original radio scripts that it was the eviction of Arthur  and Ford out the spacelock of the Vogon ship that led to his own  "invention" of the Infinite Improbability Drive. Adams realised that he  had worked the story into a dead end, thinking in frustration that the  only solutions would be "infinitely improbable." In a flash of insight  and what Adams called "mental jujitsu", the Infinite Improbability Drive  was born.
In the third book, the Infinite Improbability Drive is discovered to  be the Golden Bail of Prosperity in the Wikkit Gate. It is stolen by the  white Krikkit robots; however, it was returned and the Heart of Gold returned to operational status.
Adams developed the notion of the improbability drive having greater  causal (and narrative) effects in later books. For example: when  Zaphod's great-grandfather discusses his great grandson's career-to-date  he explains that he (Zaphod) cannot escape his destiny now the  improbability field "controls you".

NYC had to fight off rioters and looters the other day due to a small 4.9 earthquake, imagine when market chaos really hits.

You are being optimistic SD.  If only we could wipe NYC from the map.  Be it by internal destruction or external destruction.  Unfortunately, the evil is just so concentrated I don't think it can be done, by Irene or otherwise.
 
In the meantime the surf on Cape Hattarras is going to be epic.  Time for a "board meeting".

Um, fck you guy.  New York is infinitely better than whatever sht hole you live in.  We didn't have any riots.  SheepDog's been banging too many of his farm animals.  I bet New York would rape you two limp dcks and the world wouldn't know the difference.

If the gravy ever stopped flowin to Wall Street NYC would return to the shithole it was in the 70s.
 Do you think it is a coincidence that it became "great" only after the spigot to Wall Street was opened? 
When the trucks of free money stop arriving, New Yawkers will have to figure out how to make a real living.  Then come tell us all about how great the big apple is.

Of course, no argument here.  I'm less convinced your shithole will get any better but good luck with your hometowns value add.

What does Mayor B know about Indian Point that we don't?
http://www.thedailygreenburgh.com/news/indian-point-abnormal-operating-p...
It was the earthquake that did the damage in Fukushima. The tsunami just provided temporary free water cooling.
And don't forget North Anna, Calvert Cliffs or the eleven others operating under abnormal conditions. Oh, well, no one important lives within 60 miles of these plants. Oh, wait, Calvert Cliffs . . .

That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes,

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn,
world serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs.
Feed it off an aux speak, grunt, no, strength,
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight down height.

We've reached Cramer 'Bear Stearns is Fine' 2.0 (Circa 2011).
No QE3 on Friday, and tantrums and meltdowns in 401(k)s ensue.
08-25 9:31: Pimco's El-Erian says Bernanke must avoid QE3 in Friday's Speech ECONOMIC COMMENTARY
says
"Bernanke should avoid any suggestion the US central bank intends to pursue  purchases of Treasury Bonds and instead use a much anticipated Friday  speech to press for economic reforms."
One thing is certain, either with or without QE3 (or TARP 2.0, TALF 2.0, ARRA 2.0), The Bernank has forever broken markets, with the help of Timmmay.

For fuck's sake, this thing is likely to not even be a hurricane by the time it hits NYC:  http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at201109_5day.html
What, you're going to evacuate Staten Island?  to where?   What a disaster something like that would be...

Yep, I'm from Houston and remember watching all the idiots trying to leave before hurricane Rita made landfall. I've never seen anything like it. People died during the evacuation and the storm didn't even hit Houston. Unless you're below sea level, or in the path of the storm surge, it's best to shelter in place. Take a good long look at the below pictures, NY.
