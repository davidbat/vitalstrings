After an amazing playoff run , the Giants are facing off against the Patriots in the 46th Super Bowl.  And now that Mayor Bloomberg has won cheese curds from Green Bay and sourdough bread from San Francisco , he's giving his stomach a break and will give a New York City family the chance to savor seafood from Boston—plus much more—in a bet with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.
Here are the details from the Mayor's office:
If the Giants win, one New York City family will win a Super Tour of Boston. They will receive:
·         Four roundtrip tickets on JetBlue
·         A two-night stay at the Ritz Carlton
·         Dinner for four at Legal Seafoods Harborside
·         Dinner for four at the Top of the Hub restaurant
·         Four tickets to a performance at the Citi Performing Arts Center
·         Four box seats at a Bruins or Celtics game at the TD Garden
·         A behind-the-scenes-tour of the newly expanded Isabella Stewart Gardner museum
·         A Duck Tour ride
·         A VIP tour of the personal diaries of John Adams, which inspired the HBO series, at the Boston Public Library, the first publically-support free city library in the world
·         A VIP tour of the Samuel Adams Brewery in Jamaica Plain
·         A photo with Mayor Menino
If the Patriots win, one Boston family will win a Super Tour of New York City. Thanks to New York City’s outstanding partners in the tourism industry, they will receive:
·         Four roundtrip tickets on the Delta Shuttle
·         A two-night stay at the Grand Hyatt
·         Dinner for four at the newly reopened Russian Tea Room
·         Lunch or dinner for four at B. Smith’s restaurant
·         Four club seats at a Rangers or Knicks game at Madison Square Garden
·         Four tickets to the Phantom of the Opera, celebrating its 10,000th performance right after the Super Bowl
·         A ride with the captain on Statue Cruises to Liberty and Ellis Islands with a VIP tour of the Statue of Liberty crown and museum, including lunch
·         A VIP tour of the new American wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
·         A VIP tour of the Brooklyn Brewery
·         A photo with Mayor Bloomberg
Fun fact: In 2008, when Bloomberg and Menino made a bet for the 42nd Super Bowl, it was ALL food, like , "100 cups of New England Clam Chowder from Legal Sea Foods" and "12 dozen Boston Cream Pies and 12 Dozen Parker House Rolls (in honor of Tom Brady's #12) from Boston's Omni Parker House Hotel."  Obviously Bloomberg changed his tune about portion sizes .
