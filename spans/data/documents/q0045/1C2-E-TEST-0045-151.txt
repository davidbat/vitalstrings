New York (NY Daily News)– In retrospect, it probably was not such a good idea to confide in Rupert Murdoch. Billionaires, it turns out, can be just as indiscreet as the rest of us.
On Friday, in an interview with an Australian newspaper, Mr. Murdoch, the head of News Corporation, divulged that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had described President Obama as the most “arrogant man” he had ever met after playing his first and presumably last round of golf with the commander in chief.
Suffice it to say, the Bloomberg administration was mortified. The blogosphere lit up with posts. Damage control ensued.
