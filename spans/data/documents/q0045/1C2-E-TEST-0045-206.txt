New York City’s Lenox Hospital is quickly becoming famous as the birthplace of baby Blue Ivy Carter. As congratulations have poured in for proud parents Beyoncé and Jay-Z, there’s also been criticism over the past few days over the A-list treatment the stars reportedly received at Lenox.
Other parents at the hospital over the weekend have complained that the famous couple’s intense security detail – they reportedly paid to have the entire floor on lockdown – made it difficult for them to see their own new babies. With hospital administrators vowing to look into the matter, NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg has now waded into the controversy as well.
Asked about Beyonce’s star treatment at a press conference yesterday, the mayor had this to say : “If [the hospital] got paid a lot of money and it let them provide services to other people who don’t have insurance or can’t afford it, I’m not so sure that’s a bad thing. Full paying patients are very valuable to hospitals in this day and age.”
Meanwhile, Beyonce’s sister – and proud new aunt – Solange Knowles took to Twitter to fire back at critics, writing, “It has really gotten out of hand. I’ve been doing my best at keeping my mouth shut….but the ignorance is really sad and upsetting. We are supposed to be super human and watch people we love get slandered, lied on, and ridiculed. It is one of THE hardest things to accept. In any other workplace…if someone directly tells your mother or sister is a liar and a fake ect…you would naturally express yourself. However, the pure happiness and joy I’ve witnessed and experienced helps me to keep my mouth shut.”
