Mayor Michael R Bloomberg, Mayor of New York City
Michael R. Bloomberg, the 108th Mayor of the City of New York was             born on February 14, 1942 to middle class parents in Medford,             Massachusetts, where his father was the bookkeeper at a local dairy.             Mayor Bloomberg's thirst for information and fascination with             technology was evident at an early age, and led him to Johns Hopkins             University, where he parked cars and took out loans to finance his             education. After his college graduation, he gained an MBA from             Harvard and in the summer of 1966, he was hired by Salomon Brothers             to work on Wall Street.
He quickly advanced through the ranks, and became a partner in 1972.             Soon after, he was supervising all of Salomon's stock trading, sales             and later, its information systems. He was fired in 1981 after             another company acquired Salomon.
Michael Bloomberg used his stake from the Salomon sale to start his             own company, an endeavor that would revolutionize the way that Wall             Street does business. As a young trader, he had been amazed at the             archaic nature in which information was stored. When he needed to             see how a stock had been trading three weeks ago, he had to find a             copy of the Wall Street Journal from the date in question,             and the records system consisted of clerks penciling trades in             oversize ledgers. So, he created a financial information computer             that would collect and analyze different combinations of past and             present securities data and deliver it immediately to the user.
In 1982, Bloomberg L.P. sold 20 subscriptions to its service; 20             years later, Bloomberg LP has over 165,000 subscribers worldwide. As             the business proved its viability, the company branched out and in             1990 Bloomberg LP entered the media business, launching a news             service, and then radio, television, Internet, and publishing             operations.
Nearly 20 years after its founding, Bloomberg LP now employs more             than 8,000 people -- including 2,500 in New York City -- in more             than 100 offices worldwide. As the company enjoyed tremendous             growth, he dedicated more of his time and energy to philanthropy and             civic affairs. His desire to improve education, advance medical             research and increase access to the arts, has provided the             motivation for much of his philanthropy.
He funded relief programs for victims of domestic violence in New             York City, sponsored the Children's Health Fund's Mobile Medical             Unit which serves the children of homeless families, and supported             construction of new athletic fields at city high schools throughout             the five boroughs. He also served on the boards of 20 different civic, cultural, educational and medical institutions, including:             the High School for Economics and Finance; Lincoln Center for the             Performing Arts; Metropolitan Museum of Art; Police & Fire             Widows' & Children's Benefit Fund; S.L.E. (Lupus) Foundation and             Prep for Prep.

The Mayor served as the Chairman of the Board Trustees of Johns             Hopkins University until May 2002. Recently, he was honored by Johns             Hopkins University, when its School of Hygiene and Public Health was             renamed "The Bloomberg School of Public Health," a tribute             to his leadership and use of philanthropy to improve the human             condition.
In 1997, Michael Bloomberg published his autobiography, Bloomberg by             Bloomberg. All of the royalties from sales of the book are donated             to the Committee to Protect Journalists. More             Bloomberg at amazon
