"We applaud his candor,                but no one should be surprised. From Bill Clinton to George Pataki                to Clarence Thomas, many public officials have admitted something                pretty normal- theyve smoked pot." New York                City Ad by NORML

The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana                  Laws Foundation, ( NORML ),                  launched a new $500,000 ad                  campaign in New York City this week, urging an end to the                  massive number of arrests of pot smokers in this city, and features                  NYC Mayor Michael Bloombergs quote on his own use of pot. "You bet I did. And I enjoyed it," said then Mayoral                  candidate Bloomberg just before the elections last year when a                  New York magazine reporter asked about his pot use.
"Im not thrilled theyre using                  my name. I suppose theres that First Amendment that gets                  in the way of me stopping it," Bloomberg told reporters Monday                  when informed of the NORML ads graced with His Honors face                  and attributing the quote to him, but said that the NYPD will                  continue to vigorously enforce the laws. The campaign includes                  a full-page ad in the New York Times on April 9, as well as posters                  for bus stops, buses, and phone booths. There are also 2 60-second                  radio ads that will be played by the top stations in the city.

"Were not asking Mayor Bloomberg to                  change the law," said NORML founder and Executive Director                  Keith Stroup at a NYC press conference April 9, held in the Sheraton                  Hotels packed-to-capacity Liberty Suites. "Were                  simply asking him to end the double standard by which open                  container violations are handled with a ticket and a fine,                  while open smoking results in arrest and jail." Possessing 25 grams of marijuana or less is only a ticketable                  civil offense in NYC itself, similar to "open container laws," not even a misdemeanor. In 1992, when former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani                  took office, there were just 2,000 arrests of pot smokers. Until                  that time, cops would usually issue a ticket and fine instead                  of arresting people, yet by 2000, NYC was arresting approximately                  50,000 people for simple use and possession every year, nearly a 1,000 a week. The NYPD now runs most every pot smoker they catch                  through the criminal court system, which can take anywhere from                  24 to 72 hours, or longer, subjecting marijuana users to dangers                  far above and beyond any resulting from their simple use of pot,                  and the city will oftentimes attempt to coerce those arrested                  to plea out to charges they dont deserve under the law. "I would hope the Mayor realizes were not out to embarrass                  him," said Stroup, but rather that NORML is acknowledging                  the Mayors honesty "is a major step forward."
"We picked this city because of this great                  quote," as well as for its outrageous record for arresting                  more and more pot smokers every year, Allen St. Pierre, Executive                  Director of NORML, told Drugwar.com. St. Pierre noted that after                  hearing such insulting silliness as "I didnt inhale," and more from a variety of US politicians, Bloombergs candor                  was refreshing and offered a perfect opportunity to call attention                  to the ridiculous, hypocritical, and harmful anti-pot policies                  nationwide. "If Mayor Bloomberg is serious about saving the                  city some money, this is a great way to do it," said St.                  Pierre, alluding to Bloombergs efforts since taking office                  to drastically cut costs to the city.
"Most marijuana use is associated with very                  minimal health impacts, far less than the trauma of arrest, jail,                  and a permanent criminal record," said John P. Morgan, Md.,                  Professor of Pharmacology at the City University of New York (CUNY)                  Medical School, co-author, (with Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D.), of " Marijuana                  Myths, Marijuana Facts ", and member of NORMLs Board                  of Directors.

Much of the press pitched hardball but not all                  that relevant questions at the NORML representatives. "Doesnt                  buying drugs support terrorism?" asked one reporter. "Marijuana                  in the US is mainly a domestic product," said Stroup emphatically, "and of the three main countries that do export marijuana                  to the US, Canada, Mexico, and Jamaica, I dont remember                  any of them making it onto the US governments list of countries                  that support terror." St. Pierre chimed in that a hypothetical                  grow operation in Brooklyn, selling to buyers in Manhattan, would                  have zero links to terrorism whatsoever. "Are you possessing                  pot now?" asked another reporter of Stroup. "No, but                  if youre asking if I smoke pot, the answer is of course,                  for over 30 years, and Im a lawyer," replied Stroup.                  Wouldnt putting the Mayors admission to using and                  enjoying pot up all over the city give 13 and 14 year old kids                  the idea that since the Mayor smoked pot, it is ok that they smoke                  pot, asked another reporter. Stroup noted the "very first                  tenant of NORMLs Principles of Responsible Cannabis Use                  says cannabis is for adults only. NORML does not advocate                  the use of any drugs, not alcohol, not tobacco, not pot, for children.                  NORML advocates responsible use of marijuana by adults." Stroup said hed point to pro-pot rallies such as the Seattle                  Hemp Fest last year, attended by an estimated 150,000 people                  with only one arrest, hoping Mayor Bloomberg would learn something                  from those peaceful and successful rallies when asked by an activist                  what advice hed offer the Mayor as regards the annual Marijuana                  March in NYC, where arrests have numbered in the hundreds each                  year for the last few years.

Asked by Drugwar.com if there were plans for future                  similar campaigns in other cities, Stroup said, "First things                  first. Were not the federal government. We have a limited                  budget. We chose NYC mainly because of the Mayors statement,                  and the arrest data here." According to a new Zogby poll                  released by NORML at the press conference, 56 percent of New Yorkers                  oppose arrest for personal use of marijuana, with only 39 percent                  supporting it. Across the US, according to the US Government's National                  Household Study on Drug Abuse , 1 in 3 adults have tried smoking                  or in some way ingesting pot.
