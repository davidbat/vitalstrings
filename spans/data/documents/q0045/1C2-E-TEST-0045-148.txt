Bloomberg, you are on a roll!
Yesterday, we were SO PLEASED to announce that NYC Mayor Bloomberg would be opening city offices on Sunday July 24 so that gay couples could get married on the day that legalization of gay marriage takes effect.
Now, in another sweet and totally supportive move by Bloomberg, the NYC Mayor has offered to officiate his chief policy adviser John Feinblatt's marriage to his longtime partner/city's commissioner for consumer affairs Jonathan Mintz.
Here's what Mintz had to say about it when Feinblatt proposed Bloomberg's idea:
"The mayor and John popped the question."
Ha! Here's what Bloomberg had to say about it:
"John and Jonathan are two of the smartest and hardest-working people in our administration. This just felt like the best way for me to say thank you."
The wedding will take place on July 24 at Gracie Mansion. We're sure it will be an absolutely wonderful event!!!
