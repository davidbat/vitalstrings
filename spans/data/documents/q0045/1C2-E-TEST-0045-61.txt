Mayor Bloomberg: “I have my own army in the NYPD”
Mayor Bloomberg, who has come under scrutiny for his blatant disregard for the First Two Amendments, recently criticized President Obama for the Super-duper Committee’s failure in reaching a consensus and let’s face it, everyone knew that they were doomed to fail, super or not. His words, ring hollow during the very beginning of his speech and touch on the Occupy Movements problematic discourse, or lack thereof with the New York Mayor.
When prompted over whether he’ll seek to run for President, he said:
“I have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh biggest army in the world. I have my own State Department, much to Foggy Bottom’s annoyance. We have the United Nations in New York, and so we have an entree into the diplomatic world that Washington does not have,” Mayor Bloomberg said.

Recently the NYPD received the largest donation in the history of the foundation from JP Morgan in the  sum of $4.6 million. Soon thereafter, Occupiers were overwhelmed with police brutality. That’s some army Bloomberg has at his disposal.

Mayor Bloomberg almost lost his third term even though he funneled an obscene amount of money into his campaign. Bloomberg is Wall Street.
He’s also coyly hinting at a Presidential run.
Mayor Bloomberg closed by expressing the desire for someone with real, executive experience to arrive on the scene and change things in Washington. In other words, someone not like Obama and someone with more Wall Street experience. Someone who is exactly why protests have enveloped this country:
“Unfortunately, people at the federal level or the state level typically spend their whole lives in politics, and they’ve never been an executive and it shows,” Mayor Bloomberg said.
 
We don’t need another billionaire politician who boasts of his linkage to Wall Street while besieging the Occupy movement with an abundance of police presence through political maneuvering.
