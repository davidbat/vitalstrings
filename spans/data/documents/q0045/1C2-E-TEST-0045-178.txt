The plan to sidestep the United Federation of Teachers over evaluations was a bid to salvage up to $60 million in school improvement grants targeted to the 33 struggling schools. The city and the UFT are at an impasse over differences including due process protections for teachers who receive low ratings.
"We're not going to accept that," the mayor said. "And we're not going to allow ineffective teachers to remain in those 33 schools or in any school."
The UFT said the mayor is "fibbing" and has declared war on teachers.
Bloomberg said that under a plan consistent with the existing union contract, the city can form school-based committees to evaluate teachers on merit and replace up to half of the faculty in those schools.
"Under this process, the best teachers stay; the least effective go. And now, that is exactly what will happen," he said.
Bloomberg  also announced that teachers rated "highly effective" for two  consecutive years will receive a salary hike by $20,000 per year. It was not clear how that evaluation system would work.
The mayor also said he is taking another try at redeveloping a 575,000 square-foot armory in  the Bronx that he says could lead to the creation of hundreds of jobs.
In his speech, he announced plans to issue a request for proposals for the Kingsbridge Armory.
The city issued a similar request in 2006, but a deal to redevelop  the armory into a retail center fell apart amid calls by some elected  officials to require that workers at the center be paid what they called  a living wage.
 
Bloomberg has said he doesn't support a proposal currently being  considered by the City Council that would require all employees at  city-subsidized developments to be paid $10 per hour or more.
