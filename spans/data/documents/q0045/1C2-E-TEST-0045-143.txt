www.FinancialSurvivalNetwork.com presents: Our favorite whipping boy Little Brother aka Nanny Bloomberg, formally known as Michael Bloomberg, is at it once again. Nanny Bloomberg wants to ban sugary drinks that are sold in containers larger than 16 ounces. As usual he knows better than you, and he wants you to retain your boyish or girlish figure. But don't be too upset, you can still get that 1,000 calorie milk shake from Mickey D's and as of yet refills don't seem to be on his radar. These out of control, wannabe dictators must stay up nights thinking up these looney ideas. There's...

No more super-sized Cokes. Forget about 64-ounce stomach-busting sodas at KFC. Even 20-ounce Snapples are on Mayor Bloomberg’s latest heath-conscious hit list. In a dramatic move to reduce obesity, the city is going to become the first in the nation to impose a 16-ounce limit on the size of sweetened beverages sold in food establishments that receive letter grades from the Health Department, as well as mobile food carts. The list includes more than 20,000 restaurants, as well as movie theaters, stadiums and arenas. Bloomberg posed for a photo-op yesterday where he used sugar cubes as props to highlight how...

Here's a great way to reduce overhead and be effective at running a national organization dedicated to infringing on the gun rights of everyday people all at the same time... Have cities hire your people for you so that tax payers cover 1/4 of your people’s salary and benefits, pay for most of their operational costs, and finance all of their other resources! It also embeds your people as leaders in city government so that you don’t have to lobby there! Sounds like another conspiracy theory from the tinfoil hat brigade... Right? Back in March, while researching the repeal of...

I am asking all GOP voters in the Texas GOP primary on May 29, 2012, in state house district 64(Denton) to vote for Mike Brucia against six term incumbent Myra Crownover. Myra Crownover is a statist. She is another John McCain in the making(i.e. getting ready for a US House or Senate run). She is very anti-tobacco, and has made it her crusade to dictate to private business owners how they run their businesses over a legal product, tobacco. I know that alot on FR are anti-tobacco, but this is a core issue, what's next? Food and guns? Those who...

Ratcheting up his controversial proposal for revitalizing America’s cities, Mayor Bloomberg yesterday suggested that the federal government “deliberately force” large municipalities to take in immigrants as the only hope for salvaging their battered economies. Bloomberg spoke at a Midtown forum, timed to the release of a new study titled “Not Coming to America: Why the US is Falling Behind in the Global Race for Talent.” He was joined on the panel by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas, whose company helped underwrite the research. “I would argue the federal government should go one step further. They should deliberately force some places that...
