Livin' the good life
Maybe he should have said " [I am] used to seeing "inebriated" people hanging out of the windows at the center on St. Patrickâ€™s Day" and not placed the word Irish in there. How does he know everyone "hanging" out IS Irish?...Beau Colby

Blacks rant and rave and scream racism every time a white person even mentions the words chicken and watermelon in the same sentence.  I am genuinely surprised to see Irish Americans getting all flustered over something like this.

First of all, as a former and ALWAYs New Yorker I gotta tell you what Bloomberg should know: On St. Paddy's (Patty's) Day EVERYONE is IRISH IN NEW YORK CITY!!! That would mean that in the spirit of celebrating WE WERE ALL DRUNK!!
It was therefore really dumb of Bloomie to single the Irish out.

Secondly, you gotta see the spirit in which the comment was intended before the bristles go up.

The article forgot to mention: According to a statement from the Irish Historical Society, people have never drank and leaned out of the windows at the center. Jordana, is it all right to sweep some types of prejudice under the rug by presenting half the information?

I just LOVE it when these liberal weasels get caught up in their own little political correctness traps.  As they say...what goes around comes around!

Gee. Wonder how it would have been dealt with if a Irish American had made a similar comment about Jewish Americans ?  Especially in NYC.  Food for thought.

No self respecting Irish American would be offended by that.

I take it these people were sitting in Church every March 17th? Everyone is encouraged to be Irish for a day on St. Patrick's Day. What do people do on that day? They drink.
Why were these folks suprised? I doubt they were reading James Joyce at the meeting.

I have Irish blood in me and didn't take offense to this. People need to lighten up, grow thicker skin, or realize that if they really are taking something like this personally it could be because they are the ones with a problem

Whatever
Ah Mayor Bloomberg is learning quickly what it will be like if he wants to run for President. Watch what you say... he may think he is above being politically correct (PC) but no one is and does not matter what job you have either!!! He needs to attend diversity traniing to prove to the voters that he will know what and what not to say in mixed settings. WOW

.....I'm sure all will be forgiven.....But when jesse jackson, (im no fan of).  Made a comment about Jews.  Everytime, he comes to New york.  The comment he made is always thrown in his face.....  Let's face facts.  Will all make jokes about other etnic groups.  This is not new.  And believe, you me.  It will never stop.  In a way it's a way of venting.  It amazes me with all the etnic groups here.  We some how manage to some degree or another.  GET ALONG.
