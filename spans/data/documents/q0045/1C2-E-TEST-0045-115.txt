Bendoverben is right! Did you know that Mayor Bloomberg has 2 executive chefs on the taxpayer payroll.. I believe he pays one of them $120,000 a year. Yet this little hypocrite preaches to everyone that small jobs must be cut in NYC because we dont have the money. Start with your own office. Also I have to relate this story- my car was towed on Presidents day for parking on a private street in Queens due to alternate parking. Instead of just getting a ticket i had to pay $300! My dad asked the policeman in his neighborhood- and he told him its despicable but this is all coming from MAYOR Bloomberg who has put pressure on them to raise revenue. And someone i know who works for his company says he has an ego the size of the Pacific. I cant wait until he is gone!

Maybe he does need to pay his fair share. Maybe the government should confiscate a fair portion of his money. He doesn't need that much money. It's not his money anyways. Besides, after the government takes his they would never come after mine.
