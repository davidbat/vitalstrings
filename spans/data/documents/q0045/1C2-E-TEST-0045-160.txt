So you thought Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of NYC was out of touch with common folks? Think again. The NY Times reports today that hizzoner's home phone number is listed in the white pages, right there under "Bloomberg, Michael R." (You can also find it right here on anywho.com .) One agitated New Yorker reportedly rung up the mayor the other night, to find Bloomberg himself answering his bedside phone. Seems Mayor Mike is a pretty good sport about this kind of thing. Still, he'd prefer that New Yorkers direct any city-related business or questions to his favorite phone number in the world: 311.
