Separated At Birth
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Every single menu in New York City could soon be getting a major overhaul if Mayor Michael Bloomberg has his way.
The man behind calorie counts is set to announce a new public health initiative to battle obesity, taking aim at super-sized sugary drinks.
In other words, it may soon be time to say goodbye to those Big Gulps, those Slurpees or even Venti at Starbucks, CBS 2’s Derricke Dennis reported.
“That’s okay,” one person said.
No it’s not, according to Mayor Bloomberg, who is set to propose a ban on sugary drinks over 16 ounces everywhere, all across the city.
“I disagree with it, because it’s the right to choose. If you want to drink a Slurpee, you should be allowed to drink a Slurpee,” said Jamie Sawyer, a tourist from Oklahoma.
“Stupid, he did a lot of good things, but this he shouldn’t do,” added Art Lensvelt, a tourist from Amsterdam, Holland.
Dennis found Lensvelt enjoying his sugary iced coffee. He then found police officers actually fighting over Slurpees. Other items that figure to be banned are Gatorade, those fountain drinks at the movies, and, yes, the popular Big Gulp.
“That’s a good idea. A lot of obese people are in New York,” Canarsie resident Jillian Russell said.
And the mayor apparently agrees, taking aim at the sugar in sodas and some juices in an effort to reduce New Yorkers’ waistlines.
However, the NYC Beverage Association is opposed, saying in a statement: “The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda, because soda is not driving the obesity rates. The overall American diet is.
Either way, lovers of sugary drinks said Bloomberg should take a dip.
“Mayor Bloomberg, let us have our Slurpees, please,” one resident said.
