Blooming Idiot is a perfect example of the elites Anthony Codevilla describes in his recent book The Ruling Class. They see themserlves as anointed philosopher kings and we the hoipoloi as peasants to be trampled on & dirt to be ground into the earth.
It is this ruling elite exemplified by moronic billionaires such as Bloomingidiot, tax  evading Buffet, 7 prevaricating much married to heiresses Kerry, the pols, bureaucrats, union bosses, wackodemia, & the media who have with their stupidity, leftist ideology, hubris, arrogance, smugness, & horrible policies of the last 80 years delivered this nation to the brink of economic ruin, cultural depravity, moral collapse, financial insolvency, and looming totalitarianism. Codevilla’s book is  a must read if we are to inform ourselves save our nation, ourselves, & our posterrity.

All I can say is WHAT AN IDIOT Bloomberg is! Show me exactly WHERE in the US Constitution  the words “Separation of church and state” are, Mr. Blooming-freaking-idiot? Why do New Yorkers keep reelecting such an enormous waste of DNA? Are you kidding me? No firemen, cops or clergy?

There is no room for a small-minded idiot like Bloomberg there!!! Giuliani should be at the forefront of the NY memorial since he was such a great leader during 9/11!!!

When I hear Bloomberg, I think Obama.  Both are nothing but little tin dictators trying to put their noses into every part of our lives.  This little snot nose came after a good man that cleaned up that rat nest.  By the time he got it, people could walk down the street without being assaulted in broad daylight.
I guess NYC deserves him if they insist on voting for the twin/tiny man.  He makes me ill.  You can’t get much smaller than this little snit/snot.

Rob De Witt commented:
As Mayor Bloomberg’s office has patiently explained, there’s “not enough room” at the official Ground Zero commemoration to accommodate any firemen. “Which is kind of weird,” wrote the Canadian blogger Kathy Shaidle, “since 343 of them managed to fit into the exact same space 10 years ago.”

Just stand away from Mayor Korah Blooming Idiot and those who approve of him. Stand FAR away from them and concentrate on 2 Chronicles 7:14 and Psalm 91 – and stay far away from the Wicked.

Lying, evil, POS. There’d be plenty of room if he and is staff stayed away. No one wants them there anyway. They have survived DESPITE him. He’s changed his story several times anyway. He can’t keep his lies straight. I hope NY’ers get rid of him quickly.
