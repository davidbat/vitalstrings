Miami's American Airlines Arena is home not only to 2006 NBA Champion Miami HEAT, but also to the first major installation of Mediamesh in the United States. GKD and American Airlines recently unveiled the first-of-its-kind energy-efficient digital media façade which has transformed downtown Miami into what's being called "Times Square South." Blending seamlessly with the arena architecture, Mediamesh—with its stainless steel and embedded LEDs—covers the Arena's west face, making it the largest digital LED display in the Southeast region of the United States.
