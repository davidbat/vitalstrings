The 20,000-seat American Airlines Arena, home to the NBA Miami Heat and WNBA Miami SOL, is positioned on an 8.4-acre site on the serene and majestic Biscayne Bay. The arena, designed to accommodate basketball, hockey, and concerts includes amenities such as a 2.6-acre plaza, public terraces and balconies, private suites, a bar and lounge, restaurants, underground parking for 1,071 and a multi-purpose practice court.
One of the arenaâ€™s most unusual features is the installation of an ALIX retractable seating system at the event level to allow both uncomplicated and rapid conversion among seating arrangements. The event level is a structurally framed floor system above the parking level and has an ice rink constructed on a structural flat slab. The parking level constructed 15 feet below the 100-year flood elevation is a slab-on-grade construction with holes to relieve water pressure in the instance of flooding. An efficient tension-tied roof design resists uplift forces as high as 150 psf. The roof has large cantilevers on two sides and concrete framed sail structures on the opposite two sides.
