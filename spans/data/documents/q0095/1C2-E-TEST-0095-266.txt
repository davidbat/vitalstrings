Vacation Rentals  vs. Hotel Rates
Miami American Airlines Arena
The arena's maximum capacity is 19,600 for basketball, with slightly fewer seats for concerts. Fans will not only enjoy events, but also the spectacular views of the bay and Miami Beach skyline from public areas. Concessionaires include popular local restaurants such as People's BBQ, and you can also grab a bite at Bongo's, a Cuban restaurant owned by Gloria and Emilio Estefan.
