About Mediamesh
Mediamesh, a joint development between ag4 media facade and GKD, is a revolutionary new product that integrates digital imagery and color with metal fabric. Special LED strips are woven at regular intervals into GKD’s stainless steel mesh. The LEDs display all digital imagery, from logos to advertising and film clips. The LEDs are controlled remotely through a web-based user interface.
