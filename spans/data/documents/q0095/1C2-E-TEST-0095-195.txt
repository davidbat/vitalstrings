American Airlines Arena - Miami
Hello everyone,
Here's one of the American Airlines Arena in downtown Miami.  I was next door shooting ultra music festival and couldnt turn down this unique POV.  It's amazing how the stadium truly does fit in with the rest of the Miami art deco architecture.
Best of luck to the Miami Heat in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals vs. the Chicago Bulls.
More Info on American Airlines Arena:
The AmericanAirlines Arena opened on December 31, 1999 and its construction cost was $213,000,000. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The AmericanAirlines Arena was inaugurated with a concert by Gloria Estefan, two days later, on January 2, 2000, the Miami Heat played his first game in new stadium by defeating the Orlando Magic 111-103.
As part of its sponsorship arrangement, AmericanAirlines had a giant aircraft painted on top of the arena's roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design is visible from airplanes taking off and landing at Miami International Airport, where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called "Flagship Lounges," a trademark originally used for American's premium-class lounges at certain airports.
