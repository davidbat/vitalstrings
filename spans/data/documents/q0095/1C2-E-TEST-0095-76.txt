http://www.yctv.tv/miami/ - The American Airlines Arena is an arena located in Downtown Miami, Miami, Florida along Biscayne Bay and is used for basketball games and concerts. It was constructed as a replacement for the Miami Arena and was designed by the architecture firms Arquitectonica and 360 Architecture.   With Dwyane Wade leading the charge, the 2007-08 Miami Heat look to finish strong. Don't miss your chance to feel the Miami Heat LIVE at American Airlines Arena! The neighborhood is a study in contrasts... right across the street to the south is a festive plaza, arcade and marina, with shopping, restaurants, patio bars and nightclubs in abundance. The ambience of this place is truly special.  It is a great place to enjoy dinner or drinks before or after a Heat game in the warm Florida air, along with breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay and the causeways to Miami Beach.
601 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, FL 33132.  Parking starts at $15, with some lots at $10.  The cheaper lots are over towards Miami Arena, but unless you want to walk through this rough area, we suggest you pay the higher fee and park close by.   Meters are monitored 24-7, so if you park on the street you will be ticketed.
The Waterfront Theater is a theater within the arena that can seat between 3,000 and 5,800. It is Florida's largest theater and can be used for not only concerts but also family, Broadway and other stage shows.
