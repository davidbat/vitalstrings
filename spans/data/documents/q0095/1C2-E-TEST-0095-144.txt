LeBron's 'wow' moment opens eyes to ring reality
By Ira Winderman and South Florida Sun Sentinel, June 22, 2012
   "Wow. "          That was Dwyane Wade's reaction.          Not after Thursday night, after LeBron James completed a two-month run through the playoffs as dynamic as anything heretofore offered by Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and all the others who many said James might never become.         This "wow" did not come amid the streamers and confetti and champagne and jubilation that was 601 Biscayne Boulevard when Thursday turned to Friday, when the Miami Heat turned from 2011 NBA runners-up to 2012 NBA champions.

DJ Irie: He spins, he scores
By Micaela Hood and Sun Sentinel, June 20, 2012
It's the second half of Game 5 of the NBA Finals at the American Airlines Arena, and Miami Heat fans are going nuts. As "White Hot" Burnie, the Heat's mascot, dances courtside, DJ Irie spins a mix of tunes he put together to hype up the crowd. As the team's sole MC and mixer, he's feeding off the crowd's euphoria. Flashing a huge grin, he grabs the microphone and shouts, "If you love the Miami Heat, make some noise!"      Irie has been to three Finals with the Heat, and he was in Dallas when the team won the NBA championship in 2006, when Dwyane Wade was named MVP and LeBron James was still in Ohio.

Heat championship parade set for Monday in Miami
By Linda Trischitta, Sun Sentinel, June 22, 2012
Get out the white, red and black, and sprinkle on a bit of trophy gold!      The celebration for the Miami Heat's 2012 NBA Championship will be marked by a nearly two-mile parade Monday through downtown Miami.      And for Broward and    Palm Beach County    fans? There was nothing announced as of Friday afternoon, a Heat official said.      Though players like Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller own Broward properties, they'll have to commute south like the rest of the team's devotees, whose Heat car flags could be seen on game nights waving along I-95.

No tickets are no problem for some Heat fans at the arena
By Ihosvani Rodriguez, Sun Sentinel, June 19, 2012
There are court-side seats, nose-bleed seats and the $140-plus standing room only "seats," where you don't get to sit at all.      Then there are the seats that Justo Reina and his family chose  -  along with a few dozen others who showed up to the downtown Miami arena without any tickets to root for their Miami Heat squad.      Call it, seats alfresco.      "We're staying out here the whole night," Medina said. "You can still feel the energy out here.

Heat fans fill AmericanAirlines Arena for road rally

Everything seemed in place at AmericanAirlines Arena on Tuesday night.      The lights were flashing, the crowd was chanting, the sound was thumping  -  but something was missing.      Oh, yeah: the players.      Loyal Heat fans filled the arena to cheer on their favorite team in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, but instead of looking down at the action on the floor, people in the sold-out crowd of 14,005 hinged their necks up to the center-court Jumbotron to see Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and LeBron James play the Oklahoma City Thunder 1,482 miles away.

Celtics' ailing sharpshooter Ray Allen determined to fix jumper

Long before the Celtics team bus arrived at AmericanAirlines Arena for their shootaround Wednesday morning, ailing sharpshooter Ray Allen was hoisting up free throws and jumpers from every angle in an attempt to compensate for the imbalance in his motion because of a painful ankle injury.       "That's Ray," Rivers said. "Someone said, 'Should you go another way?' and I said, 'No, you want to give Ray a chance, every game, because you know he's going to do everything it requires.'

Concert review: Radiohead at the American Airlines Arena
by Jake Cline, Sun Sentinel, February 28, 2012
Twelve songs into Radiohead's 24-song set last night at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Thom Yorke, the band's anxious, elfin leader, asked the audience, “Are you still there?”      It may not have been a rhetorical question.      During the sold-out first show of a two-month tour that will take the widely acclaimed band across the United States and into Mexico, Radiohead came across unprepared at best and listless at worst. Beset by languid material and an apparent disinterest in building any momentum from one song to the next, the six-piece British act became something that once would have seemed unimaginable to its fans: Radiohead was a bore.       The band's pacing was off from the beginning.

Buying a hot dog outside AmericanAirlines Arena may soon be history
By Charles Rabin, The Miami Herald, July 13, 2011
Food vendors and Miami used to go together like hot dogs and sauerkraut. From Flagler Street to the old Miami Arena to the Orange Bowl, it seemed every corner had someone serving sausages, hot New York pretzels doused in mustard, shish-kabobs or arepas.       But as Miami evolved into gleaming condos, a bustling Civic Center and a thriving Government Center, the gritty roadside food vendor has gone the way of the Pinto -- still around but rarely seen, and, to some, not exactly aesthetically pleasing.

Good `Old Friends'
Robert Diamond Highland Beach, December 22, 2003
Old friends -- yes, they are. I just got back from a most enjoyable evening listening to the songs that made such an impact on my generation growing up in the '60s and '70s. Looking around the packed American Airlines Arena, I saw the ages probably spanned over four decades, all enjoying this wonderful duo.  Simon, of course, is the lyricist, bringing us the "sounds of silence" and the soundtrack to The Graduate. They sang tirelessly and I can't think of a song they left out of their repertoire.
