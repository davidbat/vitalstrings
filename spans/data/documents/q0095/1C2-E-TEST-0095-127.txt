American Airlines Arena
Compliments of Greater Miami CVB
Chances are if you watched the MTV Video Music Awards or the Latin Grammys you've seen the inside of the American Airlines Arena. They are broadcast live from the Miami venue. That also means that Jennifer Lopez and hubby Marc Anthony, Jessica Simpson and hubby Nick Lachey, Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Ashlee Simpson, Jay-Z, Usher and more were in town for one event or the other. Now you know why Miami is celebrity central.
Of course, the American Airlines Arena is home to the NBA Miami Heat who bring plenty of hoop-a-la to the court during basketball season.
