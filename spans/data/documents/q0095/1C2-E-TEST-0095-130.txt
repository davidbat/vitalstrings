American Airlines Arena Concert Tickets
The American Airlines Arena is located on the Biscayne Bay waterfront in downtown Miami Florida. It is near Bayfront Park and just across the street from the Bayside Marketplace shopping mall and small boat harbor. The area is most well-known as a concert venue and the stadium where the home games of the Miami HEAT basketball team are played.
The first event held at the American Airlines Arena was a Gloria Estefan concert on New Years Eve, Dec. 31, 1999. Gloria and her husband Emilio are the owners of Bongos Cuban Cafe which is located next to the stadium.
The American Airlines Arena was designed by Arquitectonica and 360 Architecture and it was built in 1999 as a replacement for now mostly inactive Miami Arena, which is located about three blocks away. American Airlines paid $42 million for the right have the new stadium named after them for a 20 year period. There is a giant aircraft painted on top of the arena which can be seen from planes flying in and out of Miami International Airport.
