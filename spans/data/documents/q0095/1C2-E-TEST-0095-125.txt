American Airlines Arena
The AmericanAirlines Arena is a sports and entertainment arena located in Downtown Miami, Florida along Biscayne Bay.  The Arena is home to the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. In the early 2000′s, the Women’s National Basketball Association team Miami Sol  played at the arena from the team’s birth in 2000 until the team’s folding in 2002. The AmericanAirlines Arena is served by the Miami Metrorail at Government Center Station and is within walking distance from Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre Station. There is more direct access to the arena within closer proximity via Miami-Dade Transit Metromover’s Freedom Tower Station and Park West Station.  (courtesy Wikipedia)
