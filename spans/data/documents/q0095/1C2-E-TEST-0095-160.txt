About American Airlines Arena
Stretching across 14 acres of downtown Miami, the AmericanAirlines Arena plays host to numerous shows, concerts, and sporting events every year. Home to the NBA Miami Heat, AmericanAirlines Arena suits fans of all ages, with plenty of room (nearly 20,000 seats and multiple suites), plenty of food (Cuban gourmet delicacies, pizza, seafood treats, and signature hot dogs), and plenty of attractions (a clear view from within the arena of the Miami skyline and Biscayne Bay). You won’t want to miss the infamous scoreboard, which changes colors depending on the atmosphere, or the Waterfront Theater within the arena, where Broadway and theater shows can be enjoyed. Since opening in late 1999, AmericanAirlines Arena continues to offer visitors a world-class entertainment experience they won’t soon forget.
