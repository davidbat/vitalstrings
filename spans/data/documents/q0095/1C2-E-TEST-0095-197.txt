American Airlines Arena (AAE)
If you go to any NBA basketball games in Miami, you'll end up at American Airlines Arena (technically the correct name is "AmericanAirlines Arena" - with no space).  Actually, if you go to any type of event in Miami, you've got a good chance of ending up there.  The Miami Heat of the NBA play their games at AmericanAirlines Arena, and are likely to be packed all season long with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh all suiting up for them.  It also houses the Waterfront Theatre, which can be used for family events, concerts, broadway shows, or other stage shows.  AAA also used to be home to the Miami Sol of the WNBA, before the team folded in 2002.

All public transportation puts you close to American Airlines Arena.  The MetroRail, MetroMover, and MetroBus all have drop off points within walking distance of the arena.

The station to get off the MetroMover at will be the Park West Station.  You then walk East to Biscayne Blvd and cross Biscayne Blvd and Port Blvd's intersections to get to the arena.
