Comissioned by the the Owner of the Dallas Stars NHL Franchise, Alexandra Champalimaud and Team had only 14 weeks to design and build what was a raw space.
Champalimaud first altered the shape of the room, transforming it from the standard rectangle into a trapazoid - narrow at the entrance and widest at the stadium seating overlooking the arena. "While it's not totally obvious, the funnel shape adds a perspective that energizes. It gives the room a sense of excitement" says Champalimaud.
At the entry is a built-in cabinet for the teams Stanley Cup trophy. The trapezoidal shape of the room is accentuated by the West African Ambuaya wood pannels, the grain oriented horizontally. The pannels hide a state of the art entertainment system including 4 plasma televisions, storage, a pop out bar and full dinner service. The floor is finished with a Bill Amberg buffalo leather rug framed in semi-opaque glass which, lit from beneath, gives the floor a rink-like luminessence. Mirroring the leather rug in shape is a goat parchment light box (ceiling mounted) framed in brushed nickel.
The Skybox can host up to 50 people.
