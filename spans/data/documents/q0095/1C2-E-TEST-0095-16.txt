The American Airlines Center (or "Dallas Arena") as seen in The Simpsons
Sports
After the Dallas Desperados played their first season in the AAC, they moved to nearby Reunion Arena and played there for their second season. For their third season, they moved back to the AAC, where they played until the league folded.
The PBR hosted a Built Ford Tough Series bull riding event at the AAC, annually, between 2005 & 2009.
The American Airlines Center, as well as the American Airlines Arena in Miami , Florida , hosted the 2006 NBA Finals , in which the Dallas Mavericks were defeated in six games by the Miami Heat . This was both teams' first appearance in the Finals. Because American Airlines held the rights to both venues in the final, the series was nicknamed by some as the "American Airlines series".

Hosted the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game on January 24, 2007.
Co-hosted the 2011 NBA Finals (Games 3, 4, and 5) with the American Airlines Arena in Miami (the same venues as the 2006 Finals), a rematch of the 2006 championship series against the Miami Heat. It was both teams' second appearance in the Finals, and this time the Mavericks won in 6 games. [15]

Concerts
The Dixie Chicks performed during their Top of the World Tour on July 6, 2003, with Michelle Branch as their opening act. It was at this show that lead vocalist Natalie Maines received a death threat, saying she'd "be shot dead" at this concert, due to her controversial comment toward President George W. Bush (himself a Texas resident, which was actually the basis for the comment).
The American Airlines Center is a usual stop for many world tours including those of Britney Spears , Lady Gaga , The Black Eyed Peas , Rihanna and many more.
Madonna will stop at the arena for her MDNA Tour on October 20th, and 21st, 2012. It will be her first time in 22 years to visit Dallas. She last stopped by on her Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, performing at Reunion Arena .
Other Info
Built on and in the shadows of the former Dallas neighborhood of Little Mexico , the beginnings of the Mexican American population in the Dallas area.
A few weeks after the first event, it was found that the glass installed in the bathrooms was not the same as what was originally intended. Many who drove by the arena complained they had a clear view into the restrooms. The glass was quickly changed to the correct type the next week.
The AAC was pictured in Season 20, Episode 8 of the Simpsons, as "Dallas Arena," with the city skyline behind it.
