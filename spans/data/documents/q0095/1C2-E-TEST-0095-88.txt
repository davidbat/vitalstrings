I saw Coldplay in Atlanta, Georgia on 11-5-2008.  Chris Martain opened the show with the following comment "It is about *&%^ time Amercia got something right, Obama"  The show got only better from there.  I decided on the way back to Tallahassee, Florida that I wanted to experience Coldplay again.  So my nephew, who hipped me to Coldplay, and I booked a week in London and attended the 9-19 show.  The set list was almost exactly the same but well worth the cost.  I will see the guys again on March 6, 2010 in Mexico City.  Three Coldplay shows, three different years in three different countires.  Life is Good
