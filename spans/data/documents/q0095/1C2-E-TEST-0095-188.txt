In 2010, the so-called “The Decision” of National Basketball Association player LeBron James made the summer city of Miami even hotter. The decision of the NBA superstar to join the Miami Heat sent waves around the nation and put Miami under the spotlight.
Now, proudly housing this NBA season’s hottest team is the American Airlines Arena. Located in downtown Miami, Florida, this multi-purpose sports and entertainment stadium can seat up to 19,600 people. Constructed in 1998, this $213-million dollar building not only hosts the home game of the Miami Heat, it also hosts several activities such as concerts, fairs, family events, conventions, and even off-Broadway shows. It has 2,105 club seats and 80 luxury suites. Florida’s largest theater, the Waterfront Theater, is contained within the arena. The theater has a seating capacity up to 5,800.
