The arena of choice for basketball fans, with gorgeous views and lots of luxury seating.. The Venue
Situated on prime bay-front land in downtown Miami, the venue hosts the Miami Heat and Miami Sol basketball teams and also offers a number of concerts throughout the year. Its luxury sky boxes, clear sight lines and acoustics make it one of the prime places to catch an entertainment event.
The Experience
The arena's maximum capacity is 19,600 for basketball, with slightly fewer seats for concerts. Fans will not only enjoy events, but also the spectacular views of the bay and Miami Beach skyline from public areas. Concessionaires include popular local restaurants such as People's BBQ, and you can also grab a bite at Bongos, a Cuban restaurant owned by Gloria and Emilio Estefan.â€¦
