 
• You're interested in tickets for an event on the same day or the following day:
When tickets are listed on the day of the event, shipping option changes to "near-term delivery". This means the broker will either have will-call tickets, email the tickets, have a courier or have the tickets available at their office. You will be contacted shortly after placing order with instructions. 
 
If you have special instructions please enter them in the notes area on the order form.
We prefer to ship tickets whenever possible. If there are specific reasons that make this impossible or impractical please do call and let us know. We will do our best to accommodate you where possible.
 
• Group Orders:
For those customers with groups needing tickets. Please use the contact form as opposed to phoning first. We will contact you shortly after receiving your request with details.
Thanks again for choosing Ticketstub.com® we appreciate your business and will continue to do our best to make sure you get to the game or event you want to be at.
Great site, its one of the easiest to use I've found. btw ... It would be really cool if you guys had a forum for us to exchange our experiences at the shows. Any plans for it?
