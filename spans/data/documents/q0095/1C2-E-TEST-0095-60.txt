Adele Tickets
American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida is one of the premiere sports and entertainment venues in Florida. American Airlines Arena tickets are popular with south Florida residents because they offer a wide variety of premium entertainment. Ticket sales have been incredible since the first day American Airlines Arena opened its doors in 1999. Part of the demand for box office tickets stems from the fact that American Airlines Arena is the home venue for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. The Heat and superstar Dwayne Wade have always been a hit at the box office, but the demand for event tickets featuring the Miami Heat went to a different level when they won the NBA title in 2006. It was hard to find an available seat during their playoff run, despite the fact that the seating capacity is 20,000. Nothing beats seeing the Heat at American Airlines Arena play championship caliber basketball.
Miami Heat basketball isn't the only event on the schedule. Tickets are offered for a wide variety of events, so that regardless of age or interests there's something for everyone at American Airlines Arena. Tickets have included world class entertainment such as WCW and WWE events and the MTV Video Music Awards. The very popular event UFC was also a featured live event. American Airlines Arena concert experiences feature some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. The list of musical guests includes Phish, Queen, Wisin y Yandel, Tina Turner, Marco Antonio Solis, Madonna, and Celine Dion.
