American Airlines Arena Information:
The American Airlines Arena is located in downtown Miami, and is used for hundreds of sporting events, concerts, and shows each year. Since opening its doors in 1999, the American Airlines Arena has been known as one of the best venues in the entire country. Not only does it offer top notch modern amenities, but there is not a bad seat in the house. For this reason, thousands of people flock to the American Airlines Arena every time that an event is held inside.
The American Airlines Arena only has one major tenant; the Miami Heat of the NBA. The Miami Sol of the WNBA used to call this venue home as well, but in 2002 the franchise folded and they are no longer in existence.
Located along Biscayne Bay, American Airlines Arena offers a great atmosphere outside to go along with the fun inside. Views are spectacular, and many visitors have just as much fun outside before an event as they do when they step foot inside.
The seating arrangements at American Airlines Arena can be configured in five different ways depending on what event is taking place. The maximum capacity of this venue is 20,000, and it is safe to say that this mark is met on a regular basis.
Over the years the American Airlines Arena has hosted some great events. In 2006 the Miami Heat won the NBA Title with the help of the raucous crowd cheering them on. Additionally, many performers such as Madonna and Gloria Estefan have played at American Airlines Arena.
Anybody who has the chance to see an event inside American Airlines Arena should take advantage. No matter if it is an NBA basketball game, concert, or show; any event that takes place inside this arena is sure to be loads of fun.
