This design is also      found inside where views of the city skyline and bay can been seen from the      concourse. Nearly 20,000 fans can watch the Heat play from three levels of      seats that enclose the court. The arena has five configurations that can be      arranged to seat 5,000 to 20,000 fans. American Airlines Arena has many      amenities including a restaurant and bar that has views of the bowl. Fans      can attend games in luxury by sitting in the view level that has seating for      800 fans. The Heat have one of the most modern and sleek video/scoreboards      in the league that changes colors depending on the atmosphere during games.      Heat fans attending games during the past several years have seen one of the      best teams in the NBA, as the Heat won the 2005-06 and 2011-12 NBA     Championship. American      Airlines Arena hosts many other events other than the Heat including      concerts and hosted the 2009 NCAA Basketball Tournament.
