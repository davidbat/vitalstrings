Lil Wayne’s Ex-Girlfriend Nivea To Launch Charity For Teen Moms
July 13th, 2011
Lil Wayne’s ex-girlfriend Nivea is launching her own charity to provide support and guidance for troubled teen moms.
The R&B singer, 29, was prompted to take action after researching the numbers of young American girls having kids in difficult situations, and she wants to reach out to them and offer words of wisdom.
Nivea is particularly enthusiastic to help those abandoned by their families and forced to live in homeless shelters.
She tells Sister 2 Sister magazine, “I’m starting up a charity… I would really like to talk to these young girls. I’m hearing so much about girls in these shelters and these 12 and 13 year olds having babies and they have no parents at all. They have no one there to tell them it’s not the end of the world.
“You (sic) scared, you didn’t mean to do that or whatever the case is – they’re just sitting in shelters, waiting ’til they can get a job so they can take care of a baby or two that they have and it’s the most depressing thing. All we have to do is sit down and have a conversation with some of these girls and inspire them and give them something (to live for) ’cause it’s just bad.”
Becoming a young mom is something Nivea is familiar with – she fell pregnant with her first child, daughter Navy with ex-husband The-Dream, when she was 22.  She also had twin boys, now five, with The-Dream and has a son, two-year-old Neal, with ex-fiance Wayne.
