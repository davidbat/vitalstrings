she laughed and walked away
and I couldn’t stop her
I guess she had it all
she had it all figured out
but she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cuz she didn’t think i could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is crying sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything could turn around
get up!
