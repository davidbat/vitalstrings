Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday Party with Lil Wayne
After warning her fans not to view her as a one-dimensional artist, Nicki Minaj partied it up with Lil Wayne while hosting her album release party inside the Fountainbleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida on Sunday (April 8).
Looking to be wearing some sort of clunky armor, the "Super Bass" singer showed off her curvy figure in a white fishnet top, black bra, tights and tall black boots for her "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded" bash at LIV nightclub.
