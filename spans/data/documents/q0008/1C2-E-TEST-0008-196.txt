A millionaire I'm a Young money millionaire tougher than Nigerian hair,
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair,
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed...
Threw the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind,
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar,
And the all mighty power of dat cha cha cha cha chopper,
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motha fuck a copper,
Got da maserati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin,
Tell the coppers: hahahaha you can't catch em, you can't stop em,
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat em then you pop em,
You can't man em then you mop em,
You can't stand em then you drop em,
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher,
A millie in here a millie in there
Sicilian bitch with long hair with coke in the derriere
Like smoke in the thinest air I open the Lamborghini
Hopin them crackers see like look at dat bastard Weezy
Hes a beast hes, a dog hes, the muthfukin problem
Ok your a goon but what’s a goon to a goblin?
Nothin, nothin you ain’t scarin nothin
On some faggot bullshit call em dennis rodman
Call me what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it’s private damn I hate a shy Bitch
Don’t u hate a shy bitch? yea I fucked a shy bitch
And she ain’t shy nomoe she changed her name to My bitch
Yea nigga that’s my bitch
So when she ask for the money when you through don't be suprised bitch
And It ain’t trickin' if u got it
But u like a bitch with no ass u ain’t got  shit
Muthafuka I’m ill not sick
And I’m ok, but my watch sick
Yea my drop sick
