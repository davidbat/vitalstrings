Lil Wayne Tattoos
Lil Wayne, otherwise known as Weezy, has an enormous collection of tattoos. In fact, most of his body is covered, from his face all the way down to his legs. So, instead of trying to describe every single one of his designs, I’m going to give you a little taste of Lil Wayne’s tattoos. The most prominent ones can be seen on his face. These include four teardrops, two under each eye, which represents close family members who have died. He also has "fear" tattooed over one eye lid and "God" tattooed over his other one.
He has the letter "C" tattooed between his eyes on his forehead which stands for his mother ‘Cita’. Other Lil Wayne tattoos include a smiley face tattooed on his inner lip, a vein tattoo which extends down his neck and on his forehead, and a gun tattoo on his right palm. But, that doesn’t even hit the tip of the iceberg for Lil Wayne’s tattoos. His entire back is done with a prayer and a huge skull tattoo. He also has his entire front covered with such things as a red star, the word god and several different collages. And that is still not a complete list of Lil Wayne’s tattoos.
