Check out the third single from Lil Wayne‘s upcoming Tha Carter IV album, dropping on August 29th. The track, which is titled “How To Love“, is totally different from “6 Foot, 7 Foot” and “John“, as Weezy has gone for a slower record with him singing throughout it.

Do you think this single will get as big as “Lollipop”
