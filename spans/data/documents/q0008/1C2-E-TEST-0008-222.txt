naw your a stupid mother fucker if you think weezy is the best i dont know if you wayne lovers are deph or just fucking stupid. Wayne does not come hard anymore yo and you know it wayne has not put out a real wayne album in years? why you think every mother fucking rapper in the game is putting out song dissin on wayne? man your idol is the fakest nigga in the game he dosnt sell drugs hes never killed no one he aint no blood so then y is he jumping on all these tracks saying dumb shit? cassidy will rip wayne any day of the fucking week he has called wayne out to battle him to show the world who is the best if wayne is then why the fuck wont he do it? cassidy has a song called "lets get it" when he calls wayne out cassidy has killed sumone and gone to jail for it, he has gone to jail for selling drugs so in my mind he is one of the only real rappers in the game so get the fuck off the radio and get your shit rite anyone can put a fucking autotune on their voice and sing a fucking song i hope you and all the other 14 year old girls in the world stay on waynes dick so i dont gotta listen to him

i agree wit all dat shit except for the cassidy line. dont get me wrong i think cassidy would kill weezy hands down but he turned down a battle with murda mook for a 100 thousand. now murda get's sonned by alot of niggas. and u honestly mean to tell me u would turn down a 100k just to charge up a nigga for 15 rounds? this nigga's resolve is in question. if u turn down an easy 100k y would u battle for just a title that aint even held(cuz wayne aint the best freestyler alive)? u gonna forever be son u should live in a ball sack
