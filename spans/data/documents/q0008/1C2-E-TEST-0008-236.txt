    The semi-documentary then focussed on Lil Wayne having a child at the the age of sixteen and moving his mom out of the ghetto when he started to make money with his first big checks coming from his days as a member of the Hot Boys alongside Juvenile, B.G. and Turk. Turning to his solo career, the show features behind the scenes looks and insights on the making of all of Weezy's albums including his latest "Tha Carter III." The episode features interviews with Baby, Slim, Juvenile, B.G., Record Company Executives and more, make sure you check it out! [ Lil Wayne's Behind The Music - Watch Here ]
