Lil Wayne Going to Jail
Posted: October 21, 2009
Rapper Lil Wayne is going to jail as part of a plea deal to avoid a longer term behind bars on gun charges.
According to reports, Lil Wayne will plead guilty for his possession of a .40 caliber gun found on his bus in 2007. Lil Wayne was expected to protest his innocence, but an announcement by authorities that they were to confirm Lil Wayne’s DNA was found on the gun making the chances of a conviction far more likely, bought about the change.
Under the deal, Lil Wayne will reportedly plead guilty for possession in exchange for an 8-month term in jail.  If 8 months sounds harsh, Lil Wayne could have faced 15 years behind bars for each count of criminal weapons possession and criminal possession of a loaded weapon. It’s believed that authorities will drop the other charges in return for the guilty plea on the lesser charge.
Lil Wayne joins a long list of rappers who have faced or spent time in jail, a move that it nearly a right of passage in some parts of the industry.
