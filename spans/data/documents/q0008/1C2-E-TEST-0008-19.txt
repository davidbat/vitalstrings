Lil Wayne
Lil Wayne crowned himself the greatest rapper alive on his 2005 album Tha Carter II and then proceeded to back up that claim with a remarkable creative hot streak, producing a career’s worth of great mix tapes and guest spots over the next few years. He capped off the run with 2008’s Tha Carter III, which sold more than a million copies in its first week. His grizzled rhymes were as all-over-the-place as he was, ranging from quick-tongued braggadocio about girls, cash and guns to gut-wrenching expressions of personal pain.
