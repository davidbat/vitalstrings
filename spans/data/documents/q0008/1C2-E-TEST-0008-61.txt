Biography
The newest addition to the many 'Lil's' in the hip hop music industry, Lil Wayne, is a force to be reckoned with. His debut album, ' Tha Block is Hot ' (1999) went double platinum upon its release and even his lowest selling album is still certified as gold upon the album release by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite his success in the music industry, Lil Wayne's childhood experiences, like many other rap and hip hop singers, were far from perfect.
