About Lil Wayne
Lil Wayne has been a staple of hip hop since he was 15 years old, starting out with a short stint as a part of Hot Boys. Wayne was born Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr., in September 1982. Wayne founded Hot Boys along with fellow rappers B.G., Turk, and Juvenile. Together, they released three albums, one of which, Guerrilla Warfare, broke through to the top ten on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum. Wayne launched a solo career while he was still with the Hot Boys and in 1999 released Tha Block is Hot. The album reached number three on the charts, was certified platinum, and spawned an equally popular single of the same name.
However, the success was not to continue on the next two albums. Although certified platinum, 2000's Lights Out only reached #16, while 2002's 500 Degreez charted higher but sold just over 500,000 copies. Two years later, Lil Wayne was able to find his voice again, releasing the smash hit Tha Carter, which reached #5 on the charts and sold over a million records. The next two albums, Tha Carter II and Tha Carter III, were even more popular. When combined, the albums have have sold over four million copies. Both have been praised by critics and fans alike, with IGN calling Tha Carter II "Wayne at his most focused...".

His latest album is I Am Not a Human Being, which hit stores in late 2010. Besides his studio albums, Lil Wayne is well known in the underground mix tape scene, having released seven since 2004. Many of the mix tapes have become very popular among fans. Wayne is the founder of Young Money Entertainment, which also manages Drake and Nicki Minaj .
