More info About Lil Wayne
Bio
He’s a four-time Grammy winner, with sales of over ten million to his name – a name which, in the past, has been tied to more than its fair share of controversy. However, what cannot be contested is the sheer musical genius of this rap superstar. Eventful is where you'll find all the latest on Lil Wayne tour dates and concerts 2011.
Michael Dewayne Carter, Jr. aka Lil Wayne, came from humble beginnings - born and raised in the infamous Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans. He began his career at the tender age of 12, when his indisputable talent was spotted by Cash Money Co-CEO, Bryan ‘Birdman’ Williams. With a sneaky suspicion that one day Lil Wayne tour dates might become a major hot ticket item, Williams took charge of the young rapper, guiding him as he embarked on the road to stardom.
Lil Wayne made his first real foray into the game in 1993, as part of a duo which later in 1997 became a four-piece. As the ‘Hot Boys’, the group sold over half a million records. With a solid base understanding of the workings of the industry, Lil Wayne released his debut album as a solo artist in 1999. It went on to sell over two million copies, the huge demand for Lil Wayne tour dates right across the county equally reflective of the artist’s mass appeal.
While his star had been on the rise for some years prior to 2008, this was when Lil Wayne secured his spot amongst the music elite with the release of his album, Tha Carter III. The record sold one million copies in its first week alone, and earned Lil Wayne eight Grammy nominations, four of which he won. His signature imagery, wit and rhyming patterns have resulted in Lil Wayne tour dates becoming some of the most anticipated events on the rap music calendar.
As buzz about the rapper continues to grow, each new Lil Wayne concert schedule brings with it more tour dates and bigger venues, taking the rapper from coast to coast, north to south and right across the globe. Indeed, it seems fitting that the Lil Wayne concert schedule is as busy as his music is diverse; over the years, he has collaborated and performed with the likes of Usher, Akon, Destiny’s Child, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Eminem.
With the most recent Lil Wayne concert schedule currently rolling out, fans of the rapper will want to stay informed on if and when he’s coming to a venue near you. Don’t miss out– make Eventful YOUR source for all the latest news and up-to-date information on Lil Wayne tour dates 2011 and beyond.
