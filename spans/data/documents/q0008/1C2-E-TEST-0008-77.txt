I've been listening to lil wayne since '97 and his flows changed, he is NOT the best rapper alive, eminem is. I am a BIG FAN of lil wayne, BUT i wish lil wayne wrote his own sh1t like Em does, but he doesnt. it does seem that lil wayne can flow, he prolly can, just his verses are written by numerous writers and himself. =/ cant wait for the carter 4 tho.

Lil Wayne doesnt have writers, he doesnt even write that often. Im a huge fan of his music. Hes a improved Jay Z-whom im not a big fan of- Wayne's real test is to see if he can do what Jay Z has done for the game over time. But looking at what he done so far make him the BEST ever. More songs than Pac and as for hits or anyones personal favorites. You'll notice that you can find more Wayne songs you like compared to other rappers. Eminem only did real good, but no hes not better-HELL NO. Boosie is ok- needs to bemore flexible with different styles. Jay Z (who i dont listen to, much) is really the only one to compare Wayne wit. Number 1 is Wayne or Jay Z. Two is K. West or Luda. People PLEASE get it right- Wayne is the BEST ever.

yo no doubt lil wayne can rap it up i listened to his early works when it was all spit spit spit true over the years his styles have changed now its like he jus singin...check Eminem, from the time he first got picked up by dre he been spittin n spittin those lyrics out. in my opinion em's a heck of a lyricist and i can understand more what he rappin about in his tracks. i wouldnt neccesarily say waynes overated he's jus overplayed same with drake. wonna talk about true RAPPING jay-z tupac eminem and t.i. keep it real. Drake is fake n Tupac is dust on the table...1.)Eminem 2.)Lil Wayne 3.)Jay-Z 4.)T.I. 5.)Tupac

Dwayne Michael Carter is the best rapper there has ever been. Whenever my mates ask me to listen to a new song, i ask if it is by Lil Wayne, and if they say no, then i dont bother listening to it. Lil Wayne is the only rapper i listen to, i have no time to listen to any others. 'Lollipop' is the first song i had ever heard by Lil Wayne, and ever since, i have loved him. I have a playlist on iTunes with over 200 songs by/featuring him. My lifes dream is to meet Lil Wayne but unfortunately i live in Australia and it is a bit hard for my dream to come true unless he does a concert in Melbourne. My favourite songs by Lil Wayne are 'We Be Steady Mobbin', 'I'm Me' and '3 Peat'. If i could chose to have any voice in the world, i would chose Weezy's. I am so crazy about Weezy that when someone i know says something bad about him, i beat them up. I hope that you read this Weezy and think about havin a concert in Melbourne, and forfilling a 14 year old boys fream. Keep doing what you do best. Your biggest fan.

Alright look lil Wayne he definataly is one of the greatest. But those of you saying f@&k eminem and biggie. Eminem has a completly different style of rapping as Wayne. Wayne is someone who raps basically about mindless stuff that he's never done. Don't get me wrong we be steady mobbin is a great song to listen to but it has no point. Hell I've heard every song by Wayne that he has ever come out with and some of his best tracks are off mixtapes. But anyone who really disses eminem is just stupid whoever has a little list from who's the best rapper is just plain retarded. Rapping can't be judged on who thinks they're the best or not. Rap is the type of music where it all depends on what is going on in the persons life and how it speaks to you.

well wayne head your not too smart are? tupac was def. got a contract a early age (like 14 or 15) but his mom wouldn't let him accept it. Lil Wayne possibly has more songs made now, but if you really think about it Tupac was only a MAJOR rapper for less than a year and in that short period he sold over 7 million albums (total 1996), he's sold over 75 million world-wide, and he still has unreleased material (one or two albums coming out this year, a movie that he wrote, and there's talk of a documentary like Ntorious that was recorded before Notorious was but it wasnt released b.c. of legal issues). Wayne is GREAT to me, but come on he's not bigger than Tupac is and he's (wayne) been rapping way longer. Wayne probably could get bigger if he dies (and i dont want him or anybody to die) but i still doubt that..I really don't like Wayne's albums b.c. they always too highly anticipated for what they sound like, but Wayne def. has the mixtape game on look, easily the greatest ever at that!

None of you know a damn thing about hip hop.
Lil Wayne's bitch ass would get killed in a battle by any real MC.
He gets dissed all the time and he never responds because he's a pussy.
He admited he couldn't fuk with Eminem even though he says he's the best rapper alive
He said that he didn't "feel" 2pac's music.
He admits that he likes Fall Out Boy
He dresses and acts like a faggot then tries to pretend that he's hard on his mixtapes
Wiggers love him
Fabulous murdered him own his own track
It's a well known fact that Rebirth is the worst album of the decade
He kissed Birdman on the lips
He got murdered by Eminem on Drop the World
Lil Wayne is a hoe

It's funny because half of you are just saying waynes the best because everybody else says it. Anybody who judges a rapper by how old their material dates is not a real hip hop head. 2 pac made classics that if some of you young heads would take the time out and turn off the lil wayne pride to listen to what he is saying, time would be of no value because it is timeless. Nobody said anything about nas and his skills. A lot of you people just grew up off these new rappers and believe that they are the best because they told they were. The bottom line is that this really just your opinion. Hip hop is not about how much money you make in the game, Its the music you push that can make a change in people's lives and the only change I see is more women getting loose, men losing morals, and more violence within the schools. As far as skill, The game has yet to find an artist that can hold down the old school and the new school. If there was there would be no question because everyone would agree to that choice. People love lil wayne because he is street, but in a since he candy coats a lot of things. We will see that one rapper that will rock the entire world on a positive and negative side and capture all fans. The time has come for a new beginning in the game. As for the cater 4, me and a bucnh of my peps are very disappointed. Nothing is serious and he got to weak ass songs by some new guy on there. The biggest hip hop rip off.

Eminem is the best rapper hands down with the simple fact that no one can touch his lyrics. His crazy ass rhymes and they way he puts them out there so fast.....read his lyrics youll be blown away how he comes up with some s@%t. i was just listening to wyane and all his s@%t is slow and he spits rhymes on a 6th graders level. All wyane wants is your money, no heart or love for the game like em or pac.

WTF! Yeah Wayne has good verses that are catchy and whatnot but nothing compared to Pac & Big. That nigga wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. Alot of these wack ass & fake ass rappers wouldn't be here if it weren't for them! And as far as Wayne being the best rapper...HAAA! His music is chillan to listen to when your getting fukd up or something but honestly who can relate to what he raps about? It like okay, who the f__k you know has like 12 lambos, f__ks 10 bitches on a daily basis, & is PROBABLY permanently high from so many damn drugs? No one! What he raps about is unrealistic. YES mother f__kers, HIP HOP IS DEAD! And ain't no way in f__kin HELL you can say Wayne brought it back cause at the end of the day his music's just crap. If you want REAL music, go f__kin' listen to NAS, Atmosphere, Living Legends, Heiroglyphics, IMMORTAL TECHNIQUE, Cunning Lynnguists & all that GOODsheeeit. I don't wanna hear no f__king auto-tuned out frog voice talking bout money bitches & cars most ppl will never have, I wanna hear REAL ppl spitting about REAL things & REAL problems. Wayne is just another craze. Y'all are just followers on the real. Look at all these stupid ppl calling theirselves "Weezy F. Baby" & "Drizzy" & "Barbie". Like c'mon now, we all f__kin' know you ugly as a monkey & half y'all "Nicki's" out there are fat & ugly. Just get over Wayne & Young Money. Their lyrics have NO substance. And why everybody tryna be a rapper now? Hahahaha KEEP IT REAL! '93 TIL INFINITY!:) Graff life baby!<3 Yes the only FEMALE holding it down for the EPTX. (:
