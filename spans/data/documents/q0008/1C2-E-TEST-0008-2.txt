Lil Wayne was born Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. and grew up in the Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. [3] Carter was born when his mother, a chef, was 19 years old. His parents were divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Carter enrolled in the gifted program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School. [4]
Lil Wayne has four children. His first child, daughter Reginae, was born when he was 15, [5] to his high school sweetheart Antonia "Toya" Carter (née Johnson). Wayne and Johnson married on Valentine's Day of 2004 and divorced in 2006. [6] Internet rumours started circulating in August 2008 that Wayne's daughter had died in a car crash, which however he quickly cleared up as false saying "Please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive, healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly. The rumors are completely false and unfounded; neither Reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident." [7] His second child, Dwayne III, was then born on October 22, 2008 at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati . [8] His third child, Cameron Carter, was born to actress Lauren London on September 9, 2009. [9] He had his fourth child, Neal, on November 30, 2009 with singer Nivea . [10]
In a CBS interview with Katie Couric , Wayne described why he goes by the name of "Wayne" instead of his given name, Dwayne. Carter explained, "I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne". Couric asked Wayne if his father knew of this and Wayne replied with a smile, "He knows now". [11]
He wrote his first rap song at age eight. [5] In the summer of 1991, he met Bryan Williams , rapper and owner of Cash Money Records . Carter recorded freestyle raps on Williams's answering machine, leading him to mentor the young Carter and include him in Cash Money-distributed songs. He also recorded his first ever collaboration album True Story with rapper B.G. . At the time, Carter was 11, and B.G. was 14, and was billed as " The B.G.'z ". [12] When he was 12, he played the part of the Tin Man in his middle school drama club's production of The Wiz . [13] At age 13, he accidentally shot himself with a 9 mm handgun, and off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler drove him to the hospital. [14] At McMain Magnet School, Carter was an honor student, but he dropped out at the age of 14 to focus on a musical career. [15]
Career
1997–99: Career beginnings and Hot Boys
In 1997, Carter joined the Hot Boys along with rappers Juvenile , B.G., and Turk . At age 15, Carter was the youngest member at that time. Hot Boys' debut album Get It How U Live! was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut Guerrilla Warfare , [3] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard magazine Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200. [16] During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, " We on Fire " from Get It How U Live! and "I Need a Hot Girl" from Guerrilla Warfare. [17] Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single " Back That Azz Up ", which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.

His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut [3] but was certified gold by RIAA . [21] Critics pointed to the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. [22] The lead single was "Get Off The Corner" which was noticed for an improvement in lyrical content and style, it also received a music video. The second single which received less attention was "Shine" featuring The Hot Boys .

Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez , released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh . While certified Gold like its predecessor, [21] it too failed to match the success of his debut. [3] The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez . [23] The lead single was "Way Of Life" which like the album failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, he was featured in the single " Neva Get Enuf " by 3LW . [24]
In the summer of 2004, Wayne's album Tha Carter was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes.

Other singles included "Grown Man", "Hustler Muzik", and "Shooter" (featuring R&B singer Robin Thicke ).

They might think they've got a pretty jump shot or a pretty good flow, but our kids can’t all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne.

I want them aspiring to be President of the United States of America. [108]
Obama has also noted that the music on his iPod includes Lil Wayne:
My rap palate has greatly improved. Jay-Z used to be sort of what predominated, but now I've got a little Nas and a little Lil Wayne and some other stuff. [109]
