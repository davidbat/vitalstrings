Lil Wayne – Rollin Lyrics
G5 sitting on the runway
Big ass chopper: call that bitch Beyonce
This for my dawgs locked down all day
Money, power, respect: 3 the hard way
I put some real niggas on their feet, boy
So they’ll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB boy
Young Tunechi fresh to death
Rest in peace, boy
My Gat bang your hat hang
I ride off with Mack Maine
I drink Patron straight
You niggas keep that champagne
My pa is the Birdman
I’m rich as a white man
I come to your show and kill you
And your hypeman
We roll in, let’s roll out
My bitches don’t hold out
They got Marley G
I gotta bond my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out
My bitch got a blow out
Mi casa, su casa
My house is, a ho house
Only f-ck with, real niggas
Polo, f-ck that Hilfiger
Yeah I’m on a pill nigga
Feed you to my little niggas
Shout out to my big homies
Fifi and T-Streets
Scope on that AK make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one
Razor blade on the tongue
You ain’t never seen this watch
Nigga, this a one of one
You niggas is honey-bun
Your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum, muthaf-cker
Give a drummer some
Cut that like my blunt is done
Suck a nigga’s dick or something
Put that p-ssy for me then wile out
And then give my nigga’s some
I’mma do my thing
I put that on Nicki Minaj, I need a bad redbone
To come give my dick a massage
I’m talking big money
I’m talking heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup
Now I’m in better shape
I’m from New Orleans nigga
Where you ain’t never safe
Who f-ck with me, I drop you off
In front of Heaven gates
OK, jump off a building
Jump out a window
And f-ck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish
That’s right, you know this
Hold up: click-clack
