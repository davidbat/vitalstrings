25 Keyshia Cole Enlists Lil Wayne for New Single ‘Enough of No Love’
Keyshia Cole was back in front of the camera shooting a video for “Enough of No Love,” the lead single off Woman to Woman, her first album since 2010’s Calling All Hearts.  The R&B songstress shares her heartbreak on the song, which features Lil Wayne.
Her husband Daniel “Booby” Gibson tweeted a photo from the set over the weekend, writing, “A wrap!”
In addition to music, the 30-year-old singer has been filming a new reality show for BET called “Keyshia Cole: Family First,” co-starring her husband and two-year-old son DJ.
She will perform at the ESSENCE Music Festval in New Orleans on July 6.
