I want it all, but I know I don’t need it.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
That’s right; private flight. Money gets stacked to the highest height.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
My fruits of labor; I want ‘em ripe.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
But you think that you’re on your way. Life lined up on the mirror don’t blow it.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
Nigga fuck your plan fuck your man. You ain’t a pimp, unless you get the same bitch to f-ck your man, and f-ck your plan. And all my bitches know that’s my plan.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
Used to think my shit didn’t stank, boy was I wrong.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
Just a snare in the 808; Weezy on the mic; DOA.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
Rims big; make the car look like it’s two stories. If I hop out, that’ll be suicide. No back seats, call it paralyzed.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
I’m peepin’ at you people different.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
I’m f-cked up; tore down. I’m twisted: door knob. Talk stupid? Off with your head.
Lil Wayne (lyrics)
