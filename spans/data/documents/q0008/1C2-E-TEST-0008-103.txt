Lil Wayne – How To Love Lyrics
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love
When you was just a young’un your looks was so precious
But now your grown up
So fly its like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listening
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin’
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else trippin
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
