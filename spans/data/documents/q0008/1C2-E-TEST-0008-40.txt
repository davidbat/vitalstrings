One hundred hit songs in 13 years??
That's insane!!
It takes some musicians longer to count that high!!
We're AMAZED Lil' Wayne recorded so many hits so quickly!!
Are you curious which track pushed the New Orleans born rapper over the hump?
French Montana’s Pop That, featuring Weezy, Rick Ross, and Drake — it just debuted at 57 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart!
Only two other artists have recorded as many chart-smashing tracks in the same category — James Brown (111) and Jay-Z (108).
It took Jay “I own a plane ” Z a year longer to hit triple-digits, but he was the lead artist on a much higher percentage of those songs!
Will Weezy eventually li-li-li-lick their records like a lollipop ???
