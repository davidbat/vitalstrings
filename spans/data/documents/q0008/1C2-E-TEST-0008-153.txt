Lil Wayne recently got his Trukfit clothing brand hooked up with a new distribution deal via Macy’s department stores.
It was recently revealed that Lil Wayne’s new Trukfit clothing line will land in select Macy’s across the country, in addition to Macy’s.com which should be a very big step for the brand.
