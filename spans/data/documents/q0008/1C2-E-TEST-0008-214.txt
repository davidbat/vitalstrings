If Free Dem Films comes to you about a Lil Wayne Tour. You can trust them...they are always straight up. Ask Mac Maine(Pres.)....However they would never come to you about tour transportation because they have there own tour bus!!!! I too was on the Young Money tour with Free Dem Films. Free Dem Films pay there bills. Some Idiot broker named Mike had a contract with some gay dude named Chris. The broker named Mike hired a bus company on Chris's behalf. We learned that Chris never had any intentions of paying the bus driver or the rip off broker. Feeling sorry for the bus driver named Dave; that we did not know was a phein, the film company gave him money when Chris decided he wasn't. It wasn't Free Dem Films who was liable or responsible for the balance. They were guess. If it were Free Dem Films on the contract, you would sue them, and stop crying you got ripped off. Besides, the monies Dave did get, he started doing meth and coke. Nobody is riding around with a druged up bus driver. Sorry, but no thanks!!!! Atl is like home. That's where we got off...Make sure yall go get that Young Money documentary. "Broken Leg" coming soon. The trailer is on YouTube...Free Dem Films...It's Bananas!!!! Next Movie!!!
