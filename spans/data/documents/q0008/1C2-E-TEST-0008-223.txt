Lil Wayne’s tattoos have always been a topic of great debate among his many fans, he has so many of them that it would be very difficult to describe them all in the space here. Since this is the case I am going to focus on the most obvious ones, the ones which are found on his face and mouth. One of his most controversial tattoos are the teardrops underneath his eyes. Now, in prison, teardrops usually mean that you have murdered someone. But, I think there is a different reason for this Lil Wayne tattoo. I think they represent three of his close friends who have died. Since he has two tear drops below one of his eyes and one tear below the other eye they probably relate to two separate instances when his loved ones died. Other Lil Wayne tattoos on his face include designs which are placed on his eye lids which together read "Fear God". He also has a letter "C" tattooed right in between his eyebrows, some people say that it stands for Carter which is his last name, right above that "C" there is a cross that indicates that he believes in God.
 
 
Lil Wayne Tattoos
Okay, there are a ton of Lil Wayne tattoos. So many, in fact that I’m not even really sure where to start. When talking about Lil Wayne tattoos should I start with his chest, face, arms, legs or back. I guess since the picture is of the tattoos that is on his back then I will start there. The ink that is on his back is actually a prayer. Want to know what it says? Then let’s go over it. The prayer reads; "Give me the patience that I need to keep my piece of mind, And with life’s cares, I hope, Dear God, some happiness to find. Give me the courage to face life’s trials and not from troubles run. Let me keep this thought in mind. "Thy Will," not "Mine," be done. Next to the prayer tattoo he has a large Chinese symbol tattoo. I don’t exactly know what it means but it looks really cool. I think that this symbol has since been covered up by a large skull but don’t quote me on that. But, these are only a small sampling of all the ink that he has. Lil Wayne tattoo collection is so large and extensive I could probably make a career about talking about it!
