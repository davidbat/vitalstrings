Kobe Bryant
(Intro)
He’s the best player in the game,it’s just that simple,theirs nothing that Kobe can’t do,he will defend your best player,he will shoot from the perimeter,he will get all in your mug,he will do whatever it takes,he is the most complete basketball player in the game today,ball or not,he has an assassin mentality,I said this weeks,I said this when the trade went down,and I’ll repeat it again,who starvin more, for an NBA World Championship,more than Kobe Bryant,there is no one,this guy is HOLLYWOOD,”What separates Kobe from the pack.”,More than Kobe Bryant,there is no one.
Ok,Kobe doin work,two four on my shirt,he da greatest on da court,im da greatest on da verse,goin for the 4th ring like it was his first,gotta get da bling,do it for Kareem,two four so nice,my flow so mean,catch me at da game sitting next to ?.Ko Ko Kobe Bryant Nikes,purple gold strings,Ko Ko Kobe in da game dunkin on “The Whole Team”,Ba Black Mamba,attack conquer,basketball beast,ra rap monster,crossover good,or turn around jumper,or just drive da lane,and dunk on dunkers,u kno where is goin,its goin down yo,this da Lake Show,but dont drown tho,I call him King Bryant,now let da crown show.

pass me da dam ball I dont need a pick at all,and dont worry bout my shot,cause imma get that off,yeaa,I drops 40 on ur double team,then I drop 81 on another team,yeaa..u better guard me wit caution,n watch how I’ll work em like an auction,Ha ha,no such thing as exhaustion no time for resting cause I dont take breaks,I I just break records,Ha,and I prefer da ball with 3 seconds,and I bet we gon win it all in 3 seconds,Ya digg,That is a guarantee apparently and please tell ur defense dont ever man to man with me,double team triple team,ur defenders sick of me,but,I never let them get to me,literally,step back and give dem a three ain ain’t no defending me.
(Lebron Skit)
Uh,never take a day off catch u at the top of the key and get a J off,baseline facetime tongue out like two three,even two three gotta love how I do me,pra practice while u sleep,practice in my sleep,stright out ,out of the High School,the brackets ain’t for me I will be jumping over u like I got a mattress at my feet n all Phil Jackson say is u better be passing it to me,I put the master in the peace,attack it like the beats,and I am starving for victory and dat means imma eat,and when dey ask u whos da best then the answer should be me,Ha Ha.
(Skit)
Call me Mr.Clutch or Mr.Automatic,I can post em up or Lamar will get da alley,Im goin for the ring,Im goin for the ring,I went to Beijing and came back with da bling,who dey want,dey want Kobe,and what he want,he want the trophy,the victory,and da glory,no Shaq,no Robert Horry,now break em off,Kobe break em off,Yea!,U better be  where every Laker dont,                          Yea,just give him the ball and he’ll take it all,Yup,or he’ll probably be dishing it to Gasol,Yea,or give it to D Fish on the wing,Yea,or just let Ariza do his thing,Yea,cause im great and so is my team,Yea,do it for Magic,its showtime baby,I see nothing wrong with doing it four times baby,Im da best,Yes,He da best,Yeaa,dont worry Lebron,get em next year,now wuts defense to an assassin,killa instinct,MURDER THE BASKET,then steal da ball back,hold it for ransom,its more then a game,this is a passion,been an All-Star,been a Champion,free throw line,u hear em chantin,MVP!,MVP!,Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me,any D smash and D,whoever he is,he cant guard me,Ha Ha,he cant guard me.”So,there you have it,the over whelming answer was,KOBE BRYANT!
