The best of Lil' Wayne
500 Degreez lyrics:
It's the real shit, yeah
500 Degreez this time biotch
Yes sir, you already know
[Lil Wayne verse 1]
You see me? I eat, sleep, shit, and talk snaps; so fuck rap
Man I got weed, pills, pistols, all crack
Bitch niggas where ya hearts at?
Ya'll ain't stuntin' like us
Bitch niggas where ya cars at?
They like, 'Wayne why the fuck you dressed in all black?'
I'm about to bring CMR back
And all the lames, we done lost that
And all we got is Weezy, Weezy, and Lil' Weezy to fall back
I'm about to lock it from the summer to the fall and back
'Its Weezy baby!' The ballers back
And the wheels on my car you got all of that
Stop playing, I've been balling jack
You don't want my glock spraying â€“ I hit all them cats
