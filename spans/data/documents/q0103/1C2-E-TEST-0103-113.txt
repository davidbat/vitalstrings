The silver car above        somehow landed on the side edge of a twisted highway section.  The        young woman driver walked away unharmed.
 
 
 This is a long        view from the historical Stone Arch Bridge that angles southwest away from        the 35 W Bridge. The center  portion of the bridge that fell into the        Mississippi is visible with its white stripes facing the camera.
 
This section of        twisted girders is just to the left of the above photo.
