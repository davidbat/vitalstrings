URS Pays $52 Million Over Minnesota Bridge Collapse
Engineering and construction company URS has agreed to pay more than $52 million to settle claims over the Minnesota bridge that collapsed in August 2007, which killed 13 people and injured 145.
According to environmentalgraffiti.com, which tracks disasters such as bridge collapses, the 40-year-old bridge was one of the worst bridge failures in three decades. The state of Minnesota hired URS to assess the safety of its bridges, but in a statement by the company, URS officials were unaware of a design flaw in the structure that left it vulnerable to collapse.
In 2008 National Transportation Safety Board officials found that the the bridge's steel plates weren't hardy enough to handle traffic flow on the structure.
On its website, URS Corp says it is a leading provider of engineering, construction and technical services for public agencies and private sector companies around the world.
