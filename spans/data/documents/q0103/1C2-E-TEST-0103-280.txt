Mississippi expected to crest at Aitkin Thursday
An engineering company linked to the 2007 interstate bridge collapse in Minneapolis continues to work for the city, receiving more than two dozen contracts in the last five years.
Despite Gov. Mark Daytonâ€™s hesitation in doing business with URS Corp., the city has awarded the California company contracts totaling more than $9 million. Most recently, the Minneapolis City Council authorized staff to negotiate a $1 million contract with URS to study transit options.
URS was a consultant studying the state-owned I-35W bridge when it collapsed and killed 13 people. URS agreed to pay $52 million to settle a lawsuit filed by victims who claimed the firm failed to spot structural problems. URS did not admit any fault.
The Star Tribune ( http://bit.ly/NgBqUl ) says URS is also bidding to design the new Stillwater Bridge over the St. Croix (kroy) River.
