Minnesota bridge collapse a reminder of Ohio River tragedy
Associated Press (2007-08-03)
ATHENS, OH (WOUB) - The bridge that collapsed in Minnesota this week was built in 1967, the same year the Silver Bridge collapsed between Kanauga, Ohio, and Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
46 people died when dozens of cars and trucks went into the Ohio River.
Witnesses to that tragedy say the images from Minneapolis are stirring up painful memories.
Shelly Horvath of Athens County says she was 17 and waiting in traffic about a block from the Silver Bridge when it fell. She says what she's seeing from Minnesota is so similar to what she remembers that it's chilling.
