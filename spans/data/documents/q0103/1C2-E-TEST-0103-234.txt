Friends and family invite you to join them on a Mora lake this weekend in memory of a man killed in the 35W Bridge Collapse. The 4th Annual Jolly Jiggin Jamboree ice fishing tournament is this Saturday, Feb. 26 on Knife Lake.
The event was created in honor of Greg Jolstad, also known as Jolly, who was killed in the tragic bridge collapse. Organizer and friend Jim Hallin says they choose to carry on Jolly's memory by gathering and fishing because of his passion for the winter sport.
The fishing event has taken off. It has drawn in nearly 400 people in past years and organizers are proud of the success.
Join in honoring Jolly's memory from 1-4 p.m. The cost is $5 to enter the contest. Four cash prizes ranging from $25- $200 will be given to the biggest fish by weight. Raffle tickets will also be sold for $10. Enter to win prizes including a StrikeMaster ice auger, a Mathews bow, and a 12 gauge shot gun.
All proceeds from the contest go towards a scholarship for a graduating Mora High School student and to other local organizations.
