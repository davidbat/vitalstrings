That was a rather generous           'clue'... for those multicontextually aware.
But why the emphasis on Sao           Paulo? What's so special about it?
Well, for           one, it has to do with the papal issue. It also has to do with the space           shuttle  Discovery STS-121 which           landed on July 17, '06, or exactly a year before the plane crash in Sao           Paulo. On top of that, STS-121 was, unbeknownst to most, 'Mission           Brazil' (and several other things) as discussed on STRUG last year.
Discovery STS-121:
Launch: July 04, 2006
Landing: July 17, 2006
Even on Etemenanki I allude to it           in ' Octagonal           Gate: Lost Secret ' (11/20/06) when I wrote:
There is more to             these things... Just the tip of the iceberg.
Brazil,             Nazis/ODESSA, Pope, Israel, Iran, Trojan/World War, etc. etc...
Or this in ' Gateway           to War ' (10/19/06):
Next pope may be Cláudio             Hummes of Brazil. [Note: Hummes was archbishop             of Sao Paulo]
The pope theme is heavily woven into all           this, and it was a confirmation of an already established           pattern when Pope           Benedict XVI visited Sao Paulo in May this year right after           Queen Elizabeth II did her 'Beltane cross-quarter' US tour. (The whole Solar/Grail/Phoenix           Resurrection theme kind of grew out of the British Royal Family           theme.)
Is it just coincidence that 'pontiff', which is           another name for the pope, literally means           'bridge-builder'?
Note how that is the exact opposite of what happened in           the North Star State. The opposite of the North Star would be the 'South Star'...           which believe it or not precisely echoes the symbolism of the Discovery           STS-116 mission patch (December '06) which has been a big part of the           Solar/Grail/Phoenix Resurrection communication (see previous           articles).
[The           'Grail baby' is coming out of the 'egg'...]
The starburst on the ISS           solar panel represents the North Star. You can           infer that from its relative position to the Big Dipper (Ursa Major           constellation) depicted next to the American flag. NASA has officially acknowledged this so there is no reason to doubt this. It is, however, reflected on           the solar panel, implying some kind of reversal - like, for           instance, the North Star           becoming the South Star!
South Star? What could be the message           there? Indeed, what is the South Star? Turns out, we don't really           have one, or not a bright one anyway. What we do have is the Southern Cross ('Crux')           constellation nearby which conveniently           points to the celestial south pole with its brightest star 'Acrux'.           This is why Acrux is a de           facto 'South Star' .
Then comes a big 'a ha!' moment: Brazil is a 'Southern Cross nation', and Sao Paulo an           'Acrux city'! And this is factual. Brazil was originally called 'True Cross' (Vera           Cruz); the Southern Cross is prominently featured on the Brazilian           coat of arms ; and each of the stars on the Brazilian flag,           including the Southern Cross, officially           represents a Brazilian state... Acrux, the 'South           Star', represents Sao Paulo! ('Sao Paulo' is a state as well           as a city.)
The multicontextual coherence           has now reached a threshold. This is a bona-fide 'signal'. The STS-116 starburst is not only           Acrux but also Sao Paulo. Still unsure? Then try this...
Discovery STS-116 returned to           earth on the winter           solstice (December 22, '06), which is traditionally when the Sun 'dies'           and is 'reborn'. It's the Sun's southernmost/lowest           point in the sky and where the Sun reverses its movement from           southward to northward, increasing daylight for the Northern           Hemisphere           (thus signifying solar 'death' and 'resurrection'). On earth, the winter           solstice corresponds to the ' Tropic           of Capricorn ' (= ~23.5° South): If you draw a line from the           center of the earth to the winter-solstice Sun, the line exits the earth's           surface at the 'Tropic of Capricorn' (or 'Tropic of Cancer' for the summer solstice).           So we can say that by highlighting the winter solstice, STS-116 was also           highlighting the Tropic of Capricorn. Guess which city is on the           Tropic of Capricorn? I mean, precisely? Yes, that's right... Sao           Paulo!
Discovery STS-121 launched               with  'South               Star' symbolism
Discovery STS-121 returned on the winter solstice (= Tropic of Capricorn)
Sao Paulo equals Acrux on the               Brazilian flag; Acrux is a de-facto South Star
Sao Paulo is situated right               on the Tropic of Capricorn (= winter solstice)
Bridge collapses near St. Paul (=> 'Sao Paulo') in               'North Star State'; same day Russia begins to claim North Pole,               Sao Paulo's plane crash is back in news; five days earlier               helicopters collided in Phoenix; eight days later NASA's Phoenix               is launched towards Martian North Pole; Sao Paulo's plane crash               (7/17) marks anniversary of Discovery STS-121 landing which was               'Brazilian mission'; Discovery's next mission (STS-116) with its North/South Star             insignia lands on winter solstice; winter solstice corresponds to             Tropic of Capricorn where Sao Paulo ('St. Paul') is located...
 
That's basically the unified           multicontextual picture of this particular period.
Now take another look at the           August 1st headlines. The clues were right           there in front of you...
Still a 'riddle' to be sure, but           not too convoluted. All it takes is a little multicontextual           perspective.
The message is 'Pole Shift'. The           phoenix is about Solar Resurrection which has to do with the 11-year           solar/sunspot cycle of which 2007 is the 'minimum' period signifying           'death' (of the phoenix). The Sun is then 'resurrected', coming fully           back to life around the Mayan 'end of time', 2012, when the Sun's           magnetic field will do a pole shift as the Sun is known to do           at the peak of a solar cycle.
