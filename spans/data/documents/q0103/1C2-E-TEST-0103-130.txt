RCB, the article cites pretty clearly that Dear Leader said this just yesterday, silly.

The story is not about the bridge…it’s about our President using misinformation to further his flawed agenda.

rube, please highlight for us just where President Obama said the Minneapolis bridge collapsed because of
“Infrastructure Spending Cuts” or “for want of maintenance”.

Of course he didn’t say that Bob. He couldn’t say that directly because he knew that too many people would point out the lie. But he certainly inferred that.
Otherwise, why would he mention it?

Mr. Johnson, thank you for pointing out the lie in our host’s posit.
Why you ask?
Our stuff is falling apart. To deny that is foolish.
President Obama wants to keep the bridges to our shining hill city open, safe and keep commerce flowing.
Do you have a problem with that?

He’s going to keep bridges going to keeping Planned Parenthood, cowboy poetry, and PBS funded?  Huh?
Even for you, RCB, this is pretty incoherent.

Sorry Bob but I wasn’t pointing out any lie. Apparently, you read what you want to see and nothing more. Mr. Obama did not say SPECIFICALLY that the Minneapolis bridge collapsed because of poor maintenance etc, but he sure implied that. It’s called politician-speak and is very useful if you are trying to instill fear in your audience. If he didn’t intend to imply that, why else would he even have mentioned it in the first place?
Besides, I thought that the much vaunted Stimulus was supposed to be used to build up the infrastructure and provide jobs.
Where are those jobs, Bob?
We’re waiting.

“…politician-speak and is very useful if you are trying to instill fear in your audience. ”
Say, didja hear the one about a Socialist Marxist Kenyan take over with death panels galore?
If gop is cutting and rejecting stimulus money, aren’t they the ones blocking job creation.

Obama wants more money for roads and bridges;  wasn’t vp joey suppose to track that road money

Well, I guess it was the party where he referenced the Minneapolis bridge, then said our infrastructure was deteriorating and then suggested we needed to spend more on it.
But silly me for thinking words mean what they mean.

Thank God for Hoeven & Berg for being big spenders.  In Minnewaukan we are going to get a dike to use until we can move the town.  On top of that they are paying for the infrastructure of the new town which will house approximately 25 homes at a cost of $10 million.  Then there will be the buy-out for those that don’t want to move which will be about 5 million.  Previous infrastruture cost of about $5 million a few year ago.  All that for a town of 200 people.  They are great.  Oops.  Forgot about the $6 million for a new school.

Obama just doing what Obama does: scaremongering so he can spend another shit-pot full of money. It’s a broken record.

Too bad that bridge collapsed  a few years early before a certain motorcade could of been in the middle. Now that would have been poetic justice.

Would there even be a lack of funding for infrastructure if we weren’t wasting our money else where?

Government should not own any property. Let private businesses and people create roads and bridges. Unless you think the government is more efficient and uses capital more wisely.

So the interstate highway system would have been built by private business, all toll roads and these private businesses would control all interstate commerce, is that the idea? Actually, the people own federal property don’t they?

Who knows what would have been built if people were able to keep all their wealth. Was the interstate the most efficient way to build roads? Was it the most cost effective? Maybe some other form of travel besides using cars would have been the most economical. Heavy subsidizing of roads encourages people to drive cars. Think of the wealth you would have without taxes.

Wealth is not the ultimate goal of my life, God and family are much higher on my list of priorities.

You could give more money to your church and your family without taxes.

Ah they cry of the truly self centered, selfish and money grubbing. It isn’t church or family you care about, just the love of money.

I am against theft and that is what taxes are.
