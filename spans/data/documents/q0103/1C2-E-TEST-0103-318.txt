Flags will be flown at half-staff Monday, on the fourth anniversary of the I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis.
The freeway bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed at 6:05 p.m. Aug. 1, 2007. Thirteen people died and 145 were injured.
Under the order from Gov. Mark Dayton, all U.S. flags and Minnesota flags will be flown at half-staff at the State Capitol Complex from sunrise until sunset on Monday.
A proclamation from Dayton says the day should be set aside to honor and remember the victims, to offer continued sympathy and support to affected families and communities; and to thank and recognize the police officers, fire and rescue personnel, and other first responders.
