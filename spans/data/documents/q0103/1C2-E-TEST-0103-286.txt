WASHINGTON, Friday, August 03, 2007  Due to the extraordinary generosity of the public, the American Red Cross believes that current financial donations and pledges will be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of its response to the Minnesota bridge collapse on August 1, 2007. Donors rushed to meet the needs of those who were involved in this tragic accident and their families, and because of their quick action the Red Cross was able to provide a safe place to rest, hot meals, basic first aid and mental health counseling to the survivors of this collapse.
As a good steward of donated dollars, the Red Cross has a standard practice of informing the public when sufficient funds have been raised to cover the costs associated with a disaster response. The financial donations and pledges received to date will cover the estimated cost for the Red Cross response. Accordingly, the Red Cross will no longer initiate fundraising activities for this disaster response. Many donations remain in “pledge” form and, while not yet received by the Red Cross, have been incorporated into funds available for the relief effort. It is important for supporters to fulfill their pledged gifts.
The Red Cross is providing mental health assistance to victims and their families. Since the beginning of the event, hundreds of people, including first responders and families of the missing have taken advantage of the emotional support offered by Red Cross workers. The organization is also providing support to the first responders, to help them physically and emotionally, including the police, fire and emergency crews who have been working around the clock. In the coming days and weeks, Red Cross workers will continue to offer support to this community through their grieving and healing process.
For those who wish to support the on-going relief efforts of this bridge collapse, the Red Cross encourages giving to the other charities and non-profit organizations that continue to raise funds. The Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is another way for people to help the victims of thousands of disasters across the country each year.  The public's continued support is also essential to the more than 750 Red Cross chapters that provide lifesaving support in local communities every day. The Red Cross is committed to keeping donors and the public informed of how donations are being used to provide ongoing relief. The most recent information can be found on www.redcross.org.
