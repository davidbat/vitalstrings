Why did the I-35 W bridge in Minneapolis collapse?
In: Science , Mississippi [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
the i-35W bridge collapsed because there was to much structural stress on the bridge at the time, when the bridge collapsed it was rush hour time so there was to much weight on the bridge.
^^^NO! the bridge collapsed because the design was flawed. the gusset plate that failed was too thin for the loading. this was the engineers error, hence the lawsuit.
