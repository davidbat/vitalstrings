Stainles steels develop a similar natural layer (passiviation). Iron (& steel) do not benefit from this behavior. Iron oxide (rust) does not bond to its substrate, nor does it provide an impermeable barrier - it just keeps corroding. Kind of like the Energizer bunny - it just keeps going & going...
To offset this normal behavior of steel, many structures incorporate sacrifical plates that take advantage of galvanic corrosion. i.e. - A material that is more anodic will be used. For steel structures, zinc is the most common anode. As long as the entire structure is electrically conductive and properly bonded, galvanic corrosion can be used to the benefit of the underlying structure. If the wrong anodes are used (or cathodes in their place) then the primary structure corrodes rather than the sacrifical plates.
In the case of the MSP bridge, if copper was used instead of zinc, then the more cathodic steel will corrode.
