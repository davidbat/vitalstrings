San Francisco based URS Corp. has agreed to pay out $52.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 100 survivors of the I-35W bridge collapse.
13 people were killed and about 150 injured when the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River during the rush hour on August 1, 2007.
URS is an engineeringÂ  firm who consulted on the bridge, and were accused of missing warning signs in the bridge before the collapse. URS settled the lawsuit before the trial was set to start next spring, saying they wished to avoid protracted litigation, and admitted no fault in the bridge collapse.
Most of the settlement will go to the survivors, except for $1.5 million set aside for a memorial to those who died.
This is the last claim from survivors or relatives of victims. URS, and the State of Minnesota still have pending claims against Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., who purchased the firm that designed the flawed I-35W bridge.
