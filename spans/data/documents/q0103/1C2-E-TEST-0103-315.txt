In-depth: Deadly bridge collapse
"This particular section or freeway was under repair," Minneapolis fire Chief Jim Clack said. "We don't know yet what caused the collapse. We do not believe at this point there was any terrorism or nefarious activity -- it was just a structural collapse."
A federal investigative team has been dispatched to the scene.
A school bus filled with more than 50 children who were returning from a summer field trip was among the vehicles on the bridge when it collapsed.
Kristy Jenkins credits staff member Jeremy Hernandez with saving her 12-year-old daughter, Nina Jenkins.
Hernandez "busted open the backdoor of the bus" and "told everyone to get out from the back of the door," the girl said. "We jumped on the highway and then jumped on the sidewalk."
"If it would have been a second later, any second before we would have been in the water or under the pavement," he said.
Tony Wagner, the president of a local nonprofit social services group that organized the trip, said eight of the kids, ages 5 to 14, were hospitalized.

Mark Lacroix, who lives on the 20th floor of an apartment building near the bridge, told CNN he saw the last seconds of the collapse.
"I heard this massive rumbling and shaking ... and looked out my window," Lacroix said. "It just fell right into the river."
According to the Minneapolis Riverfront District Web site, the steel arch bridge was opened in 1967. Its longest span stretches 458 feet over the river, and it was constructed with no mid-river piers to facilitate river traffic.
The bridge was undergoing nonstructural re-decking work, U.S. Transportation Department spokesman Brian Turmail said.
There were eight construction workers on the bridge at the time of the collapse, and one of them is unaccounted for, said Mike McGray, president of Progressive Contractors, the company doing the repair work on the bridge.
A 2001 study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation found "several fatigue problems" in the bridge's approach spans and "poor fatigue details" on the main truss.
The study suggested that the design of bridge's main truss could cause a collapse if one of two support planes were to become cracked, although it allowed that a collapse might not occur in that event. But, the study concluded, "fatigue cracking of the deck truss is not likely" and "replacement of the bridge ... may be deferred."
Two years ago, the U.S. Department of Transportation 's National Bridge Inventory database said the bridge was "structurally deficient."
The Minneapolis Star Tribune quoted Jeanne Aamodt, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, as saying the department was aware of the 2005 assessment of the bridge.
The bridge received a rating of 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. A bridge receives a rating of 4 when there is "advanced section loss, deterioration."
About 100,000 cars a day travel over the bridge, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Divers                                                    searched the Mississippi River                                                    on Thursday for more bodies                                                    entombed in cars trapped                                                    beneath the twisted steel and                                                    concrete slabs of a collapsed                                                    bridge. As many as 30 people                                                    were missing as the effort                                                    shifted from rescue to                                                    recovery.
The official death count                                                    stood at four Thursday                                                    morning, but Police Chief Tim                                                    Dolan said more victims were                                                    still in the water. Hospital                                                    officials counted 79 others                                                    injured.
"We have a number of                                                    vehicles that are underneath                                                    big pieces of concrete, and we do know we have some people in                                                    those vehicles," Dolan said. "We know we do have more                                                    casualties at the scene."
The eight-lane                                                    Interstate 35W bridge, a major                                                    Minneapolis artery, was in the                                                    midst of repairs when the                                                    bridge buckled during the                                                    evening rush hour Wednesday.                                                    Dozens of cars plummeted more                                                    than 60 feet into the                                                    Mississippi River, some                                                    falling on top one of another.                                                    A school bus sat on the angled                                                    concrete.
Under water, divers were                                                    taking down license plate                                                    numbers for authorities to                                                    track down the vehicles'                                                    owners. Getting the vehicles                                                    out was expected to take                                                    several days and involve                                                    moving around very large,                                                    heavy pieces of bridge.
"The bridge is still                                                    shifting," Dolan said. "We're                                                    dealing with the Mississippi                                                    River. We're dealing with                                                    currents. We're going to have                                                    to do it slowly and safely."
He said police estimate                                                    that 20 to 30 people were                                                    unaccounted for, though he                                                    stressed that it was just an                                                    estimate.
At Hennepin County                                                    Medical Center, patients had                                                    arrived in a steady stream                                                    after the collapse, some                                                    unconscious or moaning, some                                                    barely breathing, others with                                                    serious head and back                                                    injuries, Dr. William Heegaard                                                    said.
"There was blood                                                    everywhere," he said.
Relatives who couldn't                                                    find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel                                                    ballroom Thursday morning for                                                    any news, hoping for the best.
"I've never wanted to                                                    see my brother so much in my                                                    life," said Kristi Foster, who                                                    went to an information center                                                    set up at a Holiday Inn                                                    looking for her brother Kirk.                                                    She hadn't had contact with                                                    her brother or his girlfriend,                                                    Krystle Webb, since the                                                    previous night.
Authorities initially                                                    said at least seven people had                                                    died, but Police Lt. Amelia                                                    Huffman lowered that number                                                    Thursday morning, saying, "The                                                    medical examiner's office only                                                    has four sets of remains." She                                                    said the initial reports were                                                    based on the best estimates                                                    authorities had Wednesday                                                    night.
As many as 50 vehicles tumbled into the river when                                                    the bridge collapsed, leaving                                                    those who could escape to                                                    scramble to shore. Some                                                    carried the injured up the                                                    riverbank, while emergency                                                    workers tended to others on                                                    the ground and some jumped                                                    into the water to look for                                                    survivors. Fire and black                                                    smoke rose from the wreckage.
The Homeland Security                                                    Department said the collapse                                                    did not appear to be                                                    terrorism-related, but                                                    Hennepin County Sheriff                                                    Richard Stanek said Thursday                                                    that the cause was still                                                    unknown.
"All indications are                                                    that it was a collapse, not an                                                    act of someone doing it," Stanek said.
He said at least a dozen                                                    submerged vehicles were visible in the water. A train                                                    had been passing beneath the                                                    roadway at the time and it                                                    also fell, including a car                                                    carrying a chemical,                                                    polystyrene beads, that the                                                    fire chief said was not                                                    particularly hazardous.
Thursday morning,                                                    Transportation Secretary Mary                                                    Peters announced a $5 million                                                    grant to help pay for                                                    rerouting traffic patterns                                                    around the disaster site.
"We fully understand                                                    what happened and we will take                                                    every step possible to ensure                                                    something like this will not                                                    happen again," Peters said.                                                    The White House said first lady Laura Bush would travel to                                                    the city on Friday to console                                                    the victims' families.
Sen.

"A bridge in America                                                    just shouldn't fall down," Klobuchar said. "That's why we                                                    have called for this                                                    investigation."

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Rescuers pulled more bodies from the swirling brown waters of the Mississippi River on Thursday in what authorities said would be a slow and dangerous recovery operation after the worst U.S. bridge collapse in more than 20 years.
Two boats circled slowly near the tangle of steel girders and concrete while divers searched for more victims killed when the 40-year-old bridge in the Midwestern U.S. city of Minneapolis buckled during Wednesday evening rush hour.
Four people were confirmed dead and authorities said the toll was certain to rise.
There was no immediate explanation for why the 500-foot (150-metre) span collapsed.
"A bridge in America just shouldn't fall down," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of Minnesota.
More than 50 vehicles tumbled 65 feet into the river and onto debris from Interstate 35W as the bridge collapsed into a plume of dust, smoke and screams.
At least 60 people were hurt, with broken bones, head, neck and spinal injuries.
Federal authorities quickly ruled out terrorism as a cause, but state and federal safety officials said the bridge's inspection record did not indicate it was unsafe.
Specifically, the collapse raised questions about work being done to the bridge's deck, lighting and guardrails at the time of the collapse.Â 
Â 
"What caused this unbelievable, almost incomprehensible tragedy?" added Republican Sen. Norm Coleman. "We need to understand that to make sure that this type of tragedy never happens ever again."
Dolan said several more bodies were recovered on Thursday but he did not provide a new death toll.
"People were pinned. People were partly crushed, talking to rescue workers ... telling them to tell their families goodbye" before they died, Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan said.
"It is still a tremendously dangerous scene," he said.
WAITING AND WONDERING
People watched the recovery operation from grassy banks and the steps of a riverfront theater.
"It was chaotic," said tow truck driver Mike Euhl, who helped rescuers find their way down into the river as victims scrambled to escape half-submerged vehicles.
"These are horrible images but within each of those images is a story," Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak said. "That car you see tangled in the wreckage is someone's cousin, brother or husband. ... Thank God this wasn't worse."
City officials said the search effort and subsequent clean-up would take several days.
National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators planned to rebuild the bridge piece by piece off-site to try to reconstruct what happened.
The bridge had passed inspections the past two years, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said, though it was among thousands of bridges across the country deemed to be "structurally deficient" in a 2005 U.S. government report.
"(The rating) was by no means an indication that the bridge was not safe," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said at the scene. "None of those ratings indicated there was some kind of danger here."
She said it was the first time a bridge collapsed without an outside trigger, such as an earthquake or collision, since 1983, when three people were killed in Connecticut after a bridge collapse on Interstate-95, the major U.S. East Coast highway.
The administration pledged $5 million for initial clean-up efforts.
"We in the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible," President George W. Bush said in a statement.
More than a dozen construction workers were beginning their shift at the time of the collapse. One worker from Progressive Contractors Inc. was among the missing and was feared dead, said the Minnesota company's owner, Michael McGray.
"But we don't give up hope," McGray said.

Divers Look for Bridge Collapse Victims
Aug 2, 6:05 PM (ET)

Â 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Divers searched the Mississippi River for bodies still trapped beneath the twisted debris of a collapsed bridge Thursday, as finger-pointing began over a report two years ago that found the bridge was "structurally deficient."
The official death count from Wednesday evening's collapse stood at four, but Police Chief Tim Dolan said more bodies were in the water. Hospitals officials said 79 others were injured.
A strong current and low visibility hampered the search, and divers were pulled out of the water briefly Thursday afternoon so the water could be lowered, said Inspector Jeff Storms of the sheriff's department.
Twelve vehicles had been located in the river, officials said.
"We have a number of vehicles that are underneath big pieces of concrete, and we do know we have some people in those vehicles," Dolan said. "We know we do have more casualties at the scene."
The eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery, was in the midst of repairs when it buckled during the evening rush hour. Dozens of cars plummeted more than 60 feet into the Mississippi River, some falling on top one of another. A school bus sat on the angled concrete.
The bridge is the state's busiest, and carries approximately 141,000 vehicles per day.
The White House said an inspection of the 40-year-old bridge in 2005 found problems. The Interstate 35W span rated 50 on a scale of 100 for structural stability and was classified as "structurally deficient," transportation officials said.
The designation means some portions of the bridge needed to be scheduled for repair or replacement, and it was on a schedule for inspection every two years. "It didn't mean that the bridge is unsafe," Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said.
Earlier, at the White House, press secretary Tony Snow said while the inspection didn't indicate the bridge was at risk of failing, "If an inspection report identifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective actions."
Gov. Tim Pawlenty on Thursday ordered an immediate inspection of all bridges in the state with similar designs, but said the state was never warned that the bridge needed to be closed or immediately repaired. Another inspection was scheduled for completion in September.
"There was no call by anyone that we're aware of that said it should be immediately closed or immediately replaced," Pawlenty said. "It was more of a monitor, inspect, maintain, and potentially replace it in the future.
Around the country, a handful of states, including Arizona, Michigan, New Jersey and New Mexico, ordered inspections of their own bridges
In the river, divers took down license plate numbers for authorities to track down the vehicles' owners. Getting the vehicles out was expected to take several days and involve moving around very large, heavy pieces of bridge.
As many as 30 people were reported missing, and the rescue effort had shifted to recovery.
Relatives who couldn't find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel ballroom Thursday for any news, hoping for the best.
Ronald Engebretsen, 57, was searching for his wife, Sherry. His daughter last heard from her when she left work in downtown Minneapolis Wednesday. Her cell phone has picked up with voice mail ever since.
"We are left with the hope that there is a Jane Doe in a hospital somewhere that's her," Engebretsen said.
As many as 50 vehicles tumbled into the river when the bridge collapsed, leaving those who could escape to scramble to shore. Some survivors carried the injured up the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground and some jumped into the water to look for survivors. Fire and black smoke rose from the wreckage.
"People who were pinned or partly crushed told emergency workers to say 'hello' or say 'goodbye' to their loved ones," Dolan said.
Aron Dahlgren, 23, a University of Minnesota graduate student, was driving to his girlfriend's home when the bridge began to fall. He noticed overhead road signs in front of him start to sink - and then his car plummeted.
"That's the longest two or three seconds of your life," Dahlgren said. "That was the scariest place. I kept on thinking - I kept on questioning, was this how I was going to die. If I'd have left 30 seconds earlier, I'd have been over the water."
Jay Reeves was one of the first people on the scene after the collapse. He tried calling 911, but all the lines were jammed. Then, he heard the sounds of children's screams from the school bus.
"I opened my car door and was greeted by the screams of lots of kids. Screaming kids are good. That means they're alive and full of a lot energy," said Reeves, 39, a trained paramedic and the public safety coordinator for the Minnesota American Red Cross.
The children were sent back to his office, where he spoke to them and tried to calm them down while their parents were located. One frantic boy told him that his shoulder hurt, he said.
"I took his head in my hands and said 'you need to calm down. Take a deep breath and hold it,'" Reeves said.
The Homeland Security Department said the collapse did not appear to be terrorism-related, but the cause was still unknown. Federal officials announced Thursday that $5 million would be rapidly released to help with efforts such as re-routing traffic around the disaster site.
The first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the bridge and reassemble them, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine what happened, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said.
Investigators also want to review video of the collapse, and were setting up a phone number for witnesses to call with information. A team of 19 people was coming to the scene to help with the investigation, he said.
"It is clearly much too early in the initial stages of this investigation to have any idea what happened," Rosenker said.
This week, road crews had been working on the bridge's joints, guardrails and lights, with lane closures overnight on Tuesday and Wednesday. In 2001, the bridge had been fitted with a computerized anti-icing system that sprayed chemicals on the surface during winter weather, according to documents posted on the Minnesota Department of Transportation's Web site.
The bridge is blocks from the heart of Minneapolis, near tourist attractions such as the new Guthrie Theater and the Stone Arch Bridge. As the steamy night progressed massive crowds of onlookers circulated in the area on foot or bicycle, some of them wearing Twins T-shirts and caps after departing Wednesday night's game at the nearby Metrodome early.
The steel-arched bridge, built in 1967, rose 64 feet above the river and stretched 1,900 feet across the water. It was built with a single 458-foot-long steel arch to avoid the need for piers that might interfere with river navigation. The depth of the water underneath the bridge is between 4 to 14 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.
The collapse was not expected to have a sizable impact on barge shipments of grain and freight. The stretch of the river is largely used by recreational boaters and seldom by shippers, who rely more on bigger locks south on the river, said Bill Gretten with the Army Corps of Engineers.

The Minneapolis fire chief says it is a miracle that only five people have so far been confirmed dead in the collapse of one of the city's main road bridges over the Mississippi River.
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty said outside experts would review the decisions of state engineers to delay certain repair work on the heavily traveled 40-year-old bridge, which crumpled during evening rush hour on Wednesday.
After a day in which divers tried to reach the bodies of more victims amid the smashed cars and blocks of concrete in the treacherous waters, Fire Chief Jim Clack said a fifth victim was found and more bodies were certain to be found.
"With that big a piece of the bridge falling in the river and the time of day, I thought it would be much worse," Clack said.
"Initially, when this happened, I was worried there would be dozens of fatalities, if not hundreds. It's quite a miracle really," he said.
Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said an official estimate of eight people still missing was "fluid" and subject to change. One person reported missing had turned up safe at work, he said.
Twenty-seven of the 98 people injured in the disaster remained in area hospitals, including five in critical condition and another five in serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Pawlenty said engineers had decided to periodically inspect the steel superstructure beneath the Interstate 35W bridge and bolt on reinforcing plates where any flaws were found.
But that work, which Pawlenty said fit in the state's budget, was postponed by resurfacing and repair work which was under way when the bridge buckled and fell.
"Experts that we rely on, technical experts and engineers, made some decisions about what needed to be done. They thought they were making an appropriate decision for their reasons, and now those decisions will have to be reviewed," Pawlenty said. A private engineering firm had been hired for the review.
"The bridge was declared fit for service," he said. "There will be tough questions asked, including by me, and we will get to the bottom of this."
In Washington, the US House of Representatives authorised $US250 million ($A290 million) for the initial reconstruction of the bridge and to reimburse local governments for the cost of extra buses and other efforts to alleviate traffic snarls. The Senate was also expected to approve the money.
Divers searched submerged cars that had tumbled 20 metres into the Mississippi. "This is very dangerous work because the divers can get caught in the debris, some of which is razor-sharp," Clack said.
Divers battled swift currents and had to feel their way in the muddy waters around twisted steel and chunks of concrete.
"You got gas in there, oil. Besides, the Mississippi River is not the cleanest place. You didn't have any visibility, you just felt," Minneapolis Fire Department diver Raoul Raymose told CBS.
The eight-lane span was a vital link over the Mississippi River and the most heavily used bridge in Minnesota with roughly 140,000 vehicles passing over each day.
"It is striking the bridge was carrying a load of traffic it was not designed for," said the Democratic Speaker of Minnesota's state House of Representatives Margaret Anderson Kelliher.
Reconstruction estimates ranged as high as $500 million.
Visiting first lady Laura Bush praised the city's response: "We've seen the strength of your community, and because of that we're confident the bridge will be rebuilt and your city will heal."
President George W Bush is scheduled to tour the scene on Saturday.

Minnesota to Start Debris Removal at Collapsed Bridge
by John Hughes
8-6-07
(Bloomberg) -- Minnesota officials today are resuming efforts to find victims of last week's bridge collapse in Minneapolis as they prepare to bring in heavy equipment to remove cars and debris from the Mississippi River.
The $15 million salvage effort starting this week will begin with removing cars from the fallen highway and continue with opening a 56-foot-wide (17-meter-wide) river channel for barge traffic, according to Michael Koob, a consultant for the state from Wiss, Janey Elstner Associates Inc.
The debris removal may help locate the eight people missing after the Aug. 1 collapse, said Bob McFarlin, assistant to state Transportation Commissioner and Lieutenant Governor Carol Molnau. Five people have been confirmed dead.
``We will be focused on a recovery effort,'' McFarlin told reporters yesterday in Roseville, Minnesota. ``We will continue to have that focus until all who are missing are accounted for.''
President George W. Bush is expected to sign a bill to provide as much as $250 million for a new bridge, said Jim Berard, a spokesman for House Transportation Committee Chairman James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat. Congress approved the funding two days ago. Oberstar plans to travel to Minnesota this week to meet with state officials and inspect the site.
State and local officials held a memorial service for victims of the accident yesterday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing its investigation by examining whether a construction project under way on the span may have played a role in the worst bridge collapse in 25 years.
The board interviewed construction workers and gathered information on the placement and weight of equipment and materials, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker told reporters yesterday.
`Moment of Failure'
``We need to have an accurate depiction of what the bridge was like at the exact moment of failure,'' Rosenker said. ``All of this data is critical.''
The collapse during evening rush hour prompted recommendations to examine 756 similar U.S. structures and a federal review of whether inspection requirements should be more stringent. The Interstate 35W bridge was Minnesota's busiest, linking downtown Minneapolis to its northern suburbs.
The NTSB has agreed to let state and local authorities start removing cars and debris, Rosenker told reporters. Those operations, involving four cranes and one or two barges, will begin later this week, said Terry Zoller, the state's project manager for the effort to move the wreckage.
``It's going to be a very slow, tedious process,'' Zoller said. ``We will take pieces out very methodically and place them on a barge so we can examine each one of those pieces.''
Salvage, Construction
The salvage effort will begin months of heavy-equipment work at the site. Once the debris is removed, the effort will shift to construction of a replacement bridge, McFarlin said. The state hopes to approve a contract in September for a replacement bridge that will last 100 years, he said.
The $250 million approved by Congress will finance the debris removal and bridge construction, McFarlin said.
Federal Bureau of Investigation underwater research and recovery teams are on their way to Minnesota to assist in the search for victims, Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek told reporters yesterday. Authorities are also seeking the help of U.S. Navy diving and salvage teams, Stanek said.
The construction project being examined by the NTSB began in June and was to be finished next month with replacement and repair of pavement, lights and guardrails. Work was being done toward the bridge's southern end when the span collapsed, Rosenker said.
The NTSB is also reviewing weather data starting in 1967 when the bridge was completed to determine whether temperature played a role in weakening the structure, he said.

Minneapolis Bridge Collapse Recovery, Investigation Continues
Date Published: Monday, August 6th, 2007
No more victims were pulled from the wreckage of the Minneapolis Bridge collaps e this weekend, although rescue officials believe there are more bodies to recover from the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) continued its investigation into the Minneapolis bridge collapse, amid reports that construction crews working on the Interstate 35W Bridge had felt the structure âwobbleâ for several days before the collapse.
According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, construction workers have said that in the days prior to the disaster, the Minneapolis Bridge had âwobbledâ with every layer of concrete they moved. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT) would not comment on the reports, saying that they would be part of the NTSB investigation into the Minneapolis bridge collapse. A spokesperson for MNDOT also said that the NTSB was seeking information on the number of lanes that the I-35W Bridge had when it opened in 1967, as well as the number of vehicles the bridge carried at that time.
The NTSB said over the weekend that investigation of the Minneapolis Bridge collapse could take as long as 18 months. The agency, which has 19 investigators assigned to the Minneapolis bridge collapse disaster, has concluded that the collapse did not originate on the south end of the I-35W Bridge, and they will look at the north side today. An NTSB investigator told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that investigators are being extremely cautious because the collapsed Minneapolis Bridge is continuing to weaken.
Those same conditions were making recovery efforts difficult at the site. Divers were expected to return to the river today to search for the missing, and the state has requested help from FBI and Navy dive teams. Last week, the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the level of the Mississippi River by two feet in an attempt to lessen the current. Today, crews will begin removing debris from the river. MNDOT has hired a contractor from St. Paul, Minnesota to handle debris removal. The cleanup is expected to cost at least $15 million.
Five people have been confirmed dead as a result of the Minneapolis Bridge collapse, and eight are still missing. On Saturday, families of the missing were brought to the site of the collapse for the first time. Sunday was a day of prayer and grieving in the Twin Cities, where about 1400 people attended an interfaith memorial service at St. Marks Episcopal Cathedral.
This morning, Minneapolis commuters attempted to make it into work without one of the cityâs main corridors. The I-35W Bridge had carried 140,000 cars everyday. Commuters were encouraged to car pool and offered free bus rides. Meanwhile, MNDOT officials mulled over plans for replacing the collapsed Minneapolis Bridge. It is expected that replacement will cost in excess of $200 million. Late last week, Congress approved $250 million in emergency funds to help Minnesota with the cost of cleanup and bridge replacement. But MNDOT said that even with that money, the agency still faces a cash shortfall.
The I-35 W Bridge collapsed last Wednesday at the height of Minneapolisâ rush hour. Between 50 and 100 vehicles were on the bridge when it fell into the Mississippi River. Recent inspections of the Minneapolis Bridge had found it to be âstructurally deficientâ. The Minneapolis Bridge collapse is only the second time in 25 years that a highway bridge in the US collapsed without a cause like an earthquake or collision.
Navy, FBI divers join bridge search

MINNEAPOLIS â An elite team of Navy divers joined the search Tuesday for victims of the Minneapolis interstate bridge collapse, bringing to the job lessons learned from such disasters as TWA Flight 800 and the loss of the space shuttle Columbia.
The team of 16 divers and a five-member command crew arrived a day earlier. Once their gear arrived before dawn Tuesday, several divers immediately entered the Mississippi River even though local officials encouraged them to wait until daybreak.
âTwo in the morning, they dove into the water,â Minneapolis Police Capt. Mike Martin said, calling them âthe best divers in the world.â
âThese guys make our SWAT guys look humble,â Martin said.
Navy Senior Chief David Nagle said the divers wanted to get a feel for the area and were in the water for about two hours. Divers were back in the river by late morning, removing concrete rebar and other debris.
Also Tuesday, state officials laid out tentative plans for the bridge reconstruction, and Gov. Tim Pawlenty said his office was considering a victimsâ compensation fund.
The dive teamâs arrival raised hopes of speeding up the recovery operation. At least eight people are missing and presumed dead in last weekâs collapse, with perhaps more still in the river. Five people are confirmed dead.
Joining the Navy team was an FBI dive crew, doing forensic work for the investigation. Their tools included a small unmanned submarine equipped with a robotic arm.
âItâs basically crime-lab-underwater kind of work,â Martin said.
The city also asked residents to observe a moment of silence at the minute the bridge fell six days earlier. Bells at churches and City Hall tolled immediately after.
Four people still hospitalized with injuries from the collapse improved to serious condition, leaving only one person in critical condition. About 100 people were hurt in the disaster.
hero rewarded with college funds
A man who helped evacuate a school bus full of children after the Minneapolis bridge collapse has a generous offer to consider.
Jeremy Hernandez, 20, dropped out of Dunwoody College of Technology because he couldnât afford the $15,000 tuition. Now, he can finish his two-year automotive technician degree for free if he wants to come back, the school said Tuesday.
Hernandez, a gym coordinator for a Minneapolis community organization, was coming back from a water park with a group of 52 children, ages 5-14, when the bus dropped toward the Mississippi River gorge as the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed. Everyone on the bus got out safely.
Dunwoody President C. Ben Wright said the school created a fund that would pay for the education of people âwho have done unselfish things trying to better society.â The fund was created in response to Hernandezâs efforts. Hernandez hasnât yet said whether heâll accept the schoolâs offer.

Metal Plates Examined in Bridge Collapse
By MARTIGA LOHN
Thursday, August 9, 2007; 7:03 PM
Â 
MINNEAPOLIS -- The metal plates that held the girders together on a failed 1960s-era interstate bridge were originally attached with rivets, old technology that that is more likely to slip than the bolts used in bridges today.
Some of the plates, or gussets, also may have been weakened by welding work over the years, and some of them may have been too thin or too small, engineering experts said Thursday.
Â

The National Transportation Safety Board, in a brief Wednesday advisory to states to check such plates in bridges nationwide, cited a "design issue" with the bridge's gussets. Engineers say that the plates are an obvious place to start looking, but that a number of other factors might have contributed to the Aug. 1 collapse that killed at least seven people, with at least six still missing.
And on Thursday, NTSB officials said "people have run maybe a little bit too far" with the statement on the gussets.
"Simply by finding a piece of metal that's been sheared or twisted doesn't necessarily mean it's a critical piece of the puzzle," said Bruce Magladry, director of the NTSB's Office of Highway Safety. "We see a lot of steel that's damaged because of the bridge collapse. What we need to ferret out is what's an initial cause of damage vs. what's a secondary cause."
Engineering experts said failure of the plates, which usually sandwich the bridge's steel beams where they intersect, in a critical spot could have brought down the whole bridge, although no one has pinpointed a gusset as the cause of the failure.
"What they'll be looking for is to see whether one of the gusset plates may have fractured," said W. Gene Corley, a forensic engineer with the Skokie, Ill.-based engineering firm CTL Group. "If one of those gusset plates breaks, then you have lost half the strength at that location, and most likely the other one can't carry the load then."
The bridge's builders in the mid-1960s riveted the plates together, which required many more holes than bolts would have. More holes weaken steel, said Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a professor of structural engineering at the University of California-Berkeley, who compared them to Swiss cheese.
The rivets also tend to slip more than bolts and can lead to more cracking, Corley said. Bolts are preferred in modern bridge construction, and were used in more recent repairs.
Welding work on some gussets _ at temperatures of 2,600 degrees or more _ could also have caused tiny cracks to form as superheated steel cooled, which may have developed fatigue cracks.
Astaneh-Asl reviewed 1965 construction drawings of the bridge that showed varying thicknesses of the gussets. Some in key spots over the Mississippi River were only a half-inch thick, he said, and his rough calculation of the pressure they could withstand suggested they were weaker than the beams they connected. A cracked gusset is visible in photographs taken after the collapse, he said, but it's unclear what role that might have played in the bridge's failure.
State transportation officials say damage seen on the bridge's gussets might have been caused by the collapse.
Various problems in the bridge may simply have added up over the years and created stresses that the designers never contemplated, Astaneh-Asl said. For instance, at least one expansion joint locked up, possibly pulling one of the bridge's piers out of alignment and leading to undetermined pressures on other parts of the bridge. Such things could have made fatigue cracks worse, he said.
Inspectors who completed the bridge's last full inspection in June 2006 noted problems _ "section loss, pitting, heavy flaking rust" _ on several of the plates. They also reported loose bolts on another gusset.
Corley, who has been invited to be part of a private investigation into the collapse, said he saw "lots of rust" on the gussets.
"It brings the issue of load and brings the issue of fatigue there as well as corrosion," he said.
But something could have gone wrong in design, too, Corley said. Each plate is individually designed, and someone could have miscalculated the load or weight-bearing capacity of an individual gusset plate, he said.
"In design there's always the chance for a blunder," Corley said. "One of the most common causes of collapse of any type of structure is the blunder."
Investigators are looking closely at the weight that was on the bridge when it fell.
Construction crews had piled up sand and gravel on the bridge as they prepared to pave a 520-foot stretch of two southbound lanes of the freeway, said Liz Benjamin, a construction engineer with MnDOT. Equipment on the bridge included a cement truck, a concrete mobile mixer, buggies to haul the concrete and personal vehicles of the workers. Workers also were using 45-pound jackhammers to remove the top layer of pavement.
The bridge was one of Minnesota's busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles a day. Mark Hallenbeck, director of the Washington State Transportation Center at the University of Washington, said that's dramatically higher than designers would have considered in 1965.
The traffic would have contributed to fatigue over the years, Corley said. But the weight of truck and vehicle traffic is "pretty insignificant" next to the weight of the bridge itself, he said.___

2 Bodies Found in Minn. Bridge Wreckage
Thursday August 9, 2007 10:01 PM
By PATRICK CONDON
Associated Press Writer
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Searchers found two more bodies Thursday in the wreckage of the interstate bridge, bringing the death toll to seven with at least six missing more than a week after the bridge crumbled into the Mississippi River, authorities said.
Crews have been searching the site for the past week for eight people missing and presumed dead in the Aug. 1 collapse.
Dave Hayhoe, the police homicide unit commander, announced the recoveries ahead of a briefing on the investigation. He said the bodies were recovered by divers, but he gave no other information.
``Right now the first priority is notifying the families,'' Hayhoe said.
The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said the first body was found shortly after noon and wasn't immediately identified.
Among the eight are a pregnant nursing student and her 2-year-old daughter, a construction worker nicknamed ``Jolly,'' and a former missionary who had been on his way to meet a friend for dinner.
As the recovery operation continued Thursday, so did the investigation into the cause of the collapse. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday they had found design flaws in the bridge's gusset plates, which help tie the steel beams together.
That discovery prompted Transportation Secretary Mary Peters to advise states to carefully consider any additional stress placed on bridges during construction projects. An 18-person crew had been working on the Interstate 35W span when it collapsed during the evening rush hour.
J. Richard Capka, administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, said Thursday that the agency would quickly advise transportation agencies around the country of steps they should take if a systematic problem with gusset plates was found, though he said no such advisory was in the works.
``Gusset plates have been around a long time, and they've been a reliable feature, and we have no indication that they've ever been part of a suspect bridge problem or a bridge failure before,'' Capka said.
``They have not concluded that they've discovered anything specific that might have contributed to the collapse,'' he added.
State officials have announced tentative plans for a replacement bridge to be opened by the end of 2008. Gov. Tim Pawlenty also said he was willing to reverse his long-standing opposition to a state gas tax increase to pay for infrastructure improvements in the state.
President Bush on Thursday dismissed raising the federal gasoline tax to repair the nation's bridges, though - as proposed Wednesday by House Transportation Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar, D-Minn. - at least until Congress changes the way it spends highway money.
``The way it seems to have worked is that each member on that (Transportation) committee gets to set his or her own priorities first,'' Bush said. ``That's not the right way to prioritize the people's money. Before we raise taxes, which could affect economic growth, I would strongly urge the Congress to examine how they set priorities.''
At the bridge site, recovery crews have removed several vehicles from the river in the last two days, and Navy divers have searched for possible victims in and around the others.
In all, 88 vehicles have been located, both in the river and amid the broken concrete wreckage of the bridge, according to the State Patrol.
NTSB investigators have been trying to pinpoint where on the bridge the collapse began. Observations from a helicopter camera Wednesday found several ``tensile fractures'' in the superstructure on the north side of the bridge, but nothing that appeared to show where the collapse began, the NTSB said.
Investigators were still working to verify the loads and stresses on the beams, as well as materials in the plates.
They also were looking into reports of wobbling before the collapse.
The company that was doing construction work at the site, Progressive Contractors Inc., rejected a report that a worker noticed unusual swaying of the bridge in the days before its collapse. The company said it didn't believe any of its work contributed to the bridge failure but hadn't responded directly to claims of wobbling.
``We have now met with every single worker who was on the bridge when it collapsed,'' Tom Sloan, vice president of the company's bridge division, said in a news release Wednesday. ``None of them observed or reported any unusual swaying.''
The eight people reported missing and feared dead in the bridge collapse have been identified as Christine Sacorafas, 45, of White Bear Lake; Vera Peck, 50, and her son Richard Chit, 20, both of Bloomington; Greg Jolstad, 45, of Mora; Peter Hausmann, 47, of Rosemount; Sadiya Sahal, 23, of St. Paul, and her 2-year-old daughter, Hanah; and Scott Sathers, 29, of Maple Grove.

8th body found in Minneapolis bridge collapse
Â 
MINNEAPOLIS -- Divers removed another body from the wreckage of a freeway bridge Friday, while the federal transportation secretary offered $50 million to help with recovery and rebuilding.
The known death toll from last week's collapse reached eight when Navy divers found a body about noon.
The latest victim was identified as Sadiya Sahal, 23, St. Paul. A body found Thursday was identified as that of her 2-year-old daughter, Hanah Sahal.
Â 
Those identifications reduce the list of known missing and presumed dead to five.
Â 
During her visit, Secretary Mary Peters stood near a fallen section of the bridge as she announced the latest emergency aid. The funds are an advance on $250 million approved by Congress but not yet appropriated.
Â 
The money comes on top of $5 million in federal emergency aid pledged right after the Aug. 1 bridge collapse and $5 million to help the public transit system handle the loss of the heavily traveled span.
Â 
Associated Press - August 12, 2007 11:03 PM ET
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The official death toll in the Minneapolis bridge collapse has risen to nine.
Divers found another body in the Mississippi River Sunday.
The county medical examiner's office has identified the remains as those of 20-year-old Richard Chit of St. Anthony. His mother is still missing.
The other three people known to be missing are 45-year-old Christine Sacorafas of White Bear Lake; 45-year-old Greg Jolstad of Mora; and 29-year-old Scott Sathers of Maple Grove.
About 100 people were injured in the collapse, but only eight remain hospitalized.
Today, a crane removed a school bus and other vehicles from one end of the ruined span. In all, 44 vehicles have been removed from the bridge since its collapse. About 100 vehicles had been on the structure when it fell.

Two More Victims Found in Minneapolis Bridge Wreckage
Search crews in Minneapolis have pulled out the tenth and eleventh bodies from the wreckage of the interstate bridge collapse.
The remains havenât been publicly identified by officials
The first remains were found in a vehicle recovered on the night of Aug. 15, 2007, with the second set of remains found the morning of August 16.
A national Greek community group said one of those whose body was recovered had been driving to her church to teach a folk dancing class at the time the bridge fell.
Officials have released the identities of nine people killed in the August 1st collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge.
Before the latest recoveries, four people were listed as missing

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The remains of the last person missing after a bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River nearly three weeks ago have been found, authorities said Monday, bringing the official death toll to 13 and relief to the only family still awaiting word on a missing loved one.
Gregory Jolstad, nicknamed "Jolly," was on the construction crew that was resurfacing the bridge when it fell Aug. 1 during the evening rush hour. Jolstad, 45, was driving a skid loader, commonly known by the brand name Bobcat.
Divers had gone back in the water early Monday, and Jolstad's wife, Lisa Jolstad, has said officials had vowed to continue until they found her husband.
Greg Jolstad, 45, was one of 18 construction workers on the bridge working for Progressive Contractors Inc. The other 17 survived the collapse. Seven suffered injuries, but none critical.
Also Monday, Gov. Tim Pawlenty asked President Bush to declare the collapse a major disaster, which would make the state eligible for more federal money. The governor said the emergency response costs alone would be more than $8 million.
Bush was scheduled to be in Minneapolis on Tuesday and to get a briefing on the bridge.
Jolstad had worked for PCI for 10 years, often commuting 90 miles one way to road jobs in the Twin Cities from his home in the central Minnesota town of Mora.
Lisa and Greg Jolstad were married in 1995 and lived with Lisa's three teenage children from a previous marriage in a 97-year-old farmhouse north of town where Greg Jolstad grew up.
"Greg never wanted to venture far from home," Lisa Jolstad said.
Her worst fear since the collapse was that her husband would still be missing after all the other victims of the disaster had been found - and that's exactly what happened.
A tax assessor currently between jobs, Lisa Jolstad is living for now on her husband's paycheck, which PCI continued to issue, as well as paying for grief counselors for family members.
"Everyone at the company is just heartsick for Greg's family," said David Lillehaug, PCI's attorney.
Lisa Jolstad said earlier that she was trying to keep occupied by getting the farmhouse ready for winter.
"I sit home every night, and I just can't believe he's not coming home," she said. "I look out the back door window and it's weird not to see his truck out there. I look out the bathroom window at the sky and know he's up there, and I say, you know, why did you have to leave, Greg?"

Hundreds Feared Dead in Nepal
After Bridge Collapses
The Bridge Collapsed on Christmas Day,
Killing at Least 15 People
By NICK SCHIFRIN
NEW DELHI, Dec. 26, 2007
Bridges have given so much to Nepal's isolated villagers. But on Christmas Day, one bridge took
entire families away.
A 400-foot-long steel foot bridge over the Bheri River in Chunchu collapsed Tuesday afternoon,
killing at least 15 people and injuring hundreds. At least 70 people are still missing and presumed dead.
Hundreds of police officers, soldiers and locals are searching the river's icy waters for any survivors.
But the current is strong, and there is little hope of finding anyone alive. Some of the bodies were
found three miles downstream from the bridge.
"Most people did not know what happened. The bridge collapsed and most people on the crowded
bridge fell in the river," 20-year-old Durga Bika told The Associated Press from his hospital bed in
Katmandu. "The bridge was on top of me and my leg was caught. My friends pulled me out and
saved me."
Most of the victims were women and children. The youngest was only 5 years old.
"I heard a sound like a bomb explosion," 10-year-old Rabindra Buda told the Indo-Asian News
Service, after he had been pulled out of the river. "Then the bridge started swaying. I felt myself
falling and hit the water. You couldn't see the river anymore. It was full of human heads."
As many as 500 people were walking across the bridge toward a monthly, full-moon Hindu festival
when its steel cables gave way, plunging most of the bridge into the water about 100 feet below.
"We still don't know exactly how many people are missing so we have sent teams to nearby villages
to get information from families on whether they have not heard from their relatives," chief
government administrator Anil Pandey told the AP.
Nepal's villages are separated by mountains and the rivers that run through them. There is little
to no access to paved roads, so residents rely on their feet â and a relatively new network of
1,000 bridges throughout the country.
In all, at least 45 miles of bridges have helped to open villages up to the outside world in recent
years, reducing prices by giving farmers easier routes to deliver produce and saving lives by
making hospitals more accessible.
The bridge in Chunchu, about 310 miles west of Katmandu, was born out of peace.
It was built just last year after the government signed a cease-fire agreement with Maoist rebels,
who have waged a decade-long insurgency that devastated much of the country's infrastructure.
Rebels have destroyed bridges and roads in order to isolate government troops, but this time, the
Â bridge fell because it was not designed to support the weight of so many people, authorities say.
It collapsed just one day after Nepal's government took a historic decision to abolish its monarchy.
Under the deal, agreed to by the rebels, Nepal will become a republic after a general election
scheduled for next year.
This afternoon the government released a statement promising an investigation into the incident.
It also promised to pay $400 to each of the victims' families.
