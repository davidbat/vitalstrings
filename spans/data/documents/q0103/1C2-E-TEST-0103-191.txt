On Wednesday, August 1 , 2007 , at 6:05pm CDT, the I-35W Bridge near University Avenue in Minneapolis collapsed,  leaving multiple vehicles and pedestrians in the Mississippi River.  13 people died, and over 100 were injured.
Causes
The National Transportation Safety Board announced on January 15 , 2008 that the cause of the collapse may have been a design flaw. A report from the Gray Plant and Mooty law firm in May 2008 said that budget issues had led to poor maintenance on the bridge, which was also a factor in the collapse.
Reconstruction
Construction began on October 30 , 2007 of a replacement bridge, with construction expected to conclude in December 2008.
