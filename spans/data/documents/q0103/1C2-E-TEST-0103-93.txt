The 2007 collapse of Minnesota's I-35W bridge killed 13 people. Tragic as it was, the collapse is helping engineers foresee and act on structural problems and prevent possible failures of other spans. In this slide show, see how lessons learned from past collapses have helped improve bridge safety, and how "smart" sensing technology is already aiding the monitoring of bridges both new and old.
Find out what caused eight infamous bridge collapses.
