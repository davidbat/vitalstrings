2007 35W Bridge Collapse
Page Content
On August 1, 2007, Minnesota responded to one of the most high-profile events in the stateâ€™s history when the I-35W bridge catastrophically collapsed during evening rush hour, plunging dozens of vehicles and their occupants into the Mississippi River and onto its banks.
Thirteen people were killed and more than 100 injured in that event. HSEM activated the SEOC, establishing a joint information center in St. Paul and one near the collapse scene. Governor Pawlenty requested and President Bush issued an emergency declaration making federal resources available. See FEMA EM-3278.
Local and state response included fire, law enforcement, collapsed structure rescue, water rescue, hazmat specialists and emergency medical services, with state resources coordinated through the SEOC along with public information, various state agencies and federal liaisons from FEMA, the White House, Congress, the U.S. DOT, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Department of Homeland Security
.
In the SEOC, it was quickly discovered that this was an international media event, as public information officers from several state agencies sorted phone calls into local, state, national and international categories and pursued answers for major media from around the world.
Among the lessons reinforced in this disaster were that relationships are central to effective response, and that planning, repetitive exercising, interoperable communications and mutual aid agreements save time, money and lives.
In the fall of 2007 the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee authorized emergency recovery funds in a bill that authorized $250 million for replacement of the I-35W bridge. The new bridge opened in September of 2008.
