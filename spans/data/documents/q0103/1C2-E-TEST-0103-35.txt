Data Practices contacts and information
Mn/DOT and the Federal Highway Administration have not and will not bypass any environmental or permit requirements. Mn/DOT is using existing environmental review streamlining measures that have been developed with federal, state and local partners over the past decade. Mn/DOT has had a high level of cooperation from federal, state and local resource agencies to expedite the existing review and permitting processes during this emergency.
Environmental review for the bridge replacement is being performed through a federal categorical exclusion document and the state and federal permitting process. This environmental process still includes thorough analysis of the full range of potential environmental issues, including but not limited to threatened and endangered species, historic and archeological resources, park and recreation impacts, and many others.
Federal and state permits are still required as a part of the development process for the new bridge. To date Mn/DOT has received permits from the Corps of Engineers and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Permits from  the Coast Guard and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency are pending. The National Park Service is a part of the visual quality team, along with City of Minneapolis, Friends of the Mississippi River, State Historic Preservation Office and many others to address aesthetics/visual quality of the new structure.
