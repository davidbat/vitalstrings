Back by Popular Demand: Minnesota Bridge Collapse Seminar
 
August 31, 2009
 
Maine Emergency Management Agency will host two offerings of a seminar examining response issues in the August, 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse.  The seminar will be held October 1st and 2nd in Belfast and Dover-Foxcroft.
Several sessions of this seminar were held in January of this year. Overwhelmingly positive feedback from the emergency management and response community led to scheduling additional sessions of the seminar.
Featured Guest Instructor: Rocco Forté
Rocco Forté is the Emergency Preparedness Director in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  He commanded the Emergency Operations Center following the collapse if the I35W bridge.
Mr. Forté will be speaking to police, fire, EMA and EMS agencies throughout the State of Maine on “local response” to a bridge collapse.  He is the current Emergency Preparedness Director for Minneapolis, Minnesota and retired Fire Chief of 30 years of Minneapolis.   Mr. Forté will be speaking to us from first-hand experience about the bridge collapse that occurred in his city on August 1, 2007.
