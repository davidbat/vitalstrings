Police Chief Tim Dolan said all survivors who were on the bridge are now off.
"We've accounted for all the construction workers except for one," he said.
Rybak said rescue workers had searched around 50 cars. “We have a feeling that there are more vehicles under the water,” Clack said.
"Obviously, this is a catastrophe of historic proportions," said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.
The Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery, was in the midst of being repaired when it collapsed at 6:05 p.m. CT. Repairs, which closed at least two of the eight lanes, involved guardrail replacement on the joints and concrete work, Pawlenty said.
At least 60 injured
"There were two lanes of traffic, bumper-to-bumper, at the point of the collapse. Those cars did go into the river," said Minneapolis Police Lt. Amelia Huffman. "At this point there is nothing to suggest that this was anything other than a structural collapse."

Sixty people — at least 10 of them children — were injured, said medical officials. Six individuals being treated at Hennepin County Medical Center were in critical condition, Dr. Joseph Clinton said. He said at least one of the victims had drowned.
Clinton said his hospital treated 28 people. The injuries were blunt force trauma to the abdomen, head, trunk and extremities.
NBC News reported that every Minneapolis ambulance had been requested to the scene.
A freight train was passing under the bridge when it collapsed and was cut in two, witnesses on the scene reported to MSNBC.
No indication of terrorism
The Homeland Security Department said the collapse did not appear to be terrorism-related. The National Transportation Safety Board planned to send a team of investigators to Minneapolis, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said.
"We continue to monitor the situation. At this time, there's no indication of a nexus to terrorism," Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke told NBC News' Pete Williams.
