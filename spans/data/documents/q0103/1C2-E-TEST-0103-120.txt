MINNEAPOLIS -- Survivors of the Interstate 35W bridge collapse say they're relieved the frustrating wait for plans to build a memorial is over.
Brent and Chris Olson, of White Bear Lake, were on a section that didn't collapse in 2007. They came to a gathering Thursday where plans were unveiled.
The downtown Minneapolis memorial on the Mississippi River bluff will have 13 LED-lit beams -- one for each victim who died in the collapse. A wall of cascading water will feature the names of the nearly 150 survivors and a path to an observation deck will provide a view of the new 35W bridge.
A $1.5 million legal settlement tied to the collapse will pay for construction and upkeep.
It's set to open Aug. 1, the fourth anniversary of the collapse.
