Lack of Maintenance Caused 35W Bridge to Fall

Looking at the line where the arrow is pointing, you can see where half the width of the gusset plate is gone due to corrosion. Basically, this was MNDOT known fact which should have triggered reinforcement or replacement of the gusset plates on the 35W bridge.
A critical gusset plate connection on the I-35W bridge fractured partially along a line of corrosion that had gone unfixed by state transportation officials since at least 1993, according to evidence released Tuesday by the federal agency investigating the collapse.
The laboratory report from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) doesn't draw conclusions, but it said a corroded plate in the L-11 East gusset node broke apart from compression forces in the bridge truss, not from secondary impacts sustained during the collapse.

Kudos to many officials and Star Tribune for reporting this, despite probably huge Republican pressure to cover up the truth. For the responsibility leads directly to Republican Governor Pawlenty, since he inherited this. Now into a second term, Republican Governor Pawlenty had plenty of time to fix this or at least have a plan to fix this.
All of our bridges and roads have been suffering from lack of maintenance. I reported on the declining state of roads earlier . The Star  Tribune has interactive map of bridges, that shows that most bridges are in need of repair, here . The pledge for "no new taxes" was done by dumping maintenance as well as other government responsibilities! Time to stick the "no new taxes" Republican Governor Pawlenty with the blame that he so richly deserves. It is especially ironic given the pro-life religious ideals that Republican Governor Pawlenty touted so strongly. Obviously in Republican Governor Pawlenty's mind, being pro-life does not apply to people using bridges and roads!
