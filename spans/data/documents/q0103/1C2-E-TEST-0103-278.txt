I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse
I-35W Mississippi River  bridge collapse
On August 1, 2007, the I-35W bridge over the  Mississippi River collapsed, sending several dozen vehicles into the river and  causing 13 deaths.  Below are photos of the bridge area, post-collapse.
This zoomed-in view looks north at part    of the fallen span, taken from the West Bank Office Building, which is    less than 400 feet from the south end of the bridge.  Photo by    James Peacock, taken    August 2, 2007.  A larger photo is available here .
Looking downriver at the collapse site    from the Guthrie Theater.  The Lower St. Anthony Falls Lock is in    front of the destroyed bridge, with the 10th Ave Bridge in the    background.  Photo by James Peacock, taken    August 2, 2007.  A larger photo is available here .

First of four photographs taken from the    recently reopened 10th Ave Bridge.  This is looking southward at    what's left of the bridge in the river and the south bank.  A lot    of the concrete and rebar has already been removed both in preparation    for clearing the site for the new bridge and also to reopen the river    channel to boat traffic.  Photo by "bapster", taken    September 1, 2007.
This looks northward at the north side of    the bridge.  A lot of the concrete deck remains on this part of the    bridge.  Photo by "bapster", taken    September 1, 2007.
A closer view of the span in the above    photo, showing how it collapsed into almost a sort of "skateboard ramp" type shape.  Photo by "bapster", taken    September 1, 2007.
Near the north end of the bridge, where    one of the approach spans fell and damaged two rail cars sitting    underneath.  Photo by "bapster", taken    September 1, 2007.
