Examined more than 3000 documents
Examined and cataloged photographs and scans
2500 pre-collapse
Interviewed 15 individuals who participated in
design and construction of bridge 40 years ago
43
Assessed design review process of 14 State
Departments of Transportation
Recovered and reconstructed main truss sections
Documented and analyzed physical evidence
Compared physical evidence to data collected from
more than 350 finite element modeling evaluations
44
Gusset plates were unable to support loads on
bridge on day of collapse
Failure of gusset plates resulted in total
collapse of the bridge
Gusset plates had inadequate capacity
Design error in gusset plates
45
Required bridge owners to conduct load capacity
calculations for all structural members
including gusset plates to verify stress levels
Whenever modifications were planned or
operational changes significantly increase
Included all non-load-path-redundant steel truss
bridges within National Bridge Inventory
