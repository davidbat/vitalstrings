Raw look at the MN collapsed bridge...
This is the best footage I was able to find
MINNEAPOLIS â€” The entire span of an interstate bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River during evening rush hour yesterday, sending vehicles, tons of concrete and twisted metal crashing into the water.
The Interstate 35W bridge, which stretches between Minneapolis and St. Paul, was in the midst of being repaired when it broke into several huge sections.
The Homeland Security Department had received no indications last night that the collapse was related to an act of terrorism, said department spokesman Russ Knocke.
"We continue to monitor the situation. At this time, there's no indication of a nexus to terrorism," Mr. Knocke said.
It was not clear how many people were injured. WCCO-AM reported that one body was seen being pulled from the area, covered with a blue sheet.
A burning truck and a school bus clung to one slanted slab, while at least eight cars and a truck were submerged in the river.
The bus had just crossed the bridge before it crumpled into pieces, and broadcast reports indicated the children on the bus exited out the back door.
Ramon Houge told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he was on his way home from work on the bridge when heard a rumbling noise, saw the ground collapse and cars go down.
