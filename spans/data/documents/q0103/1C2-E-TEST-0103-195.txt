A bridge near Brewster, Minnesota collapsed under the weight of a 40-ton asphalt milling machine that had nearly completed the milling operation.  The bridge carries Nobles County 1 over Elk Creek.  The operator of the machine was able to jump to safety before the machine fell into the creek.  He did seek medical care for a possible knee injury.
