It has been almost three years since the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed over the Mississippi River, killing 13 and injuring dozens more.
Today, we learned in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press that the collapse could have been avoided.
A year before the collapse, an engineering firm was hired by the Minnesota Dept. of Transportation to look at the bridge. The firm, URS Corp. out of San Francisco, determined that the bridge was in imminent danger of a collapse.
Those findings were never reported to the MN Dept. of Transportation.
When an engineer from URS calculated the results, he knew immediately the results were bad. This engineer then used a different set of calculations which led MnDOT to believe that the bridge was safe.
Being from Minneapolis myself, and knowing that something was known about this tragedy, and that something could have been done if MnDOT knew the right information, makes me wonder again what was really behind this bridge collapse.
Since the bridge collapse, residents of Minneapolis have heard things like "structural deficient" and "fracture critical" to describe the collapsed 35W bridge. It now appears we can add "misleading calculations" to the list.
