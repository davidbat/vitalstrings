The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent Federal agency dedicated to promoting aviation, railroad,
highway, marine, pipeline, and hazardous materials safety. Established in 1967, the agency is mandated by Congress through
the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine the probable causes of the accidents,
issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate the safety effectiveness of government agencies
involved in transportation. The Safety Board makes public its actions and decisions through accident reports, safety studies,
special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and statistical reviews.

National Transportation Safety Board. 2008. Collapse of I-35W Highway Bridge,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 1, 2007. Highway Accident Report NTSB/HAR-08/03.
Washington, DC.
Abstract: About 6:05 p.m. central daylight time on Wednesday, August 1, 2007, the eight-lane,
1,907-foot-long I-35W highway bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, experienced
a catastrophic failure in the main span of the deck truss. As a result, 1,000 feet of the deck truss collapsed,
with about 456 feet of the main span falling 108 feet into the 15-foot-deep river. A total of 111 vehicles were
on the portion of the bridge that collapsed. Of these, 17 were recovered from the water. As a result of the
bridge collapse, 13 people died, and 145 people were injured. On the day of the collapse, roadway work
was underway on the I-35W bridge, and four of the eight travel lanes (two outside lanes northbound and
two inside lanes southbound) were closed to traffc. In the early afternoon, construction equipment and
construction aggregates (sand and gravel for making concrete) were delivered and positioned in the two
closed inside southbound lanes. The equipment and aggregates, which were being staged for a concrete
pour of the southbound lanes that was to begin about 7:00 p.m., were positioned toward the south end
of the center section of the deck truss portion of the bridge and were in place by about 2:30 p.m. About
6:05 p.m., a motion-activated surveillance video camera at the Lower St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam, just
west of the I-35W bridge, recorded a portion of the collapse sequence. The video showed the bridge center
span separating from the rest of the bridge and falling into the river.
Major safety issues identifed in this investigation include insuffcient bridge design frm quality control
procedures for designing bridges, and insuffcient Federal and State procedures for reviewing and approving
bridge design plans and calculations; lack of guidance for bridge owners with regard to the placement of
construction loads on bridges during repair or maintenance activities; exclusion of gusset plates in bridge
load rating guidance; lack of inspection guidance for conditions of gusset plate distortion; and inadequate
use of technologies for accurately assessing the condition of gusset plates on deck truss bridges. As a
result of this accident investigation, the Safety Board makes recommendations to the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Offcials. One
safety recommendation resulting from this investigation was issued to the FHWA in January 2008.
