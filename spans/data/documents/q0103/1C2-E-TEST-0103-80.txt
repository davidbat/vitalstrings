35W Bridge Collapse Affects Law School
The collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River is a tragedy that has occurred very near to the Law School. The initial rescue and recovery efforts, as well as the long term rebuilding process, will no doubt affect the Law School for some time. We will be collecting information and resources on this page as it becomes available.
Our thoughts go out to any members of the Law School or broader community who have been directly or indirectly affected.
10th Avenue Bridge to reopen on Friday, Aug. 31
"The 10th Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River will reopen Friday, Aug. 31. The bridge will carry one lane of mixed use traffic in each direction, as well as a bike lane in each direction. The existing pedestrian sidewalk will also be open and a viewing platform has been created on the west side of the bridge overlooking the I-35W bridge collapse site. This bridge should NOT be used as an I-35W detour."
Maps:
Two printable maps for getting to the Law School are now available, one for those traveling from the north and east (I-35W southbound, I-94 westbound, Hwy 36), and one for those traveling from the south and west (I-35W northbound, I-94 eastbound). Both maps are PDFs, ~1.5 MB.
