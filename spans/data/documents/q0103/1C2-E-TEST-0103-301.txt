SI.com: Dr. Z: Minnesota enters fray in crowded wild-card field updated: Wed Nov 28 2007 15:17:00
I'm sick of 5-6 teams. There are nine of them. They're all in contention for something or other. If I were commissioner I'd outlaw them. And as for the 6-5s? Why, they are royalty, practically assured of a berth in what promises to be the dullest first two weeks of the playoffs in history. But one of those 5-6 teams is Philadelphia, which put up such a good fight against New England. That was the voice of reason speaking, and its reward is that from now on it will wear a muzzle. And here comes something that never will be muzzled, and you know what that is. (Send comments to siwriters@simail.com)

SI.com: Scott Wraight: NHL Power Rankings, Week 2 updated: Tue Oct 09 2007 22:39:00
I admit it. The season-opening Power Rankings are, for the most part, a crapshoot. There are a few superior squads, others on the fringe of greatness and some destined to be also-rans from Day 1, but the largest group resides in the one-way-or-another category until further notice. So with regards to readers Mark Klettlinger, Chris McGurty and Justin Holmes, you'll find things more to your liking -- at some point in the season.
