Seems the Dems are seeking to politicize the bridge collapse as they did the disaster in New Orleans.  Instead of seeing this failure as a tragedy and asking how can this have happened with all the money we spend.  Rather they feel an ever increasing government will fix the issue.  The article linked below to NewsBuster.com shows how Hardball guest host Mike Barnicle outlines the lunacy of the left.  The most telling quote I saw was:
Barnicle, again to [Tom] Ridge: “Government’s gotta get bigger to help, to help governors in, in various states.”
This is just the way liberals think.  If only we had more government in every aspect of our lives we would be better off.  Look at the VA to see how health care is ran by the government.  Ask those with terminal diseases like ALS how they would be under government ran health care.  DEAD and with no help is where they would be.  More government is not the solution.  More taxes is not the solution.  Responsible spending is the true solution.  Look at Texas were we are getting tax payer paid for roads turned into toll roads.  Why?  Oh theres not enough money from the gas tax.  Yet our own heroes in Austin have stolen gas tax money to fund schools and more.  And now they want us to pay money to drive on a road we paid to build and enrich the cronies of Governor Perry.
BTW: I hate Governor Perry!
