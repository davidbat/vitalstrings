prompts safety assurance of Golden Gate Bridge

In the wake of Wednesday's deadly bridge collapse in Minnesota,                  a Golden Gate Bridge spokeswoman yesterday gave reassurances that                  the event has little bearing on the structural integrity of the                  Bay Area's treasured landmark.
The arch truss bridge that collapsed over the Mississippi River                  is completely different than the Golden Gate Bridge's long-span                  suspension design, according to spokeswoman Mary Currie.
"The two (bridges) have nothing in common," Currie                  said. "Certainly we're concerned about earthquakes," as well as wind conditions and corrosion damage from fog, she                  added.
"In order to ensure the structural integrity of the span" the bridge has an ongoing maintenance program to work on corrosion                  protection, Currie said.
In addition to day-to-day maintenance, the bridge has undertaken                  several efforts over the past decades to ensure its stability                  and safety, according to Currie.
Along with replacement of the bridge's vertical suspender ropes                  in the 1970s, and replacement of the deck of the bridge in the                  1980s, the bridge began a $460 million seismic retrofit project                  in 1997, which is expected to last another six to eight years,                  Currie said.
So far, the bridge's north and south approach viaducts have been                  retrofitted, while work on the bridge's main span and main towers                  are still yet to be completed.
According to Currie, restoration of the two main cables that                  go on and over the towers could begin later this year.
"Between all of those projects, the bridge is in good shape," Currie said.
