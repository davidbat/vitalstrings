MINNEAPOLIS | Contractor URS Corp. and the state of Minnesota have settled a lawsuit over the 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in downtown Minneapolis that killed 13 people.
The settlement reached Friday calls for URS and its insurers to pay $5 million to the state. In exchange, URS will be released from any future state claims connected to the bridge collapse.
The Minnesota Department of Transportation had hired URS to analyze the 40-year-old bridge and recommend ways to shore it up before it fell.
URS doesnâ€™t admit any liability or fault for the collapse in the settlement. The company says in a statement that the settlement allows it to avoid the cost and time of further litigation.
URS still faces lawsuits by victims of the collapse, which also injured 145 people.
