Aha.
So there are good earmarks and bad earmarks.
Who knew?
The crowd doing the Twin Towers Fiasco should pay attention to the speed at which this took place.

$10 billion a month in Iraq, could have purchased 40 first class bridges each month, including a time one bridge to Nowhere.  Such is the cost of “victory”.

I would like to note that these “new features” are fairly commonplace in Japan, China, and in Europe for large spans such as this. It helps (1) detect if something is going wrong & needs fixing and (2) help design the subsequent generations of bridges.
Its sad how far behind the US is when it comes to infrastructure. We’ll keep bailing out our financial institutions while our physical environment is crumbling around us.

Your facts are wrong regarding the Gravina Island Bridge in Alaska (The Bridge to Nowhere).  Congress stripped the specific mention of this bridge as well as the Knik Arm Bridge from the 2005 omnibus spending bill, but the money, without strings attached, was appropriated and went to Alaska.  It was Governor Palin who made the decision to spend the money on other transportation projects for her state rather than on the Gravina Island Bridge.  She made this decision eight months after becoming Governor.  Your article makes it sound as if Congress cancelled the project.  It did not, she did!

American can-do at its best. Congratulations to everyone who showed that better-than-on-time and less-than-budgeted CAN be done.
Now, while we’re thinking about Palin’s approach to bridge-building, let’s ask her to divert those funds to THIS project. Alaska can afford it.

My congratulations on a job that was evidently well-managed, well-designed, and completed (early) with a sense of civic responsibility, in mind.
My opiniion is that the principles in charge of such projects in the other 49 states study Minnesota’s methods.

This bridge was built with an entirely union workforce, working under a project labor agreement.  That’s why it was done so quickly, and below cost.  The same was true for the freeway collapse repairs in Los Angeles after the Northridge earthquake.

Great job that they did it in one year, ahead of schedule, and at budget. The Bay Bridge in Oakland-San Francisco has been under construction for literally decades… they should take note.

It is not just the high gas prices or economic slow down that is “draining the trust fund away”.
Congress (in 1998)pulled the drain plug and used the $8 billion for those great balanced budgets. They also cancelled $21 billion worth of those “bonds” in the trust fund. You know those special obligation bonds (like Social Security) that are backed by the full faith and credit… CANCELLED!!! They also stopped crediting interest to the “trust fund”.
That would have built a few bridges – no?
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century – H.R.2400

`(f) DETERMINATION OF TRUST FUND BALANCES AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 1998- For purposes of determining the balances of the Highway Trust Fund and the Mass Transit Account after September 30, 1998–
`(1) the opening balance of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) on October 1, 1998, shall be $8,000,000,000, and
`(2) no interest accruing after September 30, 1998, on any obligation held by such Fund shall be credited to such Fund.
The Secretary shall cancel obligations held by the Highway Trust Fund to reflect the reduction in the balance under this subsection.’.

A tribute to the heartland honesty and work ethic. If this project had happened in most democrat controlled big cities, they would still be fighting to see how to get the most work for their friends who could then make contributions to their political campaigns. Like the BIG DIG, or the Katrina Billions, if anything ever got done at all would be of point of supreme indifference to the democrat political hacks!

How does Palin’s name constantly pop up in these comments when she has nothing to do with THIS bridge? Not to mention the reference to the War in Iraq.

My first two years in school were in Marcy, near the north end of the old and new I 35W. And the photo shows a great new bridge. My complements to everyone who had a part in this. Imagine, months early, on budget and beating the weather. My days were obviously way before the interstate was built.

@8, Doc Stephens,
You’re ALMOST right. While Congress never ‘cancelled’ the so called “Bridge to Nowhere,” Palin only did so after it became a national punch line and a huge embarrassment to the state of Alaska.
Palin CAMPAIGNED and lobbied VIGOROUSLY with Ted Stevens to get the funding for the bridge, going so far as to tell the residents of Gravina Island ‘You’re not ‘nowhere’ to me!’
So, at best Palin is a political cynic who lied to constituents to get funding for other projects (like the ROAD to nowhere!) or she is a poll driven public sycophant unable or unwilling to make a decision that might be unpopular, but one which she claimed to have believed in strongly.
Need more proof that the Empress has no clothes? Palin’s favorable unfavorable is at a -10 aggregate from this WEEKEND. Falling like a stone.

Before we can suggest that other municipalities around the country look to Minnesota for their expertise at building a bridge in record time, or that it could have happened only in America, we have to realize it would probably still not be completed if it weren’t for the Republican National Convention being held in St. Paul on September 1. That is what got the Bush administration off it’s duff to quickly appropreate the funds, and to press to complete it. they were trying to finish it by the opening of the convention, but missed by about two weeks. Any other American city or state suffering a similar disaster would be hard pressed to get funds or committment so quickly.

A similar result was found in Los Angeles after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The collapsed Interstate 10 bridge at La Cienega  and the contractors received large bonuses for finishing months quicker than scheduled.
I remember the work lights burning bright all night. This rendered the bonus less than hugely profitable as working 24/7 incurs significant extra expenses.
Perhaps that bonus structure was analyzed for the Minnesota bridge.
Rebuilding extra quickly probably also saves money because the longer you wait, the larger the projects become, which complicates authorization, so they become yet slower and so on.
Most important, the I10 La Cienega bridge still stands.

While the completion of the 35W bridge is certainly welcome, it should be noted that the project was awarded to the highest bidder with the longest time-frame. The additional cost (including incentive) is $71 million(!) more than the lowest bidder. And the lowest bidder had a completion date of October 15, not December 24 as FlatIron-Manson (the contractor) had given. So, even if the lowest bidder had gotten the project complete by this date, the total would still be nowhere near what the total payout will be. Because the incentive was capped at 100 days ($200k/day) and there was an incentive of $7 million for not asking for more money(!), I think the target date all along by this contractor was to have the bridge done by last Monday (100 days before the “due date”).
With that $71 million, we could re-build a lot of other, smaller bridges that are in sad states of repair.

I totally agree with you.  I have worked on construction projects in the US and  around the world,  nobody gets the job done better and quicker than hard charging American Workers.  If an Oversees Job is done quicker, most likely you will find American Architects, Engineers  and Project Managers managing that  job.
I wish the Republicans would stop talking about the stupid Bridge to Nowhere and start talking about what has to be done to fix/replace the other 70000 Bridges in the USA. “It’s the Infra Structure, Stupid” !!!!!
Besides Energy and IT,   Infra structure could become the biggest job Engine in America .
