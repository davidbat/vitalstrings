Vietnamese bridge collapses
Up to 60 killed in Vietnam's worst bridge accident
HANOI 9/26/07 - A section of a Japanese-funded bridge under construction in southern Vietnam collapsed on Wednesday, killing up to 60 workers and injuring about 100 in the country's worst such disaster.
A contractor with a Chinese company working on the bridge being built in Can Tho city said 60 people were killed. State-run Vietnam TV reported 55 dead, 97 injured, including 17 with critical head injuries.
TV news bulletins showed footage of a mass of tangled steel and concrete at the scene, and emergency workers in white uniforms taking bloodied victims into hospitals for treatment.
Civilians also contributed by helping to carry the injured on stretchers to hospital and others donated blood, officials said, adding at least 150 people were being treated for injuries.
"I'm in shock. I feel helpless. I couldn't do anything," a blood-splattered survivor, Tran Minh Thu, said in a TV interview.
Officials said the rescue effort would continue around the clock. "They are using machinery to cut and lift the concrete," a police official in Vinh Long said by telephone. "It is very difficult to reach the bodies and there is also danger of further collapse."
The Can Tho director of health said rescuers had not been able to find any more victims since late afternoon.
"Now the focus is on 17 patients in a very critical situation," said the official, Le Hung Dung.
