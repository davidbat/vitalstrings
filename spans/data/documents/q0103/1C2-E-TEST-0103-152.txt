I-35 Bridge Collapse Contractor Settles Lawsuits With State and Survivors
Posted on November  8, 2009 by Joshua Glazov
The Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune's Jim Foti reports in I-35 Bridge Firm Settles Suits on Friday's settlement between Progressive Contractors, Inc. (the "contractor") on one side and State of Minnesota and the disaster survivors on the other.  Terms of the settlement, approved Friday by Judge Deborah Hedlund , are confidential.
Kyle Hart, one of the contractor's lawyers, said the company's insurers "tendered the limits of the contractor's liability insurance."  Chris Messerly, a lawyer for 103 survivors, suggested that the settlement isn't for a huge amount compared to claims against others with a role in the disaster.  Others include the engineers who respectively designed and inspected the bridge: Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc and URS Corp. The state's lawsuits against Jacobs and URS, and URS's countersuit against the state, are still pending.
