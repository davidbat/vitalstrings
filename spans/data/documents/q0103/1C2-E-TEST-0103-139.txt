MINNEAPOLIS  While divers searched the Mississippi river on Thursday for more bodies from the collapse of an Interstate freeway bridge, Gov. Tim Pawlenty and at least three other governors ordered an immediate inspection of critical bridges in their states.
In the aftermath of the incident, federal officials alerted states to immediately inspect all bridges similar to the Minneapolis bridge.
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters signed off on an advisory that was sent by the Federal Highway Administration urging state transportation departments to conduct inspections of bridges similar to the ill-fated steel-deck truss bridge.
There are 756 such spans, according to department spokesman Brian Turmail. He did not have a list of bridge locations.
"We don't know what caused this span to collapse, but the secretary wants to make sure that states are taking every possible precaution," said Turmail.
Questions about the cause of the collapse and whether it could have been prevented arose as authorities shifted from rescue efforts to a recovery operation, searching for bodies that may be hidden beneath the river's swirling currents.
Minnesota officials were warned as early as 1990 that the bridge that collapsed into the Mississippi River was "structurally deficient," yet they relied on patchwork repairs and stepped-up inspections that unraveled amid a thunderous plunge of concrete and automobiles.
"We thought we had done all we could," state bridge engineer Dan Dorgan told reporters not far from the mangled remains of the span. "Obviously something went terribly wrong."
At least five people were killed when the eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge collapsed Wednesday during rush-hour. The medical examiner's office confirmed early Friday that a fifth body had been pulled from the river overnight. Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan said more bodies remained in the river and the death toll would rise.
Dolan said that as many as 30 people were still unaccounted for and that the recovery effort was going to take several days. At least 60 people were injured.
The police chief described the desperation at the scene Wednesday night, as rescue workers struggled to remove victims from the river, about 64 feet below where the bridge had stood.
"There are some unbelievable testimonials and stories involving a number of those people … people who were pinned (under steel and concrete), people who were partly crushed who told emergency workers to 'say hello' (or) 'say goodbye' " to friends or relatives. "It was an amazing, amazing scene."
The steel-arched bridge, which was built in 1967, rose about 64 feet above the river and stretched about 1,900 feet across the water. The bridge was built with a single 458-foot-long steel arch to avoid putting any piers in the water that might interfere with river navigation.
The Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory database shows that the 40-year-old bridge was rated as "structurally deficient" two years ago and possibly in need of replacement.
A 2001 report by Minnesota's transportation department concluded the bridge would not have problems with "fatigue cracking" in the future, but it urged frequent inspections of the bridge's trusses.
Pawlenty said the state was never warned that the bridge needed to be closed or immediately repaired.
"There was no call by anyone that we're aware of that said it should be immediately closed or immediately replaced," Pawlenty told reporters. "It was more of a monitor, inspect, maintain, and potentially replace it in the future."
The governor said that he has directed state employees to conduct emergency inspections of bridges in the state in priority order, starting with bridges that have same sort of truss design or have been identified as "structurally deficient."
Other states also were spurred to take action:
•Iowa Gov. Chet Culver ordered a statewide review of bridges.
• Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich said his state will immediately inspect "critical bridges."
•Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano says her state will review conditions at "highly traveled bridges in large urban areas."
"While we have a rigorous inspection system that ensures the safety of our bridges in Illinois, a tragedy like this demands that we step up our efforts and do everything in our power to guarantee the safety of our bridge network," Blagojevich said, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Hundreds of area residents converged Thursday on St. Olaf Catholic Church in downtown Minneapolis for a prayer service in honor of the victims.
Mary Latterell, 42, attended with her 12-year-old daughter Brittany. "In our faith and belief, Mass is the strongest form of prayer. We wanted to be involved with that prayer," Latterell said. "It's our way of caring for our city."
Jim Koralesky, 63, who also attended the Mass, took the Interstate 35W bridge six times Wednesday before it collapsed. He was about to take it again a few minutes before 6 p.m. to go to Home Depot. But he said he ran into a friend in his parking lot and got involved in a conversation. After 15 minutes of chatting, he scuttled plans for his errand.
"It would have put me on that bridge around that time," he said. "Someone's looking out for me."
Meanwhile, recovery teams continued to battle strong currents to try to reach cars still submerged beneath in at least nine feet of water beneath the bridge, one of the city's main arteries.
"The bridge is still shifting," Dolan said. "We're dealing with the Mississippi River. We're dealing with currents. We're going to have to do it slowly and safely.
He said there were a number of vehicles, with bodies still in them, traped under huge slabs of concrete in the river.
"We know we do have more casualties at the scene," he said.
A long center section of concrete, sheared from the embankment at one end, rested in the middle of the river, with several cars still on it.
From the still-intact roadway on the embankment, steel beams were bent downward into the river, where cars, many of them crushed, rested partially submerged.
Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek said officials were treating the area as a crime scene until the cause of the accident could be determined but said, "All indications are a collapsing, not an act of someone doing it."
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived in Minneapolis on Thursday morning to begin an investigation.
NTSB chairman Mark Rosenker said the first step will be to recover pieces of the bridge and reassemble them to try to determine the causes of the collapse. Investigators also want to review videos of the collapse taken by nearby security cameras.
"It is clearly much too early in the initial stages of this investigation to have any idea what happened," Rosenker said.
Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for Progressive Contractors Inc., said there were 18 construction workers on the bridge repairing joints, guardrails and lights when it fell. One remained unaccounted for.
"They said they basically rode the bridge down to the water," he said. "They were sliding into cars and cars were sliding into them," he said.
Drivers recount collapse
Many drivers and passengers walked away unscathed after riding the bridge down on pieces of concrete roadway until it hit the river.
Peter Siddons, of White Bear Lake, Minn., said he was caught in bumper to bumper traffic on the bridge on his way home from work.
"The next thing I know I'm hearing these explosions and at the same time I see that the bridge is rocking and rolling and my car is being bucked so my back end is off the ground," he said.
"I saw were these sections going down in front of me and disappearing and coming towards me and then I dropped. I knew I was dropping off the bridge," he said. "At that time I thought, it's over. Next thing I know I hit a car that was in front of me and it stopped me. I waited and I thought there'll be another collapse here, is this it — and it didn't happen."
Siddons suffered only cuts and bruises. He scrambled from his car and heard screams from a school bus trapped on a section of roadway over the median and running in the opposite direction.
The bus carried about 60 children, some as young as five.
"Early responders were already there helping them. I went over towards the kids and by that time most of the kids were out," Siddons said. "I helped some over a fence onto land, then just tried to calm them down."
Anne Nicolai, 45, of Bloomington, Minn. also was driving across the bridge when it collapsed.
"I felt this vibration beneath me, but I didn't think much of it because there was construction going on," she said. "Then the big green directional signs that are over every highway were gone. They just disappeared and they were replaced by the same plume of smoke and debris that you saw at 9/11."
Next, the tall light standards "began toppling like toothpicks," she said, and realized the bridge was collapsing. Along with dozens of other drivers, Nicolai at first backed up her vehicle, then turned around and drove back off the bridge.
Jay Reeves, a Minneapolis paramedic, was driving on a street about 100 yards from the bridge at the time of the collapse. He pulled his car over to side and got out, then saw a school bus precariously tiled on a portion of the collapsed bridge behind semi-tractor trailer that was on fire.
"The only thing going through my mind was getting those people out," said Reeves, who heard the bridge groaning and the children on the bus screaming. Reeves said he whistled loudly to get the attention of the children on the bus and told them to walk out if they could. Volunteers helped get three people with non-critical injuries off the bus, he said.
Federal government jumps in to help
As state and federal officials rushed to the scene, Mary Peters, the Transportation secretary, flew here from Washington and pledged $5 million in federal funds to help restore traffic flow, clear debris and begin repair work.
"We in the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible," President Bush said Thursday after meeting with Cabinet officials.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said up to $100 million in federal funds will also be available for rebuilding and recovery. "A bridge in America just shouldn't fall down," Klobuchar said. "That's why we have called for this investigation."
Klobuchar and Minnesota's other senator, Republican Norm Coleman, said a full investigation of the collapse was mandatory to assure the safety of other bridges.
First lady Laura Bush planned to travel to Minneapolis on Friday to console the victims' families, White House spokesman Tony Snow said.
