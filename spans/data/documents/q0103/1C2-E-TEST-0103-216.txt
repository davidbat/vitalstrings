The I-35W Bridge was a deck-arch truss bridge that spanned the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was built in 1967 by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and collapsed on August 1, 2007.
The I-35W Bridge was notable for not having any piers in the water. Instead, the main support piers were located on the banks of the river, and were built of tubular-shaped concrete pillars. This allowed for a wide, clear span across the river, making river navigation easier. Although not very decorative, the bridge was one of the widest bridges in the Twin Cities area and provided an important link for Interstate 35W traffic. According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, 200,000 cars used the bridge per day.[1]The bridge was located close to downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Metrodome. (Wikipedia)
