Minnesota bridge collapse (CNN Breaking News)
Workers were repairing corroded joints when a Minneapolis bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River yesterday, killing at least four people and leaving more than 20 missing, state officials said.
“A bridge in America shouldn’t just fall down,” U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said in a news conference in Minneapolis. “We have to get to the bottom of this.”
As many as 50 cars plunged into the river as the six-story structure fell, authorities and eyewitnesses said. Divers are focusing on recovery rather than rescue, Minneapolis Fire Chief James Clack said. About 80 people were hurt.
