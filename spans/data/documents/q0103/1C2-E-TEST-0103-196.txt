The very first Which Wich restaurant has come to Minnesota.
The sandwich shop opened in Blaine this week at 1450 109th Avenue. It specializes in 100 percent customizable sandwiches.
The Minnesota location was opened by Minnetonka native Garrett Ebling, who called the business a “second opportunity to do life,” after narrowly surviving the 35W bridge collapse in August 2007.
On the day of the bridge collapse, Ebling was returning to his home in Minnetonka from a company party in Roseville when he missed an exit and ended up taking the bridge to avoid construction traffic. That’s when he felt the bridge shake and saw the cars in front of him disappear.
His car fell 110 feet into the Mississippi River, leaving him with internal bleeding, a fractured left arm, two broken ankles, a collapsed lung, a ruptured diaphragm, fractured vertebrae, a broken jaw, multiple broken facial plates, brain trauma, and a loss of smell. He was in the hospital for two months.
Ebling went through extensive physical and emotional therapy to put his life back together after the accident. When he was ready to work again, he decided he wanted to look into franchises, and he discovered Which Wich Superior Sandwiches in 2009.
The company first opened in Texas in 2003 and now has more than 200 locations. It’s gained popularity for its unique ordering system, where guests use markers to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. Customers check off what type of sandwich they want, choose the size, type of bread, cheese, spreads and vegetables. The sandwiches are then delivered in personalized sandwich bags.
Ebling opened the Blaine location this week. He is now a husband, father, and business owner.
