   Peggy Fisher, As Trustee for the Heirs and Next of Kin of Ryan Lee Fisher, Decedent, Appellant, Vs. County of Rock, Respondent. C6-97-2263, Supreme Court, July 15, 1999. (Minnesota State Law Library)
"A county is entitled to statutory immunity when its decision not to install guardrails at an existing bridge site where a fatal automobile accident occurred is based on both engineering and policy considerations."
"Because we conclude the county is entitled to statutory immunity, we do not reach Fisher's argument that failure to install approach guardrails at the bridge site falls within the maintenance exception to the statute of repose."
Ed. note: In light of the 35W bridge collapse, evidence summarized in the text of this opinion about standards for bridge replacement vs. funding of such replacement bear consideration.

"Citizens and government officials alike are concerned about the state of bridges in Minnesota after the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge into the Mississippi River on August 1st, 2007. Media accounts refer to MNDOT bridge inspection reports, Federal Highway Administration documents, and other documents that aren't always easily identifiable. This guide pulls together many of the reports being analyzed and discussed, along with general background information on bridge safety.
Librarians will be adding resources to the guide as the investigation continues and the issue unfolds."
