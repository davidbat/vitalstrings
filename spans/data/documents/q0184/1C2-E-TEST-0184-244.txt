It's June 1st, the kids are getting out of school and summer is just days away!  You will need your annual beach fix... the sand between your toes, ocean air and that great feeing of coming out of the ocean and warming up in the summer sun! Now is the perfect time to reserve your Ocean City vacation.  I still have some great weeks available!
Please come and enjoy our wonderful condo on 46th Street! It's perfect for your family!  Close to the beach, restaurants, Putt Putt, Amusements and shopping.
Salty Sands II is one of two buildings in the Salty Sands complex located along the north side of 46th Street. Our unit (102-2) is on the first floor and is 1/2 block from the beach.  There are no major roads to cross to get to the beach, only a small alley. No highway noise either!!!!
There are two entrances to the condo, one large sliding glass door that leads to a large balcony with views of the dunes and ocean to the east and Assawoman Bay to the west. The second entrance leads to parking and the beach. We have two covered parking spaces in the garage directly under our condominium.
The Kitchen is loaded, you won't need a thing and our Living room is comfortable and colorful. There are two bedrooms and two full baths.  The master bedroom has a Queen size bed and the 2nd bedroom has two sets of bunk beds. We take extremely good care of our condo and continue to upgrade as we can.  We have four children and have made our condo very inviting and kid friendly!
