Why is the ocean salty? Snooki really doesn’t know, but she explained why she doesn’t like the big body of water on this week’s episode of MTV ’s Jersey Shore . That’s right – the most popular reality show on TV can also be educational. Well, perhaps it can be educational.
Apparently Snooki had a boyfriend named Jeff who once wanted to take a dip in said ocean. However, tonight the Snook-ster actually informed the viewing audience (along with Jeff) that “I f---in' hate the ocean. Too much whale sperm. Everybody Google it, because that's why the water is salty. F---in' whale sperm.”
That’s right. Biology according to Jersey Shore – the ocean is salty because of whale sperm. Unfortunately, it seems that as believable as she was, Snooki was wrong about the reason for a salty ocean. Yes. You simply cannot believe everything you see and hear on TV.

The ocean is salty because the salt in the ocean comes from rocks on land. In fact, if the ocean’s salt was spread over land, then it would form a layer that is nearly 500 feet deep. That’s a little scary, but not as scary as whale sperm.
Do you watch Jersey Shore on MTV every Thursday at 9 p.m. on Cox channel 30 in Oklahoma City. The show is certainly a mainstay for many younger Oklahomans. What were your favorite moments from tonight’s episode (other than the interesting theory on why the ocean salty)?
