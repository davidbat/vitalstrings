There is no one simple explanation but you can point to a couple of major contributing factors.
Rivers dissolve some minerals as they run over the land and deposit those dissolved salts into the ocean.  Compared to the ocean, however, the salt concentration of rivers is very low...so low, in fact, that humans don't generally consider rivers to be salty at all.  If the oceans were just filled by incoming rivers their salinity would be similar to that of the rivers, but there are other processes at work.
Sunlight warms and evaporates ocean water, which then forms clouds and eventually falls as precipitation elsewhere.  Salt does not evaporate so evaporation of seawater concentrates the salt that's left behind.  This helps to explain how the oceans can be so much saltier than the rivers.
But if rivers carry salts into the sea, and then water evaporates, concentrating the salt, why isn't the ocean getting saltier all the time?  That's because salts are constantly being absorbed by living things as well as settling out of solution on the ocean floor.  So, the concentration of salt in the oceans remains nearly constant, at 35 parts per thousand.
Really, that's a very simple answer...there are much more complex things at work in balancing the salt concentration of the oceans.  Rather than write a book about them here, I'll just give you a nifty link.  Consider it an early Christmas gift!
