Why is the Ocean Salty
Not Ocean water but even rain water contains "Salts" but all water do not taste salty. Ocean water contains a lot of salt that if it spread in earth  it would form a layer more than 500 feet. But how this much salt comes into this sea.
The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This water becomes acidic and this acid chemically break down the rocks and carries salts and minerals along in a dissolved state as ions. This water through rivers reaches into the oceans. most of the ions were cleared by sea water but chloride and sodium make up over 90% of all dissolved ions in seawater. The water vaporizes into gas leaving these ions which increases the salinity concentration int water to a plus.  The saltiness of the ocean, or its salinity, is fairly stable at about 35 parts per thousand.
Lakes are in contact with the ground. do not feel salty because water is moving ? Ocean salts, however, have no place to go. "The ions that were put there long ago have to be here only." But then why Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea do not feel salty ? The reason may be because water often leaves lakes to continue its trip toward the sea.
