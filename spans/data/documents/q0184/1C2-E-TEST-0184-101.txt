dialx7: The ocean is so salty because as the water flows from inland streams and rivers, it picks up minerals along the way. As it flows into the ocean, the water is evaporated to some extent, but the salts never evaporate.  For more information see here: http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-...
