Snooki makes list of science-challenged celebs for ‘whale sperm’ comment

Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi.      (Elisabetta Villa - GETTY IMAGES) Snooki , the tiny-bodied, big-haired human famous for getting into drunken shenanigans on “ Jersey Shore ,” is being honored for one of her scientific theories — not in a good way.
The Sense About Science charitable trust has placed Snooki on its list of celebrities who showed loose, little or no grasp of scientific concepts in 2011.
Snooki, real name Nicole Polizzi, made the list for a theory she described on the MTV reality show about why the ocean is salty:
“I hate the ocean. It’s all whale sperm. Everybody Google it. Because that’s why the water is salty. From the [expletive] whale sperm.”
In fact, the saltiness “comes from many millions of years of water flowing over rocks and minerals,” according to oceanographer Simon Boxall.
Snooki is joined on the list by several other celebs, including actress Juliette Lewis, Fox’s Bill O’Reilly, TV’s Simon Cowell, singer Suzi Quatro and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann.
The fifth season of “Jersey Shore” premieres Jan. 5. Who knows what wildly inaccurate claim she’ll make this season!
