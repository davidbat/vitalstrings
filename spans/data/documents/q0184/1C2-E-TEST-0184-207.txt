Why Are Oceans Blue
Why is the ocean blue?
The ocean is blue because not only does the sea cut straight through                underwater salt mines making it salty but also it cuts right into                vast underground chlorine mines as well. These chlorine mines have                a similar effect the commercial product you can buy that makes your                pool blue. But because the ocean is deeper it appear bluer than                your pool.
 
 
 
In addition, the short anwer is that the Caribbean is host to the                largest underwater chlorine mines and thus the ocean is bluer in                the Caribbean than it is most other places on earth.
Why is the ocean blue - really?
The ocean is blue for reasons that are similar to why                the sky is blue . Sunlight collides with air molecules and scatters                blue light specials because the wavelength is short than the red                light district and thus scatters more.
Once this blue light passes through the atmosphere and strikes                the water molecules, thus taking a double hit, the blue light is                scattered even more than Scatman Caruthers and the ocean even appears                bluer than the sky. The ocean's water both reflects and intensifies,                lifts and separates the blue light.
