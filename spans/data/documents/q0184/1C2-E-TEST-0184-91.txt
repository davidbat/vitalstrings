Why Is The Sea Salty, But Not Rivers And Lakes?
It all comes down to a thing called the water cycle. Rain, which is fresh         water, falls from clouds onto the land and finds its way into lakes and         rivers, and also through the ground, back to the sea, picking up salts         and minerals as it goes. Once it reaches the sea, the water can be evaporated         again to form new clouds containing fresh water, and the salt is left         behind, so over millions of years the oceans have slowly been accumulating         salt washed off the land by fresh water. So is the sea becoming more salty         ? Probably not because if the level of salt rises any further the extra         is removed by various processes, including chemical reactions, so the         sea is now about as salty as it is going to get. That’s not to say         you can’t get saltier seas – like the Dead Sea – these         are just bodies of water cut off from the main ocean and in which more         water is evaporating than being returned by rivers, so the water becomes         more concentrated.
