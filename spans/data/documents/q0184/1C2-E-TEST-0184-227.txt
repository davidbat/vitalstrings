Q. Why is the ocean salty?
A. The saltiness of the sea comes from dissolved minerals,  especially sodium, chlorine, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, and potassium,  said Galen McKinley, a UW-Madison professor of atmospheric and oceanic  sciences.
Today's ocean salt has ancient origins. As the Earth formed,  gases spewing from its interior released salt ions that eventually  reached the ocean via rainfall or land runoff.
Now, the ocean's salinity is basically constant. "Ions  aren't being removed or supplied in an appreciable amount,"  McKinley said. "The removal and sources that do exist are so small  and the reservoir is so large that those ions just stay in â€¦
