Why is the sea salty?
Image a world where all water is drinkable... unfortunately this is far from being the case.
The salts of the seas and oceans (which compose 96% of water reserves) originate from volcanic activities that produced a few billion years ago, great quantities of water vapors, carbonic gases and chlorine.
Later on, the cooling of the earth provoked the condensation of these water vapors, and gigantic acid rain dissolved the natural minerals present in the earthâ€™s crust.
Moreover, these minerals are day after day continuously extracted from rocks by the rain. These elements accumulate in the sea and agglomerate with other elements to form crystals: sodium chloride, our famous kitchen salt.
By evaporating one liter of sea water we are left with 35 grams of salt.
