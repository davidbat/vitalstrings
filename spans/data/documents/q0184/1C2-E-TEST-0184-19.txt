This Internet site contains information from Herbert Swenson of the           U.S. Geological Survey regarding the chemical nature of ocean water.           We will explore much of this material in class but you will find it           helpful if you gather some of the information yourself and use the           class time as a time to review the information you have gathered.
1. How much saltier is sea water when compared to fresh         water?______________
2.
What are some of the sources of salts in the         ocean?
 
 
 
3. What does it mean to have a balanced salt budget? Is the ocean's         salt budget balanced?  Where do the incoming salts go?
 
 
 
 4. Do past accumulations of dissolved or suspended solids in         the ocean completely explain why the ocean is salty? What other process         contributes to saltiness?
