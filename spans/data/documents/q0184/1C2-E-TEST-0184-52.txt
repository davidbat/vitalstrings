Bite-size answers to commonly asked questions from inquiring minds
 
Q. Why is the sea salty? Why aren’t rivers?
 
Did you know?
 
Sea turtles ‘cry’ to remove salt. They have special glands next to their eyes which     produce salty discharge.
 
17% of salt used in the USA is for deicing roads. Just 6% is used in food (source:     Listverse.com).

A. Why is the sea salty? Well, on average, seawater is made up of around 3.5% salt     and other minerals (so the oceans are 96.5% water, 3.5% salt). Most of this is the     ordinary table salt (sodium chloride) we use every day. So where does it all come     from?
 
It is believed that minerals from within the Earth seeped into the seas through vents     in the ocean floor (through the crust of the Earth in effect) when the oceans were     first formed. Today, rivers and streams continually carry salt and other minerals     to the ocean as land rocks get gradually eroded by water and the weather. When water     evaporates from the sea (to fall again later as rain) the salt within the water is     left behind where it concentrates. In addition, winds also carry particles which     get deposited into the water and decomposed organisms also add some salinity.
 
The amount of salt in our seas has remained pretty consistent for a long time now,     despite the ongoing flow of minerals from rivers etc. This is because some of the     salt gets removed when it hits the sea bed (one theory is that it moves or gets forced     back under our land masses).
 
So why aren’t our rivers salty? Well, river water and streams can contain a small     amount of salt but because there’s only a trace, we can’t really taste it. Rivers/streams     are rushing or moving waters so salts don’t tend to accumulate or concentrate.
