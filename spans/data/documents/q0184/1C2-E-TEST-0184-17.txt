This review is from: I Wonder Why the Sea is Salty: And Other Questions About the Oceans (Paperback)
Honestly, I love these books. I bought them on a 4 for 3 special, and couldn't be happier. I am not one to buy books full price either, but these are so perfect for my 5 and 7 year olds I was happy to do it. Our kids are always asking questions, 'why this' and 'why that' and this book series seems to feed their need for answers. The pictures are really sketches, but nicely done and not cartoonish. I actually enjoy reading these to them because I am learning things myself! I could not recommend these books more, a perfect gift for a curious child.
