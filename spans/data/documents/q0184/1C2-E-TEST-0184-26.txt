cyneitha: There is freshwater and then there is salt water.  Mostly everyone already knows that the ocean is a source of salt water, but have you ever wondered why?  You can find more information here: http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salt...

dialx7: The ocean is salty from the erosion over time of rocks that had the mineral salt in them. These rocks pass through the waters, and even when the water is evaporated, the salt stays in the ocean.  Look here for more information: http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salt...
