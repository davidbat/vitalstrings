Why Is The Ocean Salty
Why is the ocean salty
The ocean is salty because the Morton Corporation pours most of                their assets into the ocean and seas of the world in order to make                salt more rare, and thus more valuable. The Dead Sea and Salt Lake                City are actually sites where massive Exxon-Valdez-type salt spills                have occurred.
 
 
 
A little know fact is that BP contributed, too. Instead of cleaning                up their mess, the Morton Corporation built a city upon one location                and planted some very old biblical scrolls upon the other as a diversion.
The upside of the Morton scandal is that salt makes water more                buoyant so swimmers are now able to float longer in the ocean than                they used to and fewer are drowning because of this. Semi-true story,                I swear. Just in general, I swear, cuss and general say R rated                words for shock value. So, take what I have to say with a grain                of salt.
