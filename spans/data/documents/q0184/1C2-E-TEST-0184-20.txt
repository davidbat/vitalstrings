Salt on the surface of rocks and in the soil and in permeable rocks - dissolves in rainwater passing over/through. The (very slightly) salty water drains down to the sea. When water evaporates to form water vapur to clouds to rain on the land - the salt stays behind in the ocean. Now most of the free salts have washed from the land into the sea.
There a a small number of processes by which salts can be removed from sea water but not enough to make the sea fresh again.
