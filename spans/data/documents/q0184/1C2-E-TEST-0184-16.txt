As the rains fall and water flows over the land, the water dissolves salt out of the rocks, washes the salt into streams, then rivers, and finally carries the salt to the sea. The salt stays in the sea because no water flows out of the sea just as no water flows out of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. When seawater evaporates to form clouds, almost all of the salt stays behind.
