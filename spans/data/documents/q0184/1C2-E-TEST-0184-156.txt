Jersey Shore : Why is the ocean salty?, Sammi and Ronnie break up
"Jersey Shore" star Snooki encouraged fans to "google" the reason the ocean is so salty, claiming that all of the "whale sperm" has something to do with it. Of course, fans whipped out their laptops and got right to work. Meanwhile, Sammi and Ronnie were in the middle of breaking up, again, as Pauly D invited his stalker into the house.
"Jersey Shore is mindless entertainment ," tweeted one Cleveland fan. There's never a dull moment at Seaside Heights, especially when Snooki's involved. She found a new man, who later slipped up by telling Snooki about his former serious relationship. Snooki of course backed off, not taking his phone calls. All the while, Snooki insisting that the ocean is salty due to the "whale sperm." Which, isn't true . The ocean is salty due to the rocks from the land.
