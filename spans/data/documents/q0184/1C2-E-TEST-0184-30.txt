14) Why is the ocean salty?
Sea water is about 220 times saltier than fresh lake water. Doing a little math, all the salt in the ocean weighs more 100 million times the combined mass of every single person on the planet. That’s a fair amount of salt. But where does it all come from?
Rain water is slightly acidic; the ever-so-infamous carbon dioxide found in the air reacts with water to form weak carbonic acid. Falling rain both physically erodes rocks (from the impact of droplets) & also chemically breaks them down (from the acid). The broken down rock is then carried by the water as dissolved ions (i.e. salts such as: sodium & chloride) & with the aid of gravity, flows into rivers & ultimately, the ocean.
But why, you may ask, is the ocean salty while rivers & lakes remain fresh? Well keen & curious reader, there is an answer! Rivers & lakes have a relatively quick residency time. Water flowing in (& also dissolved ions), flows out again within about 200 years in lakes, compared to 100-200 million years in the ocean. Also, as water evaporates from the oceans surface, dissolved ions remain behind, slowly increasing salinity over time.
Other natural processes, may alter the amount of salt in the ocean. Some of which include:
- Hydrothermal vents & under-water volcanoes, releasing new sources of ions.
- The melting & freezing of ice-caps.
- Geographical location. Salinity levels are lower near river mouths & the polar seas.
- Marine organisms. Oysters & clams use calcium from the sea to help build their shells.
Lakes with no escape to rivers or the ocean may also have increased salinity. The Dead Sea’s salt concentration for example, with no outlet streams, is more than 8 times that of the ocean!
Simply: Dissolved & eroded rocks.
