Answer:
The salt in our oceans is the result of millions of years of minerals leaching and dissolving from the solid earth. The major portion comes from rivers, while a good quantity of the salts are dissolved from rocks and sediments below the ocean floor, through volcanic vents. The weather is also responsible, to a lesser degree, as the rain deposits mineral particles into the oceans.
The sun's heat distills or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea, leaving the salts and minerals behind. The water returns to the ocean, via rivers or precipitation, to wash down more salt, which becomes ever more concentrated. This process is part of the continual exchange of water between the Earth and the atmosphere that is called the hydrological or water cycle.
Another explanation
Rain water, or precipitation, is slightly acidic due to dissolved compounds. When this acidic water beats down on the land and rocks, they end up dissolving the minerals in the rocks and return them to the water. The minerals are salt compounds - not just sodium chloride. A salt is any ionic compound (metal and a nonmetal), such as calcium chloride or magnesium chloride. The salt(s) then flow down rivers and streams to their final destination in the oceans, where they remain. Over the course of millions of years, this salt has accumulated to be a substantial component of the oceans.
