Most lakes have water flowing out of them as well as into them.  Most of the salt and other minerals carried by the incoming water are carried out by the outgoing water.  The oceans, the Great Salt Lake, the Dead Sea, and some others have no water flowing out.  The only way for water to leave is by evaporation, leaving the salt and other minerals behind.  Over time, the mineral concentration increases.
