Perhaps it is over billion of years of evolution. Salt is one major solvent in sea water. We know through rainfall, all forms of solvents are being washed off from the surfaces of the earth.  Rain water now a the solution are being drained to sea and into oceans.  When the cycle of evaporation, due to sun rays, takes place only pure water is being extracted from all water surfaces. They formed into clouds, get condensed and fall back onto earth and ocean again and again. This cycle had been an on going process throughout time. Thus making the ocean water really salty.
