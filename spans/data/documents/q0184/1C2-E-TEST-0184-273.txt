Sea Water, Freezing of
The density of ocean water is determined by its salinity (or salt content) and temperature. The saltier and/or colder the water       is, the denser it is. Salt water is most dense at its freezing point,       unlike fresh water, which is most dense at about 3.9°C (39.0°F).       Oceans are highly stratified: deep ocean water is heavy, and the lighter       water is on top. This often is not the case in the atmosphere: warm air       near the ground surface is lighter than the overlying air it displaces,       resulting in unstable conditions and thunderstorms.
The stratified, stable nature of oceans is important because otherwise       there would be no sea ice , nor would there be warm tropical seas. Tropical oceans are       temperature-stratified: a thermocline separates the warm, light water on top from the frigid deep waters. Polar       oceans, on the other hand, are salinity-stratified: the salinity is       slightly lower on top, especially in the Arctic and near the estuaries of large rivers such as the MacKenzie in Canada and the Ob in Russia.       This fresh-water outflow will stay on top of the Arctic Ocean and mix only       very slowly, because it is lighter. Instead of a thermocline, there is a       halocline, a layer in which the salinity changes rapidly with depth. *
Salty water freezes below 0°C (32°F): this is why salt is used       to melt the snow or ice on a road pavement. The saltier the brine , the lower its freezing point. This is also why salt traditionally was       added to the water–ice mixture used to make ice cream.
Ocean water with a typical salinity of 35 parts per thousand freezes only       at −1.8°C (28.9°F). So if there were no halocline in the       polar oceans, then the cooled top ocean layer, being denser, would sink       into the deep ocean, in the same way as thunderstorm clouds rise in the       atmosphere, and the entire ocean column would have to cool to −1.8°C before its surface could freeze.
Formation of Sea Ice
As sea water freezes, salt is excluded, because salt has a different         crystalline structure: it forms cubic crystals (with four sides) whereas         ice is hexagonal, or six-sided. (A close look at tiny snowflakes will         reveal their hexagonal form.) So pockets of brine form within the ice;         they refuse to freeze, because of the high salinity. The brine then         slowly leaches out of the bottom of the forming ice and drips into the         ocean below. Thus sea ice, when melted, is considerably fresher than the         original sea water from which it formed. This brine rejection process         creates dense water below the ice surface. This layer of dense water may         sink to the bottom of the ocean. Furthermore, this
Ice floes and other forms of sea ice are less salty than the sea             water from which they formed, owing to a process known as brine             rejection. Yet sea ice still is too salty to be melted for human             consumption. Only icebergs, which are derived from glaciers, are             composed of fresh-water ice.
process of "deep-water formation" is an exception to the         normally stratified nature of oceans.
The salt enrichment is most effective when it occurs in a thin layer on         a calm sea. The faster sea ice is frozen, the less salt that can escape.         For instance, when frozen at an air temperature of −40°C         (−40°F), the salinity of the ice is about 10 percent. But         when frozen at an air temperature of −6°C (21°F), the         salinity of the ice is only about 4 percent. Such ice is fresh enough to         use as drinking water; in fact, in spring, polar bears often drink the         water in melting ponds on ice.
When sea ice melts in the summer, the meltwater forms a relatively fresh         surface layer that lies above the saltier ocean water, maintaining the         halocline, and allowing easier freezing the next winter.
