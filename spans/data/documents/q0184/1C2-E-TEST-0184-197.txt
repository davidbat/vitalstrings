Why are oceans salty?
The oceans contain around 97%         of the Earth's water supply. Oceans cover about 70% of the Earth's surface.
As water flows through rivers,         it picks up small amounts of mineral salts from the rocks and soil of         the river beds. This very-slightly salty water flows into the oceans         and seas. During evaporation only the water in the oceans leaves, but         the salt remains dissolved in the ocean - it does not evaporate. So the         remaining water gets saltier and saltier as time passes.
