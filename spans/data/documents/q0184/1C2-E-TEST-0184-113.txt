seawater is water from a sea or ocean On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5%, or 35 parts per thousand (also expressed 35â€° or 35 ppt). This means that every 1 kg of seawater has approximately 35 grams of dissolved salts(mostly, but not entirely, the ions of sodium chloride).
