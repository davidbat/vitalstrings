Edit
When it rains, the rain water washes over rocks etc and erodes very small particles of it (salt crystals) which are then carried along the waterways to the sea. The water from the sea evaporates as per the natural cycle of water and forms clouds and then rain again and the process starts over. When the water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind as the temperature required for water to evaporate isn't as high as the temperature needed to turn a salt into a gas. The salt is therefore left behind making the sea salty. The reason why the sea doesn't become super salty is because of the influx of fresh water that is always flowing into it and the salt crystals sinking to the bottom of the ocean and becoming part of new rocks. There are stretches of open water that are highly concentrated with salt crystals because the water is evaporating and not being replenished with any fresh water. Â  more
