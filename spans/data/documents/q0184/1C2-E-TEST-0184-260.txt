Geena Davis: Witch of the Armed Forces
Fine... I'll watch your show this week, you salty seductress. I'll watch it with one eye open in case you zap me with your sexy president gaze. You think your gaze will lower taxes and gas prices? You think people have forgotten that you were in the orginal cast of " Buffalo Bill ?" No one has. Be careful, Davis.  I'm closer then you thin-

HAGS CAN READ
If AM New York didn't publish an "Animal Report" daily, I wouldn't have known that...
"a Florida woman has been arrested for padding her bra with a stolen rare parrot. Jill Knipsel (35) hid the Greenwing parrot in her bra and tried to trade the bird for a vintage car. However, it turned out that the car's owner is friends with the man who owns the rare bird. After DNA tests confirmed the bird's identity, Knipsel was charged with grand theft." (AP)
