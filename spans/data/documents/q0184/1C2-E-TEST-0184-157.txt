“Why the Sea is Salty”
Personally, I thought this was pretty good for an old animation. I’m used to old cartoons with the cartoonish-movements & Betty Boop style of that time period. It’s cool to see something that wasn’t turned into yet another “Tazuka-inspired anime”. I wish more anime was made in this semi-realistic/ukiyo-e woodblock style!
If you enjoy old classic anime inspired from Japanese folktales, I also recommend the movie “ Taro the Dragon Boy “.
