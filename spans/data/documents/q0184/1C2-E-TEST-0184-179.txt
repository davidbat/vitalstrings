Why is the ocean salty? 3rd Grade Science Experiment
Why is the ocean salty? The 3rd graders finished their Ocean Unit to see why the ocean was so salty. We added 4 tablespoons of salt, 1 cup of water, used a cooking pot and a stove to boil the water.
Here is the salt and the water mixed together.
At first it appears that the salt is evaporating with the water, but as the water continues to boil the salt stays at the bottom of the pot.
The students learned that the water was changing to another form of matter called steam or gas.
The result was that the salt stayed in the pan and did not evaporate.
