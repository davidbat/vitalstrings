Why are the Oceans Salty?
Glad you asked...
The oceans are salty because water runs down hill and collect salt as it flows over the land. This water ends up in the ocean. When water is evaporated into the air, it leaves the salt behind. Over time, this leaves a lot of salt in the water that is at the lowest point on the planet. That is the oceans.  You can find more information here: http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salt...

Then again, this answer might help you...
The salt in the ocean comes from the rocks on the land.  The rain comes down on the rocks and erodes tiny particles that wash off into the ocean.  Inside these tiny particles is the salt, and that's why there's salt in the ocean.  You can find more information here: http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/whyoceansal...
