If you can answer these questions,      you have prepared well for the first class test. All that remains to be done      is to be able to write 50-75 word answers, with sketches and concept maps,      as and when appropriate.
 
Can you name the 4 different kinds of sediments          and tell a bit about the origin of each?
Sediments have been called “the memory of the          ocean.”  Is it a long memory?  About how old are the oldest marine          sediments?
How is heat different from temperature?
What comprises a water molecule?  What are the          differences between covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds?
What is heat capacity?  Is there anything unusual          about water’s heat capacity?
What happens when water freezes?  Boils?
What is meant by “latent” heat? Can you explain          the latent heat of fusion? How about the latent heat of evaporation?          Will global warming melt Greenland ice faster, or slower, than          evaporating the tropical waters?
Remember “density stratification?”  Can you think          of how seawater might be density stratified?  (Hint:  think of the          effects of heat and salinity on seawater’s density.)
What’s a SOFAR layer?  Does sound travel faster or          slower in one?  Why is it a Big Deal?
What colors of light penetrate deepest into the          ocean?  What limits that penetration?
What’s the “photic zone?” What’s a thermocline?  A          halocline?  A pycnocline?
What carries most of the heat between the equator          and the polar regions?  (If this heat were not redistributed, the ocean          would boil at the equator and freeze at the poles.)
What’s average ocean salinity?  What are the most          important ions dissolved in water to make seawater?
Why is seawater salty? Could these salts have come          from the land? Could water on Earth be of terrestrial origin?          Extraterrestrial? What are the evidences?
What causes the seasons?
Can gases dissolve in seawater?  Where does the          ocean’s oxygen and carbon dioxide come from?
How fast does Earth rotate eastward? What is          Coriolis effect?  How does it work, and which way does it go in the          northern hemisphere? In the southern hemisphere?
What are the general wind patterns of Earth?  Could you draw them?   Could you label the major winds?
If I put you at some random place on Earth’s          surface, could you predict (roughly) where the winds would be coming          from?
What is a tropical cyclone? Why is our Atlantic          coast vulnerable to them? Why not the Pacific coast? Why does our          hurricane season last from April through November?
What about ocean currents?  What causes them?  What influences their direction of flow?
Do you know what a gyre is?  How many gyres are in          the world ocean? How is a western boundary current different from an          eastern boundary current? Which surface currents are the fastest?  The          warmest?  The coldest?
Do ocean currents          have anything to do with weather along the U.S. west coast?  If so, what          influence do they have?
Can a wind wave ever be in shallow water?  (Stated          better:  Can a wind wave ever be considered a shallow water wave?)
Can a tsunami ever be in deep water?  (Stated          better:  Can a tsunami ever be considered a deep water wave?)
Which ocean waves move fastest?  Is there a          relationship between wavelength and wave speed?
Can you name the parts of an ocean wave (crest,          trough, height, period)?
What’s the “fetch?”  Which ocean basin has the          greatest potential fetch?
Why do the waves break on reaching the shore? Does          the geometry of shoreline affect how the waves break?
 What’s          a tsunami like in the open sea, away from land?  What happens when a tsunami comes ashore?  Could you surf a          tsunami?
What causes ocean tides?  Which has the greatest          effect:  sun or moon or Jupiter?
How is a spring tide different from a neap tide?          What are diurnal, semidiurnal and mixed tides? The California coastline          has mixed tides: can we have diurnal tides sometimes? Semidiurnal?
