The Dead Sea is the lowest place on earth and one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, 6 to 10 times saltier than the Atlantic Ocean.  Because the salt creates such a harsh living environment, the only organisms that will survive in the Dead Sea are bacteria and algae.  Any fish that accidentally swims into the Dead Sea from one of the freshwater streams that feed it, like the Jordan River, would die instantly!
The sea is so salty because of evaporation.  The high temperatures and low humidity in the region cause the water in the sea to evaporate very quickly, leaving behind all the dissolved mineral salts.  Some salts sink to the bottom and some wash ashore leaving a salty crusty beach.

Because of the high concentration of mineral salts in the Dead Sea, the water is more dense than both freshwater and the human body.  This means that our bodies become buoyant, like a cork, and we can easily float on it.  When you take a dip in the Dead Sea you can actually kick back and read a book like floating on a raft.  In fact, it is hard to actually “swim” in the sea.

The Dead Sea has been a tourist attraction since the time of Herod the Great in the 1st Century BCE.  The Dead Sea isn’t just a novelty for “fun while floating” but the mineral salts have been used in Egyptian mummification, in agricultural fertilizers and even in modern day cosmetics.
