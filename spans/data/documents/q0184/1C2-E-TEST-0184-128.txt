Gary Massoth chemical oceanographer
Gary Massoth describes a journey of discovery along the margins of the Pacific plate and explains why the sea is salty. Mid-ocean ridges are the single largest continuous geological feature of our planet. These ridges lie beneath another predominant planetary feature, the ocean. This talk traces an eye opening trip along the margins of the Pacific plate and reassesses why the sea is salty.
Gary Massoth's research focus has been to assess the effects of deep sea hydrothermal discharge on the chemistry of the oceans, including the design and robust exercise of chemical instruments for sampling and analysis.
