On last night’s episode of Jersey Shore, our pint-sized quote machine Snooki told audiences all over the world that she wouldn’t go into the ocean because it was salty from all the whale sperm . What? Don’t believe her? Google it.No really, she’s asking you to Google it. So we did. Apparently Snooki gets all her info from Urbanlegends.com , the top hit for “Whale Sperm Ocean.”
This is definitely Snooki’s watershed “ chicken or fish of the sea ” moment, and she’ll be joining Jessica Simpson in the Hall Of Fame For People Who Are Dumb About The Ocean. But are we ready to give her the prize for the dumbest thing ever said on Jersey Shore? Lets take a look at some of the other priceless quotes from the past three seasons before deciding.
1. “This situation is indescribable. You can’t even describe the situation that you’re about to get into the situation.” – The Situation
2. “I would send her a picture of my c*ck and a pack of bubble gum and say, chew on this!” – Ronnie
3. “I am so excited because we are going to see the crocadillies.” – Snooki
4. “Ronnie’s new nickname is IFF. The I’m F*%ked Foundation. He’s a client and the president!” – Pauly D.
5. “Tall, completely jacked, steroids, like, multiple growth hormones … that’s the type I’m attracted to.” – JWOWW
