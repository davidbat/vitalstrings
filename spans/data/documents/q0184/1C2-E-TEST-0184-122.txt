The ocean is salty primarily because of erosion and runoff from land.  The major ions in seawater are chloride, sodium, magnesium, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium.  These six ions make up 99% of sea salts, and of them, the first two are in greatest concentration (85% of total dissolved salts).  The ocean was at first "fresh", but it has become salty over the past 3.5 billion years.  Other ways that salt has been added to the ocean over time are at hydrothermal vents, aerosols such as lead (from cars) CFC's and other "greenhouse" gases  and bromine (from volcanoes).  However, the average salinity of the ocean now remains constant (at around 35 ppt) due to removal of salts at hydrothermal ventws, sea spray, evaporation ponds, and organisms who use some of the salts to make their shells.
