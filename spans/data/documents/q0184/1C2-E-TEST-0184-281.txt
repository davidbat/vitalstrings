Hi,
Which sea is more salty Dead sea or red sea. I also want to compare their salinity.
Urgent.

Answer
I don't know for sure, but I would expect it would be the Dead Sea.  It's a landlocked saltwater sea with a high rate of evaporation, which would lead to an extremely high salinity.
The Red Sea, on the other hand, is just a finger leading off the Indian Ocean.  Since it's long and narrow, with a small mouth, I would expect the salinity to be a little bit higher than the Indian Ocean, but not significantly so, as tidal action would create mixing that would keep the salinity stable.
