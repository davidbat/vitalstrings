Why is it that the seas and oceans of the world are salty, and known as salt water, but lakes and rivers are not salty, and known as fresh water? If they both contain water, how can there be a difference as big as that?
The way to answer this question is first to call to mind the water cycle. This sees water evaporate from the sea into the sky to form clouds. These clouds produce rain which sees the same water falling back down to the Earth. The water finds its way back to water sources, such as rivers, which then makes its way back to the ocean again. And so it is that this cycle continues and continues.
The reason that the sea is salty is because as the water passes through the land it picks up minerals along the way, and salts too. These travel into the ocean, but cannot be evaporated and so remain in the water of the sea. This process has taken millions of years of slow salt accumulation, and scientists believe that the total amount of salt in the sea is around 50 quadrillion tonnes.
Salt is actually a blanket term of a variety of natural chemicals which are found in the ocean. It is believed that there are roughly seventy types of chemicals in the ocean, all occurring at different concentrations in different locations. The salts are believed to originate from in the earlier days of the world, from the erosion and cracking of rocks and mountains, which was then transported by the rivers into the ocean. Other sources also include the sea bed and the rocks beneath this which would also contain salts. Also suggested is that salts were released through volcanic vents in the sea floor. Of course, all of this happened a long time ago but the salt has been collected over time to give the sea the salty taste that it is recognised for.
