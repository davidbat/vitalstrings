Dear Tom,
I presume the oceans, which cover most of the Earth, are the primary source of moisture for rain. The oceans are salty, so why is rainwater always fresh?

Dear Michael,
The Earth's water is constantly on the move, evaporating into the atmosphere and then returning as rain or snow. It's an ongoing process known as the hydrologic cycle. About 95 percent of the world's precipitation originates as moisture that evaporated from the oceans. However, salt in seawater is merely dissolved in the water, not chemically bound to it; the salt remains behind when water evaporates. Only pure water returns to the atmosphere.
Seaside inhabitants know that air blowing in from the oceans contains salt particles and, surprisingly, it's for the same reason the oceans are salty. When airborne droplets of salty ocean spray evaporate, the salt left floating in the air.
