Why          is the sea salty?
Grade          Level: K-3
Overview In preparing for an ocean unit, do a 'K W L' organizer. 'K' is for what          we know about the ocean. 'W' is for what we want to learn about the ocean.          'L' is for what we have learned about the ocean. The following lesson          was developed because the students wanted to know why the ocean is salty.
Purpose For students to observe how salt concentration increases in water. Also,          how the salt remains after the water evaporates.
Objectives Students will be able to:
i. Demonstrate that salt can make        water salty.
ii. Explain why the sea is salty.
Resources/Materials
Rock salt, water, containers, strainers.
Activities          and Procedures
i. Make the children pour water over        the rock salt which is contained in a strainer. The water plus dissolved        salt will be collected in a plastic cup. Students will taste the water sample.
ii. Heat the salty water and allow        the water to evaporate. Observe that the salt remains.
iii. The above procedure is repeated over a 3 or 4 day period. The students          will observe that the salt increases each time new salt water is added.
Tying          it all together
Students will do a Saltwater Painting to once again observe the evaporation          process. Mix warm water, salt, and food coloring. Paint pictures with          the mixture on white paper. Let it dry. The water evaporates, but the          salt remains, creating beautiful pictures.
Assessment
What do the children think is the difference between: River water and          sea water?
Suggestions/Modifications
Students may trace the origins of the table salt that is used in food,            i.e. what is the process that brings the salt from the earth to the            table.
Students may try to discover why the salt will stay in the water            and not separate from it without heat.
Students may explore all of the different ways salt is used.
