Why are the sky and the ocean blue?
Question #44108. Asked by Hamlet.. (Feb 07 04 9:20 AM)
Hamlet.
The ocean usually appears blue - 1. It reflects the sky, 2. Water absorbs low frequency light infared, red, and some orange.  And reflects yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet...the overwhelming amounts of reflected, high frequency light results in a blue colored body of water.
The sky is blue because of scattering - when white light encounters the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the earth's atmosphere, the high frequency section of the white light strikes the orbiting atoms of the nitrogen and oxygen, which causes the high frequency light to be scattered in all directions.
The high frequency light scattered by the molecules in the air are the violet, indigo, and blue colors of white light.  These are the colors reflected by the atoms in the atmosphere, and therefore are the colors that we see in the sky.
