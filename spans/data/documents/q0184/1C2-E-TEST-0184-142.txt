How Salty Is the Ocean?
Salinity measures how much salt something contains per thousand parts, and in the case of the ocean, its salinity is 3.5, meaning that if you took 1,000 liters of seawater and drained out all the water, you'd be left with about 35 liters of salt.
Salt Through Weathering
When slightly acidic rainwater falls to the earth, it's constantly trying to get back to the ocean. On its way there -- through the soil, through rocks -- it slowly disintegrates rocks and other minerals, picking up salt ions that it carries with it in a process called "weathering."
Salt Through Eruptions
The eruption of underwater volcanoes and the activity at hydrothermal vents also add salt to the ocean. When rocks dissolve under these extremely hot conditions, the minerals of which they were composed are released into the ocean. In the case of above-ground volcanoes, the broken-down constituents of the rock are sometimes carried to the ocean by the wind or rainwater.
