is the 2nd saltiest body of water and the deepest salt lake in the world.
3 million years ago, the area was repeatedly flooded with waters from the
Red Sea
. As the years went by, the waters collected and formed a narrow, crooked bay that wound through what is now the
Jezreel
Valley
. The floods were sporadic through centuries of climate change and contributed to many geologic changes. Approximately 1 million years later, the land rose in such a way that the ocean could no longer flood the area, and the existing water stayed - this area became a lake, and what is now known as the
Dead Sea
.
In terms of climate, the area mostly remains sunny, dry and warm year-round, with skies relatively clear and low in pollution. The unique conditions and climate make the
Dead Sea
a popular center for wellness and health, and the area offers many treatments that are 100% natural including Climatotherapy, Heliotherapy, Thalassotherapy, and Balneotherapy. Climatotherapy offers theraputic benefits through the local weather and climate; Heliotherapy takes advantage of the sunlight in the area; Thalassotherapy is based upon the simple practice of bathing in the salt-rich water of the
Dead Sea
; Balneotherapy is a treatment involving the mineral-filled mud from the
Dead Sea
People have studied and enjoyed the
Dead Sea
since the beginning of civilization. Jesus and John the Baptist were closely connected to the
Dead Sea
and the surrounding areas. It is mentioned twice in the bible, and in both instances it is predicted to come alive, so to speak - prophecies claim that the
Dead Sea
will one day be inhabitable by fish and plant life. The ancient Greeks recognized its magesty as well - Aristotle wrote about it; during the Egyptian conquest Cleopatra reportedly requested that land around the
Dead Sea
be reserved for cosmetic factories; the Nabateans discovered certain elements that would later be used in Egyptian embalming and mummification practices.
King Herod saw the area as a wonderful retreat, and built fortresses and palaces along the Western shores. The Essenes settled here as well, and later, in the 20th century, their writings were discovered and named the "Dead Sea Scrolls". The region attracted Greek Orthodox monks, who built monasteries there as places of worship and pilgrimage. Bedouin tribes have continuously lived in the area for thousands of years and could be considered the "natives of the land".
The beginnings of the
are told of often in the Islamic tradition. The
Dead Sea
was the home of
Lot
(Prophet Lut) in the Hebrew scriptures. His tribe was known to partake in homosexual activities and therefore punished by Allah - in a big way. Allah sent angels down to Lut, and they raised the land around the prophet's tribe before throwing it down into the ground again, causing the area to cave in. This area became the lowest land on earth, and it is where the sinners were destroyed and the followers were saved.
The
is still quite popular, as tourism has been booming there since the 1960's. The
Dead Sea
is home to the world's lowest road, Highway 90, which runs approximately 390 m below sea level. There are golf courses, retreats, and resorts. People come from all over the world to admire the natural beauty of the sea, to swim and soak in the salty waters, and to feel the healing effects of this beautiful body of water. The history of the Dead Sea really is quite an interesting story.
