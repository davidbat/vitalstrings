About         the Dead Sea
What's so special about the Dead Sea?
The waters of the Dead Sea contain 21         life-essential minerals such as potassium, bromide and magnesium.  Many of these minerals are found in no other sea or ocean.
The Dead Sea         distinguishes itself from the earth's most bountiful sources by its         lavish contents. In fact, this body of water contains 10 times more salts         and minerals than the Mediterranean Sea, which is one of the richest,         most fertile locations on the planet. These salts and minerals are         recognized worldwide for their amazing therapeutic, nourishing and         activating abilities.
Time is typically considered something that opposes us.  In its course, our bodies become depleted from many life-essential         minerals. This results in an acceleration of the aging process. Premature         wrinkles, aches and pains, age spots and tiredness are a few of the         resulting effects. Though, ironically, it is time itself which had         enriched the Dead Sea with so many minerals and other rejuvenating         essentials as well as its unique position of being the lowest inhabited         location on earth (1,312 feet below sea level).
Since before the days of Cleopatra, people have traveled to         the Dead Sea to soak up its minerals and heal their ailments. Even         Cleopatra herself was reportedly enamored with the Dead Sea's amazing         health benefits and used its distinctive minerals for her legendary         beauty treatments.
Why is it called         the Dead Sea?
It's called the Dead Sea because nothing lives in it.         There is no seaweed or moss that collects on the bottom or any fish or         creatures living in or near the water. As a matter of fact, what you'll         see on the shores of the Dead Sea is white crystals of salt covering         EVERYTHING.
The salts found in the Dead Sea are mineral salts, just like         any other ocean except these salts are extremely concentrated. The water         in the Dead Sea is so concentrated that it is considered deadly to all         living things EXCEPT humans. We can swim in the Dead Sea just like any         other body of water except people don't really "swim", we float! Because         the Dead Sea is extremely concentrated with dissolved mineral salts, the         water density is much greater thhn any other body of salt water including the         ocean. So instead of swimming in the Dead Sea, you just float on top of         the water like a cork.
 
How did the Dead Sea form?
In this part of the world there is a rift forming where two crustal plates              are spreading apart. The East Rift Valley runs through most of Africa, but              it starts north of the Dead Sea and runs south along the eastern side of              the continent. The Sea is located right along the Rift Valley where the              Earth's crust is being stretched thin.
To get an idea of how this "crustal              spreading" occurs, take a bar of taffy and try to pull it apart. You'll              see where the candy starts to stretch it gets really thin just before it              breaks. That's what is happening to the Earth's crust in the Rift Valley.              Where the Earth's crust gets thin that part of the surface sinks lower.              The Dead Sea is still sinking lower even today. Scientists estimate the Dead              Sea sinks an average of 13 inches each year. On a geologic time scale              that's incredibly fast!
Why is the Dead Sea so salty?
Approximately three million years ago the Mediterranean Sea penetrated the              East Rift Valley, emptying seawater into the region. This deposited              enormous amounts of salt in the region. Over time, the early lagoon that              had formed became separated from the nearby lakes as the Mediterranean Sea              withdrew. Since then, the Dead Sea has been continually fed water from the              Jordan River and other small streams that surround it.
The most unique aspect of all this is the              evaporation that occurs. This is the only way water gets out of the Dead              Sea. And boy does it evaporate! This part of the world gets plenty hot!
When the water evaporates, it leaves behind              all the dissolved minerals in the Sea, just making it saltier. In fact,              it's a combination of the action of (1) huge deposits of salts from the              ancient Mediterranean ocean (2) continued evaporation and (3) mineral              salts carried in the sea from the local rivers, the Dead Sea continues to              get saltier.
Since the water does not escape and just              traps the salts within its shores, evolution has not had a chance to              produce any creatures that could adapt to such brutal conditions.
