Ocean salt primarily comes from rocks on land
Some areas of the ocean are saltier than others. This image shows methane mussels living at the edge  of a underwater brine pool   in a cavern at a depth of 198 meters (650 feet) in the Gulf of Mexico. The pool of  brine in the foreground is nearly four times as salty as seawater and is so dense that a submarine can float on the pool (in fact, this photo was shot from a submarine).
Salt in the ocean comes from rocks on land.  Here's how it   works:
The rain that falls on the land contains some  dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air.  This causes the rainwater   to be slightly acidic due to carbonic acid (which forms from carbon dioxide   and water).
As the  rain erodes the rock, acids in the rainwater break down the   rock. This process creates ions, or electrically charged atomic particles. These ions are carried away in runoff  to  streams and rivers and, ultimately, to the ocean.  Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from   the water.  Others are not used up and are left for long   periods of time where their concentrations increase over time.
Two of the most prevalant ions  in seawater  are  chloride and sodium. Together, they  make up over 90 percent of all dissolved ions  in the ocean. Sodium and Chloride are 'salty.'
The concentration of salt in seawater  (salinity) is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way,  about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts;  in a cubic mile of seawater, the weight of the salt (in the form of  sodium chloride)  would be about 120 million tons.
By some estimates, if the salt in the ocean could be removed and  spread evenly over the Earthâ€™s land surface it would form a layer more  than 166 meters (500 feet) thick, about the height of a 40-story office  building.
