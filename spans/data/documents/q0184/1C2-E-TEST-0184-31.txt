Why is the Ocean Salty?- CSI
 
Why is the ocean salty?  I know more salt is added from the rocks and rain, etc.  How was it salty in the beginning?  I know God created all things.  So, obviously, God made it that way!!!!  But, how does a student answer the question for a teacher that is scientific and Christian at the same time?

Here is a great article on the salinity of the oceans and the fact that it is also a young earth chronometer (a clock in nature that indicates that the time line in the book of Genesis is accurate).

There are many such young earth chronometers; however evolutionary sources completely ignore any evidence that contradicts their Big Bang worldview cosmology.
The truth is that the ocean exists with just the appropriate salinity to accommodate the incredibly diverse life forms within it. This is often referred to as the ‘anthropic principle’ and simply stated it means that everything we see in the natural world, including the place that earth inhabits in the solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, etc. seems to be fine-tuned to support life. This evidence is so overwhelming that many evolutionists simply refuse to discuss it. They say, ‘because it is evidence for intelligent design and creationism, it is religion and not science. Their definition of science is really naturalism and materialism. Remember, we are not telling people they have to believe in God or an intelligent designer or may or may not be God. We are saying that you cannot simply ignore the evidence because it does not agree with our worldview. Most of the great men and women of science were either Bible believers or theists that believed that God was the Creator of the universe.
Below is a list of 25 SCIENTISTS, who upheld the biblical view of creation, were   involved in supporting Christian missionary work, wrote books on Christian   evidences, believed in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior from sin, and had   their own personal ministries in church. Where would modern science be without   their contributions?  
 
1. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), founder of   physical astronomy 
2. Robert Boyle (1627-1691), father of modern   chemistry 
3. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), an early great mathematician who   laid the foundations for things like hydrodynamics, differential calculus, and   probability theory 
4. John Ray (1627-1705), father of English natural   history and probably the best zoologist and botanist of his time 
5. Nicolaus   Steno (1631-1686), father of stratiography 
6. William Petty (1623-1687)   helped institute the science of statistics and the modern study of   economics 
7. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) invented calculus, discovered the law   of gravity and the three laws of motion, developed the particle theory of light   propagation, invented the reflecting telescope, etc. 
8. Carolus Linnaeus   (1707-1778), father of biological taxonomy 
9. Michael Faraday (1791-1867),   one of the greatest physicists, developed essential concepts in electricity and   magnetism, invented the electrical generator, and made numerous contributions to   chemistry 
10. Georges Cuvier (1769-1832), founder of comparative   anatomy 
11. Charles Babbage (1792-1871), founder of computer science 
12.   John Dalton (1766-1844), father of atomic theory 
13. Matthew Maury   (1806-1873), founder of oceanography 
14. James Simpson (1811-1879)   discovered chloroform, laying the groundwork for anesthesiology 
15. James   Joule (1818-1889) discovered the mechanical equivalent of heat, laying the   foundation for the field of thermodynamics 
16. Louis Agassiz (1807-1873),   father of glacial geology 
17. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), father of   genetics 
18. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), father of bacteriology 
19. Joseph Lister (1827-1912) founder of antiseptic surgical methods (Pasteur's and   Lister's contributions, incidentally, have saved millions of lives.) 
20.   William Thompson, Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), one of the greatest physicists who   established thermodynamics on a formal scientific basis, supplying a strict   statement of the first two laws of thermodynamics 
21. Joseph Clerk Maxwell   (1831-1879) created a systematic theoretical and mathematical organization for   electromagnetic field theory. Einstein praised Maxwell's contributions as the   best in physics since Newton. 
22. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) developer of   non-Euclidian geometry, used by Einstein in his development of relativity   theory 
23. Joseph Henry Gilbert (1817-1901) developed nitrogen and   super-phosphate fertilizers for farm crops; co-developed the first agricultural   experimental station, laying a foundation for the advances in agricultural   science that allowed farmers to feed millions 
24. John Ambrose Fleming   (1849-1945) invented the Fleming valve laying the foundation for ensuing   developments in electronics 
25. Wernher Von Braun (1912-1977), father of   space science 
The five greatest physicists in history—Newton,   Faraday, Thompson, Maxwell, and Einstein—were each candid in their belief that   the universe was created by God; four of the five were committed Christians with   a firm conviction that the Bible was the authoritative Word of   God. 
 
Again, where would modern science be without their   contributions?
