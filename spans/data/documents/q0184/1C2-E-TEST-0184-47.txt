1.  Students pour water over the rock salt which is
    contained in a strainer.  The water plus dissolved
    salt will be collected in a plastic cup.  Students
    will taste the water sample.
2.  Students will allow the water to evaporate, observing
    that the salt remains.
3.  The above procedure is repeated over a 3 or 4 day
    period.  The students will observe that the salt
    increases each time new water is added.
 
Students will do a Saltwater Painting to once again
observe the evaporation process.  Mix warm water, salt, and
food coloring.  Paint pictures with the mixture on white
paper.  Let dry.  The water evaporates, but the salt
remains, creating beautiful pictures.
Also included on Big Sky is a script for an ocean
program.  It is entitled "Under the Sea".
