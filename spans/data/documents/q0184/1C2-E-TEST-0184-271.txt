Planet Earth has been called the "Blue Planet" due to the abundant water on its surface. Here on Earth, we take liquid              water for granted; after all, our bodies are mostly made of water.              However, liquid water is a rare commodity in our solar system. There              is no liquid water on the Sun nor anywhere else in the solar system,              save Earth. Nor has a drop of water been observed in interstellar              space. Only a planet of the right mass, chemical composition, and              location can support liquid water. And only on such planets could life              flourish.
Liquid water covers most of the surface of our planet.              This water comes in many forms, each with it's own special properties.              Rain is essentially pure water (consisting only of H2O with trace amounts of elements and other compounds picked up from atmospheric dust),              while fresh spring water and most lakes and rivers contain more dissolved salts (~0.02-0.4            percent %, or parts per hundred,). Ocean water              is much more salty and has on average ~3.5% salt content, also            referred to as "salinity".  Note that 3.5% equals 35 parts per            thousand  (ppt) which is the typical unit for which salinity is            reported, and this value equals 35,000 parts per million (ppm) - a ppt            is equal to 1 gram of salt dissolved into 1000 grams of water, or a            gram per kilogram (g/kg).  Some spring and lake waters are even            saltier than the ocean, and they are often called "brines" which can become saturated with salts.  These different              types of water are found in many different environments on Earth.
The largest and most dramatic bodies of water are our              oceans. The oceans cover ~71% of the globe and have an average depth              of 3,729 meters. As mentioned the average salinity is 35 ppt, but            this ranges from ~33-37 ppt.  Although the salinity of seawater            is made up mostly of major elements like sodium (Na), chloride (Cl),            sulfate (SO4), and magnesium (Mg), seawater also contains              many dissolved elements in smaller quantities such as calcium (Ca),            the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus important for plant growth, and            dissolved gases like CO2 and methane (CH4). The important points here are that these differences in chemical composition contribute to the diversity of ecosystems and the diversity of life that has adapted to different water bodies, and the amounts of salt contribute to the weight or density of the water which is important for how water bodies are structured
How did the ocean get so salty? The answer is that            the supply of salts comes from weathering of rocks on land, and then            transport to the sea in rivers, plus inputs of salts from hydrothermal            or volcanic vents (these topics were covered in earlier lectures in this class).  One of the very first scientific attempts to            estimate the age of the Earth was proposed by Sir Edmund Halley (of            Halley's comet) in 1715, who reasoned by mass balance that if you measured the rate of            input of salts from rivers (X tons per year), and the total salt in the ocean (Y tons), you could            calculate how many years it took to accumulate the salts now found.  The first application of this idea in the 1800s found that the ocean was ~90 million years old, which was in great contrast to the common idea            at the time that the ocean (and the Earth) was ~ 6,000 years old. 
Today we know from radiometric dating that in fact the            ocean is much older than 90 million yrs.  It has been in            existence for perhaps 3.4 billion years, and has had the same            composition for probably the last 1.5 billion years.  Why the big            difference between 90 million and 3.4 billion? This puzzled scientists            for many decades, until it was realized that the first estimates            assumed the ocean kept getting saltier over time, and that none of the            salts were ever removed.  In fact the salts are removed by            various processes including precipitation to a solid (mineral) form,            and subduction of sediments, and these "losses" of salts were not            considered and thus the time needed to accumulate the salts in the            ocean was too short. Thus we see how an understanding of geology and plate tectonics (as given in previous lectures) helps in our understanding of the chemical composition of the oceans.
One of the most powerful tools that scientists use is the concept of "residence time", which indicates how long on average something            (like sodium, Na, in the ocean) stays in the "pool" where it is found. The equation for calculating            residence time (Rt) is Rt = (amount in the pool) / (rate of input or            output from the pool).  For example, if a classroom holds 100 students, and            100 leave each hour, then Rt = (100 students) / (100 students/hr) = 1            hr.  For the oceans, we can calculate that the residence time of            water itself is about 3,200 years.  But for the atmosphere the Rt            of water is only about 3 days -- this means that if you add a            pollutant to the atmosphere in water, it will "rain out" back on your            head very quickly.  In the ocean the Rt of Na is ~200 million            yrs, and that for aluminum is only 150 yrs. Thus the aluminum is much            more "reactive", which is common for many elements like nutrients that            are in high demand and taken up quickly by organisms.  Note that            to make the Rt calculation the pool must be in "steady state"; that            is, the input rate must equal the output rate.
Given this basic understanding of the composition of            the oceans, we can move forward to understanding how the oceans            play a role in regulating climate.  Over half of the solar radiation absorbed by our planet is taken up              by the oceans. This energy, once absorbed, is redistributed by ocean              currents. The mass movement of water performed by the oceans plays              a key role in the control of climate, and this movement depends in            large part on differences in density of the water caused by variations            in temperature and salinity.
Temperature, Salinity, and Density of Water
Figure                    1. The salinities of Earth's Oceans measured in ppt
The density of water is determined by its              temperature and salt content.  Water density increases                as its salinity increases, and it increases as its temperature              gets colder.  So, warm, less salty water floats on top of (is              less dense) than cold, more salty water. These differences in              density of seawater have profound effects on ocean circulation            and the transfer of important elements like nutrients.
When water evaporates, it leaves behind dissolved salts,              making the remaining water more dense and more likely to sink to the ocean              floor. In this way important nutrients or other important elements            such as dissolved oxygen are cycled toward the ocean floor in a process known as "bottom-water            or deep-water formation".  From a climate point of view,            this sinking water also takes with it the greenhouse gas CO2 which has been absorbed by the ocean from the atmosphere, thus "removing" the gas from interacting with the atmosphere (at least for            a while...). As you will see later in the lecture on Earth's carbon cycle, this absorption of CO2 is a major process determining the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
In addition, much of this deep-water formation occurs            in polar regions, where the surface water in contact with the            atmosphere gets very cold (so more dense), and if it forms ice then            the salts are excluded from the ice and thus the remaining water            becomes even more salty and more dense.  The widespread sinking action of dense, saline water can drive              large-scale ocean circulation. This subsurface ocean circulation              produced by a combination of temperature and salinity change is called "thermohaline              circulation" ('thermo' for temperature and 'haline' for salt). This type of circulation is distinguished from               circulation at the surface of the oceans, which is driven by wind.
Figure 2: Thermal structure of Earth's                  Oceans
The salinities of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are            shown in Figure 1 for north-south cross-sections of the Atlantic and            Pacific oceans. Note the effect of enhanced salinity due to outflow            from the Mediterranean.  When more dense water overlies less            dense water it must sink, and this sinking drives the subsurface ocean            currents.
The North-South thermal structures of the Atlantic,            Pacific, and Indian oceans are shown in Figure 2. Several features are            of interest in this figure. Temperature tends to be highest at the            surface, with the deep waters being largely isothermal (having a            constant temperature with depth). As a consequence, the temperatures            are high in the top 1000 meters and drop thereafter. The warmest            temperatures are near the equator, as expected, with the polar water            being relatively cold and isothermal. Because of the nature of the            thermal structure, it is often useful to think of two separate ocean            reservoirs, a surface zone separated by a transition zone (called a            'pycnocline' - 'pycno' for density, and 'cline' for transition) from a            deep zone.  This layering is called stratification and it is an important concept to grasp in order to understand how lakes and oceans are physically structured, and how that structure influences the movement of water.
 
2. Ocean Circulation
Unlike the atmosphere, which is characterized by very turbulent              weather systems that move quickly, the ocean is a fairly stable place. This is because              it is heated from above, in contrast to the atmosphere, which is heated              from below. Because warm fluids (air and water are both fluids, one            is just much more dense) are less dense and want to rise, the rising            warm air in the atmosphere creates turbulence and and large structures            such as "convective clouds" which lead to "convective storms" that you            hear about on the Weather Channel.  (Convection is just the            movement of fluid due to its temperature, rising if warm, sinking if            cool.)  Thus the warm water in the ocean has nowhere to rise to            because it is already at the top, so, there is little turbulence            generated.  As is shown in Figure 2, the              relatively warm surface waters float on top of the colder and denser deeper waters,            which leads to a generally stable situation.
But we know that there is still water movement from            top to bottom in the ocean, because we know there is oxygen in the            bottom of the ocean.  If the stratification (layering) in the            ocean was very strong and never disrupted, decomposition processes by microbes in            the bottom waters would consume all of the oxygen and we would find            only bacteria and viruses that can live without oxygen, and none of            the fantastic diversity of life that exists now. Thus it is evident that            the bottom waters must be re-supplied with oxygen from the atmosphere            from some large-scale water motion or circulation in the oceans.
The ocean has four main types of motion (plus the very            small scale turbulence which we won't discuss):
surface currents
tides
tsunamis
Different sources provide energy for these different              types of motion. Surface and deep currents are powered by solar radiation.              The energy source for the tides is gravitational attraction of the              Earth and Moon. The Earth's internal heat provides energy for tsunamis,            through the action of earthquakes.              In this lecture we will focus on the first two types of circulation: surface currents              and deep currents.
Figure 3. Global Surface Currents.
Large-Scale Surface Currents
Surface currents are forced by frictional interaction              between the ocean surface and the prevailing atmospheric wind. The              wind imparts its momentum to the top layer of the ocean.
In each ocean, the prevailing trade winds drive              equatorial ocean currents from east to west. When these currents encounter              land, they divide to flow north and south along the eastern borders              of the continents. As they progress, they are deflected to the right              in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere              by the Coriolis Effect (see this link for            a detailed explanation ), creating large vortices or gyres, which are very large horizontal cells of water circulation.
Figure 3 illustrates the large-scale surface currents.              Notice the large clockwise gyres in the Northern Hemisphere and the              counter-clockwise gyres in the Southern Hemisphere. Small west-to-east              counter-currents are seen near the equator. The famous Gulf Stream              (currents number 1 and 2) carries more than 20 times the total amount              of water in all the rivers and streams in the world!
Smaller-Scale Surface Currents and Upwelling:
The Coriolis Effect forces surface water at an angle              of ~45o to the direction of the wind. As momentum passes              downwards through ocean layers, the currents rotate further under              the influence of Coriolis and moderate in force. The net result is what is              known as an "Ekman Spiral" motion (shown in Figure 4). On              average, the surface waters, taken as a whole, tend to move perpendicular              to the prevailing wind (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and              to the left in the Southern Hemisphere).
 
Figure 4 shows the Ekman Spiral for the Northern                  Hemisphere. For a wind blowing southward along the coast of California,                  the ocean current will be seaward. As the waters are forced                  seaward, underlying waters that are colder move upward to take                  their place (see below).
The region over which the current actually reverses                  direction is known as the friction layer (~100 m depth).  The Ekman Spiral helps explain why the waters off                  the coast of California, and in fact all along the West Coast of the U.S., are so cold (see Figure 5).
The cold waters off the coast of California are                  clearly unusual. Water temperatures closer to what one might expect                  for the latitude (about 10° F higher) are found to the north and the south of the localized cold zone.
The Ekman Spiral has a different direction in the Southern              Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere the rotation is to the left, whereas  the rotation is              towards the right in the northern hemisphere - these differences are due to the Coriolis effect).
Figure 4: Ekman Spiral for Northern Hemisphere
Figure 5. Ocean temperature isoclines (isotherms,                  lines of equal temperature) off the West                  Coast of North America.
The cold waters off California are produced by the same "upwelling" process that results in cold surface waters off the western coasts              of South America and Africa. The process is related to the offshore              surface current driven by the prevailing winds, which blow parallel              to the coast.
Figure 6. Upwelling off the California Coast.
Figure 6 shows the upwelling process for the case of California              surface waters. The prevailing wind blows from north to south along              the coastline and, in conjunction with the Coriolis Effect, forces              the surface waters westward and out to sea. The waters in this seaward              current are replaced from below. The forced upwelling of cold              deep water cools the surface waters and brings vital nutrients upwards              to support a rich food chain, including large numbers of photosynthetic              algae called phytoplankton (the word algae is general for any            small photosynthetic plant, such as found on a rock in a stream;            phytoplankton are specialized algae that float in the water column of            oceans and lakes). This situation in Californian coastal waters              is repeated off the coast of Peru, with the difference that the Peruvian              cold waters are in the Southern Hemisphere. The Peruvian waters support              an incredibly rich food chain, including the world's most important              anchovy fishery.
El Niño and links to Global Climate
Because the upwelling currents are forced by prevailing              winds, they are affected by changes in the strength of these winds.              A phenomenon known as El Niño occurs periodically in              Peruvian coastal waters. This term refers to the occasional situation              when the trade winds slacken sufficiently to cut off the Peruvian              upwelling, leading to an increase in the temperature of the surface              waters. It is called El              Niño (the Christ-Child in Spanish), since it often occurs              around Christmas time. During these events, most of the            phytoplankton or algae are starved of the nutrients normally              brought up from the deep waters and die away. Sometimes, the die-off              is so rapid and intense that the decomposing bodies of the            phytoplankton, and other sea creatures              that depend on them for food, leave a foul smell on the ocean.
Figure 7. El Niño influence in the Pacific Ocean.
Figure 7 shows the region of the Pacific Ocean that              is anomalously warmed during El Niño events. The size and extent              of surface-water warming affects the Earth's climate on a truly global              scale, with certain areas of the world experiencing drought while              others experience greater rainfall.
El Niño events occur sporadically every 3-5 years              or so and last for a year or two. Some of the unusual weather experienced              in 1997-98 (large floods on the Mississippi River) has been ascribed to an El Niño event.
El Niño events are also sometimes referred                  to as "ENSO" events (standing for El Niño, Southern                  Oscillation events). One of the effects of an ENSO event is a                  rise in sea level off the coast of South America and a drop in                  sea level off Australia.
El Niño events occur sporadically but fairly                  often (one every 3-5 years or so). They are almost impossible                  to predict, at least so far.
The opposite (and more normal) situation to El Niño                  is sometimes called "La Niña" - good fishing                  time!
Deep Water Circulation - The Thermohaline Circulation
Figure 8. Great Ocean Conveyer Belt.
A large-scale circulation of the oceans involving a              deep current carries more than 30 times the volume of all the rivers              of the world combined. We will call this 3-dimensional current the "Conveyor" or "Conveyor Belt" (Figure 8).
The conveyor belt is a globe-straddling ocean current              that keeps Northern Europe unusually warm for its latitude. The Gulf              Stream is one leg of this current system. It functions to transfer              heat from the relatively warm tropics to the relatively cold polar              regions.
The extra heat received by Northern Europe is brought              by the conveyor-belt-like ocean current. The part of the conveyor              near the ocean surface moves to the North in the Atlantic and to the              south in the Pacific. In the Atlantic, the surface of the conveyor              carries warm water to a region near Iceland, where it cools and sinks,              returning to great depth. The convergence of this warm surface current              and cold Arctic air allows for effective transfer of heat to the atmosphere,              keeping northern Europe warm. The amount of heat involved is very large: about              30% of the total solar energy received by the entire Atlantic! As              the waters cool due to this heat-transfer conveyor, they become more              dense and sink, feeding the lower part of the conveyor.  This            sinking is the deep-water formation described above.
The sinking action of the conveyor at its northernmost              extreme in the Atlantic is aided by its extra salinity. There is a              slight imbalance between evaporation and runoff in the Atlantic, which              causes it to be saltier than the Pacific. (Some of the water evaporated              from the Atlantic ends up raining into the Pacific, either directly              or from runoff via rivers and streams. Water evaporates in its pure              form, leaving behind salt and other solutes. The net effect of this              imbalance is to make the Atlantic more saline than the Pacific.) This              difference in salinity between the Atlantic and the Pacific is a driving              force behind the Conveyor. This type of circulation, powered by differences              in temperature and salinity, is referred to as Thermohaline Circulation              (Heat-Salt Circulation).
Figure 9. Energy transfer through the Conveyer Belt.
The importance of the ocean conveyor to climate is impossible              to overstate. Without its moderating influence on the climate              of Europe, Paris would have roughly the same climate as the Hudson              Bay and human history would have been undoubtably quite different! Figure 9 illustrates              the effect of the transfer of energy from the warm surface current              to the air blowing from Canada towards Europe.
To recap: at the northern Atlantic limit of the ocean              conveyor belt, surface waters release heat into the atmosphere, greatly              moderating Europe's climate. The subsequent plummeting of the cooled,            more dense              water from the arctic and subarctic oceans to greater depths simultaneously enriches the bottom waters              with oxygen, allowing great diversity of life in the deep ocean. The cycle is powered,              in part, by the extra salinity of the Northern Atlantic waters, due              to the higher rate of evaporation compared to the Pacific.  It            is also powered by the cold arctic waters that freeze and in the            process of excluding salts from the ice (the ice is like distilled            water), become even more dense.
So how could this conveyor belt have affected the            paleoclimate that we talked about in the last lecture, especially some of the short-term variations? There is evidence that the conveyor has "stalled" (stopped or been reduced in strength dramatically) once              within the past 12,000 years; this time is known as the brief cooling period called the Younger Dryas.
 
3. An Example of Rapid Climate              Change Caused by Air-Sea Interactions: The Younger Dryas
The Younger Dryas was a period of dramatic cooling              on Earth that was a brief reversal of the  warming trend coming out of the last            glacial maximum 20,000 years ago. Starting around 11,000 years            ago, during the warming, there was an abrupt cooling that lasted ~700 years and              led to enormous but short-lived changes in the climate of Northern              Europe. These changes were first noted in the pollen records from            lake sediments, which              indicated a change-over from forests to cold-adapted herbaceous plants (such as Dryas, a plant that thrives on arctic and alpine tundra) and back to              forest again. In the early 1980's, evidence for the Younger Dryas              was obtained from CO2 ice-core bubble measurements and confirmed that it was an event of global significance (since carbon              dioxide is well-mixed throughout the global atmosphere).
The Younger Dryas period has caused much debate, since              it challenged the previously-held idea that climate could only change              very gradually. It had been thought that the thermal inertia of the              ice sheets was so large that significant advances or retreats could              only happen over long periods of time. The Younger Dryas            demonstrated unambiguously that change can be abrupt. Thus, climate appears sometimes              to respond in a manner similar to earthquakes where stress and strain              builds up over years, leading to sudden abrupt changes, rather than              slow incremental changes.
Figure 10 provides a synopsis of what we suppose happened              to the temperature of the North Atlantic Basin during the Younger              Dryas. The top panel shows the changes in solar radiation expected              from a consideration of the Milankovitch cycles over the past 30,000              years. The bottom panel shows the sluggish (lagging) response of the              melting ice caps. The middle panel shows the paleoclimate temperature              record.

Consider the melting of the polar ice cap as it retreated              (Figure 11). Initially, all the runoff waters would have been channeled              into the Gulf of Mexico along the Mississippi and its tributaries because the border of the ice sheet was still so far south..              At some point, when the glaciers had retreated northward to about the latitude              of Northern Lake Superior, the runoff waters would have been diverted              to flow out along the St. Lawrence into the Northern Atlantic. At            first these waters built up in giant inland lakes, perhaps blocked by            remnant ice blocks.  Once this inland freshwater sea "broke            loose", the water flowed to the ocean and because              these fresh waters had very low salinity, they would have floated on top of the sea and inhibited              the downward plunge of the conveyor belt.              This sudden release of vast amounts of fresh water into the Northern              Atlantic might have been sufficient to stall the Conveyor belt completely,              leaving Europe without its moderating influence. After the initial shock of the fresh water runoff had been absorbed, the Conveyor would              have started up again, returning the climate to its ordained "Milankovitch              cycle" path. The timing of the retreat of the polar cap ice past              Lake Superior has been shown to be coincident with the onset of the              Younger Dryas.
The example of the Younger Dryas is a warning that              climate change can be unpredictable and abrupt. Stresses on the              system can build up until, almost without warning, a sudden and fundamental              change occurs on a short time scale. These abrupt changes may            represent "tipping points" (like a water balloon filling up nicely and            then suddenly it breaks) in the ocean-atmosphere interaction that            drives our climate system.  These tipping points are inherently            difficult to predict, and represent one of the most worrisome and            perhaps dangerous outcomes of the current global climate change and            warming that we are experiencing. A "Hollywood" version of these tipping points is seen in the film "The Day After Tomorrow". These basic differences in the configuration of the conveyor belt and its effects on climate are shown below.
Figures 12 and 13. Configurations of the global conveyor belt and the implications for climate change on Earth. One potential cause of shifts in conveyor-belt circulation is the melting of ice caps.
 The large Earth in the center (Figure 12, left above) shows the cold climate state prevailing during most of the  Normal Ice Age, where the  conveyor belt was operating but it was shifted to the south due to the polar ice caps. The bottom Earth shows an advance of the Conveyor Belt into the Nordic Seas, resulting in a warm anomaly and Rapid Warming. The upper globe shows climate when the Conveyor Belt collapses, such as occurred during the Younger Dryas period, which resulting in Rapid Cooling. Concerns today are centered around the rapid melting of the Greenland ice cap, which injects less dense, fresh water into the North Atlantic and may contribute to placing a freshwater "lid" on the North Atlantic, thus preventing the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water that drives the global conveyor belt. Weakening of the conveyor belt circulation would also reduce the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed from the atmosphere and transported into the deep ocean water, meaning that a positive feedback loop would be set up by more CO2 in the atmosphere causing higher temperatures and more ice-cap melting, which weakens the conveyor belt, which reduces the amount of CO2 taken up by the ocean, which increases the CO2 in the atmosphere, which causes higher temperatures. It is both these kinds of feedback loops, and the kinds of abrupt climate change seen in the Earth's recent past, that have scientists and others extremely concerned about rapid climate change on our planet.
Summary
Salts in the ocean come from weathering of rocks                on land, and inputs from hydrothermal and volcanic activity in the                ocean itself. The overall chemical composition of the ocean is                quite stable, but local variations in salinity and temperature                create differences in water density in the oceans, which in turn have large impacts on ocean structure and the movement of water currents.
The ocean structure is more stable because it is heated                  from above, compared to the atmosphere which is fundamentally                turbulent and rapidly changing because it is heated from below. However, winds do drive                surface currents, and differences in water density cause water                sinking that establishes a deep-water, 3-dimensional thermohaline current                  that encircles the globe (the Conveyor Belt). 
The oceans play an important role in controlling                  the climate of the Earth. Surface water currents and the Conveyor Belt effectively                  transport energy from low to high latitudes, which moderates                  the climate of Northern Europe.  Upwelling of cold,                nutrient-rich waters on the west coasts of continents is forced by                a combination of prevailing winds and the Coriolis Effect. When                upwelling off the coast of Peru slows, we have the El Niño                condition, which can cause global climate changes and lead to substantial societal impacts.
There is evidence that during the Younger Dryas                period ~11,000 years ago, the Conveyor Belt was weakened and the                Earth was thrown into a severe cold period.  Thus, abrupt,                rapid climate changes can be very strong and can be caused by a                breakdown of the atmosphere-ocean interactions that control                climate.
