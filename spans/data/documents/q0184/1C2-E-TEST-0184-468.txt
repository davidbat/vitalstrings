Track of TS 07W
On June 21, a tropical disturbance formed east of Yap, and it developed multiple vortices.
Early on June 25, a vortex developed well within the low-pressure area, prompting the JMA considering it as a tropical depression north of Palau; also, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system later that day.
On June 26, the PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and named it Dindo. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Doksuri, and the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression. Late on the same day, the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical storm.
On June 27, Doksuri’s low-level circulation center became exposed due to moderate easterly wind shear. On June 28, the JTWC downgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression, as the system’s exposed circulation center began to underwent a usual circulation center replacement cycle, which involves a circulation center to be replaced by another new circulation center. On June 29, the HKO issued the strong wind signal No.1 as it was located 120 kilometers from Hong Kong.
