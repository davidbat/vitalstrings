A lot of rivers join the ocean. In the course of the river, it takes along with it, a lot of sand and salt and minerals. These elements get deposited in the ocean. In the long run, this deposition led to a large amount of salt accumulating in the ocean. Another reason is the volcanic eruptions and stuff like that. Hope that helps. Bye.
