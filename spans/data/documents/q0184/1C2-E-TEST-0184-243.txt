Question
I know its probablly simple but why when in a salt environment and ingesting it all the time ,do fish in the sea not taste salty? and river fish taste earthy.
Answer
This is a very good question and I never even thought of it that way till you asked.  Marine fish don’t taste salty because there is not anywhere near as much salt in them as in salt water (if any at all in some cases).  The reason fish can live at different salinities is based on there ability to regulate there osmotic pressure (live a pump that gets rid of excess salt).  The varying ability to do this is why different species can tolerate different salinities (a variations of, or extremes).  So the don’t taste salty because the mostly are made up of fresh water.  Hope that helps.
