Q:
Why is the ocean salty?
A:
It is salty because it has a lot of salt in it! Salt is a mineral that is found in soil and rocks, too. Flowing water picks up some salt and carries it to rivers. Rivers carry it to seas. Since this has been happening for millions of years, the oceans now have a lot of salt — about one cup per gallon!
