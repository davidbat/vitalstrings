There is a lot of salt on the earth, and it mixes very well with water.
There is a lot of salt on the earth, and it mixes very well with water. There is some salt in all water. Water on the land runs into lakes and rivers. The water from most lakes goes into rivers. These rivers run into the seas and oceans. They carry little clouds. It evaporates. Salt cannot evaporate. It stays in the ocean.
The water in the oceans has more salt then river water. Ocean water is about 3,5% ( three and a half percent ). Some seas have more salt than other.
Some lakes do not have a river to carry the water and the salt away. Some of the water leaves the lakes. It evaporates, but the salt cannot. These lakes are very salty. There are two famous lakes like this. They are the Dead Sea in the Middle East and the Great salt Lake in the state of Utah in the United States. They are much saltier than the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean
