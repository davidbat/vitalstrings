The Salton Sea's saltiness is a threat to the animal life that calls the sea its home. This problem is becoming more pressing because its saltiness continues to increase. The Salton Sea was originally salty because when it was created from its source, the Colorado, flowing into the Salton Sink, the current picked up salt particles. Salt already in the Sink dissolved into the new water with which it was filled. The Salton Sea continues to be salty because the Colorado River is still its source. As the water flows in that direction, it naturally accumulates salt. This is becoming a major ecological threat.
