Snooki's Theory Has 'Jersey Shore' Fans Asking: Why Is The Ocean Salty?
That question and 'whale sperm' become Google Trends following Snooks' marine-biology lesson.
By Aly Semigran
During Thursday night's episode of "Jersey Shore," Nicole " Snooki " Polizzi got viewers to take an active interest in ... science?
Yes, the return of DJ Pauly D's stalker and even Ronnie's embarrassing health scare came a distant second to Snooki's failed theory on why ocean water is salty.
Snooki's short-lived romance with a fellow Shore dweller named Jeff set the scene for the moment that would cause an Internet explosion. When Jeff suggested that he and Snooki take a dip in the ocean, the pint-size reality star replied, "I f---in' hate the ocean. Too much whale sperm."
When Snooki urged "Shore" watchers, "Everybody Google it, because that's why the water is salty. F---in' whale sperm," they heeded her advice — in huge numbers. "Why is the ocean salty?" and "Whale sperm" quickly rose to the top of Google Trends not soon after the show aired on the East Coast.
The Snooki-led Google Trend continued through the night and well into Friday morning (February 4). While Polizzi herself missed the moment (she tweeted Thursday evening, "Holy Jersday! I missed our episode!! Hope you all tuned in"), she certainly created a stir, and likely had science teachers everywhere changing their syllabi.
So why is the ocean salty? Sorry to burst your bubble, Snooks, but it's because of salt.
Did you hit Google last night to test Snooki's theory? Let us know in the comments!
Don't miss "Jersey Shore," airing Thursday nights at 10 p.m. ET on MTV.
