Here is some insight
All water, even rain water, contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call "salts." But not all water tastes salty. Water is fresh or salty according to     individual judgment, and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of     taste than by a laboratory test. It is one's taste buds that accept one water and reject     another.
SOURCES OF THE SALTS...
Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything. Ocean water is indeed     a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the     teeming life in the seas. Most of the ocean's salts were derived from gradual processes     such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth's crust by weathering and     erosion, the wearing down of mountains, and the dissolving action of rains and streams     which transported their mineral washings to the sea. Some of the ocean's salts have been     dissolved from rocks and sediments below its floor. Other sources of salts include the     solid and gaseous materials that escaped from the Earth's crust through volcanic vents or     that originated in the atmosphere.
