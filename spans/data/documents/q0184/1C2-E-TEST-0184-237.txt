What is the difference between an ocean and a sea?
Visit with an oceanographer to find out what the difference is between an ocean and a sea. Many oceanographers designate only 3 oceans: the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian.  They consider the Arctic Ocean to be part of the Atlantic and the Antarctic or Southern Ocean to be part of all three of the oceans.  Other oceanographers designate that there are 5 oceans and include the Arctic and Southern oceans.  Parts of the oceans that are shallower and partially enclosed are called seas.  There are more than 50 seas; the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are both part of the Atlantic Ocean.
Why is the Ocean Blue?
Talk with an astronaut and find out why oceans and seas always appears blue from outer space. When we look at oceans and seas close up, they are often grayish-green in color.    Sunlight contains all the colors of the spectrum.  However, water absorbs colors in different ways and filters out the colors in different ways.  Blue light penetrates the most deeply into water, and everything below a certain depth in the ocean always appears blue.  Some of this blue light is scattered back to the surface, and that is why oceans and seas appear blue from above the earth.
 
The                                   Blue Frontier Sustainable Seas Expedition
Follow famed ocean scientist Sylvia Earle as she explores the United States'                                       last frontier: the ocean. Take the DeepWorker sub on a simulated dive                                       through the Monterey Bay kelp forest and learn more about the 12 U.S.                                       National Marine Sanctuaries. The site also has links to classroom ideas                                       and activities.
Dive and                               Discover
Join a virtual expedition to the eastern Pacific Ocean to look for new                               volcanic eruptions on the crest of the mid-ocean ridge. You can read the                               daily updates by the crew, watch a movie of a volcanic seafloor, and learn                             about topics from vent biology to the earth's anatomy in the "infomods."
Making                  Waves
A unique multi-media approach to learning                    that offers teachers and students an insider's view of current, relevant                    ocean science research efforts. It is intended to team teachers, scientists,                    and students in an attempt to deliver real-world science to middle school                    classrooms.
Oceans
Explore the open seas, an interesting and little understood world full                               of bizarre and fascinating creatures. This site focuses on the Ocean's                               complex food chain and its many organisms that have adapted to extreme                               and unusual conditions in the world's oceans.
