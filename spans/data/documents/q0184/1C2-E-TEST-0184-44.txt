Snooki is now a published author , but, well, she may not be writing text books any time soon.
On Thursday night's episode of 'Jersey Shore,' the beach-loving Guidette began to contemplate her favorite locale. So she asked her equally learned roommates to Google the following question: 'Why is the ocean salty?"
While there are over 1.85 million search results for that exact question, Snooki had her own answer: whale sperm.
Perhaps she should ask Matt Lauer for the real answer -- he's already quizzed her on what she knows, like "what's a badonk?"
