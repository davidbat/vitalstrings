Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi : Celebrity guidette. Authoress. Tanning aficionado. Oceanographer?
On last night’s episode of Jersey Shore, everyone’s favorite pint-size Jersey-ite reached deep into her vast reservoir of knowledge to answer an age-old question: Why is the ocean salty?
While cavorting on the boardwalk with her new beau Jeff on the episode, Snooki offered the following thought on the Atlantic.
“I hate the ocean. Yea, it’s all whale sperm.”
To which a perplexed Jeff replied,
“Whale sperm! There’s no whale out here!”
Undeterred by this seemingly reasonable observation, Polizzi reasserted her theory during a post-shoot interview, noting,’
“Everybody Google it because that’s why the water is salty. From the whale sperm.”
An intriguing theory, to be sure. Though the Snookster should probably leave open the possibility that the ocean is salty because of, well, salt.
