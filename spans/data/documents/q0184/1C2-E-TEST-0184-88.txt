Why is the Sea Salty?
Glad you asked...
The oceans are salty because when it rains the water runs off the land and collect salt. As the water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind. Fresh water lakes and rivers always get fresh rain water. Since oceans are lowest, salt builds up over time.  You can find more information here: http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salt...

Then again, this answer might help you...
The sea is salty because of the rivers that flow into it pick up salt from minerals and rocks along the way.  When the water evaporates the salt does not.  Therefore the sea remains salty.
