Separating Solutions and          the          Salty          Sea
This                caravan                of                camels                is                carrying                salt                across                the                Sahara                Desert                to                be                traded                in                another                part                of                Africa.
Why          is          the          sea          salty?          Where          does          all          that          salt          come          from?          How          does          it          get          there?          Much          of          the          salt          comes          from          the          land.          When          it          rains,          rainwater          dissolves          soluble          substances,          including          common          salt          ( sodium          chloride ),          from          soil          and          rocks.          Some          of          these          substances          eventually          find          their          way          into          creeks          and          rivers,          and          from          there,          they          are          carried          to          the          sea.
Why          is          the          sea          saltier          than          rivers?          Once          in          the          sea,          soluble          substances          are          concentrated. Heat          from          the          sun          evaporates          the          water          from          the          sea          but          leaves          the          salts          behind.          Over          millions          of          years,          seas          become          saltier          and          saltier.          For          the          same          reason,          lakes          that          have          no          outlet          to          the          sea          quickly          become          salty.          Lakes          can          even          be          saltier          than          seas          are.
Salt          is          a          valuable          commodity          that          has          been traded          for          thousands          of          years .          It          is          used          in          food,          providing          flavor          and          acting          as          a          food preservative .          It          is          also          used to          make          a          wide          variety          of          chemicals .          These          chemicals          are          used          in          many          industrial          processes,          including          making          glass,          soap,          and          chlorine.
Salt                making                by evaporation ,                Salt                Lake,                Utah                (early                20th                century).
Today,          most          salt          comes          from          mines,          although          a          lot          is          also          extracted          from          the          sea          or          salty          lake          water.          Salt          has          been          extracted          from          salty          bodies          of          water          throughout          history.          One          common          method          of          extraction          is          to          let          the          heat          from          the          sun          completely          evaporate          seawater          that          is          trapped          in          pools          or          small          lagoons.
In          some          desert          areas,          water          is          very          scarce.          But          many          of          these          deserts          are          near          seas          (or          salt          lakes),          and          salt          can          be          removed          from          seawater          to          get          fresh          water.          This          process          is          called desalination .          Seawater          that          is desalinated is          fresh          enough          to          drink          and          to          grow          crops. In          some          desalination          plants,          the          saltwater          is          heated .          The          water          evaporates          away          from          the          salt,          as          steam.          The          steam          then          condenses          to          form          fresh          water.          This          process          requires          a          lot          of          energy,          so          it          is          very          expensive.          Other          desalination          plants          remove          salt          from          water          by          a          process          called reverse          osmosis .
The                Yuma                desalination                plant                in                Arizona                is                the                world's                largest                desalination                plant,                capable                of                producing                72                million                gallons                of                desalted                water                per                day.

2.          It          is          widely          believed          that          the          term "salary" was          derived          from          the          Latin          word          for          salt.          Based          on          what          you          read          in          this          article,          why          might          this          be          true?
