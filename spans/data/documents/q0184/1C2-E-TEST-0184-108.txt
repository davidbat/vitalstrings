The answer is quite simple.
There are lakes that have no escape to rivers or the sea, and such lakes are generally more saline. They act in a similar way to the ocean with water evaporating off and leaving salts behind. In some cases enclosed lakes, like these, will evaporate completely leaving behind huge salt flats. However, due to the ease with which salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolve, the next rains will recreate the lake with its saline environment.
Interestingly, in our fossil record, you can find examples of such lakes which are often represented by rocks containing mud cracks, the cracks filled with sand.
Another interesting point is that some lakes are likely to vary in salinity according to the surrounding rocks/minerals.
Many large salt lakes around the world have been created by being closed off from the oceans... and thus have become hypersaline through evaporation. Around 6 million years ago during the Tertiary, the Mediterranean was closed off from the Atlantic and became very heavily saline before eventually drying out completely. Evidence of this is visible in the fossil record with large bands of gypsum and other evaporites found across southern Europe.
