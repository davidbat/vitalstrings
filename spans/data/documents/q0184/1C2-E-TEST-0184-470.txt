Firm activities
AlgaeArt combines treatment & disposal of brines from desalination with production of Spirulina and other saline / brackish water algae, organisms and crops.
Management of brines and brackish waters via saline agriculture.
The firm develops business projects by combining advanced technology, farming opportunities and sustainable investment.
 
Brines (reject concentrate) from desalination
Desalination of brackish wells by reverse osmosis produces a salty concentrate that requires treatment before disposal due to the high nitrate and salt content:
·        removal of nitrates from salty water is expensive and complicated
·        evaporation of brines is expensive too
 
Spirulina production is an efficient way to remove nutrients from salty waters transforming the nutrients into valuable biomass.
Evaporation of the brines is a by-product of AlgaeArt technology.
This technology combines high yield agriculture and water treatment with environment protection.
