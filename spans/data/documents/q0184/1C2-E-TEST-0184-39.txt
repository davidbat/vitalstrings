Why is Ocean Salty?
The earth is made up of the land and water. A bigger area is covered by water, approximately seventy-one percent. The largest body of water known to man is the ocean. There are five known oceans in the world; they are the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Southern Oceans. Aside from that fact that they are all of large sizes, they have one more thing in common and it is being salty. What caused the ocean to be salty?
The Ocean is salty due to a number of reasons that is consistent to the flow of nature. The salt in our ocean is a result to the breaking down of solid earth, which has been happening for millions of years. The earth as we know existed for a long time, even way beyond human existence. In all those years, many changes has taken place in the biological matter and it has affected water composition, such that of the ocean.
The ocean is not only made up of itself but it has come from smaller bodies of water. All these bodies of water, such as rivers, had biological decays due to teeming of aquamarine life. These decays have been carried over to the ocean. Even ocean floors, they have different sorts of rocks that break up. One kind is the igneous rock. Other eroded materials can also come from the volcanic vents below the ocean floor.
The weather also contributes to the ocean salt. When it rains, the acidic rainwater is being deposited on the ocean. Thus, it adds to the components. When it is hot, the sun evaporates most of the pure water so all minerals are left in ocean. Then, ocean water becomes even more concentrated. This is just a part of the process of hydrological cycle wherein the earth and atmosphere, exchange components of liquid matter.
