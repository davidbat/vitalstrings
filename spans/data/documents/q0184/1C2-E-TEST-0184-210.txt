Our planet, Earth, is the only place in the universe known to have liquid water. 1 In fact, astronauts looking at     Earth’s surface from outer space see mainly water. The ocean covers 71% of     the total area, and contains enough water to cover the whole planet to a depth of     2.7 km (1.7 miles) if the surface were completely flat.
Salinity
The ocean is essential for life on Earth, and also helps make the climate fairly     moderate. However, although the ocean contains 1,370 million cubic kilometres (334     million cubic miles) of water, humans can’t survive by drinking from it—it     is too salty.
To a chemist, ‘salt’ refers to a wide range of chemicals where a metal     is combined with a non-metal. Ordinary common salt is a compound formed when the     metal sodium combines with the non-metal chlorine—sodium chloride. This contains     electrically charged atoms, called ions, that attract each other, resulting     in a fairly hard crystal. When salt dissolves, these ions separate. Sodium and chloride     ions are the main ions in seawater, but not the only ones. The salty seas benefit     man, because the ocean provides many useful minerals for our industries.
How old is the sea?
Many processes (see below) bring salts into the sea, while they don’t leave     the sea easily. So the saltiness is increasing steadily. Since we can work out how     much salt there is in the sea, as well as the rates that salts go into and out of     the sea, we should be able to calculate a maximum age for the sea.
In fact, this method was first proposed by Sir Isaac Newton’s colleague, Sir     Edmond Halley (1656–1742), of comet fame. 2 More recently, the geologist, physicist, and pioneer of radiation therapy, John     Joly, (1857–1933) estimated that the oceans were 80–90 million years     old at the most. 3 But this was far     too young for evolutionists, who believed that life evolved in the ocean billions     of years ago.
More recently, the geologist Dr Steve Austin and the physicist Dr Russell Humphreys     analyzed figures from secular geoscience sources for the quantity of sodium ion     (Na+) in the ocean, and its input and output rates. 4 The slower the input and faster the output, the older             the ocean could be.
Every kilogram of seawater contains about 10.8 grams of dissolved Na+ (about 1% by weight). This means that there is a total of 1.47 x 1016 (14,700 million million) tonnes of Na+ in the ocean.
Sodium input
Water on the land can dissolve salt outcrops, and can weather many minerals, especially     clays and feldspars, and leach the sodium out of them. This sodium can be carried     into the ocean by rivers. Some salt is supplied by water through the ground directly     to the sea—called submarine groundwater discharge (SGWD). Such water is often     very concentrated in minerals. Ocean floor sediments release much sodium, as do     hot springs on the ocean floor (hydrothermal vents). Volcanic dust also contributes     some sodium.
Austin and Humphreys calculated that about 457 million tonnes of sodium now comes     into the sea every year. The minimum possible rate in the past, even if the most     generous assumptions are granted to evolutionists, is 356 million tonnes/year.
Actually, a more recent study shows that salt is entering the oceans even faster     than Austin and Humphreys thought. 5 Previously, the amount of SGWD was thought to be a small fraction (0.01–10%)     of the water from surface runoff, mainly rivers. But this new study, measuring the     radioactivity of radium in coastal water, shows that the amount of SGWD is as much     as 40% of the river flow. 6 This means     that the maximum possible age of the ocean is even smaller.
Sodium output
People who live near the sea often have problems with rust in cars. This is due     to salt spray—small droplets of seawater escape from the ocean, the water     evaporates, leaving behind tiny salt crystals. This is a major process that removes     sodium from the sea. Another major process is called ion exchange—clays can     absorb sodium ions and exchange them for calcium ions, which are released into the     ocean. Some sodium is lost from the ocean when water is trapped in pores in sediments     on the ocean floor. Certain minerals with large cavities in their crystal structure,     called zeolites, can absorb sodium from the ocean. [Ed. note: some anti-creationists     have proposed that sodium is removed by albitization, but see addendum for Dr Humphreys' response.]
However, the rate of all of this sodium output is far less than the input. Austin     and Humphreys calculated that about 122 million tonnes of sodium leaves the sea     every year. The maximum possible rate in the past, even if the most generous assumptions     are granted to evolutionists, is 206 million tonnes/year.
Estimating the ocean’s age
Granting the most generous assumptions to evolutionists, Austin and Humphreys calculated     that the ocean must be less than 62 million years old. It’s important     to stress that this is not the actual age, but a maximum age. That is, this evidence is consistent with any age up to 62 million years, including     the biblical age of about 6,000 years.
The Austin and Humphreys calculation assumes the lowest plausible input rates and     fastest plausible output rates. Another assumption is that there was no dissolved     salt to start with. If we assume more realistic conditions in the past, the calculated     maximum age is much less.
For one thing, God probably created the oceans with some saltiness, so that saltwater     fish could live comfortably in it. Noah’s Flood would have dissolved large     amounts of sodium from land rocks. This would have found its way into the oceans     when the Flood waters retreated. Finally, the larger-than-expected SGWD would further     reduce the maximum age.
Conclusion
The salinity of the oceans is a strong evidence that they, and the Earth itself,     are far younger than the billions of years required for evolution, and is consistent     with the biblical age of about 6,000 years. It is also far younger than the evolutionists’ ‘dates’ for many marine creatures. In short, the sea is not salty enough     to suit the taste of evolutionists! Of course, all such calculations depend on assumptions     about the past, like the starting conditions and constant rates of processes. They     can never prove the age of something. For that, we need an eye-witness     (cf. Job 38:4 ). The point of such calculations is to demonstrate that even under             the evolutionists’ own assumptions about the past, the Earth     is far younger than is usually claimed and does not contradict the Bible.
Addendum: is albitization the evolutionary escape hatch?
One anti-creationist called Glenn Morton claims that the sodium-rich feldspar called albite (NaAlSi3O8)     would form permanently on the ocean floor, taking sodium out of seawater. He claims     that such a sodium sink would invalidate the age calculations of Drs Austin and     Humphreys. But Dr Humphreys answered a critic who cited Glenn Morton and gave permission for     his response to be reproduced below:
No, Glenn Morton is not at all correct on this, and sincere creationists can continue         using sea sodium as an evidence for a young world. Morton showed you an early letter         in his correspondence with Steve Austin and me, but not our replies. He also did         not show you how he terminated the correspondence.
What happens is this: indeed albite forms in mid-ocean vents and takes sodium out         of the high-temperature sea water. But then when the albite gets into cooler water,         it decomposes into the mineral chlorite and releases the same amount of sodium back         into the sea water. That is why albite (in any significant amounts) is found only         at the mid-ocean ridges and nowhere else. So his “albite sink” would change into         a “chlorite source”, and the net effect on sodium in the sea would be zero.
That may seem technical to you. So here is a non-technical way you can judge for         yourself whether Morton is right or not: find out whether he has published his “albite         sink” theory in a peer-reviewed secular geochemistry journal. The foremost one has         the Latin title Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. Such journals would be overjoyed         to publish his theory if it were correct, because it would solve the 75-year-old         problem Steve and I pointed out, the great imbalance between ingoing and outgoing         sodium. The secular science establishment would probably award Morton the Nobel         Prize for it!
Moreover, Morton would be very proud to have his theory published in such a journal         and would be sure to mention it prominently on his website. Let me know if you find         such a citation there. If you don’t, then you know Morton is blowing smoke at you.
Smoke and mirrors are generally what you will get on skeptics’ and old-earther web         sites. They shun peer review and publication. Instead they rely on the naïveté         of most of their readers to protect their bad science from exposure. Anybody can         say anything on a website, and they do. Psalm 1:1 promises a blessing for avoiding         such company:
“How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of             the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!”
Instead, delight in the law of the Lord,
