Don't worry about silly? If it is possible it will be done.  It is the future not the past, that matters.

For once, please try, try thinking before typing.
Putting clean water into the Dead Sea is not just silly, it's extremely uneconomical.
The Dead Sea is like 8 times saltier than the ocean.   That means, to get the Dead Sea to the same salinity as the ocean, you need to add about 7 times its current volume of clean water.
The Dead sea covers about 500 square kilometers,  and is about 300 meters deep.  So it holds about 300 times 500 million cubic meters of salty water-- that's about 150 billion cubic meters, 150 trillion liters.
The cost of reverse-osmosis desalination is about $3 per cubic meter,
so to get 7 times the volume of the Dead sea it will cost you about 150 trillion times 7 times $3 or a bit over two quadrillion dollars.
So you get your desalinators going- you pump it in.... and you have..... a bunch of seawater.   At great cost.    One quadrillion dollars....
Which you could have gotten for free, from the ocean.
