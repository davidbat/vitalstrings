What Our Subscribers Say:
"I just wanted to let you know that this is one of the best sites that I have   found! I am a teacher in a multi-needs classroom and use the activities on the   KidsSoup resource library site for many of my units. There is something for   everyone, of every skill level, and the activites are easily adaptable for each   skill level as well. I love the colourful printables and always laminate them for   future use. I have recommended this site to many of my other teacher friends, and have received many compliments on the art activities that we have done from   the KidsSoup site. Standing ovation kidssoup.com! I am excited for upcoming topics!"

Show a large   globe and ask children to identify the oceans. Also ask them how they know that   they are oceans. Point out that most of our planet is covered by water and that   this huge amount of water is called oceans and seas, and they are all joined   together. The oceans and seas are salty. There are five oceans: Atlantic,   Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and the Antarctic. Smaller areas of the oceans are   called seas. The largest two seas are the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. Talk   about the differences between oceans, lakes, and rivers.
