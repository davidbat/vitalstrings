USB650 Red Tide Spectrometer
World’s Most Amazing Low-Cost Spectrometer
The Red Tide Spectrometer is a low-cost, small-        footprint lab spectrometer that's ideal as a general-purpose instrument        for your budget-conscious classroom or teaching lab. The Red Tide has a        wavelength range of 350-1000 nm, and utilizes a detector with 650 active        pixels; that’s 650 data points in one full spectrum, or one data point per        nanometer. Configured with a 25 µm entrance slit, the Red Tide offers ~2.0        nm optical resolution (FWHM).
Flexible Platform, Convenient Interface
The Red Tide is a preconfigured, off-the-shelf        spectrometer where all of the optical bench options, such as grating and        entrance slit size, are already selected. The Red Tide can be used with        various Ocean Optics spectrometer accessories, light sources and sampling        optics, to create application-specific systems for various absorbance,        reflection and emission applications. With its small footprint (89.1 mm x        63.3 mm), convenient USB interface, and integration times as fast as 3        milliseconds, the Red Tide is a great tool for basic lab measurements.
Spectrometer Alone or with Sampling System
The USB-650 Red Tide comes without a light source or        sample system, allowing you the freedom to choose the accessories that best fit your application.
The USB-650-VIS-NIR (at right) comes with a        direct-attach light source and sample holder. The light source includes an        LED-boosted tungsten source and a sample holder for 1-cm cuvettes that        connects to the front of the spectrometer. In this configuration, the        system has a wavelength range of 370-980 nm.
The USB-650-UV-VIS includes a deuterium tungsten    halogen light source and a 1-cm cuvette holder. In this configuration,    the system has a wavelength range of 200-850 nm.
Note: The Red Tide USB650 is not recommended    for absolute irradiance measurements. For absolute irradiance, we    recommend the USB2000+ miniature spectrometer.
Cross-platform Spectrometer Software
Red Tide operates via SpectraSuite Spectroscopy        Operating Software, the first spectroscopy software to run in Macintosh,        Linux and Windows. The Chemistry module for SpectraSuite includes features        specifically designed for educational use, such as a Beer's Law calculator        for absorbance experiments. The Red Tide also works with our educational        distributors' software.
