It is equally distributed between bays and headlands.
It is focused on bays and cuts them deeper.
It is focused on headlands and erodes them back.
It is reflected back to sea.
What is a typical order of features created as a headland is eroded by waves?
Sea arches, then sea caves, then sea stacks.
Sea arches, then sea stacks, then sea caves.
Sea caves, then sea arches, then sea stacks.
