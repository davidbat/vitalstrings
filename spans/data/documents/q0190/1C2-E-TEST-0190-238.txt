Red tides can often have a devastating effect on fisheries      is some coastal areas .      Red tides are caused by several species of microscopic plants called phytoplankton.      These species produce strong chemical toxins poisons called toxins.

In Florida red tide typically starts in the Gulf of Mexico      40-80 miles off shore and slowly moves southeasterly with the prevailing ocean      currents toward the Tampa Bay area. As the bloom increases the density of      red tide organisms increase to several million cells in each liter of seawater.      The result is a deadly mass of toxin-containing water moving toward southwest      Florida, leaving a wake of dead and dying fish. These toxins cause extensive      fish kills, contaminate shellfish and create respiratory irritation for people      who live along the shore. The Scandinavian and Japanese fisheries, Caribbean      and South Pacific reef fish, and shellfishing along US. coasts are sometimes      affected by red tides.
The cause of red tides is not well known. Some scientists      think coastal pollution helps produce red tides. In Florida, red tides are      caused by a natural process. Because of the severe economic and public health      effects of red tide, many oceanographers are using satellites such as SeaWiFS      to map the location of red tides, and to understand what causes red tides.
What about Red Snappers?
