How Can     the Moon Affect Tides?
Dont believe     everything you hear, especially around marinas and bait stores where the "old     salts" spin their yarns. When you hear boaters referring to ebb tide, or incoming     tide or outgoing tide, it may be familiar language, but it is not accurate. Tide does not     ebb, nor does it come in or go out.
Tide is defined as the vertical movement of water and only goes up and down.
Current is the horizontal or sideways flow of water. It floods in which makes the         tide rise and ebbs out which makes the tide fall. 
It is     this up and down tidal movement that you should be concerned with and be able to estimate     with some accuracy, especially when entering a potentially shallow port or harbor.     Lets explore some definitions concerning tide.
First of all, tide is     the rise and fall of water caused by gravitational forces of the moon and sun on the     oceans of the earth. Generally speaking, tidal cycles contain two high tides and two low     tides each day. During the time between high and low tide there will obviously be current     flow. The time between high and low tides is a little over 6 hours and the entire tidal     cycle repeats itself approximately fifty minutes later each day.     So if you know that low tide is at 0800 today you can estimate that it will be at 0850     tomorrow.
The difference between     the high tide and low tide is called the range of tide. For instance, if the water depth     at high tide is 20 feet and at low tide is 18 feet, the range of tide is two feet.
There are two types of     currents that you can expect in regard to tides.
Flooding         current is experienced when the tide is rising.
Ebbing         current is experienced when the tide is         falling.
When the tide     has reached it highest and lowest points there is a brief period where there is no current     ebbing or flooding, this is referred to as slack     water.
Although there     are irregularities in some parts of the world, as a general rule the following can be     predicted using publications such as the Tide and Current Tables, using software     specifically designed to estimate tides or by accessing the information about tides online     at BoatSafe Safety Links.

How do the effects of     the sun and the moon affect tide? The gravitational pull of the moon tugs on the surface     of the ocean until its surface mounds up and outward in the direction of the moon. When     the mound of water has reached its highest point it is called high tide. On the side of     the earth opposite the moon, the centrifugal force caused by the earths rotation     produces another mound of water and high tide on the opposite side of the earth. Somewhere     in between these two high tides are two flat areas on the surface of the ocean, these are     low tides.
The moon appears to     rotate around the earth each day, however it is the earths rotation that gives this     appearance. The moon actually orbits the earth in an elliptical pattern, taking 27.3 days     to complete one orbit. The length of time that it takes for the earth to rotate around so     that the moon is in the same position is actually a little over a normal 24 hour day. It     is 24 hours and 50 minutes or a tidal day. That is why the tidal cycle starts     approximately 50 minutes later each day. As the earth rotates, the moons     gravitational force continually mounds the water and that fluid mound moves around the     earth. The actual height of the tide is influenced by the shape of the coastline and depth     of the water.
Two other     areas that need to be covered are "spring tides" and "neap tides." It     was mentioned previously that the tides are affected by both the sun and the moon.     Actually, the suns effect is less than half that of the moon but when these two     bodies are in alignment and pulling in the same direction they cause higher high tides and     lower low tides called spring tides.
On the other hand when     the Sun and Moon are at right angles to one another with the moon pulling one direction     and the sun pulling another there is somewhat of a canceling affect and you get lower high     tides and higher low tides called neap tides.
