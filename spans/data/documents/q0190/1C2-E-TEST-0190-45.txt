Ocean tides are caused mainly by the moon’s gravitation, which tugs at our planet. The moon pulls up the water on the part of the ocean that is turned toward it. At the same time, a second tidal bulge forms-on the Earth’s opposite side. As the moon orbits the Earth, the bulge of water travels over the ocean. When it reaches the coast, the tidal bulge raises the waterline along the shore, causing what is known as high tide. The water is then pulled away, causing low tide. In most places in the world, tides go in and out this way twice each day.
