I know that guy surfing. His name is Joel Puckett. A buddy of mine. If you need proof he's in one of my videos surfing too.

Oh really? Okay I've been trying to figure it out. I had someone else post on my company's FB page that they knew the surfer, but the two names don't match.
Have him email me... info@mansbestmedia.com
I'd like to figure it out soon. Thanks!
