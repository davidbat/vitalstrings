Tides
Tides are caused largely by the gravitational force exerted by astronomical bodies. Other forces do affect tides, for example the friction between the Earth’s crust and the water slows movement but the Earth’s sun and moon are the primary agents for the planet’s tidal systems. The moon’s pull is stronger than the sun’s because it is on average only 376,000km away compared to the sun’s distance of 150 million km. The distance between Earth and the moon remains constant because centrifugal force caused by the Earth’s rotation balances the pull of gravity.
The moon literally draws the water towards it, depleting the levels of water elsewhere. But the centrifugal force on the opposite side of the planet is stronger than the moon’s and it also pulls water towards it. The opposing forces create bulges called high tides on both sides of the Earth. Where the impact of the forces are even, between the bulges, low tides are produced. As the moon moves around the planet, the water levels vary in accordance. There are approximately two high and two low tides per day. The times between the tides vary but there is an average of 12 hours 25 minutes between high tides.
Although the sun’s effect is only two fifths as strong as the moon’s, despite its much larger size, there are times when it works with or against the moon. When the moon is between the sun and the Earth (new moon), both the sun and the moon work together to produce particularly high tides. When the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth to the sun (full moon), both will be working against the centrifugal force and tides will also be higher. Both these events cause spring tides, and occur twice a month.
When the moon is at right angles to the sun, their gravitational forces partly cancel each other out. These result in neap tides and are less extreme.
Some places have weaker tides than others and may have only one tide per day. In the oceans, tides can affect the height of water by about a metre. Areas where the flow of water is restricted, such as bays, can have more of a tidal range. In the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, the tide level ranges by as much as 13-15m on spring tides.
The timing of the tides is incredibly important for many animals. During high tide, thousands of female green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs on the beach. This synchronism means that all the young turtles will hatch out at the same time. Predators will be overwhelmed and many more of the offspring will be able to reach the sea.  Animals living on the coast are constantly affected by the changing sea levels, finding themselves alternately submerged or exposed with every tide.
