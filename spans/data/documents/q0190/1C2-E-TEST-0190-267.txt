WHAT IS A TIDE POOL?
1.
The oceans' shores are constantly in motion. They are a mixture  of both land and sea and never the same from one moment to the next. The  boundary between land and sea constantly changes with the tide's rhythmic rise  and fall. When the tide retreats, seawater trapped in depressions in the rocks  forms tide pools. These shallow pools  and surrounding areas uncovered by the retreating tides are often teeming  animals and plants, which must adapt to environmental extremes to survive.
