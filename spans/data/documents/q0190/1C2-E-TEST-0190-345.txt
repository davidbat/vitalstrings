Tide pools
Â 
Tide pools can be                     the best or worst of microhabitats depending on their                   position on the shore. There are many physical factors at work                   in these pools.  Let's review these                   factors...
Tide Pool Physical Factors
Shape
A                                 large, shallow pool has a large surface area to                                 volume ratio or a lot of the pool is exposed                                 at the surface. A small, deep pool has a small surface area to volume ratio. Shape and volume                                   become important when we consider the other                                 factors that contribute to stress in a tide pool.
Temperature
The                                   temperature of tide pools is affected by air                               temperature and direct sunlight on the pool. Shallow                                   pools with large surface areas are likely to                                   be more affected by temperature. The major impact                                   of temperature changes on organisms is a change                                   in rates of photosynthesis and respiration. For                                   every 10 degrees centigrade,                                   photosynthesis increases by one and a half times                                   and respiration by two to three times. This causes                                   a build up of by-products, such as carbon dioxide                             and oxygen, within the water.
Oxygen
Photosynthesis                                   in plants, especially algae, cause oxygen concentrations                                   to peak in the afternoon. At night, available                                   oxygen is depleted rapidly and animals  migrate                                   to the surface. A pool with a large surface area                                   to volume ratio will allow more oxygen to diffuse                             into the water from the air.
Carbon                             Dioxide and pH
The                                   other result of photosynthesis during the day                                   is that carbon dioxide is taken up by the plants.                                   As the level of carbon dioxide drops, the pH                                   rises, making the water more alkaline. This change                                   is reversed at night when photosynthesis stops                                   but plants and animals continue to respire                                   - using up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide.                                   High levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in the                             water make the pool more acidic.
Salinity
The                                 sun and wind evaporate water from the surface                                 of pools. In isolated tide pools, this                                 causes an increase in salinity (salt-concentration).                                 Heavy rainfall can lower salinity rapidly, however the less dense freshwater often forms a layer above                               the salty water. The mixing is not always uniform                               and animals and plants in the pool's depths may                               remain unaffected. Some species are able to survive                               a wide salinity range.
