Everybody knows Jesus makes the tides work. He does it with his hands somehow. He makes the high tide so poor people can launch their boats and go fishing and he makes the low tide so they can dig clams. That’s why they don’t need unemployment benefits or some over reaching government program like welfare. I’m sure Bill knows this but didn’t want to say. He probably didn’t want to make his viewers feel dumb.

Ahh, the Strawman argument guy peeps in on this topic, no surprise.
You can “prove something” to be true, and until it is proven to be true, it is presumed to be false. You can never, however, prove a negative. I can not prove you can not fly, but you could possibly prove you can. Until you prove you can, I say you can’t. That’s not faith or a “belief”, that’s using logic, reason, physics, and all the other “knowledge” of the world we have available.
There is no hard evidence supporting the xtian “god”, so I don’t believe in it. I don’t believe in Unicorns, either. Both could exist, but until there’s substantial ‘proof’, there’s no point in “dedicating your existence” to something that pretty much mimics “fantasy” and “fairy tale”.
The shame you feel when confronted with the reality of a lack of “god” is on you, not “us”. You don’t want to admit you’ve been wrong, you don’t want to admit you’ve been duped, you don’t want to admit you’ve been a fool.. and you’re, at your core, ashamed to stick to your guns in the face of such obvious foolishness. I have no problem letting you believe what you want, but I have a problem with you trying to take your delusions and make them law governing me. Keep your fantasies to yourself and we’ll get along famously, try to make me live according to your delusion and we’ll have a problem.

Ah yes… the invisible hand of The Lord at work, moving water around for no apparent reason.
I always wondered why these crackpots blame natural distaters on evildoers, and explain them as a punishment from their deity. Wouldn’t an all-powerful god be able to kill evildoers by simply stopping their hearts or exploding their heads, without requiring wind, water, disease, and (most importantly) collateral casualties…?

Next he’ll be rolling back heliocentricity.  Which means the round earth theory might as well go, too.  Germ theory?  He’s never seen one single ‘bug’ cause disease; therefore it must be God smiting the enemies of the house of Abraham.  And electricity!  Wind!  Light!
Who granted the followers of Jesus the ability to *interpret* God’s word as they see fit whenever it matches their needs?  Isn’t that kind of equating one’s self with the Lord?
Which brings up a few interesting bugs in the Christian meme:
-The Prophet had to come from the house of Abraham, via paternal lines.  Kinda tough to do with a virgin birth.
-Pretty much everything in the OT was Jewish-centric (ie, “we” referred to Jews, “they” referred to non-Jews. “Thou Shalt Not Kill”…those in our tribe, was the intention, etc.).  If the Jesus story (NT) was a correction of that, doesn’t it largely refute much of the scary OT stuff the evangelists, fundies and neocons claim as theirs to weild?
-When are we as a culture going to start calling Christianists on their gross incompetence at following the teachings of Jesus?  It should be proclaimed *everywhere* and every time they do something non-Jesus like.
…and on it goes…

Well, if you say so, but I’m not sure where it’s going.  Philo 101, courtesy of wiki:
“Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family, consisting of close to 900 or more species according to TROPICOS (a service of the Missouri Botanical Garden). Other sources quote different numbers of species. According to S.J. Mayo there are about 350-400 formally recognized species whereas according to Croat there are about 700.[1][2] Whichever the exact number of species, the genus is the second largest member of the arum family. Taxonomically the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo or “love” and dendron or “tree”.”

“In short, oceanic tides are caused by the moon’s rotation around the earth”
The moon doesn’t rotate around the earth, it revolves around it.  The earth does not rotate around the sun, it revolves around it.  Rotation is the planetary motion that causes diurnal cycles (i.e., day and night).  Perhaps Mr. Webster got confused by the fact that the moon’s period of rotation and  period of revolution are the same.  Naah, he was just sloppy.
Silverman was wrong, too.  Everyone knows Thor lives in Asgard.  There is no exact Olympian equivalent.  If there were, it would be a cross between Hephaistos and Zeus.

So you can’t explain gravity.  Nobody can…yet.  So what do you do – do you say “God does it” or do you put it on the shelf with the other things that have yet to be explained.  Is your faith in a sky spirit or in the expectation that someday an explanation will be found?

Okay.  Let me explain.  Modern scientific theory suggests that the rise and fall of the oceanic tides are the result of the gravitational influence of the Moon and also the Sun upon the Earth’s waters. Measurements tend to confirm this theory.  Look it up in your Astronomy 101 text book
Now, if you can explain just how gravity works, then you are smarter than Einstein or any other physicist who has ever lived.  Gravity is what it is, whether or not it is the result of a Diivine scheme.
Mr. O’Reilly may be ignorant of Science.  Maybe he is even stupid; I do not know. What I do know is that trying to picture any person who is of a conservative bent as stupid or ignorant because O’Reilly made some absurd statement on Television is wrong. Hence my reference to the liberal Democrat congessman who believes that Guam would tip over if too many people stood on the island.  Maybe you missed that story.

I thought that Einstein showed gravity was curvature of the four dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold we live in. Just a tensor, really. Not so big a deal. Perhaps the Levi-Civita connection confused me. Oh, well, silly me. And I didn’t think it was such a mystery after all. Maybe all that differential geometry used to express it is just too difficult for me to get. I guess I need to go back to some old reference like Hawking and Ellis The large scale structure of space-time. Or maybe some newer reference makes it a mystery. There is an article about general relativity in the latest Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. Maybe I will look in there for a mystery.

i’d never have guessed bill o’reilly had so much in common with insane clown posse.
fuckin’ tidal movements, how do they work?

Yes, we know a lot about what gravity does and we can measure its effect and calculate results, but at the quantum level gravity does not work. You know that. Neither Einstein nor Hawking have explained the paradox. Simply put, we know what gravity does but we cannot explain why.  In that sense it is a mystery.  This fact does not imply the existence of a Supreme Being.  We do not disagree on this issue.
Where we disagree is in the assumption that if Bill O’Reilly is ignorant, then ALL conservative thinkers are also ignorant. Got it?

” Do you Liberal geeks realize that most of us conservative thinkers are embarassed by people like Bill O’Reilly? He is not our standard bearer.”
No, I don’t think we do because these are the people out front.  these are the people with the most popularity and the largest audience.  so if most “conservative thinkers” (an oxymoron if I ever saw one) are embarassed by them….why do you watch?

He went to Harvard and he doesn’t know about tidal movement?
WOW
