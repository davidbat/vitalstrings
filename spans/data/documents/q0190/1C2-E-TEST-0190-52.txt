The          Tidal Zone
Eastern Warm Temperate Zone
In        our walk from the highest shore levels towards the sea, in the Eastern Warm        Temperate Zone of south-eastern Australia, we now come to the Tidal Zone,        sometimes called Littoral or Midlittoral in some texts. This        region may be further subdivided into " high-tide ", " mid-tide ", and " low-tide " levels.
This          region is generally covered and uncovered by the tide at least twice each          day for south-eastern Australia. This is the region which is truly "intertidal".
What          Causes the Tides
Gravitation is an attraction between masses. Large masses such as the Moon, the Earth          and the Sun have a gravitational effect upon one another. If not, the          Earth and the Moon would fly off into space from their orbits around the          Sun.
When          we consider two bodies, gravitation is proportional          to the product of the masses of the two bodies and inversely proportional          to the square of the distance between them.
Although          the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it plays a much larger effect upon          the Earth's tides. The Sun's effect, is only 47% as great as the moon's          effect.
About          70% of the Earth is covered by water, so when the Moon orbits the          Earth, there is a bulge of water underneath it. On the other side of the          Earth is another high-tide water bulge caused by centrifugal force.
The moon orbits the Earth every 27.5 days (called the lunar month),          but the Earth revolves on its axis every 24 hours (one full day).
So,          while the high tide bulge of water lies directly under the Moon, and on          the other side of the Earth, the solid Earth revolves underneath the liquid          bulges of water. In other words, the high tide remains more or less stationary          underneath the moon, while the Earth revolves through it.

Spring          High Tide
When          the Moon and Sun are on the same side of the earth, and all are in a line,          this causes a New Moon. When the Moon is on one side of the Earth          and the Sun is on the other, and all are in line, we get a Full Moon.          Both these situations cause the extra high and low tides called the Spring          Tides, one each lunar month. There are thirteen lunar months          each year.
Neap          High Tide
When          the Sun, Moon and Earth are not in a direct line, the Sun's gravitational          effect works against the Moon, so the tidal variation is not as great.          At the time of the First Quarter phase of the Moon and the Third          Quarter phase of the Moon, we get the not-so-high and not-so-low Neap Tides, one each lunar month.
But          the Earth is not a liquid ball of water, and the land masses of the continents          greatly complicate the effects of the tides and cause all sorts of variations.
The          Eastern and Western Australian Situation
In          both eastern and western Australia we get two high tides and two low tides          every 24 or so hours.
In          south-eastern Australia we have a two metre tidal range, caused by the          Pacific Ocean banking up against the coast as the solid Earth spins under          the blanket of water. So in the "pool" of the Pacific Ocean,          the variation between high and low tide is not so great along the South          American coastline and is greater against the Australian coast.
In          the west, the Indian Ocean banks up against the South African coast, and          the tidal range is not so great along the western Australian coast. South          Western Australia only has a one metre tidal range.
The          Southern and Northern Australian Situation
Not          all of Australia gets two tides each day. Across southern Australia and          northern Australia, due to the canceling or competing effects of the Pacific          and Indian Oceans, there may only be one high tide and one low tide in          24 hours.
Occasionally          on South Australian shores there may be a "dodge tide",          where the tide may remain fairly stationary for a couple of days. If this          occurs during the hot summer months and there is a strong searing wind          blowing from the arid interior, all creatures of the high shore will perish.
South-eastern          Australia, including New South Wales and Victoria and Tasmania, has a          2 metre tidal range, while south-western Australia has a 1 metre tidal          range.
