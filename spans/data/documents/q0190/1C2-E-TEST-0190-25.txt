What Causes Ocean Tides?
Glad you asked...
Ocean tides are caused by the gravitational pull from the moon.  There are different types of tides such as spring tides.  Spring tides occur when there is a full moon.  The moon and sun are both aligned and cause a greater gravitational pull which causes the tides at full moon to be higher than normal.

Then again, this answer might help you...
There are two high tides and two low tides each day. The moon is the cause of ocean tides. Tides are created because the Earth and the moon are attracted to each other like a magnet. The moon tries to pull the Earth closer. However, the Earth is able to hold everything except the water.
