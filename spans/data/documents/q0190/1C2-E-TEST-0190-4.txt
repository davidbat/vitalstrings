Gravitational Pull of the Moon
As the moon revolves around Earth, it exerts gravitational pull and inertial forces. These forces cause a bulge in the oceans on opposite sides of the planet. Since water is more liquid than earth, it allows for more movement. So, as water moves back and forth in relation to the forces of the moon, high and low tides are created. Since the distant of the moon to the earth constantly changes, heights and depths of tides can vary as well, this is known as lunar altitude.
Gravitational Pull of the Sun
Even though the sun is 390 times further away from Earth than our moon, it is 27 million times larger than our moon; therefore, the gravitational pull of the sun is actually 177 times greater than that of the moon. The sun should have a greater tide generating force upon the Earth than the moon, but because of its distance from Earth, it generates approximately only half of the force that the moon does. Also, depending upon the moon's location in relation to the sun, the sun can have a greater or counter effect upon the Earth's tides.
Rotation of the Earth
As the Earth rotates, it creates a centrifugal force.  This force is relation to the revolution and gravitational pull of the moon, which creates a center of gravity between the two planets.  As the two planets spin around this axis, it creates a greater centrifugal force that creates an outward pull, which influences high and low tides as the ocean water tries to find an equilibrium.
Other factors
The oceans do not experience equal tides in every part of the Earth. This is partly due to the shape of the Earth, lunar altitude, currents, weather, ocean floor topography and the shape of the shoreline. In certain areas, the amplitude of tides can be much greater than that of others.  However, sea levels are accurately predicted on a tide chart, which gives information of the exact time for high and low tides.
