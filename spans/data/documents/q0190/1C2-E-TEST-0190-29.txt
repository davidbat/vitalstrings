(r). Ocean Tides
Introduction
An ocean tide refers                         to the cyclic rise and fall of seawater. Tides are caused                         by slight variations in gravitational attraction                         between the Earth and                         the moon and the Sun in                         geometric relationship with locations on the Earth's                         surface. Tides are periodic primarily because of the                         cyclical influence of the Earth's rotation .
The moon is the primary factor controlling                         the temporal rhythm and height of tides (Figure                         8r-1). The moon produces two tidal bulges                         somewhere on the Earth through the effects of gravitational                         attraction. The height of these tidal bulges is controlled                         by the moon's gravitational force and the Earth's gravity                         pulling the water back toward the Earth. At the location                         on the Earth closest to the moon, seawater is drawn toward                         the moon because of the greater strength of gravitational                         attraction. On the opposite side of the Earth, another                         tidal bulge is produced away from the moon. However,                         this bulge is due to the fact that at this point on the                         Earth the force of the moon's gravity is at its weakest.                         Considering this information, any given point on the                         Earth's surface should experience two tidal crests and                         two tidal troughs during each tidal period.
Figure 8r-1: The                             moon's gravitational pull is the primary force responsible                             for the tides on the Earth.

The timing of tidal events is related to                         the Earth's rotation and the revolution of the moon around                         the Earth. If the moon was stationary in space, the tidal                         cycle would be 24 hours long. However, the moon is in                         motion revolving around the Earth. One revolution takes                         about 27 days and adds about 50 minutes to the tidal                         cycle. As a result, the tidal                         period is 24 hours and 50 minutes in length.
The second factor controlling tides on                         the Earth's surface is the Sun's gravity. The height                         of the average solar tide is about 50% the average lunar                         tide. At certain times during the moon's revolution around                         the Earth, the direction of its gravitational attraction                         is aligned with the Sun's (Figure 8r-2). During                         these times the two tide producing bodies act together                         to create the highest and lowest tides of the year. These spring tides occur                         every 14-15 days during full and new moons.

When the gravitational pull of the moon                         and Sun are at right angles to each other, the daily                         tidal variations on the Earth are at their least (Figure 8r-3).                         These events are called neap                         tides and they occur during the first and last                         quarter of the moon.

Types of Tides
The geometric relationship of moon and                         Sun to locations on the Earth's surface results in creation                         of three different types of tides. In parts of the northern                         Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, tides have one high                         and one low water per tidal day (Figure 8r-4).                         These tides are called diurnal                         tides .

Semi-diurnal                             tides have two high and two low waters per                             tidal day (Figure 8r-5). They are common on the Atlantic coasts of the United States and Europe.

Many parts of the world experience mixed                             tides where successive high-water and low-water                             stands differ appreciably (Figure 8r-6). In                             these tides, we have a higher high water and lower                             high water as well as higher low water and lower                             low water. The tides around west coast of Canada                             and the United States are of this type.

The map in Figure 8r-7 shows the geographic                         distribution of these three tide types on the Earth.
