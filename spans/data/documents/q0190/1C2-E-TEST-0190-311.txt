Looking for Low Tides And High Tides? Find it here!
The tides have long ruled human affairs. What is fundamentally a simple matter of gravity, water flow and the position of the moon and sun has led to the creation of poetry, the movement of armies, and historical actions all over the world. The natural world is also responsive to the tides, with various species relying on the movement of the tides for their daily lives.Formally, the tide is the rise and fall of sea levels as the result of gravitational forces from the sun and moon combined with the rotation of the earth. Since the oceans of the world are flexible compared to the rock and soil of the continents, they are highly susceptible to this gravitational pull. The moon creates the largest amount of this force. The area directly under the moon in its orbit, known as the sublunar point, is the location of high tide. Fluid dynamics requires that the area diametrically opposite the sublunar point, the antipodes, also has high tide at the same time. The spaces 90 degrees away from these two points are the low tide spots. These areas move as the moon travels in its orbit.Most coastal areas experience two high tides and two low tides per day, but some only receive one of each daily. This is due to the configuration of the coastline and the alignment of the sun and moon among other factors. The daily tides have a wide range depending on location; some sites see only a rise and fall of a few inches to a foot, while the Bay of Fundy in Canada experiences the largest tidal differences in the world, with the water level changing by 53.5 feet between low and high tide.The tides are of great interest to mariners, as they dictate the availability of seaports. Tidal charts are published and are easily found on the Internet.
