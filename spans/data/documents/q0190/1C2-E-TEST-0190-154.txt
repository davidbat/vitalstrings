toothpicks
 
1. Show students pictures of tide pool animals. Give them                          modeling clay to makes the tide pool animals. To make                          sea urchins you cut a potato in half, paint it black or                          brown, let it dry. Color some toothpicks the same shade                          of black or brown. Now pierce the toothpicks into the                          potato half all around to look like a sea urchin.
2. Fill basin half way up with sand. Spray the sand with                          water. Have students with their hands flatten sand uniformly.                          Now with fingers make a few depressions in the sand for                          the tide pools and put some blue gravel in it. Have students                          put rocks on one side of the basin, then arrange the tide                          pool animals made by the students in the depressions in                          the sand and by the rocks. Now pour water in the basin                          about a couple of inches above the sand making sure not                          to disturb the sand. Now you tilt the basin towards the rocks to simulate high tide. Then tilt the other way for                          low tide. point out to student the depressions filled                          up with water at high tide and became dry at low tide.
Teaching Strategies:
1. Look up tide tables on the internet or the local newspaper                          or weather channel, then have students make up their own                          tide table. Have a sheet with four columns for each student.                          The columns should be labeled where, day, high and low. Then they can record                          the tides every day. The students will notice each day                          the tides occur about 50 minutes later than the previous                          day. Students can learn to draw a simple graph                          on tides or read one made by the teacher as a math activity.
2. Buy a basket of shells from a novelty store then have                          students trace them and notice the colors and patterns                          on the shells. Borrow a shell field guide from the local                          library and identify the shells.
3. Have students do an IntelliPics activity. Click                          here to open instructions for InelliPics
4. If possible take a field trip to a tide pool. it is                          a good idea to have a magnifying glass to look at slimy                          plants, tiny animals, snails, and barnacles.
Evaluation/Assessment:
1. Have students verbalize and tell their classmates                          about how a chosen tide pool animal protects itself when                          the tide goes out.
2. Students who are able to answer worksheet questions                          can be given quizzes to answer.
3. Show students a variety of tide pool animals and have                          them point out which features help them survive the harsh                          environment of the tide pool.
4. Have students identify tide pool animals when there                          are many different kinds of sea life in a poster or picture.
Extension:
Have students make a story from the tide pool animals                          view using Kid Pix or Hyperstudio for Reading and Language                          Arts. Tide pool Scavenger Hunt worksheet can be used to                          learn new vocabulary words for reading and language arts.
Let students build a Tide pool in a large cardboard box                          for art class.
Adaptations:
These lessons can be used for 2nd and 3rd grade students.
