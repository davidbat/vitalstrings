Tides
Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea level resulting from the gravitational interaction and motion of the Sun, Moon and Earth acting on ocean waters. Tidal patterns are modified by other influences such as the shape and depth of oceans and the weather. The combination of factors is complex and causes local tides to vary greatly from one site to another.
Derby has Australiaâ€™s highest tides and one of the highest in the world.
The Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada, has 15m tides. Other high tides occur at Bristol (UK) 14.6m, Mont Saint Michel (France) 12.3m, Puerto Gallegos (Argentina) 13.2m and Bhaunagan (India) 12.2m.
High tides in Western Australia are Derby 11.8m, Yampi Sound 10.9m, Broome 9.8m and Wyndham 8.4m.
Storm conditions can cause higher tide levels than predicted. Tides can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy from analysis of long term tide records. The tide predictions provide the time and height of high and low water for a particular day at a particular place. Spring tides occur every 14 days at the new and full moons. Neap tides occur every 14 days at the half moon.
Tide charts are available from the Derby Visitor Centre.
Online Tide Prediction data is available from the Department for Planning and Infrastructure (DPI) website.
