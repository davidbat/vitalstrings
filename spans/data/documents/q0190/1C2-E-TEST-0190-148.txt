Predictability of Red Tides
Red tides are not predictable, but under certain circumstances, the probability of a red tide can be projected within seven months.  This would have to include information about the ocean's sea surface temperature, the season, climates and currents.  As can be
fig.9 red tide occurrences (Alaska's Marine Resources:            Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, the Alaska Problem)
seen in the graph above, May and June have the highest occurrence of            PSP outbreaks. Other sources document 17 additional occurrences from            1995-97.
The Climatic Effects
Most cases of red tide seasonally occur. They tend to happen in the            late summer an early autumn, although it may sometimes depend on the            different temporal pattern in each region. This happens because at that            time the weather is getting cooler causing winds to blow, which in turn,            upset the settled ocean floor in a process called "upwelling". This            basically means that the nutrient rich water in the deeper parts of            the ocean rises up to the surface. The upwelling also brings up the            dormant cysts, which rest in the sediments on the sea floor. Because            of the good temperature, salinity, and light conditions at the time            of the upwelling, it is very easy for the cysts to germinate, thus is            the first step on its way to a quickly multiplying harmful algae bloom.
Climatic changes greatly affect the frequency of occurrences because            it takes cool winds and a cool climatic temperature for the upwelling            to occur. If the waters are too cold, the germination may not be able            to take place.
Current PSP Monitoring
The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, DEC, is currently            monitoring red tides and PSP outbreaks in the Kachemak Bay and Cook            Inlet region and is shown in fig. 9. The following are all accepted            by the state of Alaska as certified shellfish beaches: Polly Creek-Crescent            River, Jakolof Bay, Kasitsna Bay, Tutka Bay, Halibut Cove Lagoon, Chugachik            Island, Sadie Cove, Peterson Bay, and Little Jakolof Bay. A uniform            Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, PSP, sampling plan will be implemented            once an area has been certified by the Alaska DEC. Approved areas are            those waters where water sampling and marine toxin shoreline sampling            have taken place and that fecal material, pathogens, microorganisms,            poisonous and toxic substances are not present in dangerous concentrations.            These plans have been established so that a grower or harvester is aware            of the sampling requirements over a three year period. This plan also            contains provisions that must be completed prior to permission being            granted for a

reduction in monitoring. Presently, ADEC monitors the west side of            Cook Inlet from Harriet Point to south of Crescent River. You can see            from Figure 9 that this is the opposite side of Cook Inlet from Kachemak            Bay. Razor clams are traditionally harvested from mid May to the end            of August during any year. ADEC takes razor clam samples and analyzes            the whole animal, which is a very conservative testing since the average            person only eats the edible portions, i.e. the body, foot and the neck.            Then, the only processor, Pacific Alaska Shellfish Company in Nikiski            sends in the samples for analysis. Thus, from the period that the fishery            starts in mid May to the end of August someone, either ADEC or the processor,            sends in samples to be analyzed during the twice a month low tide series.
ADEC also samples the area between Clam Gulch and Anchor Point from            time to time on no regular schedule from May through August. This part            of Cook Inlet is just north of Kachemak Bay and is regulated for sport            harvesting only. Commercial digging is not allowed. This area has not            gone through the full water testing and shoreline work to access potential            pollution sources. ADEC doesn't actively monitor this area because of            lack of funding for such activity and they have no jurisdiction on regulating            sport/recreational harvesting activities. Their current regulations            only pertain to the commercial harvest of clams, for resale or profit.
Public Notification
The Public Information Office (PIO) in Juneau disseminates PSP outbreaks            through ADEC's notification system via a press release to the various            radio stations, newspapers and television channels throughout the state.            Also, other state agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Fish and Game, and the Department of Public Safety, Division            of Fish and Wildlife are notified. PSP expert, Mike Ostasz, usually            writes up the press report once the episode is confirmed to be PSP,            and then he sends it to the PIO and awaits approval through his boss            and the Director. Upon approval or modification of the press release,            it is then released.
If someone is thought to have PSP, getting that patient to a medical            facility is the best course of action to follow. If symptoms do occur,            the first thing to do is induce vomiting. This can be done by sticking            a finger down the throat, by drinking salt water, or by taking Syrup            of Ipecac. However, vomiting should not be induced in a semi-conscious            or unconscious victim. Treating for shock is done by placing the patient            in a prone position, elevating the feet, and covering them with a blanket.            Victims should not be given digitalis or alcohol, because these drugs            may increase toxin absorption. Seeking medical attention as soon as            possible is important since severe symptoms may occur rapidly. Mouth            to mouth resuscitation must be administered if there is trouble breathing            until medical personnel take over treatment.
There is no known antidote for the toxin. PSP is a neurotoxin that            blocks movement of sodium through membranes of nerve cells. Without            sodium transmission, nerve cells can't function. This ultimately leads            to the symptoms of PSP: numbness, paralysis, respiratory failure, and            coma.
Program to Monitor the Kachemak Bay Ecosystem            for Red Tides
Our proposal for monitoring the Kachemak Bay for red tides involves            five areas. The first area to monitor will be any illness to humans            that might be due to PSP. We will expect any doctor, hospital or medical            facility to immediately notify the authorities. This is an after the            fact method of monitoring, but easy to set up and important in case            of the failure of the remaining methods.
The mollusk species that are potentially harvestable must also be monitored.            There are various locations around the Bay that are used to harvest            a variety of species. There are some beaches and bays that are being            used for commercial operations but there are also many small but rich            beaches used for domestic and sport use. In those designated areas,            sampling of indicator species maybe carried out. The most important            species is the mussel. The mussels are the first species that become            infested with PSP, but they hold their toxicity for a relatively short            period of time. The butter clams hold their poisons the longest. They            have been known to remain toxic for up to two years after a red tide            has occurred. The razor clams are a species that lie in between. They            do not become toxic as fast as mussels but do not stay polluted as long            as the butter clams.
We also propose to set up vertical mussel and oyster cultures which            could be a part of a local commercial operation which are currently            operating in several of the side bays of Kachemak Bay. They grow on            vertical columns suspended in the tidal waters. The middle portion of            these columns would have the greater chance of picking up PSP, due to            the fact that plankton migrate to the surface for daylight and back            down at night. Therefore, the middle of the column will be exposed twice            as long to any potential PSP carrying algae. Random sampling of these            middle organisms will give us a first indication of a PSP outbreak.
Planktonic tows can also be done every so often and is considered our            third level of monitoring. According to an FDA expert on Toxicology(Hall),            this is a viable monitoring option. This will require people to be trained            to use field scopes to analyze and identify the organisms. This assessment            will also be done in specific locations, as well as in conjunction with            sightings of coloration. To date, all sightings of tides of coloration            have proven to be false alarms in Kachemak Bay. (Every sample taken            has been caused by another nontoxic species.) An interesting point of            observation is that all Kachemak Bay tidal blooms have originated in            Jakalof Bay, as seen in fig11.
Our fourth level of monitoring is in the area of analyzing algal cysts.            Some of the algae in a typical population will become a cyst as seen            in fig. 10. A cyst is a hardened spore that will lie dormant in the            very top of the sediment until upwelling currents bring them to the            surface and conditions are ideal for growth. We feel the potential for            advance PSP warning may be possible if the sediments are skimmed and            analyzed periodically at least during the seasons that PSP is most likely            to occur.
Another area that we feel that needs to be addressed is personal medical            kits. This is not environmental monitoring, but might increase safety            for the general public. A company in Nova Scotia is currently doing            research in this area. The company is developing a personal PSP detection            kit. Developer Ray Roberts describes the MIST Alert rapid test kit as            being similar to a home pregnancy test. "Basically, we have

developed a rapid test kit for PSP which is much like a home pregnancy kit. The test kit gives results in about ten minutes and is extremely easy to use. Applications of the kits are as a harvest management tool to know when it is safe to harvest shellfish, or as a quality control tool in shellfish processing plants. It can also be used in government regulatory labs as an initial screen for PSP.  Our test has the potential to substantially reduce the number of live mice used for testing for PSP, which is the current testing method "(Roberts). The company currently has the trial ongoing with the test kit in Alaska, Norway, Scotland, the United States, Canada and New Zealand. The kits are commercially available now at a cost of twenty US dollars per test.  Personal detection kits are not yet available but the company is currently doing testing work in Kodiak and other parts of the state.
