 
What is Red Tide?
Dictionary.com defines red tide as: A bloom of dinoflagellates that causes reddish discoloration of coastal ocean waters. Certain dinoflagellates of the genus Gonyamlax produce toxins that kill fish and contaminate shellfish. This is an accurate description but it is a little lacking.
Red Tide also kills fish, crustaceans, sea mammals (like manatees and dolphins), and birds.  It causes mild to sever respiratory distress in humans.  It may also cause respiratory distress on other animals, but no research has been done on that to date to our knowledge.  Also unstudied are the long term effects on humans  exposed to red tide toxins for long term periods (like lifeguards).
Red tide kills by paralyzing.
Here’s a video clip of what it does to neighborhoods, canals, waterfront property etc. wherever it goes:
Red tide is a common name for a phenomenon known as a harmful algal bloom, an event in which estuarine or marine algae accumulate rapidly in the water column, or “bloom”. These algae, more correctly termed phytoplankton, are microscopic, single-celled, plant-like organisms that can form dense, visible patches near the water’s surface. Certain species of phytoplankton contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from green to brown to red, and when the algae are present in high concentrations, the water appears to be colored red. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discoloration, and not all discolored waters associated with algal blooms are red. Additionally, red tides are not typically associated with tidal movement of water, hence the preference among scientists to use the term algal bloom.
The term “red tide” is most often used to describe a particular type of harmful algal bloom common to the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and is also called “Florida red tide”. This type of bloom is caused by a species of dinoflagellate known as Karenia brevis, and these blooms occur almost annually along Florida waters. The density of these organisms during a bloom can exceed tens of millions of cells per liter of seawater, and often discolor the water a deep reddish-brown hue.
The most conspicuous effects of red tides are the associated wildlife moralities among marine and coastal species of fish, birds, marine mammals and other organisms. In the case of Florida red tides, these moralities are caused by exposure to a potent neurotoxin produced naturally by Karenia brevis, called brevetoxin.
It is unclear what causes red tides, but the frequency and severity of algal blooms in many parts of the world have been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities. The growth of marine phytoplankton is generally limited by the availability of nitrates and phosphates, which can be abundant in agricultural run-off. Coastal water pollution produced by humans and systematic increase in sea water temperature have also been implicated as contributing factors in red tides. Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the Saharan desert are thought to play a major role in causing red tides. Some algal blooms on the Pacific coast have also been linked to occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as El NiÃ±o events. While red tides in the Gulf of Mexico have been occurring since the time of early explorers such as Cabeza de Vaca it is unclear what initiates these blooms, and how large a role anthropogenic and natural factors play in their development.
Unclear what causes the blooms? Let me expand:
It’s true that Harmful Algal Bloom are a naturally occurring in phenomena.  However despite several Florida government sponsored organizations and the Government of Florida themselves insistently repeating that:
Red Tide is not on the increase
The evidence suggests there is no link between fertilizer polluted run-off and red tide
Residents and tourists really don’t mind red tide.
This web site and other organizations have learned:
Red Tide is definitely on the increase, here’s just one study with evidence of that. Look throughout this site there are more.
The Evidence actually suggest there is a link between red tide and fertilizer-laden runoff.  Here’s one study with evidence of that, Again, look throughout this site or do a search with your favorite search engine, you’ll find more.
Further we note, as others have, that it seems that our top scientific research organizations and our state government is colluding to make sure new research in this area isn’t started, or doesn’t address the relevant questions involved.
The Government of Florida has knowingly, intentionally and repeatedly lied about these two things and probably more.  Here’s just an example of them being caught red handing lying about the connection between red tide and pollution.  Again look through this web site, there are more.
As for people not minding red tide blooms, the irritation they do to humans eyes, nasal passages etc, the large fish kills, the dead birds and pets, well, we find this so ridiculous we won’t even speak on it.
