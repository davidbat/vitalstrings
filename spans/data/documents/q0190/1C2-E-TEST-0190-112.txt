Think of a see saw, with a 100 pound person on the left and a 40 pond kid on the right. In order to make it balance we move the fulcrum of the see saw closer to the heavier side. In the case of the sun and earth though, the sun is so much bigger than the earth in terms of mass, that this fulcrum point is so close to the sun that we pretty muchï»¿ make it the center of the sun.
Now in terms of the tides this level of attraction from the moon and sun pull on the water on earth.
