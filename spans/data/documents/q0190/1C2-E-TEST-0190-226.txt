consequently,
Exercise 1
Read the following paragraphs A & B. Underline the topic sentence and also underline words that specify cause and effect.
A.
The ocean's delicate coral reefs are affected by changes caused by humans. To illustrate, dumping waste products and garbage in the sea results in changes in the natural environment. Due to these changes the ocean becomes polluted, and as a consequence, coral reefs are damaged . When the ocean becomes extensively polluted, coral reefs die.
B.
Good health is affected by a balanced diet. On the other hand, if we do not eat well, this could cause problems and we could become very sick. For instance, if our diet lacks Vitamin A, blindness may result. Many problems affecting the skin and the teeth are due to a lack of Vitamin C. When our diet contains recommended amounts of Vitamin A and C, however, our ability to fight diseases like cancer is greatly affected. So it makes sense to eat well because this results in a longer and healthier life.
