The Activity involves graphing                  tidal data and comparing the information on the graph to the lunar                  phases. Students will create a graph of a month's worth of tidal                  data. This graph will be a line graph that has peaks and dips.                  They will then view a chart of the lunar phases for the same month.                  Students should notice that the peaks and dips are more pronounced                  when the moon is in its full or new phases. The peak and dips                  are less pronounced when the moon is only half full. Through this                  activity, students should realize that the highest and lowest                  tides every month occur during the full and new moon phases. The                  smallest changes between high and low tide occur during the half                  moon phases each month.
Tools                      and Resources
Hardware                used in this lesson:
Computer: With keyboard, mouse, and operating system such as Windows                95
Printer- (optional): For printing out instructions and assessments                for the class or for printing student work (graphs)
Projector- (optional): Such as a Proxima projector, that is capable                of projecting computer images onto a screen so that the whole class                may view the lesson along with the teacher
Software used in this lesson:
Microsoft EXCEL: To create graphs of tidal data
Microsoft WORD: To view printable documents and print them
Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator: To view the lesson,                access the links, data, and pictures
Web sites used in the lesson:
Ask Yahoo :                This site describes how sea level is calculated and is used in the                Presentation of the lesson.
Anchorage,                AK : This site has a photograph of the water level measuring                device and station in Alaska.
Satellite : This site                describes how sea level is measured using a satellite. It is very                complicated and can be an optional site for students to visit.
Why                Sea Level Changes : This link brings up the NOAA page about tides                and what causes them. It is a long page, but the students should                read the first to paragraphs to access information about tidal changes.
Moon Phases : Clicking                on this link will open up a chart that is to be used with the activity.                The lunar phases for the month of February 2000 can be brought up                so that they may be compared with the tidal data from the students'                graphs. The chart will show the full, new, and half phases of the                moon during that month.
More                Information on Gravity and Tides : This site provides a written                description of how the gravity of the sun and moon affect the tides.
Extensions and Modifications (Optional)
As an extension, some students may                      want to see the source for the data from the spreadsheet.                      The teacher may have students access this information, along                      with the steps we followed to build the spreadsheet. You can                      access an online version of this challenging extension activity                      at http://oceandrilling.coe.tamu.edu/curriculum/Sea_Level/Tides/                      Extension_Activity_Pages/ activity.html . Other options                      to extend the lesson include having students view related                      links and pages and share their findings with the class.
This lesson may be modified in its presentation. The teacher                      may want to do the lesson from the computer, projecting the                      information on a screen in front of the class and asking questions                      along the way. Presenting the lesson in this way may assist                      students who are not comfortable with navigating around the                      Internet or in classrooms where there are few computers or                      Internet connections.
