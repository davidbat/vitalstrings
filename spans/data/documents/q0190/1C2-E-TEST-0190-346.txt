“Thank you very much for the disc which I think is quite brilliant
I am in fact a shore-
based RYA instructor ... teaching at night school. This year we are doing the day-
skipper  
Your disc has given me some good ideas! Especially mnemonics for lights and the illustration of depth in which to anchor.
We have already covered ColRegs and Tides but with your permission I would like to use a few (not many) of your illustrations for revision. However I shall certainly recommend your disc to the course members ... and also to students from previous years for refreshing.”

ColRegs, Tides and Stability Resource
Welcome to the site.  It’s aimed mainly at leisure sailors, especially those studying for – and training -
RYA certificates.  However, even STCW candidates have found the ColRegs and stability elements valuable
There three separate parts on this website:
-
ColRegs – with hundreds of illustrations and animations
-
Tides – causes, predictions and worked examples.  This includes printable sheets to help with interpolation and simplify secondary port calculation.  This part was not intended for web-
type hosting so the graphics are large.  This means some systems may be slow to download.  Be patient, it’s worth it
-
Stability – concentrating on simple explanations with animations.  This part is still under development
Each is entirely self-
contained. Once you’re in the topic you’ll find the relevant site map a very quick and convenient way to navigate within the section.  The ColRegs and stability sections have a powerful search capability

There’s enough in the discs for a Yachtmaster candidate -
but everything’s in “bite-
sized” chunks
If you’re not yet ready for Yachtmaster, just take what you need!
I was selling the first two parts world-
wide on discs, and getting great feedback.  Unfortunately some people liked the discs so much that they decided to sell copies.  One person told me that a lecturer was selling copies to students for more than 4 times the price I was charging!  Rather than put the price up by placing expensive copy-
protection on each disc  I’ve decided to make the materials available free  
Who knows, some generous souls may contribute a few pence …
