Tides are period ic rises and falls of large bodies of water. Tides are caused by the gravitation al interaction between the Earth and the Moon . The gravitation al attraction of the moon causes the ocean s to bulge out in the direction of the moon .
Tides and
Gravitation al Locking
We have introduced tides in our earlier discussion of the Moon 's observational chara cteristics through the effect of the Moon on the Earth 's ocean s, but the effect is much more general, ...
Tides
Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the influence of the Moon on the Earth are the ocean tides, particularly the spring tide s where the gravitation al pull of the Sun and Moon combine to give the greatest effect.
Tides are the rising of Earth 's ocean surface caused by the tidal force s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the ocean s.

Tides
(a) A differential gravitation al force . In the Galaxy , a tide results because the Milky Way 's gravity pulls more strongly on the side of an object facing the Galactic center than on the object's other side, so the object may get torn apart.

Ocean tides
Earth 's ocean tides are initiated by the tidal force (a gradient in intensity) of Moon 's gravity and are magnified by a host of effects in Earth 's ocean s.
Tides make Io fiery. Of course, those are not like ocean tides on Earth . Rather, they are tidal bulge s in the solid crust of the moon Io.
Tides and currents impact Pontchartrain's blue crabs from the very start of their life cycle . After mating, females release their eggs at the peak of high tide , just as the tide is about to retreat back toward the Gulf.
Tides occur because the gravitation al force between two bodies decreases with distance . Gravitation is the universal force of attraction between all matter. It holds astronomical bodies together and attracts different bodies toward each other.
tides Rising and falling motion that bodies of water follow, exhibiting daily, month ly and yearly cycle s. Ocean tides on Earth are caused by competing gravitation al pull of the Moon and Sun on different regions of the Earth .
Tides are a very complex phenomena, yet they can be boiled down to a few key concepts. The first to develop an accurate theory of the tides was Sir Isaac Newton over 300 years ago.

The tides the Moon created may have played a role in getting life to move out of the ocean s, since some animals would be trapped in the intertidal zone and adapted to being out of water for a period of time .
Neap tide s are especially weak . They occur when the gravitation al force s of the Moon and the sun are perpendicular to one another (with respect to the Earth ). Neap tide s occur during quarter moons.
Land tides occur on every object in the Solar System (if it has &QUOT;land&QUOT;). They cause friction and affect the orientation of many satellite s. Here's how.

Spring tide s - The tides of the ocean are at their highest when the earth , moon , and sun are in a line.
Star - a ball of gas that makes its own light and heat because of nuclear reaction in its center.
PLEIADES , ATLANTIDES or Vergiliae, in astronomy , a group of stars situated in the constellation Taurus . They are supposed to be referred to in the Old Testament (Job. ix. 9, xxxviii. 31).
What effect do the tides have on the Earth 's rotation rate?
Why is Earth the only planet with an ozone layer ? And why is it the only one with life and water?

Both the sun and moon produce atmospheric tides; and there exist both gravitation al tides and thermal tides.
Ocean ic tides actually rotate around each ocean basin as vast gyres around several amphidromic points where no tide exists.
Moreover, the distortion of the two caused by tides and rotation renders the binary continuously variable even when there is no actual eclipse going on, as we see different projections of the distorted surfaces as the stars go around each other.
Its tides help stir the ocean s and create tidal pools in which life could have first developed.
The gravitation al influence of the moon is chiefly responsible for the tides of the earth 's ocean s, the twice-daily rise and fall of sea level.
The gravitation al attraction between the Earth and the Moon gives rise to the lunar tides in the ocean . Because the ocean s are fluid, along the radial line from the Earth to the Moon they contain two bulge s caused by the attraction.
The most obvious is the tides. The Moon 's gravitation al attraction is stronger on the side of the Earth nearest to the Moon and weaker on the opposite side.
Atmospheric electricity, except for that associated with charges within a cloud and lightning , results from the ionization of the atmosphere by solar radiation and from the movement of clouds of ions carried by atmospheric tides.
Io's vulcan ism results from the tremendous land tides caused by 's tremendous gravity flexing it over its eccentric orbit (Peale et al. 1979). The major gas is SO2, but there may also be O2 and Na.
The tidal force (so named because it accounts for the tides on the Earth ) is due to a body receiving different amounts of gravitation al force .
Nucleotides in one DNA strand have specific matches with nucleotides in the other DNA strand because of the chemical affinity of the bases.
As the years progressed, Newton completed his work on universal gravitation , diffraction of light , centrifugal force , centripetal force , inverse-square law , bodies in motion and the variations in tides due to gravity .
Tides! But the tides on Io are not like ocean tides we're familiar with on Earth . The gravitation al field s of Jupiter and its large moons Europa and Ganymede cause tidal bulge s in the solid crust of Io that are as high as 100 meters (330 feet).
Anglo-Saxon ~: {sometimes just Saxon ~} a sundial from the Anglo-Saxon period (c 650 - 1050 AD); designed to show unequal hours, or the basic tides, with a horizon tal gnomon .
Protein s are sometimes referred to as macromolecular polypeptides because they are very large molecule s and because the amino acid s of which they are composed are joined by peptide bonds.
How does the moon cause tides on earth ?
The gravitation al pull of the moon causes the earth 's ocean s to bulge . This bulge is the high tide .

Tides are caused by the gravitation al interaction between the Earth and the Moon . The gravitation al attraction of the moon causes the ocean s to bulge out in the direction of the moon .
The tides on Earth raise the water level by perhaps one meter at the most, and raise the land up to 30 cm (one foot). The huge mass of Jupiter , however, raises the surface of Io by an astonishing 10 meters (32 feet).
And so time was told by the ebb and flow of tides, by the ripening of the strawberries, by the Sun 's position in the sky , by watching stars rise and fall , or by knowing when the bears wake from hibernation.
At the singularity , the gravitation al tides diverge; no solid object can even theoretically survive hitting the singularity .
The Moon 's gravitation is the cause of the tides on Earth . The same effect has lead to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to revolve around the Earth , meaning it always presents the same face to the planet .
53 billion years ago, provides ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planet 's rotation . Between approximately 3.8 billion and 4.

In addition to the Moon , the Sun also attracts water on Earth . When the Moon is new or full, the effects from the Moon and the Sun will rein force each other. The high tides will be higher than the high tides at other times.

Postulated the solar system evolved from a large flattened cloud of gas, published differential equations describing planet ary orbit s and tides, determined the masses of Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus , applied probability theory to errors in observations.
There is a gravitation al pull between the Earth and the Moon , which causes the ocean tides.

Singularity
The center of a black hole , where the curvature of space time is maximal. At the singularity , the gravitation al tides diverge. Theoretically, no solid object can survive hitting the singularity .
Our planet 's Moon is the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System . Only three moons of Jupiter ( Ganymede , Callisto , and Io) and Saturn 's moon Titan are larger. The Moon 's gravitation al pull on the Earth is so strong that it affects our ocean 's tides.
a comet , but modern versions of this theory invoke a passing star . The gaseous debris torn from the sun by tidal force s is supposed to have condensed into the planet s; however, this theory has been replaced by the nebular theory . [Silk90]

The two stars orbit so close to each other (0.062 AUs) that, as Star B swelled up to be a giant star , its companion Star A could produce tides in Star B that causes gas in B's now swollen outer envelope to flow to Star A.
