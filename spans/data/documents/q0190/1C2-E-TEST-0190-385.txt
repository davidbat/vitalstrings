Worldwide - Permanent
     Fed up with spending a fortune on Tide Tables? Need the tides for your landfall? Ever tried buying tables for Canada or the U.S. when you're in the Caribbean getting ready to sail North? Ever wondered why there isn't one set of tables for the whole of the English Channel or the whole of the Eastern American seaboard?
     Here's some tidal prediction software that covers the world and is valid forever!
 
     The "Monthly Screen" here gives a graphical representation of the range of highs and lows throughout the period with the springs and neaps appearing clearly. The Table scrolls for the month, and will print out hard copy on registered copies. See also the Daily screen
     If you don't have a computer on board, print out the Tables in your home or office before you go sailing!
