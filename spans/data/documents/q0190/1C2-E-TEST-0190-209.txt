Florida red tide is the generic term for a bloom of a microscopic alga (a plant-like organism) called Karenia brevis.
 
What causes a Florida red tide?
Florida red tide, or Karenia brevis, needs three components to form a bloom.  The first is biology- the organism. The second is the correct chemistry (natural or man made nutrients for growth).  And the third component is the right physical conditions to act as a concentrating and transport mechanism. There is probably not just 1 'recipe' to cause a Florida red tide bloom.  Tests are being conducted to see if coastal nutrients enhance or prolong blooms.
