By far the most important factor affecting the movement of water across the ocean is the tides. Tides are great bulges of water caused by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. Attracted by gravity, these bulges move around the Earth’s oceans, causing water levels to rise and fall. Typically water will rise for about six hours, followed by six hours of falling water depths.
