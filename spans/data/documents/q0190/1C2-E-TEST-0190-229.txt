1) If ice is floating in water, and then melts, the level of the water does not change.  This is because, even though ice is less dense than liquid water, it is more voluminous.
2) If ice is sitting on a mountain above the water, and then melts and flows into the water, it adds to the volume of the water and the water level increases.
Most of the ice on Earth is in situation #2.
