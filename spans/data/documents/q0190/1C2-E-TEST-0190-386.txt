What is the intertidal zone?
At                      the border between land and ocean there exists a wondrous                      diversity of life that can only be viewed by land lubbers                      at certain times of the day, and at other times surrenders                      itself to the fish and the crabs. This favourite location                  of beach combers is, of course, the intertidal zone!
 
It's                    nothing at all when the tide is high
It's just a bunch of waves
They whip all around the rocks
And chase all the fish into caves
But if you get there when the tide is low
And the pool is clear and clean
You can see to the bottom
The damnedest collection of creeps
you ever seen
Hungry flowers that feed on fish
Scooping in whatever comes
Crabs that grab another crab
And chew his legs, the dirty bum!
Starfish having himself a lunch
Eats a mussel off a shell
Shrimps and limpets and snails and eels
What a smelly tale they tell
Biting each other and eating each other
and lousing up the sea
Stupid sons of fishes, if you're asking me!

The purpose of the following pages is to provide an introduction to intertidal (littoral) ecology and to provide a basic field guide for the rocky beaches of south west British Columbia (north west Washington State). If you don't enjoy the pleasure of living by the ocean, this guide can give you an online experience. Due to seasonal changes in the abundance's of some species, this guide is by no means complete, but hopefully will be added to as the occasion arises. Feel free to print off, or download, photos and information for educational use.

Introduction
Intertidal organisms have become specially adapted to survive the                rapid and significant changes in temperature, salinity, moisture,                pH, dissolved oxygen, and food supply that occur on a daily basis                due to the movement of the tides. Different plants and animals have                excelled at dealing with different problems, and, as a result, the                rocky intertidal is composed of a series of bands - representing                dominant species at different tidal heights. This distribution pattern                of different species along the shore is referred to as vertical,                or intertidal, zonation. Typically, physical stresses set upper                boundaries and biological stresses (competition, predation etc.)                set lower boundaries.
The size and species composition of the intertidal will vary with                degree of exposure. Large waves increase the size of the supralittoral                ("splash") zone, and allow species to live higher in the                intertidal. High levels of wave action also select for certain species                and morphologies that can withstand the large forces without being                ripped off of the rocks. The following is a brief overview of physical                and biological characteristics of different regions in the intertidal.
The                Supra-littoral Zone
The size of this zone depends on slope, splash, climate, and amount                of shade. This zone is only covered by water during the                  highest high tides and marine organisms found here are                adept at surviving in these arid conditions. Dissolved nutrients                and oxygen are limited in the supralittoral and it is sparsley populated. Organisms found here are: black lichen, coralline algae, some small                green algae and small, herbivorous snails and limpets. Some littorine                snails have become so adapted to a dry environment that they will                drown if submersed for any length of time! A barnacle dominated              zone is found just below the lichen, in the upper mid-littoral.

The                Mid-littoral Zone
Increased submergence time makes this zone more                favourable for many species and the major biological factor at work                is competition for space. This zone is dominated by mussels, which                would threaten to take over the entire zone if it wasn't for the                voraciousness of their main predator - the seastar, Pisaster                  ochraceous.
Pisaster is called a "keystone species" because it affects the                diversity of the area more so than one would expect based on its                numbers. Some examples of other species found here are: snails,                limpets, barnacles, chitons, Fucus (rock weed), polychaetes,                small anemones, and shore crabs. Obviously, this is a very busy                place!
 
 
The Low-littoral Zone
The highest level of dissolved nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)                and plankton are found in this region, as it is normally                  covered by water. The high concentration of nutrients makes                the low intertidal a favourite place for macro algae. As a result,                many grazers are also found here. Large anemones, seastars, sponges,                flat worms, crabs and nudibranchs all make their home in the low              littoral.

Tide                Pools
Each tide pool is a unique environment formed in rocky depressions                by the receding tide. Tide pool organisms face large and sudden                changes in salinity, temperature, pH and other factors due to tidal                movements. As a result, residents have many special adaptations.                Tide pools differ from each other depending on depth and height                in the intertidal. Anemones, sea urchins, barnacles, dog whelks,                and sculpins create intricate interactions in these tiny, isolated                micro-habitats.
