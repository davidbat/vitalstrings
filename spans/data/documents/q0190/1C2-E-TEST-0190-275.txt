In each what-if    scenario, I make one change in Earth's environment and then consider the implications    of that change. In this example, I form a world identical to Earth -- except    that it never acquired a Moon. I call the new world Solon to emphasize    its solo existence. To understand how Solon would differ from Earth, we need    to know how the Moon is affecting Earth today and, working back in time, deduce    its effects over the Earth's lifetime. The most obvious effect that the Moon    has on Earth is to produce tides (see figure 1 ). Tides don't    just lift boats and uncover clam flats; they have caused profound changes to    our world.

The tides are one of the most important          ways that the Moon affects life on Earth. They are the result of the fact          that the Moon's gravitational pull does not affect all parts of Earth          equally: The lunar gravity exerts a stronger pull on the parts of Earth          that are closer to the Moon. This tugs the oceans ever so slightly toward          the Moon. The effect is small -- it lifts the surface of the ocean by          less than 1 meter -- but enough to create a wave that travels around the          globe as Earth rotates. As this wave enters shallow coastal waters, it          increases in size. Photos courtesy of John Neff, University of Iowa.
Tides    occur because the gravitational force between two bodies decreases with distance.    Gravitation is the universal force of attraction between all matter. It holds    astronomical bodies together and attracts different bodies toward each other.    Because gravity tugs on nearby things more strongly than on distant things,    the oceans closest to the Moon feel the greatest attraction to the Moon. Being    fluid, these nearby oceans move upward in response to the Moon's pull, until    there is a balance between the upward force from the Moon and the downward force    from Earth. The high tide on the far side of the Earth occurs because these    most distant oceans feel the least attraction to the Moon. In essence, they    are left behind as the Moon pulls the other parts of Earth toward itself with    greater force.
In 1897 George    Darwin, son of Charles, suggested that tides are causing the Moon to spiral    away from us. His hypothesis was confirmed in 1969 after the Apollo 12 astronauts placed corner reflectors (like the red and orange ones on a car)    on the Moon. By firing lasers from Earth to the Moon, off the corner reflectors,    and back again, astronomers measured the round-trip time and, hence, the distance    to the Moon. Repeating the experiment over several years, they confirmed Darwin's    prediction. The Moon is receding at 2 inches per year.
To understand    why the Moon is fleeing from us, imagine for a moment that neither Earth nor    Moon rotated and that the Sun's tidal effect could be ignored. In this case,    one of the two high ocean tides would be directly between Earth and Moon, while    the other would be on the opposite side of Earth from the Moon (see figure    2a ).

An          astronaut's view of ocean tides. This is a much-exaggerated view of the          tides as you might see them if you could fly high enough above Earth and          Moon. The imbalanced gravitational pull of the Moon causes the oceans          to be slightly non-spherical, creating two high tides and two low tides.          Of course, the actual tides would be much smaller than shown in these          two diagrams.
Suppose, for the moment, that Earth did not rotate (a). In this case,          the two high tides would lie on the straight line from the center of the          Moon to the center of Earth. The gravitational force would be directly          from the center of the Moon to the center of Earth.
Now take a look at what happens on the rotating Earth (b). Because Earth          rotates faster (once every 24 hours) than the Moon revolves (once every          29 days), the high tides are not aligned as above. Instead, the rotation          pulls the tides around, so that the high tide closest to the Moon outpaces          the Moon. This nearer high tide exerts a gravitational force on the Moon,          causing the Moon to spiral outward. In return, the Moon exerts a gravitational          force on the high tide, causing Earth to rotate slower. Diagram by Kathleen          L. Blakeslee.
Now add back the    Earth's rotation. Earth rotates in the same direction that the Moon orbits,    but Earth spins much faster (once a day) than the Moon goes around it (every    29 days). The rapid rotation causes the high tide to be pulled slightly ahead    of the Moon (see figure 2b ). This tide gives Earth a handle    to crank up the Moon's orbit. The high tide pulls the Moon forward in its orbit,    causing the Moon to accelerate and, therefore, to spiral away.
