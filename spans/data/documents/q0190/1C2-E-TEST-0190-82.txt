The Moon pulls the Earth's water towards it because of gravity, then the Earth rotates. When the Earth rotates try to think of the water as staying still, inline with the Moon. The land and ocean floor rotates and the ocean doesn't. When the land approaching the Moon catches up with the water the effect of a high tide is experienced.
Draw a circle to represent Earth
At top label, Moon, Water bulge, water pulled towards Moon, any land at high tide
At left and right label any land at low tide
At bottom label, Water bulge, water pulled to Earth and Moon, any land at high tide
On the other side of the planet the water is pulled towards the combined centre of gravity of Earth and Moon.
This is why you have 2 high tides per day.
The high tide times change daily because the position of the Moon changes as the Moon orbits Earth (28.5 days orbital period)
It is obvisouly a lot more complex than that in real life due to ocean currents, wind patterns / low pressure systems and the effects of the Sun's gravity however the Moon is the most influential and hence dominates all other forces considerably. The other contributors mearly effect the height of high tide.
Spring tide I think is more to do with the Earth's tilt as it occurs once a year when the Earth's position in space dictates that the north pole points towards the Sun as directly as possible. (twice a year if you count the southern hemisphere spring tide). It can not be a combination of the Sun and Moon as such, otherwise we would have a spring high tide every month.
Its not just oceans that are tidal many lakes throughout the world are also tidal including Lake Windermere in the English Lake District.
