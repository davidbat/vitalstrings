Introduction
The word "tides" is a generic term used to define the alternating  rise and fall in sea level with respect to the land, produced by the  gravitational attraction of the moon and the sun.  To a much smaller extent,  tides also occur in large lakes, the atmosphere, and within the solid crust of  the earth, acted upon by these same gravitational forces of the moon and sun.   Additional nonastronomical factors such as configuration of the coastline, local  depth of the water, ocean-floor topography, and other hydrographic and  meteorological influences may play an important role in altering the range,  interval between high and low water, an times of arrival of the tides.
The most familiar evidence of the tides along our seashores is the observed  recurrence of high and low water - usually, but not always, twice daily.  The  term tide correctly refers only to such a relatively short-period,   astronomically induced vertical change in the height of the sea surface  (exclusive of wind-actuated waves and swell); the expression tidal current  relates to accompanying periodic horizontal movement of the ocean water, both  near the coast and offshore (but as distinct from the continuous, stream-flow  type of ocean current).
Knowledge of the times, heights, and extent of inflow and outflow of tidal  waters is of importance in a wide range of practical applications such as the  following: Navigation through intracoastal waterways, and within estuaries,  bays, and harbors; work on harbor engineering projects, such as the construction  of bridges, docks, breakwaters, and deep-water channels; the establishment of  standard chart datums for hydrography and for demarcation of a base line or "legal  coastline" for fixing offshore territorial limits both on the sea surface  and on the submerged lands of the Continental Shelf; provision of information  necessary for underwater demolition activities and other military engineering  uses; and the furnishing of data indispensable to fishing, boating, surfing, and  a considerable variety of related water sport activities.
