News
February 2010: Finally restored the WXTide32 forums using freeforums.org.  I have had little time to answer email to this will serve as a user-to-user forum.
February 2007: Released version 4.7 to implement new U.S. timezones and a couple bug fixes (see change list ).
July 2006: It has come to our attention that there is at least one person selling WXTide32 on eBay.  Selling WXTide32 is in direct violation of the GNU license under which the software is released and I have notified eBay of the violation.
June 2006: Release version 4.6 adds mostly bug fixes.
May 2006:We have added the ability to download files directly from this web site.  See the download page.
May 2006:We are on our new web host and busy making sure most of the sites are still working.  AffordableHost, our previous (and never again) provider, just could not keep the server they put us on going for more than a few hours at a time.  Not only were we unable to send email for the past 3 weeks, but the web sites were up and down like the tides.  Being able to respond to email will be a relief.  We thank you for your patience.
Errata and reported anomalies
The reference station Norwegian Bay, W. Coast, Australia has been found to be totally inaccurate.  To get correct tides for that location generate a User Station with Carnarvon, Australia as the reference station and use time offsets of -8 minutes to both the low and high tide times.
WXTide32 revision history
Changed: Implemented new U.S. timezones.
