Tides                                at the Bay of Fundy
The tides in Canada's Bay of Fundy                            are the most extreme in the world. Because of the unique                            shape of the bay, the difference in water level between                            high tide and low tide can be as much as 48 feet (14                            meters). Observing tidal changes over time at any coastal                            location can show interesting patterns. These patterns                            can reveal the relationship between tides and the lunar                            cycle.

In this investigation, youll be examining                                  tide images from Cape Porpoise Harbor, Maine.                                  By observing the tide patterns, you'll be able                                  to make a connection between tides and phases                                  of the moon.
