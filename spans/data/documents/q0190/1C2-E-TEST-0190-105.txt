Tides:
causes of the tides:
although tides were known to the ancients and the Roman scholar Seneca         linked them with the moon, an understanding of them did         not come until Sir Isaac Newton's Principia in 1687.
the rising tide is called a flood (from 13thC English sailors term flod) & the falling tide is called an ebb
tides are governed by the relative positions of the moon , and secondarily     of the sun, both of which exert a gravitational pull and attract the waters     of the earth towards them as well as many other factors including ocean     depth, coastal topography, tilt of the earth, all of which create some 120     tides of which a few are dominant. Wind and storm         surge also adds to tide heights;
the sun exerts a gravitational pull 180x as strong as the moon's         gravitational pull on earth, but the variation in the moon's force is         2.2x larger than the variation in the sun's force, resulting in the moon         creating the major variance in tides.
although it is the gravitation of the moon & the sun that raises         the tides, the energy of the churning waters is extracted from the         rotational energy of the earth spinning on its axis.

tidal friction:
tidal friction is the friction of the earth's waters moving over the         earth's solid surface as a result of the tides.
tidal friction both lengthens the day by 1 second every 50,000yrs (or         2msec per century and contributes to the need to add leap         seconds ) and         increases the size of the orbit of the moon (and how long it takes to         revolve around the earth). In a few billion years, the length of the day         will have increased to the same length as the moon's revolution around         the earth of approx. 40 days, and the moon will appear stationary in our         skies. The solar tides will then cause the moon to approach the earth         once more.
in fact, the earth exerts a much greater gravitional pull on the moon         resulting in tides on the moon which slowed down the rotation of the         moon to be in synch with its revolution around earth so that both take         27 days and thus always has the same side facing earth, thus we always         see the same part of the moon!
in addition, the daily tides create much smaller daily variations to         earth's rate of rotation of +/- 40microseconds.
height of tides:
the water level with time is approximately a sinusoidal curve with a     wavelength of 12-13hrs, ie. there are two high tides and two low tides every     25hrs
tidal ranges are dependent on:
distance of moon-earth (greatest at perigee):
as the moon's orbit around the earth is an ellipse & not a                 circle, when it is at its closest to earth (perigee) once a                 lunar month, it's tidal influence is 30-48% greater than when it                 is at its far point (apogee) as although it only comes 9-14%                 closer at perigee than apogee, gravitational forces vary                 inversely with the square of the distance and the variation in                 gravitational forces vary inversely with the cube of the                 distance. Indeed, at Minas Basin, it is this factor that has a                 more important influence on the tidal range than the spring or                 neap tides , as the tidal range increases by 3-6m at perigee.
part of the lunar cycle (greatest near New Moon - the spring             tide):
highest high tides and lowest low tides each month occur around the time     of the new moon and secondarily around the time (usually after) the full     moon as the gravitational pull of moon and sun are in the same direction,         these are called " spring tides " although they have no relation to the season spring.
a proxigean spring tide is an unusually high tide at New             Moon when moon is at perigee and occurs at most once every 1.5yrs.
lowest high tides and highest low tides occur around the time of the first & last quarter moons as the pull of the moon is at right angles to the         pull of the sun, these tides are called "neap tides".

highest tidal ranges occur at:
Minas basin ,             the eastern extremity of the Bay of Fundy between New             Brunswick  and Nova Scotia:
avg. range is 12m but can reach 16m, at low tide, Wolfville's                 harbour is empty!
near the mid-point of an incoming tide, a tidal bore may be                 seen tumbling upstream in some of the rivers flowing into the                 basin. A tidal bore forms when the incoming tide pushes                 its way upstream against the outgoing freshwater flow of the                 river.
at Cape Split, the awesome display of the roaring incoming                 tides and its currents exceed 8 knots (4m/s) and the flow in the                 deep 5km wide channel on the north side of Cape Split equals the                 combined flow of all streams & rivers of earth (4 cubic km                 per hour). 3 hours later the spectacle pauses & then begins                 flowing in the opposite direction. The 14 billion tonnes of                 water entering actually causes the Nova Scotia countryside to tilt slightly under the immense load.
highest tides occur a day or two after the astronomical peak.
this is mainly due to resonance of the tidal system which is                 effectively bounded at this outer end by the edge of the                 continental shelf with its ~40:1 increase in depth. The system                 has a natural period of approx. 13hrs which is close to the 12h                 25m period of the dominant but relatively gentle lunar tide of                 the Atlantic Ocean.

timing of tides:
each subsequent day, the high tide of the same part of the day is 34 to     71min later than that on the previous day depending on the phase of the moon     and whether it is low tide or high tide as they are not fully symmetrical.
the reason for this is the revolution of the moon around the earth         which takes ~27 days and as there are 24hours in a day, high tide,         ignoring other effects such as the sun, local topography, etc, would         occur 24/27 of an hour later each day, at the time the moon is highest         in the sky or some 12h 25m later when it is directly underneath us.
thus if you want to get low tide at sunrise or sunset for photography,         this timing will approx. recur in Victoria coast every new moon or full         moon,         although the actual height will depend on the position of moon & sun         and the exact timing depending on the season.
In actual fact on the Victorian surf coast, the low tide will be         approx. at sunrise at new moon & full moon for Oct-March with the         subsequent low tide approx. 12.5hrs later (ie. before sunset). In March & Sept, during the equinoxes when daylight duration = night         duration, low tide will occur at both sunrise and sunset during a full         moon or new moon. From April to September, low tide tends to occur at         sunset at new moon & full moon with the preceding low tide ~12.5hrs         earlier (ie. before sunrise).
local lag times:
topographic features such as bays, estuaries have "lag             time" from the regional oceanic high tide depending on the             distance from the opening to the ocean, the narrowness of the             opening and the volume of the bay.
for example Port Phillip Bay in Victoria:
some places such as Gulf of Carpentaria have only one high tide a             day as the lag time is about 12hrs as it is a long way from the             Indian Ocean "entrance" and the Pacific Ocean "entrance" is too small to be effective at allowing rapid             tidal equilibrium. This 12hr lag time coincides with the 12hr cycle             of oceanic tides and one tide each day gets nullified. (see as the             Karumba tides)
tide prediction charts:
the 1st official tide charts were issued by the British Admiralty in         1833 & the US began to compile data in 1853.

tidal currents:
high velocity tidal currents can be produced at inlets to seas, bays,         which can make many of these impossible to navigate at times when the         current is not slack (eg. the Saltens Maelstrom, Norway). Ships caught         in a swirl of water can be hurled against rocks at high speed & crushed to pieces.
in some places, tidal currents are being used to generate electricity
