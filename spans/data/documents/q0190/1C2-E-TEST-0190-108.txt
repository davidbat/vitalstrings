The highest and lowest tides happen every two             weeks during the full moon and new moon because the gravitational             force of both the moon and the sun are pulling on the ocean water.             There are two high tides and two low tides during a day (24 hours).
High tide: When the sun and the moon are lined up with the             earth, they have a great gravitational pull on the earth. When             this happens, it causes the water to be pulled away from the             earth
Low tide: When your area is not lined up with the moon, you             will have low tides. The low spring tides are usually best for exploring, especially in the lower part             of the intertidal zone.
