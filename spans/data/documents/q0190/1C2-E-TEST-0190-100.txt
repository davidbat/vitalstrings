THE TIDES
 
The tides are the         regular rise and fall of the ocean .         They are seen most prominently along coasts and in harbors and bays .
Tides occur in all bodies of water. In small, enclosed         areas such as lakes and ponds, however, the rise and fall         of the water are slight and usually pass unnoticed. Where         the oceans meet the land along         seacoasts and in bays and harbours , the tides are more         prominent. In mid-ocean the difference between high water         and low water is perhaps two or three feet. Along the         shores of continents, especially in gradually narrowing         bays, the difference may be much greater. The highest         tide in New York Harbor is about 5 1/2 feet (1.7 meters).         In Boston (Mass.) Harbor the water rises as much as 11         feet (3 meters). In the Bay of Fundy, between New         Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, the tide can rise 53         1/2 feet (16.3 meters) from low water, and even more         during exceptional storm conditions .
 
High Tide and         Low Tide

In most places, the tide rises and falls twice a day,         reaching a maximum height called high tide on each rise         and a minimum level called low tide on each fall. It         takes a little more than six hours for rising waters to         reach high tide and approximately another six hours for         falling waters to reach low tide. This sequence is called         the tidal cycle. The complete cycle takes 12 hours and 25         minutes and is then repeated. The amount of change in the         water level during a tidal cycle is known as the tidal         range.
In some parts of the world there is only one complete         tidal cycle in a day. Such tides are called daily tides;         they are observed chiefly in Alaska and in the Gulf of         Mexico.
Other areas have mixed tides; where two high tides occur         with only a slight low tide between them, followed by a         prominent low tide. Mixed tides are seen primarily in the         Pacific Ocean. Daily tides and mixed tides occur where         the shape of the coastline affects the tidal waters.
Closely related to the rise and fall of the tide is tidal         current, the horizontal flow of water produced by the         tide. In the open sea , tidal         currents flow in circular paths, constantly changing         their direction. In such semi-enclosed waters as harbors,         bays, and the mouths of rivers, tidal current becomes a         to-and-fro motion of the water. In certain areas tidal         currents may reach high velocities.
 
The         Astronomical Tides
 
For many         centuries the tides have been familiar to sailors and the         inhabitants of seacoasts. They were not understood,         however, until the 17th century, when Isaac Newton         proposed the law of gravitational attraction. According         to this law, the tides are caused by the gravitational         attraction of the moon and the sun on the Earth . For this reason they are         called the astronomical tides.
The sun's gravitational effect upon the oceans is less         than half that of the moon. This may seem strange,         because the moon is smaller than the sun. The moon,         however, is much closer to the Earth than is the sun, and thus it has greater influence upon         the tides. The other planets in the solar system are too         far away to have any appreciable effect upon the Earth's         tides.
The attractive forces of the moon and the sun operate to         pile up ocean waters in a wave directly beneath them,         forming at the same time a similar wave on the opposite         side of the Earth. These tide waves have a wavelength of         one half the circumference of the Earth, and as the Earth         rotates they try to follow the moon and the sun.
In doing so, they would cause a high tide whenever they         reached a continent. If the ocean covered the entire         globe, such direct tides would occur every 12 hours and         25 minutes under the gravitational attraction of the moon         and every 12 hours under the attraction of the sun.
The direct tides, however, are influenced by the depth of         ocean basins , by the Earth's rotation, and by the         continental boundaries they touch, so the high tides do         not follow the moon and the sun exactly. The actual tides         are therefore indirect tides. A full understanding of the         actual tides has not yet been reached by scientists.
When there is a full moon or a new moon, the sun and the         moon are in line with the Earth, and their gravitational         attractions are added together. This causes         higher-than-normal high tides, which are called spring         tides though they have nothing to do with the season of         the year.
When the moon is in its first and last quarters, the sun         and the moon are at right angles to one another, and the         attractive force of the sun partially offsets the         attractive force of the moon. This causes         lower-than-normal high tides, called neap tides.
 
Predicting         Astronomical Tides
 
It is difficult to predict astronomical tides solely         from observation of the movements of the moon and the         sun. To overcome this difficulty, careful measurements of         the rise and fall of the water level are made over a long         period of time.
Instruments called tide gauges are placed at each point         from which a tide prediction is needed. When subjected to         a process known as harmonic analysis, tide-gauge records         yield information that can be directly related to the         movements of the moon and sun. Tides can then be         predicted from the known future motion of the moon and         sun.
 
Meteorological         Tides and Bores
 
Certain types of weather can produce a tidelike rise         or fall of the water level. Such effects are called         meteorological tides. They may be caused by changes in air pressure , by wind-driven water         piling up along coasts, and even by rain or melting snow.         In enclosed bodies of water, meteorological tides may         completely mask the astronomical tides.
In the ocean, the meteorological effects on tides are         related to the large ocean currents, such as the Gulf         Stream in the Atlantic and the Kuroshio Current in the         Pacific. These current systems are considered to be         fairly constant. In adjacent and marginal seas, storms         may from time to time cause storm tides involving         sea-level elevations of up to several meters. Under         normal conditions the wind         velocity decreases after several hours. Such an         elevation of sea level is neither permanent nor periodic.
For a long time it was assumed that the mass of the ocean         water is constant. Since a considerable amount of frozen         water is stored in polar areas ,         however, and given proper variation of the climate of the Earth , the amount of ice and the         elevation of sea level will change. Another potential         cause of sea-level change is the gradual, vertical motion         of the land .
When a coastline is so formed that a river flows to the         sea through a funnel-shaped outlet, the high tide may         enter the river as a wall of water called a bore. Bores         occur in some European rivers, in the Petitcodiac River         at the northern end of the Bay of Fundy, in the Amazon River in Brazil , and in the         Fuchun Jiang in China.
