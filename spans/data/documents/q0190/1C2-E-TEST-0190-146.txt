WHAT CAUSES TIDES?
1.
Tides are created by the  gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent the sun, upon the Earth's  oceans. The sun has about half the effect that the moon has on the Earth's  tides.
 
 
2.
In most areas, typically two high tides and two low  tides occur within a 24 hour and 50-minute lunar day. (A lunar day is 50  minutes longer than a solar day.) The time between each high and low tide (or  low and high tide) is 6 hours and 12.5 minutes.
 
 
3.
In most coastal regions, one of the daily high  tides is higher than the other high tide and one of the low tides is lower than  the other.
 
 
4.
Some  regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico, only have  one high tide and one low tide each day.
 
 
5.
During a new or full moon, both the sun and moon  are in line with the Earth. The combined gravitational effect causes extremely  high-high and low-low tides. The tides during this time are referred to as spring tides.
 
 
6.
During the  quarter moon portions of the lunar cycle, the sun and moon are at right angles  in relation to the Earth and the resulting tidal range is smaller. The tides  during the quarter moon cycles are called neap  tides.
