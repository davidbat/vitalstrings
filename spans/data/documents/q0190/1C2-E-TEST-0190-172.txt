Oceans Alive! | Oceans in Motion
Water on the Move
   
 
The Earth is surrounded by two great oceans: an ocean of air and an ocean of water. Both are in constant motion,          driven by the energy of the sun and the gravity of the          Earth. Their motions are linked; the winds give energy to          the sea surface and ocean currents are the result. The          currents carry heat from one location to another, altering          the Earth's surface temperature patterns and modifying the          air above.
Out in the open sea, ocean waters are driven by two great          wind systems. Close to the equator the Trade Winds blow the          surface waters westward. In the temperate zone, the          Westerlies blow the surface waters back toward the east. The          result is that in each great ocean basin there is roughly          circular movement of the surface waters. In the northern          hemisphere these wind driven currents move clockwise and in          the southern hemisphere they move counter clockwise. Both          surface and deep-water currents affect the world's climate          by moving cold water from the poles toward the tropics and          vice versa.
Ocean waters are always in motion. Currents flow like          rivers, waves crash against seashores and tides rise and          fall.
