As IO notes, it is sometimes difficult to get the complete  meaning of something that was said when all you have is a written transcript, and don't know the "tone" with which the statement was made.   With that caveat, and just looking at the written words, O'Reilley apears to commit a fairly common logical fallacy, which it to argue that the lack of an alternative explanation constitutes "proof" of  his explanation. (I'm obviously ignoring, for sake of my point, the obvious fact that there is indeed a scientific explanation for why tides go in and out.)  I.e., "I think Sally ate my pie.  You have not shown that someone else ate my pie.  That proves that Sally ate my pie."
I imagine that what O'Reilley really meant to say was that the existence of God has not been disproven by science, because there are still things for which an accepted scientifc explanation has not been found.  (He picked a bad example to use, however.)
Personally, I think that a person who bases his belief in God simply on the failure of current science to provide an explanation for some physical phenomenon is setting himself up for disappointmemt.
