For this part of the project my partner, Sarah, and I were looking            at the connection between the tidal action on the earth and its connection            to the moon. One of our primary questions was whether or not you could            predict the tides by simply knowing the phase of the moon. We discovered            that knowing the phase is an important part of several different pieces            of information required to predict the tides.
Several different things are responsible for the tidal forces on Earth,            but the two main astronomical reasons are the force of gravity exerted            by the moon and sun upon the earth and centrifugal forces produced by            the revolutions of the earth and moon and earth and sun around their            common centers of gravity (NOAA).
I will attempt to explain the centrifugal forces first since it helps            to clarify the effects of the solar and lunar gravitational forces.            The common center of mass, or barycenter, of the earth and moon is not            at the center of the earth. Instead the center of mass is approximately            1068 miles below the surface of the earth’s crust (on average), always            facing the moon along an imaginary line that connects the two. The centrifugal            force is always in the opposite direction of the moon’s gravitational            pull and thus is pulling away from the barycenter in an equal amount            of force. This keeps everything in balance (NOAA).
The best analogy I can give is that of an Olympic hammer thrower. When            the Olympian spins the ball and chain around, centrifugal force is being            exerted on the ball at the end of the chain, which is pulling on the            athlete. The athlete in turn has to exert at least the opposite amount            of force in the opposite direction to keep the ball from pulling him            off balance.
This is the same thing that happens with the earth and moon. They            are both exerting force on each other and are both exerting opposite            force in opposition to each other. Since we are only concerned with            the barycenter below the earth’s crust, that is the only one that I            will pay any attention to. The effect this force has on the earth is            going to be constant on all points on Earth. However, the gravitational            effects of the moon and sun may be different at different times on the            earth because the magnitude of the gravitational forces of the various            attracting bodies are at either farther or closer positions in relation            to the Earth. One of Newton’s laws of Gravity can be expressed here            as the distance away from the objects to the second power over the tide            raising force or gravity to the third power (NOAA).
The effect of the Moon’s gravity on the ocean’s of the Earth is very            minute, but is significant enough to create bulges that are responsible            for the tides. The gravity of the Earth is what keeps everything on            the Earth from flying off into space. This means that the Earth’s gravitational            force is greater then the centrifugal force produced by the Earth. The            oceans are no exception to this rule, however the nature of the water            that makes up the oceans makes it possible for the Moon to move the            water just slightly enough to make tidal forces. The tractive force that actually makes the tides does not come from the moon pulling directly            or perpendicularly to the oceans. The force comes from when the moon            pulls horizontially across the plane, causing the water to bulge and            produce the tides (NOAA).
These two forces in coordination with each other super-impose themselves            over the Earth and create the force necessary to produce tidal action.            This is done in a couple of different ways: the net or differential            force and the tractive force, which is explained above.
Tidal Inequality is the variation in the range of the tides. This is            where the lunar phases play their most significant role in the tidal            shift. The lunar phase effect is responsible for the neap and spring            tides. The spring tides have nothing to do with the season; instead            it refers to the fact that tides are usually a little higher at this            time or “springing out”. Neap tides are weaker tides and reflect the            Greek definition of the word meaning “scanty” (NOAA).
Spring tides occur when the moon is at the new and full phase and neap            tides occur at the first quarter and third quarter phases. The lunar            and solar gravities reinforce each other during the spring tide and            thus have a greater effect upon the tides. At neap tide the moon and            sun run perpendicular to each other resulting in some what of a nullifying            effect. This results in lower or weaker tides (NOAA).
Another factor that determines the tidal differential is the parallax            effect. This is when the sun or moon or both are either closer or farther,            in regards to the distance from the earth. When the moon is at its closest            position it is at a position called perigee, its furtest is apogee.            Similarly when the earth is at its closest to the sun and then farthest            away is called perihelion and aphelion, respectively. The effects of            these forces are quite simple to explain. When the moon or sun is closer,            the amount of gravitational force they can exert on the earth will be            greater, thus resulting in stronger or higher tides (NOAA).
Thirdly there is the lunar declination effect. The moon does not travel            around an elliptic directly around the earth’s equator, instead it travels            on a path that is about five degrees declination either above or below            the equator, depending on how you look at it. When the moon is at high            declination, diurnal tides are the result; half-way between the equator            and the highest point of declination results in mixed tides, and when            the moon is directly over the equator semi-diurnal tides are the result            (NOAA).
