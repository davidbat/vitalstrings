(Tides)
The Moon can move within 218,000 miles (351,000 km) of the earth's         surface. This proximity to the earth produces reactions in the earth's atmosphere, seas and the earth's surface. The most observable         reaction occurs with the ocean's tides. The tides are due to the         gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon. The Earth's great          oceans are pulled regularly to and fro by the Moon, as well as the         fluids in our very own bodies. High and low tides occur in a          roughly 6 hour cycle, with two high and two low tides          a day. This 6  hour cycle is caused by the gravitational tugging of the          moon upon the earth.
The Moon's gravity pulls the Earth's water surface into two bulges,      one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the opposite side. The      water on the side of the Earth closest to the Moon is pulled, by the Moon's      gravitational force, much stronger than the mass of the Earth. The water on     the side furthest from the Moon has a weaker pull than the gravitational     force of the Earth. As the earth rotates under this ocean bulge,     it causes a high tide. The height of the tide is determined by     the shape of the coastline and of the nearby continental shelf.
A change in the gravitational force across the body of the earth       produces two bulges, causing us to experience two high tides, and two      low tides each day. The tides make the earth slow down its rotation      around its axis, and when the angular force of the earth decreases the      moon compensates by increasing its angular momentum.
The effect of the Sun's pull also causes similar effects. Twice       a month, at new and full Moon, the Sun and Moon pull in line so       that the tidal bulge occurs on both sides of the earth. One bulge       occurs toward the Moon and the other away from the Moon. The tides       that we see at this time are the result of both pulls. Their tidal       effects combine to produce tides higher than normal called Spring       Tides, because they "spring up".
When the solar low tide and lunar low tides occur simultaneously , it produces what is known as a Neap Tide. This occurs at first or last                      quarter, when the Moon is pulling at right angles to the sun. The tidal                      effects work against each other and produce tides of a smaller range,                      called "neap", or scanty tides. As the earth rotates under these two                      bulges, points on its surface experience a cycle of low tides twice a                      day. The actual height of the tide is partly determined by the shape                      of the coastline and depth of water.
