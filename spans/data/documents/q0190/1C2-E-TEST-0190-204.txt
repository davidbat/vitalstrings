"OK, here's the deal." The gruff inspector snarled as he      spoke to your team of detectives. "For a long time people have been blamin'      things on the moon! People claim to be crazy because of it, lovers claim to      be under its spell, and even hospitals blame the full moon for loaded emergency      rooms." "Yeah!", one of the newer members of your team replied flippantly,      "So what's new?" The rest of your team let out a low sigh. Now the whole team      was in for it! "I'll tell you what's new, Mr. Smartypants," the inspector      glowered at each of you slowly, "Now some nutcase has brought charges against      the moon for causing the tides! And, its your job to bring me proof one way      or another!" The inspector turned back toward his desk and we thought he was      through. He wasn't! He turned back to your team, pointed his finger at you      and said, "And you only have two weeks to solve the case. Now get started!"
If you are going to collect evidence against the moon, there      are three things you must know:
What are tides?
What is the difference between spring tides and neap tides?
What are diurnal tides, semidiurnal tides, and mixed tides?
After you know the answer to each of the questions above,      you will need to collect the following information:
a record of tide levels for a calendar month from three        different locations,
an Eastern United States location
a Western United States location
an Asian location
a calendar of phases of the moon for the same calendar        month.
With all of the above information available you must answer      two questions;
Can you find a pattern that will convince the jury that        the moon is responsible for the tides?
If the moon is guilty, does it have an accomplice which        contributes to causing the tides?
Your first step will be to prepare a preliminary report answering      the first three questions stated in the Task section. All of your information      is to come from the Internet. Some of your work will be done from printed      material which came from a web site, but other information must be obtained      live from the Internet.
The following web page locations provide information which      has been printed for use at a station without a computer. If there are enough      computers in your class you may also get this information directly from the      web sites. (Caution! Some of these web sites may have already come to the conclusion      that the moon is guilty. You can not adopt that conclusion until you have      proof in hand from section two.)
NOAA's Oceanographic Products and Services Division has        a very complete description of Our        Restless Tides : a brief explanation of the astronomical        factors which produce tides.
The Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University        of Tennessee in Knoxville has a very good lesson        on tides with a good diagram of spring tides        and neap tides.
Michael J. Pidwirny, Ph.D., of the Department of Geography,        Okanagan University College, British Columbia presents a very        good summary of ocean tides [This expired link is available through the Wayback Machine Internet Archive.

Once you feel that you can give the inspector a very complete      description of the basic tide questions it is time to start collecting tide      data about three sites. This information should be copied and pasted into      a spreadsheet (you will find more about this in the Process section and in      the Teacher's section). When you select a location you will see a data table      of the last 2 days. To find the actual data for your project scroll to the      bottom of the page where you will see "Prediction Options." Scroll      down a bit to "Select presentation options," and use the pull down      menu to change the length of time to display from 2 days to 4 weeks. In the      next section, "Starting time and time display options," change the      current month to the previous month. After making those changes, click on      the gray button that is labeled, "Make prediction using options." Do the same for each location chosen.
