Scientist Discover Snow on Mars
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have discovered snow on Mars. Unlike snow on Earth, Martian snow is very small and made up of frozen carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, not water. The carbon dioxide snowflakes are about the size of a red blood cell, so they appear as more of a cloud of fog on the surface of the planet than individual flakes of precipitation.
