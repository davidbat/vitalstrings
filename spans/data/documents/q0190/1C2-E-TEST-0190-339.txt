A storm            goes through a series of stages before being classified as a hurricane.
Tropical Disturbance
Thunderstorms              with light cyclonic circulation
Tropical Depression
Wind speeds              between 20 and 34 knots (23-39 mi/hr)
Tropical Storm
Wind speeds              between 35 and 64 knots (40-73 mi/hr)
Hurricane
Wind speed              greater than 64 knots (74 mi/hr)
 
 
Where          and When Do They Form?
Hurricanes do          an important job for the Earth. They help move heat from warm tropical          places to the cooler temperate zone. To do this, they typically form between          5 to 15 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. Then, they thunder          across the warm oceans of the world such as the Atlantic, the Gulf of          Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Western Pacific Ocean (where they are called          typhoons), up to higher latitudes.
Hurricanes happen          when the oceans have been warmed during summer months. In the North Atlantic,          hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30, but most hurricanes happen          during the fall.
 
Storm          Surge
As a hurricane’s          winds spiral around and around the storm, they push water into a mound          at the storm’s center. This mound of water becomes dangerous when          the storm reaches land because it causes flooding along the coast. The          water piles up, unable to escape anywhere but on land as the storm carries          it landward. A hurricane will cause more storm surge in areas where the          ocean floor slopes gradually.
When high tide          happens at the same time as a storm surge, the combination of the two          is called storm tide. During a storm tide, the water level may be 20 feet          or more above normal. This causes huge floods. Storm tide is especially          dangerous for islands or coastal areas where even a few feet of surge          may cause large areas of flooding.
There are computer          models that allow forecasters to predict the amount of storm surge that          will affect a coastal area. A model called SLOSH takes into account a          storm’s strength, its path, how the ocean shallows, and the shape          of the land and calculates how much storm surge a hurricane will probably          cause.
