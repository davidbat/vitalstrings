Marine Biology Causes of Tides
Cause             and Effect of Tides
Causes:
Tides are caused mainly by the gravitational pull of the               Moon on the waters of the ocean. The Moon revolves around the               Earth in the exact same direction as the Earth rotates on its               axis, but they travel at different speeds. High tides exist in               a location when the Moon is either directly overhead or on the               opposite side of the Earth from the same location. The attraction               of the Moon is strongest on the side of the earth which it is               facing. This gravitational pull causes the waters to bulge out               toward the Moon in a high tide. When the moon is not directly               overhead, low tides result, the lowest of which occurs when the               Moon is at a right angle from any given location. When there               is a full moon or a new moon it causes the Earth to have the               best low and high tides.
Depending on the relative position of the Moon and the Sun               to the Earth it causes different types of tides. A "Spring               Tide" is caused when the Earth, Sun and Moon are lined up.               Because of this greater centrifugal pull on the earth, the tides               have the most variation between high to low. When the Sun and               the Moon are not lined up with the Earth, we have a "Neap               Tide" or the least variation between high to low.
In southern California, in a period just over 24 hours, the               rotating Earth passes through these liquid bulges and produce               two high tides and two low tides. Here is Los Angeles this phase               is known as a mixed semidiurnal tide schedule. A mixed semidiurnal               tide means two low and two high tides of different heights in               a 24 hour period. A semidiurnal tide schedule is when the two               low and two high tides are both approximately the same height               in each 24 hour period. The water recedes and comes up about               the same length each day. Due to the location of places like               the Caribbean, being closer to the equator, they have what is               known as a diurnal tide. In a 24 hour period the tide only produces               one high and one low tide.
Effects:
The different tides have different effects all over the Earth.               In rocky intertidal zones, the tide pools can be effected greatly               with the change in these tides. The temperature and salinity               in the tide pools can increase and decrease quickly. As the water               warms and evaporates the salinity level of the water goes up.               There can also be an increase in the UV light when the organisms               are out of water. All of these effects cause the organisms to               adapt or die.
Most of the effects of the tides on organisms living in these               areas are due to the exposure to air. Another main problem is               dehydration. Some strategies for survival in this area are to               move to a moist area in order to maintain water. Also to move               to a sheltered area protected from the sun and the crashing of               the waves. The bivalves "clam up" in order to keep themselves from drying out. Limpets use their               home scars to hide in sometimes trapped for life. The snails use their operculum like a tiny door to close themselves up inside.
Some organisms cover their body with a protective layer.               The sea anemones secrete a mucus to help               them keep moist. Some also attach shell fragments to themselves.               Worms like the polychaete worm and sand castle worm live in tubes.
Organisms that have light colored shells don't absorb the               heat as fast but rather reflect it. Having ridges on the shells               also keep the organisms cooler as the texture of haveing a ridged               shell helps reflect most light and sun rays.
Organisms that live in the pounding surf have found ways               to adapt too. Algae uses its holdfast               to attach to the rocks an keep it in place. It's stem is flexible               and moves with the wave motion. Mussels attach by their byssal               threads and the members of gastropods use their foot to secure               them in place. The clingfish uses a modified fin, on its pelvic               area, like a suction cup. Having a compact size and a hydrodynamic               shape can also help to hold colonies of organisms like barnacles               and chitons in place.
Changes in food availability can be a major problem. Barnacles               out of water can not feed since they are filter feeders and need               the water to obtain their food. There is a competition for space               in these tide pools as organisms fight for shady areas. Larval               settlement is an effect of the tides. These babies need a place               to attach to begin their advancement to adulthood. All of these               effects vary according to the duration of exposure, the time               of day during the exposure and the season during exposure. California               does not have as much of a problem as does places like Alaska               where seasons are shorter, water is colder and daylight can be               scarce or non existent in winter.
