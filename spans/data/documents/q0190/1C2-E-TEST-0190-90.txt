The                          tide height is not the same every day.
Low spring tides in Singapore usually happens before sunrise                          or after sunset.
Low                          spring tides happen near the new and full moon.
Our shores                are submerged most of the time. Safe and wet underwater, amazing                plants and animals live out their lives unseen.
The non-diver and casual visitor can only have a 'dry' and easy                view of this rich intertidal zone when it is exposed during low                spring tides.
The lower the tide, the larger the expanse of shore that is exposed.                The coastal area affected by the tides is called the intertidal                zone .
Isn't there a low tide every day? Yes, it's true, there is a 'low' tide every day. Singapore has two                low tides and two high tides a day. The height of the tide is not                the same every day. High and low tides do not happen at the same                time every day, and the highest and lowest tide level change every                day.
What affects the tides? Among                the factors that can affect tide height are:
Gravitational                  pull of the moon.
Gravitational                  pull of the sun (although much further away, the sun is gianormous).
The rotation                  of the earth (the way your laundry in a spinning washing machine                  moves outwards).
Spring                Tides: During a full moon or new moon, the moon and sun                are lined up. Their combined gravitational effect results in an                extra high and extra low tide. This is called a spring tide because                the water appears to spring up.
Neap Tides: At a quarter moon or three-quarter moon, the sun's gravity works                at right angles to that of the moon. This results in a smaller difference                in height between the low and high tide. This is called a neap tide.
There's an animation                of the tides on the NOAA website.
What's so special about a low spring tide? During a super low tide, we can get a quick glimpse of a part of                the shore that is seldom exposed. Also, usually a larger area of                the shore is exposed, since the low tide is a lot lower. So there is more to see in terms of variety and area uncovered. But remember                the 'spring' part of this low tide: so the tide moves fast and the                window of low tide is usually short, about an hour at most. Guided                walks on our shores are usually held during low spring tide.
In the photo of the natural shore of Sentosa (on the left) at low                spring tide, you can see the mid-water mark as the dark portion                on the natural cliffs. The area exposed at low spring tide is quite                different from that at higher tides. It can also be dangerous to                go at the wrong tide, or to be unaware of the turning tide as you                might get trapped.
Not all shores can be visited at the same tide level. Some shores                in Singapore require lower tides than other shores for a safe and                enjoyable visit. A shore with a gentle gradient means a larger area                is affected by the tides resulting in a wider intertidal zone that                can be explored for a longer time during low tide. While a steeper                sloping shore means there is a narrower intertidal zone which is                not exposed for long during low tide.
It's thus important to go                with experienced people and with shore guides . You will be safer,                and also see and learn more about our shores. Here's more                about preparing to visit our shores .
Other things to note about our tides: In Singapore, spring tides usually occur over a few days twice a                month and usually for only a few hours each time. The low spring                tide usually happens before sunrise around April to August (at about                2-3am), and then after sunset in October to February. Often, there                are no low spring tides in September and in March.
Low spring tides don't necessarily happen on weekends.
Low tides don't happen at the same time every day. This is because                the moon takes more than 24 hours to go around the Earth. So the                low (and high) tide shifts by about 50 minutes every day.
The tides can differ from predictions depending on the winds (which                can raise water levels) and the barometric pressure (the pressure                of the miles of atmosphere on the sea level).
If we go at a neap tide, will we see nothing? There is always something to see on our shores at any tide. For                example, on rocky shores , the mangroves and coastal forests .                High tide is when you are most likely to see fascinating animals                such as otters , crocodiles , sea                turtles , fishes and more. See the Adventures                with the Naked Hermit Crabs blog for some sightings during their                free Chek Jawa boardwalk tour which is conducted at any tide.
