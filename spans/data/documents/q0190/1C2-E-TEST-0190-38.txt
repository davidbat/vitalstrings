What Causes Ocean Tides
October 16, 2011 By Janice VanCleave
Why Tides are the Same on Opposite Sides of the Earth.
The Sun and the Moon both cause tides. This is because both of the gravitational attraction between the Earth and each of these celestial bodies.
The Sun’s distance from Earth is about four hundreds times the distance of the Moon . Thus, the greater gravitational attraction is between the Earth and the Moon .
In the video, you see a yellow and blue bulge around the Earth. The yellow bulge show how much of an ocean tide is due to the Sun and the blue bulge is the tide due to the Moon. Note that as the Moon moves the blue bulge follows it.
The highest tide is called the spring tide and has nothing to do with the season. Instead, the origin of the term spring referred to something bursting forth, jumping, rising, as a natural spring. Note that spring tides occur on both sides of the Earth at the same time. Also, spring tides occur during full moon, when the Moon is opposite the Sun as well as during the new moon when the Sun and Moon are on the same side of Earth.
What Causes Tides to Bulge on Both Sides of the Earth?
The following video is so simple, but very good. Yes, it ends abruptly, but the answer not given is that the Moon has a slight precession, meaning it wobbles like a spinning top. Since the Earth’s position in space changes about 10 in about 71.6 years, its effect takes more than the human eye to see any difference in the tides.
Notice that the biscuit (cookie) was slightly moved toward the Moon, this adds to the bulge of water on the opposite side. But most of the water bulge opposite the Moon is due to the fact that the Sun and/or Moon’s gravity doesn’t affect the water on the opposite side.
