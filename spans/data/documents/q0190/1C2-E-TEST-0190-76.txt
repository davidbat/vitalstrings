The causes of ocean tides is presented as images and text
A brief description of "How to Survive Life in the Tidepool" is given
 
"Tides" is a generic term used to define          the alternating rise and fall in sea level with respect to the land, produced          by the gravitational attraction of the moon and the Sun.
The most familiar evidence of the tides along our seashores is the repeated        appearance of high and low water -- usually, BUT NOT ALWAYS-- twice        daily.
Tides vary from place-to-place in terms of:
Tidal range, or distance between high and low water levels,
Time interval between low and high water levels, and
Arrival time of high and low water levels.
The factors that contribute to these changes include:
Configuration of the coastline,
Local depth of the water,
Ocean-floor topography ("bathymetry") and
Other hydrographic ("hydro" = "water" in Greek)        and meteorological influences.
What actually causes tides?
The force of gravity pulls inward toward Earth's center of mass and holds water on our planet's surface.
However, gravitational forces of the moon and Sun also "tug" upon our ocean waters.
Both these "extraterrestrial" ("outside-Earth")        bodies draw ocean waters to positions on the earth's surface directly beneath        them.
This is easily seen in the image above and at left.
 
High        ocean tides are produced by "bulges" that form from the horizontal flow        of water toward TWO regions on the earth. "Why TWO regions?" you        might ask.
One always faces the Moon...
...where the moon's gravitational pull is strongest
The other always faces directly away...
...where the moon's gravitational pull is weakest
This is shown in the two images above (^^^) and the one image at left        (<<<).
Low tides are created by a corresponding withdrawal of water from      regions around the earth midway between the "bulges."
So, the shift between high and low tides results from Earth's daily rotation        BENEATH:
two tidal bulges AND
two tidal depressions.
One of the most well-known "by-products" of tides are tide      pool (at right, >>>).
Tide pools are small pools maintained by water brought in and flushed        out by tides.
A wide range of life forms can be found in tidal pool communities.
The location of an organism relative to the tide level significantly affects        the physical conditions it faces. So, tide pool residents must be able to        cope with a highly variable environment.
Organisms that live near the top of the high tide line are submersed        in water only occasionally.
Organisms that live near the low tide line are almost always under water.
Many tidepool plants and animals attach themselves to hard, rocky outcrops and are capable of remaining anchored against the intense action of winds        and waves.
At low tide, tidepool organisms are often exposed to extreme temperatures,        harsh winds, and direct sunlight
In general, tidepool organisms must therefore be fairly robust creatures        in order to survive.

If possible, you might take a field trip to a tidepool and complete                the "Mapping The Depth & Population Of A Tidepool" activity.
Consider whether there is a tie between:
tidal range
the alignment of the Sun, moon, and Earth
lunar phase

Look closely at the three diagrams of the Sun, moon,        and Earth system ( presented above ).
In order to see all three planetary bodies AS THEY MOVE IN THE SAME PLANE, where is your "vantage            point" with respect to Earth? [HINT: Look at the continents            on the Earth image.]
Is this the only "vantage point" that            provides such a view?
Tidal range is the distance between high and low        water levels in a tide zone.
Which type of planetary alignment would            you expect to show the HIGHEST tidal range?
Sun, moon and Earth aligned with the Sun                and Moon on opposite sides of Earth . (Scroll                up, at far left).
Sun, moon and Earth aligned with the Sun                and Moon on the same side. (Scroll                up, at far right)
Sun, moon, and Earth form a right angle                (i.e., are ninety degrees apart). ( Shown above,                ^^^ )
Is it easy to choose ONE of these planetary            alignments?
Is it easier to ELIMINATE one of these planetary            alignments?
How can you verify whether or not your answer            is correct?
Lunar phases describe the extent to which        the moon is illuminated from the perspective of Earth's surface. Examples        include "quarter moon" and "half moon."
Can you name the lunar phases associated with            each of the three cases illustrated above?
Look up the terms "spring tide" and "neap tide" in the dictionary.
Are these "tides" tied to water                levels, lunar phases, or both?
The amount of "pull" the Sun and moon        have on Earth's oceans is related to:
How much mass each has. (Mass is the            amount of matter -- or "stuff" -- in an object. Objects with            greater mass will have a greater pull.)
Its distance from Earth. (Closer objects exert            a greater pull.)
Which has more mass... the Sun or the moon?
Which is closer to Earth... the Sun or the                moon?
The moon's tide-producing force is greater than            that of the Sun. This is seen in the image where the Sun, moon and Earth            form a right angle ( Above, ^^^ )
Can you guess why this is the case?
Look up the following values (in an almanac            or other reference book):
Mass of the Sun
Mass of the moon
Average DISTANCE between the earth and Sun                (this value is averaged because the actual separation between these                bodies changes over time)
Average DISTANCE between the earth and moon                (this value is averaged because the actual separation between these                bodies changes over time)
With these values, and given that gravity is            proportional to MASS DIVIDED BY DISTANCE-SQUARED, estimate the gravitational            force:
Between the earth and the Sun
Between the earth and the moon.
Compared to the Sun, how MUCH greater                    is the moon's gravitational pull on Earth's oceans?
Our coastlines vary in terms of relief (steeper        vs. flatter slopes) and substrate (muddy bottom vs. bedrock).
