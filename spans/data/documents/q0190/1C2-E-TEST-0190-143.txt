Causes of accidents
According to insurers’ statistics, 80% of oil        tanker accidents which cause oil        spills at sea are a result of human errors: badly handled manoeuvres,        neglected maintenance, insufficient checking of systems, lack of communication        between crew members, fatigue, or an inadequate response to a minor incident        causing it to escalate into a major accident. From a more practical point        of view, analysis of the circumstances surrounding accidents (see animation “Causes of oil tanker accidents”) demonstrates the high proportion        of spills due to groundings and collisions.

ITOPF is a mutual organisation providing technical advice on pollution        response for shipowners of oil tankers. ITOPF experts contribute to response operation management,        impact assessment and environmental restoration operations around the world.        See below the home page of ITOPF’s website, which is an indispensable        source of information on accidents, their causes and response carried out.

Collisions are generally due to manoeuvring errors,        especially in poor visibility and/or busy shipping traffic areas. Groundings        are also often a result of manoeuvring errors, often made worse by high      winds, challenging currents and bad weather.
 
Causes of oil tanker accidents (spills of over 700 tonnes)
The grounding of the Sea Empress at the entrance to        Milford Haven port, Wales (Great Britain) is one such example. However,        equipment failure is a more common cause of groundings than of collisions.        The grounding of the oil tanker the Braer in the Shetland Islands, Scotland        (Great Britain), resulting from seawater entering into a fuel tank ,        causing engine failure, is a classic example of technical failure.
Oil tanker spills
The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd keeps an up-to-date        database on the Internet (www.itopf.com), on oil spills of over 700 tonnes,        from oil tankers, ore carriers and tank barges which have occurred all over        the world since 1967. Information is also provided on various aspects of        the spills and their consequences.
This data brings to light the fact that a little more than 5.5 million tonnes        of oil were spilled in the world’s seas by oil tanker accidents during        the 30 year period from 1970-2000, totalling nearly 182,000 tonnes per year        with a peak of 640,000 tonnes in 1979. Since then, despite a bad year in        1991, the tendency is towards a considerable decrease. In the decade from        1990 to 1999, 73% (830,000 tonnes) of the total amount spilled (1,140,000)        was caused by only 10 accidents.
