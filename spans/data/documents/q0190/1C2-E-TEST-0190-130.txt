WATER            MOVEMENTS AND WINDS OFF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST
TYPICAL              SPRING AND SUMMER CONDITIONS
INTENSIFIED DURING LA NIÑAS
The normal            spring drop in sea level along the California coast results from the            onset of strong winds blowing toward the Equator. These winds plus the            Coriolis effect (the tendency of winds and currents to veer to the right            in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere)            push surface waters away from the coast. To fill their place, colder            water rises to the surface in the yearly upwelling that makes the ocean            off northern California so cold in spring and summer. During La Niñas,            upwelling conditions are intensified. Higher sea levels in autumn and            winter are produced by relaxation of the alongshore winds that push            surface water away from the coast and by expansion of the water caused            by summer and fall warming. Northward and onshore flow of warmer surface            waters during El Niños intensifies these effects and causes downwelling,            which prevents the replenishment of nutrients to surface waters and            can have a major impact on sea life. For example, in 199798, thousands            of seals and sea lions starved to death when downwelling warm water            drove away many of the fish and squid on which they normally fed. Young            animals, such as the sea lion pup shown below, were particularly vulnerable.
STRONGLY              REVERSED CONDITIONS, COMMON
DURING EL NIÑOS
 
A long-term sea-level rise    of about 0.04 to 0.08 inches per year is documented in the Fort Point record.    Similar trends of slowly rising sea level have been observed elsewhere along    the west coast of North America and in other parts of the world. Many scientists    think that rising sea level may be the result of increased melting of the polar    icecaps and thermal expansion of ocean water caused by global warming.
The fourth factor affecting    sea level at Fort Point is the occurrence of atmospheric events such as El Niños.    What are El Niños, and how do they create abnormally high sea levels    in the San Francisco Bay area? During most years, equatorial trade winds blow    from east to west, piling up warm surface water on the west side of the Pacific    Ocean. Every 2 to 7 years, the trade winds relax, or even reverse, and the warm    surface water moves back along the Equator toward South America. Because the    resulting warm-water conditions off the west coast of South America significantly    disrupt fish populations and usually become noticeable around Christmas, fishermen    named this phenomenon "El Niño" after the Christ child. The    name "La Niña" is now given to an opposite phenomenon that    brings unusually cold-water conditions.
As part of an El Niño,    unusually long, low waves are generated in the western Pacific Ocean and move    eastward along the equator. These waves—called "Kelvin waves"—are    difficult to observe and are still rather poorly understood. They appear to    be about 6,000 miles long, to travel at speeds of more than 5 miles an hour,    and to have heights of up to 10 inches. When a Kelvin wave hits South America,    the wave splits and moves northward and southward along the coast. The passage    of a Kelvin wave along the coast causes sea level to rise by an amount equal    to the height of the wave. As a Kelvin wave moves along the west coast of North    America and passes the mouth of San Francisco Bay, the higher sea level outside    the bay causes ocean water to flow into the bay and raise its level as well.
The Fort Point record shows    evidence for Kelvin waves raising sea level in 1997 by about 6 inches as early    as late May, earlier than in previous El Niño years. These Kelvin waves also    raised ocean temperatures near San Francisco, and by the late fall of 1997,    water temperatures off the coast were well above normal to depths of 300 feet    or more. The resulting thermal expansion of the water caused an additional rise    in sea level of about 8 inches that lasted until after the flooding of February    1998.
PROGRESS            OF A KELVIN WAVE DURING THE 199798 EL NIÑO
As          part of an El Niño, unusually long, low waves, called "Kelvin          waves," are generated in the western Pacific Ocean and carry warm          water eastward along the Equator. The satellite images of sea-surface          elevation (top), taken in March and April 1997, show the progress of a          Kelvin wave (high sea-surface elevations shown in white and red) across          the equatorial Pacific. When the wave hit South America, it split and          moved northward and southward along the coast. The passage of the wave          along the coast caused sea level to rise by an amount equal to the height          of the wave, about 6 inches. As the Kelvin wave moved along the west coast          of North America and passed the mouth of San Francisco Bay (bottom satellite          images of sea-surface temperature), the higher sea level outside the bay          caused ocean water to flow into the bay and raise its level as well.

During winter in California,    storms typically bring high rainfall, low atmospheric pressure, and strong winds.    The low atmospheric pressure in storm systems allows ocean waters to expand,    resulting in a temporary increase in sea level. Every 1-inch decrease in atmospheric    pressure causes a 1-inch rise in sea level. Unusually low-pressure systems can    result in a sea-level increase of up to 8 to 10 inches. Along the northern California    coast, strong storm-related winds from the south combine with the Coriolis effect    to push surface ocean waters toward the coast and into San Francisco Bay, raising    sea level as much as 10 to 12 inches.When El Niño conditions are present,    not only are storms more frequent and severe, but the winds are also more likely    to blow from the south.
RELATION            OF WATER TEMPERATURE TO SEA LEVEL DURING THE 199798 EL NIÑO
Tide-gauge          records from Fort Point in San Francisco show evidence for Kelvin waves          raising sea level in 1997 by about 6 inches as early as late May, earlier          than in previous El Niño years. As recorded by U.S. Geological          Survey instruments (photo below graph) anchored off the northern California          coast at Davenport mooring (see map on left), these Kelvin waves also          raised ocean temperatures. By the late fall of 1997 water temperatures          off the coast were well above normal to depths of 300 feet or more. The          resulting thermal expansion of the water caused an additional rise in          sea level of about 8 inches that lasted until after the flooding of February 1998.
 
The El Niño of 199798    was followed by La Niña conditions the following winter. These conditions caused    unusually strong upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters off the northern California    coast.
To better understand the    effects of El Niño conditions and other influences on sea level, USGS    scientists continue to monitor sea-level changes in San Francisco Bay. They    also are collecting and analyzing ocean current, temperature, and pressure data    from the waters off California's coast near Santa Cruz and the Farallon Islands.    These studies will help ocean scientists develop models for predicting sea-level    changes in San Francisco Bay and will aid in anticipating coastal flooding in    the region. This work is only part of the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program's    ongoing efforts to protect people's lives and property from geologic and environmental    hazards in the coastal zones of the United States.
