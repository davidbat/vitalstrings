Diagram of Rip Currents or Undertows
National Weather Service
Definition: Hurricanes, tropical storms, and high winds can cause increased risk on the beach. Rip currents or undertows are dangerous rivers of water that flow outward away from the shore. During high surf conditions they are most likely to cause problems. Rip currents most typically form at breaks in sandbars and can be narrow or extend to hundreds of yards.
Where do Undertows Occur?
A rip current can occur anywhere there is a shoreline. Even fresh water bodies like the Great Lakes can be affected by these dangerous rivers of water. It is estimated that over 100 people per year lose their lives in a rip current. Go to the US Lifesaving Association statistics page for more details.
