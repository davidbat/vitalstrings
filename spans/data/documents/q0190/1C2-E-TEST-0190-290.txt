Definition:
A tide pool is a puddle of water left when the ocean recedes. This occurs as the tide turns from high tide to low tide.
You can find many interesting animals and seaweeds in a tide pool - including crustaceans like crabs and barnacles, snails, and sometimes even fish.  Pick a tide pool and look closely and patiently - who knows what you'll find!
Also Known As: tidepool, tidal pool
