"Tides" refers to the alternating rise and fall of sea level within a day. What causes the sea level to change? It is actually the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon that cause waters of the ocean to swell and recede at different parts of the earth.
The Moon Tide
The earth and the moon are two great masses that have a significant gravitational pull on each other. This is what keeps the moon in orbit around the earth, and it is also what causes tides to occur in the ocean.
The Sun Tide
The tides are caused mainly by the gravitational attraction of the moon and the earth, but there is also a gravitational attraction between the earth and the sun. The effect of the sun upon the tides is not as significant as the moon’s effects. Basically, the sun’s pull can heighten the moon’s effects or counteract them, depending on where the moon is in relation to the sun.
