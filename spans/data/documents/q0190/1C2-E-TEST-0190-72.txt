High Tides:
You get two of these per day, as the Earth rotates "under" the moon. A Tidal Bulge  is produced on the side of the Earth "beneath" the Moon. While another is produced on the exact gemoetric  opposite side of the Earth.
The bulge under the moon is produced due to gravitational interaction, the mass of the Moon, mass of the Earth are both "tugging" on the mass of the oceans, making them non-uniform and pulling parts of it closer towards the moon.  The bulge produced on the opposite side of the Earth is made because the moon's mass is gravitationally pulling the Earth's mass too, (see visuals in my link).
Spring Tides and Neap Tides:
Both the Moon and the Sun pull on the Earth, but as the moon orbits the Earth, you have different agnles of these two gravitational forces acting on the Earth, and, on its ocean mass.  When you have a first or third quarter moon, the tides are more evenly distributed, when you have a new moon or a full moon, the tides "stretch" out more, because of the gravity of the Sun and of the Moon on Earth do not cancel each other out as much, in fact, they compliment each other.
