The position of the moon relative to the earth.  The gravitational pull of the moon causes a "bulge" of water that follows the moon as it orbits the planet, thus bulge of water is the high tide.  There is a second bulge opposite the moon which is a bit harder to explain, but has to due with reduced pull of gravity because that side is farther from the moon which is the second high tide you see in a day.
Now for extra credit, why are some tide higher than others?  Well the moon does not orbit the center of the earth, it orbits a "barycenter" that is below the surface but not in the center.  So sometimes the moon is closer and the "water bulge" is bigger, resulting is higher tides, which is also amplified when the moon and sun line up.
