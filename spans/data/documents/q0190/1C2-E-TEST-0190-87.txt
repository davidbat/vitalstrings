Mark Thompson, Norfolk astronomer and Chairman              of the Norwich Astronomical Society, writes about what causes the              annual spring tides which each year batter the Norfolk coast.

The sun and the moon affect the water on our planet,                which is why we have tides.
Some are stronger than others as Norfolk                astronomer, Mark Thompson explains.
You may be wondering why the spring tides in Norfolk                are often very dramatic. Well, it's because of the Sun and the Moon.
We all know that our closest neighbour in space                is the Moon.
On average, it's about 380,000km away and although                this seems a very long way, it is still able to have a very important                impact on our lives.
Gravity
Like all objects in space, the Moon has gravity.                Gravity is the force that holds you and me on the Earth and stops                us floating off into space.
It holds the Earth in its orbit around the Sun                and it keeps the Sun travelling around the middle of our milky way                galaxy.
While the gravity of the Earth pulls on the Moon,                the Moon's gravity is also pulling on the Earth. This pull of gravity                causes a bulge to appear on the Earth as the Moon pulls that part                of it very slightly toward it.
We don't really notice this when it's the land                but when it's the sea, we see a much more dramatic effect.
The sea seems to rise and we see this as high tide.
A similar effect is seen directly opposite on the                other side of the Earth.
As the Earth spins on its axis, we experience these                two of these high tides every day. In between this we experience                a low tide.

Have you heard about Spring and Neap tides and                wondered what they are?
When the Moon is in line with the Sun and Earth,                we experience our usual high tide from the                Moon, but the Sun's gravity adds to the force and makes the tide                even higher.
This is when we experience a spring tide.
When the Sun and Moon are at 90 degrees from each                other (such as when the Sun is setting and the Moon is high in the                sky) we see the lowest of the high tides, or neap tide.
We get two spring tides each month and two neap                tides each month. Not only do the tides have an effect on ships                and fishing, but the tides are very important to life in the sea.
Without them it would be a very different world.
