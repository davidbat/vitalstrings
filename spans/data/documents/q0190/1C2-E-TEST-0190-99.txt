David Silverman, president of the American Atheist Group, went on Tuesday's  "O'Reilly Factor" to defend the billboard ads his group has put up around the country calling religion a scam.
O'Reilly began by telling Silverman that his organization is insulting religious people, an accusation Silverman denied, insisting that his message was simply the truth so how could it be offensive.  The conversation then took a strange turn as the host played what he believed to be his trump card of the why God exists debate.
O'REILLY: I'll tell you why [religion's] not a scam, in my opinion: tide goes in, tide goes out.  Never a miscommunication.  You can't explain that.
SILVERMAN: Tide goes in, tide goes out?
O'REILLY: See, the water, the tide comes in and it goes out, Mr. Silverman.  It always comes in, and always goes out.  You can't explain that.
In fact, science has a very good explanation for the tides occur on such a regular basis:
Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth.
Most places in the ocean usually experience two high tides and two low tides each day (semidiurnal tide), but some locations experience only one high and one low tide each day (diurnal tide). The times and amplitude of the tides at the coast are influenced by the alignment of the Sun and Moon, by the pattern of tides in the deep ocean (see figure 4) and by the shape of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry.
To which O'Reilly would no doubt reply: but where does gravity come from!
