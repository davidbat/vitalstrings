The                 gravitational pull of both the moon and the sun on the earth’s                  oceans causes tides. Most bodies of salt water experience a tidal                  change approximately every six hours. The tide may change up to                  seven feet and, along California’s rocky shoreline, a low                 tide exposes places where marine plants and animals live. Not                 only                 do tides change by the day, but there are also times during the                 month when the tidal change is greater.
In                addition, the moon’s revolving around the earth and the earth’s                revolving around the sun affect tides at different times of the year. Early summer (June-July) and early winter (December-January)                are the months of the year with the greatest tidal change. There                are many days at Doheny when there is not enough tidal change to                uncover our rocky reef and expose tide pools.
Doheny’s                tide pools are different from the tide pools found along a rocky                shoreline. San Juan Creek empties into the ocean through our park.                It's flow creates a southward current in front of our campground                and south day use area. The steep drop-off in this area causes the                surf to break right on the sand making wave riding impossible here.                The area directly north of San Juan Creek is rocky because the creek’s                flow causes the sand to move south. The area north of the creek                is where tide pools are found at Doheny. When the tide recedes,                pools are created in the uneven rocky bottom. It is here to look                for the tide pool animals outlined below.
ARTHROPODS
Barnacles
Barnacles are actually                 part of the same group of animals, called crustaceans, as crabs,                 lobster, and shrimp. Adult barnacles look very different from their               crustacean relatives. After birth, barnacle larvae look just like                 larvae of other crustaceans; however, when a barnacle metamorphoses,                 it attaches it self to a hard surface head first and creates                 a cone               around its body made of calcium. Its modified legs, called                cirri, filter water for plankton and detritus like little nets.
These organisms                  are the highest living intertidal marine species. Most species                 can                easily spend half of their lives out of water. Some species only                  need to be wetted with ocean spray making them well adapted                 for                life along California’s rocky, wave swept shoreline. Since               these organisms are sessile, males may become female and vice versa               in some species             in order to reproduce.
Some of the species                found at Doheny are the common Acorn Barnacle (Balanus                glandus) that would be found on rocks in the surf zone.
Red Thatched                Barnacles (Tetraclita rubescens) live alone rather                than in groups. They are brick red in color with only four sides                instead of the usual six, and they like to live under the ledges                of rocks.
Little Brown                Barnacles (Chthamalus dalli) live on rocks in                groups with up to 60,000 individuals per square yard.
The Red                Striped Acorn Barnacle (Balanus pacificus) attaches                it self to other marine life, especially sand dollars. They can                live to a depth of 240 feet. They are smooth in texture and pink                to purple striped in color.
Another barnacle                that likes to attach to other marine life is the White-Ribbed                Barnacle (Megabalanus californicus). It is similar                to the Red Striped Barnacle in that it has pink to red stripes.                These barnacles prefer to attach to crabs, kelp, mussels, and pier                pilings.
Pacific                    Goose Barnacles (Pollicipes polymers) are                    found  in mussel beds only when the tide is the lowest at                    Doheny. These                barnacles look different from other barnacles because their cupped                     feeding appendages are on 3½-inch stalks. The stalks                     are  edible and are eaten in Spain and Portugal.

Crabs
Blue Banded                Hermit Crab – (Pagurus samuelis): The bright                blue bands on their walking legs easily identify these little hermit                crabs. They also have bright red antennae. They live in abandoned                black turban and striped dog winkle shells which is why shells should                not be collected anywhere along California’s coastline. They                are strictly an outer coast species found in the rocky high intertidal                areas. Blue Banded Hermit Crabs have compound eyes that adapt to                both day and night. These crabs feed at night on brown algae and                dead animals. Pile Perch, Sheephead, and Kelpfish love to eat them.

Porcelain                  Crabs - There are several different species of porcelain                  crabs  found at Doheny. These are flat little crabs that easily                  slip under              the rocks to hide, so you won’t find them unless you look under              a rock. This in the most prolific crab in terms of overall numbers                          in our tide pools. A study in Pacific Grove, California, found nearly              900 animals per square meter. They are small, up to ¾ of              an  inch, with long antennae. Some rocks at Doheny may have hundreds              under              them. They live in the high to mid-intertidal areas of our rocky              reef.  Porcelain crabs are filter feeders or feed on detritus --              decaying              plant and animal matter. This is one of many species that relies              on  the protection of the rocks for its livelihood, so never leave              a rock              overturned after you look under it.

Striped Shore              Crab - (Pachygrapsus crassipes): These green to              red or purple crabs with black stripes are active during daylight              hours. They are so well adapted to living out of water that they spend              at least half of the time that way. They have excellent eyesight which              adapts well to both day and night. For the most part, these crabs              feed on land on diatoms and algae. Occasionally they will prey on              hermit crabs and Black Turban snails, and they’ve even been              observed capturing kelp flies with their very dexterous claws. Seagulls,              raccoons, and octopus love to prey on these crabs. Because they are              well adapted to life on land, Striped Shore Crabs will be found in              the rocks along the jetty. But be careful; these crabs may pinch when              handled, so avoid picking them up. Never place them in a container              as they will die and then smell.
Although these crabs                are native to Western North America, scientists believe they may                have been introduced to the Orient in the 1890’s in merchant                ships’ hulls. These hulls may have contained the swimming                planktonic form of this crab in the trapped seawater found in them.

CINDARIANS
Solitary Green Anemone – (Amthopleura xanthogrammica):                   Sea anemones are members of the phylum Cindaria that is the                   same phylum as jellyfish and corals because they have                   stinging cells. These organisms look like flowers with a central                   foot and mouth, as well as multiple tentacles that are used                   to capture  food ranging from small fish to plankton                   to detritus. The tentacles are equipped with specialized                   cells called nematocysts. Nematocysts are like mini spear guns                   that can harpoon and paralyze prey allowing it to be digested                   with ease. The stinging cells are too small to penetrate                   human skin.
There are three                 ways a sea anemone can reproduce. First, they can reproduce by                 releasing             male and female gametes into the                       water column. Secondly, they can divide in half, similar                 to the way a single cell divides. And thirdly, they can reproduce                       by budding. This involves growing a whole new anemone on                         the side of their body which will eventually fall off                 and                         become             a clone of the original anemone.
Anemones have a water vascular system, which means they control                           their movement by either inhaling or exhaling water.               Solitary Green Anemones are common along California’s                           rocky shoreline; however, they are not found very often               on Doheny’s                           flat reef.

ECHINODERMS
Purple                   Sea Urchin – (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus):                  These animals are completely covered with sharp, brightly colored                  purple spines making them easy to recognize. Purple Urchins are                  only found during the lowest tides at the farthest edge of our reef.                  They need highly oxygenated water to survive, so they are well adapted                  to living in the surf. In fact, some excavate an impression in the                  rocks with their sharp spines for protection from predators and                  strong surf. They are able to regenerate their spines when they                  break off.
If you look at a                Purple Urchin carefully in the water you’ll notice tube feet                extending beyond the spines. These tube feet are used to snag pieces                of kelp, their favorite food.
Purple Urchins can                do damage to kelp forests when they become overpopulated. They eat                all algae in site and create an urchin barren which is an area of                denuded rocks covered with Purple Urchins. This happens because                only Sea Otters, sea stars, and Sheephead feed on these animals.                Since Sea Otters are no longer found in the waters off Doheny or                anywhere south of Point Conception, Purple Urchins can easily overpopulate            an area.

Sea Stars
Bat                 Star - (Patiria miniata): Commonly found in                 the intertidal zone to depths of about 870 feet.                 These sea stars                 are also found between Sitka, Alaska and Islas                 de Revillagigedo,               Mexico. These stars are not very large sea stars; in fact,               their arm radius is only four inches. They usually have five arms                 but they can have as few as four or as many as nine. They can                 be almost any color.                 Bat Stars are omnivores and scavengers, which means they will                 try to eat almost anything                they can get their  tube feet on. Spawning usually occurs               in May and July when the males and females release their gametes               into the water column. This is where the eggs are fertilized. When               the sea stars hatch, they are plankton. A week or two after they               hatch they settle to the bottom where they will spend the rest               of their lives.

Brittle                     Star – Brittle Stars belong to the class Ophiuroidea,                     which consists of over 2,000 different species. Of those,                     only 16 species frequent the California coastline. They range                     from shallow water species to extremely dense populations                     that live in deep water along the continental shelf. Brittle                     stars                     are easily distinguished from other sea stars because of                     their thin, segmented rays and their round central disk.                     They also                     have the ability to lose arms when disturbed and regenerate                     them quickly. Not much is known about brittle stars as they                     haven’t been studied yet. However, depending                     on the species, it is known that                     they can be herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous, scavengers                     or even detritus feeders. Brittle stars are often                     found in masses under rocks in areas of Doheny’s reef                     that are usually  covered with water. They are best found                     on a minus                     tide.

Knobby                 Star - (Pisaster gigateus): The Knobby Star                 is a  relatively large sea star that can reach                  24               inches across. They are found from Vancouver Island,               Canada to Baja California in depths ranging from the intertidal               zone to almost 300 feet. These                 sea stars are active predators. They have been known to eat bivalves                 (mussels,               clams, scallops and oysters), chitons, snails, and barnacles. When               they eat, they use their extremely strong tube feet to pull open               their bivalves and then digest their prey outside of their bodies.               Spawning occurs between March and April. An interesting side note;               these sea stars are actually trainable. In laboratories,               they have been trained to associate food with a certain light.

FISH
Northern                    Clingfish – (Gobiesox maeandricus):                    The  northern clingfish is also known as the flathead clingfish,                    the                common clingfish or scientifically, Gobiesox maeandricus.               The clingfish is an oddly shaped fish that looks similar to a tadpole.               They are commonly found from Guadalupe Island, Baja California               to               Revillagigedo Island, southern Alaska. These fish are very common               in the tide pools off Doheny though they are rarely seen because               they hide under rocks that are exposed only during the lowest tides               of the year. These small fish have the ability to literally cling               to the rocks by using their specialized pelvic fin as a suction               cup. The largest northern Clingfish on record was 6.5 inches long.               They will feed on small snails, worms and shrimp. Because of its               small size the northern clingfish has no real economic use, so               no one fishes for it.

Tide Pool                   Sculpin – (Oligocottus maculosus):                   The tide pool sculpin, also known as Oligocottus maculosus,                   is a very common fish from the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia to the                   Bering Sea, Alaska, and down the Eastern Pacific to Southern                   California. Though these fish only reach about 3.5 inches and                   live a maximum of five years, they thrive in the turbulent                   waters of the intertidal zone. They also have the ability to                   withstand very cold-water temperatures. In the Bering Sea they                   have                    been known to live in temperatures as low as 33 degrees Fahrenheit.                   Other interesting characteristics of this species, is                   their uncanny ability to find their way back to their favorite                   tide pool as well as the fact  they have no scales. Tide                   pool sculpin survive by eating isopods, amphipods, shrimp and                   worms. In turn, they are often eaten by larger fish like                   the kelp greenling. They range in coloration from gray to brown                   and even  green with multi-colored speckles.
They are oviparous,                 meaning they lay eggs. The coloration of the eggs seems to depend                 on where they are laid. Eggs laid in protected areas tend to                 be a greenish color, but eggs subject to a lot of water movement                 will be a pinkish color. During the lowest               tides at Doheny you can look for these fish in the pools left behind               as the ocean recedes.

MOLLUSCS
Abalone -                 The abalone is a gastropod mollusk that lives under its ear-like                 shell. Historically                the three most common species of abalone around Dana Point were                  the Black, Pink and Green Abalone. The black abalone was the                 most                common abalone found in the tide pools and surf areas, while the                  pink and green abalones were normally found below the tidal                 line.
Unfortunately,                 abalones  have suffered greatly in recent years. Due to over                 harvesting, poaching                and a disease that spread through the different species, their                 numbers  are just a fraction of what they were 25 years ago.                 The black abalone                has taken the biggest hit, with approximately 1% of its former                 population  remaining. Several years ago, to protect the remaining                 stocks, the                California Department of Fish and Game made it illegal to take                 any  abalone South of San Francisco. The remaining population                 has been                slow to recover.
Abalones are herbivores,                 feasting on the many different algae types found in the area.                 The               different species come in different sizes with blacks being the                 smallest and greens being the largest. The largest abalone along                 the California coast is the cold-water loving red abalone, with               some individuals growing to 10 or more inches across.
Abalones are slow                growing and a full size green abalone of 7 or 8 inches might be                15 years old or more. Abalones reproduce sexually by releasing male                and female gametes into the water to meet by chance for fertilization.                The newly formed planktonic abalones eventually settle onto something                hard to live their lives. Abalones are not big travelers, often                moving less than ten feet over a period of months.
There is a host                of animals that prey on abalones including crabs, lobster, octopus,                starfish, cabezon, sea otter and, of course, humans. If you are                lucky enough to see an abalone in the tide pools, please always                place the rock back as you found. This will ensure others will have                that chance and the abalone will have a chance to grow to maturity                and reproduce to replenish the wild stocks.

Chama - (Chama                   arcane):              The Chama is a type of bivalve -- a class                   of mollusk with two shells -- that cements itself onto the                   underside of rocks on                   Doheny’s                   reef. They live the majority of their lives attached to these                   rocks, only opening their shell enough to extend a siphon to                   filter out very fine food particles from the water. They range                   from Oregon south to Bahia San Juanico, Baja California. Usually                   these animals can be found in small groups, but in some areas                   they will be so densely populated  they will literally                   be cemented on top of each other. Nothing is known about their                   reproductive lives other than  there are two genders.

Chitons - Perhaps                 the most mispronounced animal in the ocean is the chiton. It                 is pronounced               with a hard “k” sound. Chitons are a type of mollusk                that identified by eight shell plates held together by an outside                oval of tissue called a girdle. Most chitons are light sensitive                so they’ll be found under rocks. Some species are brightly                colored while others are well camouflaged. Chitons are found almost                everywhere in the ocean – from the high intertidal zone to               as deep as 4000 meters. They are at home in cold arctic seas as               well as in the warm tropical waters near the Equator. Most chitons               are vegetarians, but some are carnivorous.
Some species found at Doheny are the California Spiny Chiton (Nuttallina                californica). California Spiny Chitons are up to two inches                long with a narrow body. The body length is two to three times the                width. These chitons live in depressions in the rocks of Doheny’s                reef. At high tide they feed on a type of red algae called Corallina                which often grow right on their shell plates. Western Sea Gulls                eat these chitons when the tide is low.
The Southern                Spiny Chiton (Nuttallina scalora) doesn’t                retreat from sunlight and is colorful. Body color varies from green                to brown to black. They are up to an inch in length with a life                span of up to twenty or more years.
Hairy Chitons (Mopalia ciliata) are covered in soft hairs and are similar                to the Mossy Chiton. The hair makes them more tolerant of daylight;                however, they feed on diatoms at night and stay put during low tide.                Their radula, which is the mouth mechanism for scraping algae off                rocks, can pick up magnetite from the rocks making their mouth magnetic.
A similar looking                species, the Mossy Chiton (Mopalia muscoa),                is covered in stiff hairs making it look fuzzy. They may be found                on the topsides of rocks during low tide, especially if it is overcast.                At night, they feed on red or green algae. Other marine life may                be found living on their bodies.

Limpets -                 There                   are several different species of limpets in the Doheny area.                   Limpets are mollusks               closely related to abalones. They range in size from ½ inch               to 3 inches with  the Owl Limpet second only to the Giant Keyhole               Limpet in size. The Owl Limpet gets its name from the muscle scar               found on the inside of its shell. This scar resembles the silhouette               of a Great Horned Owl.
Limpets are herbivores                that feed on algae. The shape of their shells often helps them stay                affixed to the rocks in the surf zone. At low tide, the limpet will                grip tight to the rocks and trap small amounts of water under the                shell which the animal will use until water is available again at                the next tidal change.
About half of all                 limpets species display homing tendencies. This means that during                 high tide when water is covering the animal it will range over                 a meter                 or so of rock in search of food. As the tide recedes, the limpet                 will return to its original place on the rock to remain until                 the               next high tide.
Predators of the                limpet include sea stars, crabs, octopus and man. Be careful when                you’re in the tide pools not to crush limpets by stepping                on them or turning rocks on top of them.

Navanax - The navanax is a                medium-sized sea slug with two distinct color forms. One is dark,                the other light. Both have striations of blue, yellow, orange and                white down the length of their body. They can be found in sandy                or muddy bodies of water where it is calm, although they are often                spotted in the tide pools at Doheny nearest lifeguard tower 13.
This sea slug is                carnivorous, feeding on other sea snails and slugs. The navanax                will follow its prey’s mucus trails for its dinner. One of                the navanax’s favorite meals is the Bubble snail. The navanax                will often have so many inside of its soft body that when you pick                it up it will feel very lumpy. This is where its nickname “bag                of marbles snail” comes from.
Although not preyed                upon by too many animals, if disturbed, the navanax will extrude                a bright yellow fluid similar to the purple fluid released by the                sea hare. Also like its cousin the sea hare, each navanax will release                millions of eggs every spring in a clump, similar in color and size                to spaghetti.

Sea                Hares
Black                Sea Hare or California Black Sea Hare – (Aplysia vaccaria): Sea hares are large mollusks                that lack an external shell, and they get their name because their                antennae resemble rabbit ears. These sea hares are very similar                to the Brown Sea Hare and are identified by their uniform black                to dark brown coloration. The most distinguishing feature of these                sea hares is their size as they are the world’s largest gastropod                weighing up to 35 pounds.
They,                too, are found along the water’s edge at Doheny to a depth                of 60 feet. They feed exclusively on brown feather boa kelp so they                don’t produce purple ink.
They                are also hermaphrodites like Brown Sea Hares except their eggs are                tangled pinkish-white egg strings.
Brown                Sea Hare or California Sea Hare – (Aplysia californica): These sea hares are reddish brown                to greenish brown with some mottling. They have two elongated flaps                with an internal shell. They begin to appear on Doheny’s rocky                reef from May through the summer months living near the water’s                edge to a depth of sixty feet. These animals are active during the                day making them easy to spot in spring and summer.
Sea                hares are herbivores, feeding primarily on red algae. They have                a complicated digestive system with three stomachs. Purple ink,                which is their defense system, is derived from the algae they eat.                Be careful when handling, as the ink will stain clothing.
Living                only for a year, these sea hares are hermaphrodites having both                male and female reproductive organs. All they have to do is locate                another sea hare of the same species. They lay up to a million eggs                that look like yellowish spaghetti. The eggs hatch in 12 days. After                hatching, the larvae swim for about a month before settling on red                algae. They then gorge themselves in order to double their weight                every ten days for the next three months.

Snails
Black Turban                    Snail – (Tegula funebralis): The Black                    Turban  snail is a common snail at Doheny with a distinctive                    black shell                found in the upper intertidal zone. In size, its shell is about                     1 to 1¼ inches or 3 centimeters in diameter. Black Turbans  eat a variety of algae, especially the microscopic                     film that grows                on the surface of rocks. If you examine the snail’s shell                closely, you might find a small Black Limpet, called Collisella                 asmi, living on it. Tiny algae live on the Black Turban’s               shell that these Black Limpets eat. During low tide, Black Turbans               will often group together and during this time the Black Limpets               will move from shell to shell. Blue-banded Hermit Crabs love to               live in the abandoned Black Turban shells so never collect shells               when you visit Doheny or any other tide pool.

Cloudy              Bubble Snail – (Bulla gouldiana): This is              an abundant snail found from Morro Bay, California south to Ecuador.              Living solely in mud and silt substrates, they are generally believed              to be herbivores though this is not well known. This is the largest              species of bubble snail off our coast reaching a maximum size of 5.5              cm and living about a year. These snails cover their shell with their              mantels so the shell will be free from other growth. Believe it or              not, it is not uncommon to find other organisms living in or on these              snails. The pea crab and the crepidula snail can be found in the mantle              cavity of the bubble snail. If you can’t find a bubble snail,              they leave distinctive tracks in the sand. Follow the tracks, and              you might find the snail.
