Changes in elevation of the ocean surface
Caused by gravitational forces of the
Moon, and to a lesser extent
The Sun
During new or full moons
Gravitational effects combined
Especially at high and low tides
Large daily tidal range
First and third quarter moons
Gravitational effects are offset
Daily tidal effect is least
Other influencing factors
Configuration of the ocean basin
Tidal Currents
