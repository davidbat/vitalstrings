Types of energy. Energy exists  in many forms, this are the main forms:
 
*Chemical  energy. Chemical energy is stored in chemicals, which are made from  atoms that are linked together to make molecules. The energy is released when  the links between some of the atoms are broken down into smaller molecules.
 
*Gravitational  energy. This is the force of gravity between an object and the Earth,  pulling the object down towards the planet. If an object is in a position, above  the surface of the Earth, it possesses stored energy called; gravitational  energy.
 
*Strain  energy. Elastic materials can change shape (by squashing, stretching or  bending). As they do so, they store strain energy. This energy allows them to  return to their original form.
 
*Nuclear  energy. Every substance made from atoms, has a nucleus, made from protons  and neutrons. In most elements these are strongly bound together, but in some  they aren’t. Than the unstable nuclei may split up to form stable ones. This  releases (nuclear) energy.
 
2  other forms of stored energy. Magnetic potential energy  and electrostatic energy.
 
*Kinetic  energy; is the movement of energy.
 
*Internal  energy. Molecules  move inside a solid by kinetic energy. This movement is made by the internal  energy of the substance. The internal energy is increased by heating the  substance.
 
*Thermal energy. Thermal  energy is the energy supplied to a substance which increases its internal  kinetic energy. Mostly it's called heat energy. Another (scientific) name is  Thermal energy.
 
*Sound energy. Sound energy  is formed by the vibration of an object. The energy passes through the air by  the movement of the atoms and molecules. Sound energy spread in all directions  from the point of vibration.
 
*Electrical  energy. Electrical  energy is the movement of electrons though an electrical conductor.
*Radiation  energy. This kind of energy travels in waves which contain some electricity and some  magnetism. They are called electromagnetic waves. There are a lot of different  wave sizes and wavelengths. They are divided into 7 groups. These groups are:  radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultra violet, x-rays and gamma  rays. This are 3 examples:
 
*Light  energy. The light energy escaping from the sun we see as a rainbow. Because our eyes see  different wavelengths as different colours.
*Infrared  radiation. Infrared radiation carries heat (thermal energy) in the form of electromagnetic  waves which we feel as the warmth on our skin.
*Ultraviolet  light. UV light gives our skin a tan. That’s caused by the chemical changes in our  skin. UV light comes on earth as great amounts because of the destruction of the  ozone layer.
 
Energy changes. Energy can be transferred from one form to another. The object or material in  which the energy changes form is called the energy converter or energy  transducer. The flow of energy through one or more energy converters is called  an energy chain.
 
Sources of energy. We use many different sources of energy to provide everything we use in our  everyday lives.
 
Nuclear  fusion in the sun. At the  centre of a star it’s so hot that hydrogen nuclei move fast enough to fuse  together, to form helium. Than energy is released which is radiated from the  sun’s surface as electromagnetic waves.
 
Energy from the Sun’s light.
 
Biomass; the amount of matter in a living thing.
 
*Food. Food stored in plants may be eaten by herbivores (e.g. sheep) or omnivores (such  as ourselves). Crops we eat provides us with energy. Food provides animals with  chemical potential energy. They use this energy to alive and build up their  bodies. We take in stored energy, from animals when we eat their meat.
 
*Fuel wood. In many countries were there isn’t any coal, wood is used as fuel for cooking  and heating.  
 
*Ethanol. Countries with a shortage of material to make petrol, ferment plants such as  sugar, cane and grain to make ethanol (a type of alcohol). This is mixed with  petrol and reduces the demand for oil.
 
Energy from  food wastes.
 
*Biogas. Wastes of eaten food can be used as a source of energy. The wastes from  vegetables, humans and animals can be stored in biogas digesters, where  microorganisms feed. As they do methane gas is produced. This gas can be used  for cooking or lighting and as a fuel to generate electricity.
 
*Dung. In some countries dung of domestic animals is collected, dried and made into  fuel cakes for burning.
 
Fossil  fuels. Coal is  formed from large plants which grew in swamps ± 275 million years ago. They died > fell into swamps, there was a lack of oxygen in the swamp which prevented  bacteria growing and decomposing the dead plants. The plants formed peat > the  peat became buried and was squashed by the rocks formed above. The increase in  pressure squeezed the water out of the peat and warmed it. These processes  slowly changed the peat into coal.
 
Solar cells; are made from materials which converts some of the energy in sunlight into  electrical energy.
 
Energy from the Sun’s heat. Most  of the energy from the sun is in the form of infrared radiation. This warms the  earth and the atmosphere.
 
Movement of  the atmosphere. The air nearest the Earth’s surface warms the fastest and then rises. It’s  replaced by cooler air. The cycle repeats itself every time.
 
Movement of  water.
 
*Flowing  water. The Sun’s heating effect causes the evaporation of water from the surfaces of  the oceans and lakes. The water vapour rises and forms clouds as the air cools.
 
*Waves.  Waves are produced by wind blowing on the oceans. Kinetic energy from the wind  in changed into kinetic energy of the water. There are machines who can change  that kinetic energy into electrical energy.
 
*Solar  Panels. Solar panels heat water in a house on a sunny day; In the panel are pipes which  carry water. They run over a black surface which absorbs infrared radiation from  the sun. The water is warmed in a hot water tank.
 
Energy from nuclear reactions on Earth. The unstable elements (in  the Earth) are called radioactive elements. As the
become stable they release particles and energy. We use energy from radioactive  materials (found in and below the Earth’s crust).
 
Fission. The atoms of some heavy elements such as uranium can split into two smaller,  more stable atoms. This process, called nuclear fission, releases large amounts  of energy.
 
Heat energy in the Earth. There are radioactive materials beneath the Earth’s crust which releases energy  that heats the core and mantle. Under the crust water heats and forms geysers.  The heat in the rocks under the crust can be used as a source of energy. Than  cold water is pumped down to the hot rocks where it is turned to steam. Through  pipes it is returned to the surface. Then it’s used to generate electricity in a  power station.
 
Energy form gravitational forces.
 
The Moon, the Sun and the  tides. Water in oceans is pulled down by the Earth’s gravity and by the gravitational  pull of the moon and to a smaller extent by the gravitational pull of the Sun.  Difference in force causes the water beneath the moon and on the opposite side  of the Earth to rise up slightly, causing high tide. The level of water in other  parts of the ocean falls, causing a low tide at those places.
 
Twice  a month the Sun and the Moon are in line as the Moon orbits the Earth. At these  times the difference in the sea level at high and low tide is greatest as the  (small) gravitational pull of the Sun reinforces the effect of the stronger pull  of the Moon. The tides are than called spring tides.
 
Energy stored in the water at high tide is used by to generate electricity. A  dam built across an estuary and the rising water of the tide passes through the  pipes in which turbines turn. This movement is passed to a generator and  electricity is produced. When the tide falls the water passes through the pipes  in the opposite direction and turns the turbine again, so even more electricity  is generated.
 
Non-renewable and renewable energy sources. The sources of energy are divided into 2 groups.
ˇ
*Now renewable energy sources. These sources cannot be  replaced once they’ve been used up (e.g. fossil fuels and radioactive materials)
 
*Renewable energy sources. These sources can be replaced. (e.g. light and heat from the Sun, biomass,  geothermal energy and kinetic energy of the wind, water, waves and the tides)
