A report from Discovery has investigated the whole phenomenon of glowing ocean waves on scientific basis to explore the cause. Jorge Ribas, a well known marine scientist, explains that it is colossal red tide which causes glowing … this colossal red tide is also termed as algae bloom, of bioluminescent phytoplankton (Lingulodinium polyedrum). The microorganisms produce light in reply to stress, such as when a wave collides with the shore, a surfboard slashes through the surf, or a kayaker’s paddle splashes the water. As a result, the cool glowing waves emerge to make the whole scenario highly astonishing and cutely magical.
This stunning phenomenon has been observed by thousands of beach lovers at various times since 1900 around the beaches of California and San Diego. When algal blooms gift the water a splendid red glow, the scientists call it “Red Tide”. However, it should be noted that there are a few kinds of “Red Tide” those might be killer enough for the folks and marine life……though the glowing waves striking to the shore of San Diego are reportedly nontoxic and undisruptive.
For surfers who don’t mind catching a wave in water teeming with a sludge of microorganisms, the glowing ocean offers the chance of a lifetime. Night swimmers also often delight in the opportunity to lounge in a bioluminescent sea. The organisms can also be present in wet beach sand, so even beach walkers can watch as the ground sparkles with every footstep.
