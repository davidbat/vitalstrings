 
Introduction:
Have you ever visited the ocean?  Have you ever built a sand castle and then watched the waves get closer and closer until they start washing away the outer wall of your sand castle.  Bit by bit your castle starts to crumble into the sea.  Slowly the waves come higher and higher up the beach until your entire sand castle is washed away.  The tide has come in. 
 
But why does that happen?  What is the tide?
 
Instructions:
A treasure hunt is a fun way to find information on the Internet in order to answer some questions. 
 
This Treasure Hunt is about the Ocean Tides.  It will lead you to some web pages about the tides.  Click on each Internet link and read carefully before answering each question.  You may not always need to read the whole web page to find the answer.  Answer each question in a complete sentence on the answer sheet.
