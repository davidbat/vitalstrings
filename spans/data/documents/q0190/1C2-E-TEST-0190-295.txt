Eclipses, Tides, and Moon Phases
Lesson 4 - Moon Phases, Eclipses, and Tides
Notes
* The positions of the moon, Earth, and the sun cause the phases of the moon, eclipses, and tides.
* The moon revolves around Earth about once every 27.3 days. It also rotates on its own axis about once every 27.3           days. The same side of the moon always faces Earth. 
phases - the different shapes of the moon you see from Earth, which  are caused by changes in the           relative position of the moon, Earth, and sun. The phase of the moon you see depends on how much of the sunlit side of the moon faces Earth.
eclipse - when the moon’s shadow hits Earth (solar) or Earth’s           shadow hits the moon (lunar). 
solar eclipse  - occurs when the moon passes between Earth and           the sun, blocking the sunlight from reaching Earth. The moon’s shadow then hits Earth. The darkest part of the moon’s           shadow is called the umbra. From any part of the umbra, the moon completely blocks light from the sun. Only people in the umbra see a total solar           eclipse. Another part of the shadow is less dark and larger than the umbra. It is called the penumbra. From within the penumbra, people see a partial           eclipse, because part of the sun is still visible.
lunar eclipse  - occurs at a full moon when Earth is directly between the moon and the sun. During a lunar eclipse, Earth’s           shadow falls on the moon. Earth’s shadow also has an umbra and a penumbra. When the moon is completely within Earth’s umbra you see a total lunar           eclipse. A partial lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves into Earth’s penumbra.
tides - the rise and fall of the ocean’s water every 12.5 hours or so. The force of gravity pulls the moon and Earth toward each           other. Tides occur mainly because of differences in how much the moon pulls on different parts of Earth. As Earth rotates, the moon’s gravity pulls water           toward the point on Earth’s surface closest to the moon. The moon pulls least on the side of Earth farthest away. Two tides occur each day because of this           difference in the pull of the moon’s gravity.
Both the Moon and Sun Cause Tides
 
spring tide - twice a month, the moon, Earth, and the sun are in a straight line. The combined forces of the gravity of           the sun and moon produce an especially high tide and an especially low tide. 
neap tide - twice a month, when the pull of gravity of the sun and moon are at right angles to each other,  the           high tide is lower than usual and the low tides then are higher than usual.

STANDARD III. Earth Science
Unit of Study: Earth and Space Systems
A.  Earth in the Solar System
4.  Most objects in the solar system are in regular and predictable motion, which explains such phenomena as the day, the year, phases of the moon, and eclipses.
  b. Sequence and predict the phases of the moon (e.g., waxing, waning, crescent, new, and full).
  c. Demonstrate the arrangement of the sun, the moon and the earth during solar and lunar eclipses (including partial eclipses).
5.  Gravity alone holds us to the earth’s surface and explains the phenomena of the tides.
 b. Diagram the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth during tides.
 c. Examine the effect of the sun and moon on tides.
