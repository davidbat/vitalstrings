Background
The tides cycle with the 24-hour 50-minute lunar day.  The lunar day is 50        minutes longer than a solar day because the moon revolves around the Earth in        the same direction that the Earth rotates around its axis.  So, it takes        the Earth an extra 50 minutes to “catch up” to the moon.  In most places,        there are two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes.  This means that high tides occur 12 hours and 25 minutes apart.  So for        example, if the first high tide of the day occurs at 1:10 am, then next will        occur at 2:00 pm.  When the two highs and the two lows are about the same        height, the pattern is called a semi-daily or semidiurnal tide.
If the Earth were a perfect sphere without large continents, all areas on the        planet would experience two equally proportioned high and low tides every lunar        day. The large continents on the planet, however, block the westward passage of        the tidal bulges as the Earth rotates. Unable to move freely around the globe,        these tides establish complex patterns within each ocean basin that often differ        greatly from tidal patterns of adjacent ocean basins or other regions of the        same ocean basin (Sumich, J.L., 1996).
Disruption of the water flow can cause areas to experience different heights        between the high and low tides.  When this pattern occurs, the pattern is        called a mixed semidiurnal tide.  For example, if the first high tide of        the day occurs at 2:00 am, and is 1 ft, the second high tide of the day would        occur at 2:50 pm, but may be 4 ft.  The U.S. West Coast tends to have mixed        semidiurnal tides.
Some areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico, have only one high and one low tide each        day. This is called a diurnal tide. (Sumich, J.L., 1996; Thurman, H.V., 1994;        Ross, D.A., 1995).
The shape of bays and estuaries also can magnify the intensity of tides.  The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia is the classic example of this effect, and has        the highest tides in the world—over 15 meters (Thurman, H.V., 1994).  Narrow inlets and shallow water also tend to dissipate incoming tides.
Because tides can range in size and type, it has become extremely important to        predict and measure tides.  To measure the height of tides, it is necessary        to figure out a starting point.  The National Ocean Service (NOS) of the        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been measuring tides        for many years.  They compile all of the information to determine tidal        datums, used as a basis for measuring or calculating the heights of tides.
Tidal Datum Definitions
National Tidal Datum Epoch – The specific 19-year period adopted by the National        Ocean Service as the official time segment over which tide observations are        taken and reduced to obtain mean values for tidal datums.
 
Elevation
Mean Higher High Water (MHHW)
The average of the higher high water      height of each tidal day observed over the National Tidal Datum Epoch.
Mean High Water (MHW)
The average of all of the high water      heights of each tidal day observed over the NTDE.
