Who knew red tide caused blue waves?
San Diego's beaches are captivating many with an eerie nighttime phenomenon. It seems that "red tide" is causing bioluminescent glow-in-the-dark waves in the area, a sight that's almost too eerie to believe.
But you can see it for yourself in the videos below.
According to the Los Angeles Times , an unusual algae bloom has turned the surf red by day, and provided this effect at night.
The electric blue glow is caused by an algae bloom commonly referred to as a “red tide.” The organism,  a phytoplankton called Lingulodinium polyedrum, has bloomed since late August, turning the water a brownish-red color in the daytime, according to UC San Diego scientists.
More specifically, the color is caused by a chemical reaction that results from the movement of the algae. Move a whole lot of algae at once (in say, the crash of a wave) and a brilliant flash of light becomes visible.
The event is mildly toxic, GrindTV reported , but isn't really harmful to humans beyond making a swim a bit uncomfortable. However the phenomenon has brought out all sorts of adventurous types, especially surfers who can't wait to say they rode glow-in-the-dark waves. Its at least a lot safer than this attempt at glow-in-the-dark surfing .
How much longer the blue surf will last is unknown. According to the L.A. Times , while some spots have cleared up others remain colored.
