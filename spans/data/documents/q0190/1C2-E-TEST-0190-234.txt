Galileo's Theory of the Tides
by Rossella Gigli
What is the cause of the tides? In the age of Galileo,          this question had many answers, from animistic concepts about the "breath"          of the earth, to the pre-Newtonian intuition that the moon should have          something to do with the sea's motions. But Galileo saw this problem in          a different way, connecting it to the whole structure of the Copernican universe . In 1597 the          Pisan scientist wrote a letter to Kepler , saying that he had found in the          Copernican doctrine a way to explain many natural phenomena, [1] perhaps (as Kepler supposed, referring to Galileo's letter)          even a puzzling one, like that of the tides. [2] What,          exactly, the Galilean solution to the problem of the tides was, became          clear only in 1616, when Galileo was in Rome, trying to convince the Church          not to ban the Copernican theory. After this attempt failed, with the          consequence that the Copernican position could no longer be held or defended,          Galileo wrote his "Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare", in the          form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini. [3]
In this letter Galileo examines in how many ways the          water contained in a vase can move. A first way derives from the slope          of the vase, like that of the bed of a river. Secondly, an external cause          (such as a strong wind) can produce waves in the water. But there is also          a third cause for the water to move: the motion of the vase itself. Indeed,          if the vase has an irregular motion (i.e. with accelerations and decelerations),          the water also acquires a motion. Galileo makes a comparison between the          water and the seas and between the vase and the earth, so that the changes          in the motions of the sea can be effects of an irregularity in the earth          motion. Galileo's theory is based on the following reasoning: the Copernican          earth is affected by two main circular motions, i. e. the annual revolution          around the sun and the diurnal rotation. Due to a additive effect of these          motions, there is an alteration in the surface speed of the earth, every          12 hours. Referring to the diagram, in which the large circle represents          the earth's annual orbit and the small circle the earth itself, Galileo          explained his ideas as follows:
[W]hile the circle BCDL turns on itself in the direction            BCD, there are in its circumference mutually contrary movements: for,            while the parts near C go down, the opposite ones near L go up; and            while the parts near B move toward the left, the part on the opposite            side near D move toward the right. Thus, in a complete rotation the            point marked B first moves down and toward the left; when it is near            C, it descends the most and begins to move toward the right; at D it            no longer goes down, but moves most toward the right and begins to go            up; and at L it ascends the most, begins to move slowly toward the left,            and goes up till B. Now let us combine the specific motions of the parts            of the earth with the general movement by the whole globe through the            circumference AFG. We shall find that the absolute motion of the upper            part (near B) is always fastest, resulting from the composition of the            annual motion along the circumference AF and the specific motion of            the part B, which two motions reinforce each other and add up toward            the left; on the other hand, the absolute motion of the lower parts            near D is always slowest, since the specific motion of D, which here            is fastest toward the right, must be subtracted from the annual motion            along the circumference AF, which is toward the left. . . . [4]
Thus, for 12 hours, a point on the earth's surface        will move eastward, in opposition to the global westward movement of the        earth, and for 12 hours it will move westward, in the same direction as        the annual motion. The composition of these motions causes on one hand a        slackening (due to a subtraction of two opposite motions) and on the other        hand an acceleration (due to an addition of two motions in the same direction).

With this mechanism, Galileo thought he had found the          irregularity in the movement of the vase (the earth), able to move the          water (the seas). Although this irregularity is not perceived by us on          solid ground, Galileo was sure it was shown by the oceans, by the ebb          and flow of the tides. Galileo intended to solve two problems at the same          time: the tides are not a mystery any more if we consider them an effect          of the earth's motions, and the earth's motions themselves (i.e. the Copernican          system) are not absurd any more if we consider the tides a tangible proof          of these motions.
Such a theory remained in Galileo's mind until 1623,          when Maffeo Barberini , who was          considered a friend and a patron of artists and scientists, became Pope          (Urban VIII). Galileo tried to propose again the Copernican question,          and obtained the permit to write a dialogue, in which to discuss the arguments          for the two main world systems ( Ptolemaic and Copernican ), without presenting a final          verdict. Galileo worked for almost 10 years at the Dialogue: it          is divided in four Days in which Salviati (a Copernican) and Simplicio          (an Aristotelian) confront each other; a third character (Sagredo) listens          to them, often intervening in favor of Salviati. In the Fourth Day of          this masterpiece appears the theory of the tides again, the proof that          the earth's motions are not a fiction, that the fluctuations of the sea          are effects of mechanical causes and not of a magical attraction between          the moon and the water. The earth is a planet: all that happens on it          is caused by its own motions, not by the astral influences. This proof,          however, presented the final verdict that the Pope did not want the Dialogue to contain: Galileo was brought before the Inquisition and again lost          his battle.
Many critical questions are involved in this Galileo          theory of the tides: first of all the fact that, rejecting any kind of          attractive force as the real cause of the tides, this theory was, in Newtonian          terms, an error. Nevertheless this judgment has for a long time impeded          a historical evaluation of Galileo's theory. Only in some recent essays          the question is examined with more care and is judged in the context of          the physical and astronomical debate of the seventeenth century. To accuse          Galileo of an excess of scientific realism, or even of presumption (as          some authors have done), is to lose the possibility of historical reconstruction          in which what counts is not the achievement of the future, but the efforts          to reach them. Galileo was trying to build a scientific method in a world          based more on books than on the nature, more on astrology than on astronomy,          more on closing one's eyes than on observing through the telescope. That          his theory of the tides did not survive the critical judgment of his successors          is not germane to historical inquiry.
