Tides
Ocean tides are periodic rises and falls in the level of the sea, and are       formed by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun on the water in       the ocean. Although the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it has a       greater gravitational attraction for the Earth because the Moon is much       closer to Earth. This causes the oceans to bulge out in the direction of       the Moon.
Equilibrium Theory of Tides
Two theories help explain tides. The equilibrium theory of tides uses         the universal laws of physics, as applied to a water-covered Earth. The         dynamic theory of tides studies tides as they occur in the real world,         modified by landmasses, geometry of the ocean basins , and Earth's rotation.
The equilibrium tidal theory begins with a hypothetical, water-covered         planet and its satellite moon orbiting the Sun. The Moon is held in         orbit with Earth by Earth's gravitational force. There is also a centrifugal force pulling the Moon away from Earth and trying to send it spinning         out into space.
Earth and the Moon rotate around the common center of mass of the         Earth-Moon system; this system is held in orbit by the Sun's         gravitational attraction while centrifugal force pulls the center of the         mass away from the Sun. Both forces, gravitational and centrifugal, must         reach and maintain equilibrium to hold the Earth-Moon system in orbit.
Most ocean shorelines experience a high tide and a low tide (shown             here) every day. Certain locations have two high and two low tides             per day. Still other locations have mixed or unequal tide cycles.
In the Earth-Moon-Sun system, the mass of the Sun is greatest, but its         extreme distance renders its gravitational pull nominal. The         tidegenerating force of the Moon and Sun vary as the inverse cube of         their distances from Earth. The mass of the Moon is very small by         comparison, but it is considerably closer, and therefore has a greater         attractive effect on water particles than does the Sun.
Lunar Tides.
Water responds to the Moon's gravitational force by flowing         toward it, making a bulge on the surface of the ocean. On the side of         Earth facing the Moon, gravitational force is applied to water particles         toward the Moon. This force produces a lunar bulge in the layer of ocean         water. At the same time, the centrifugal force of the Earth-Moon system         acting on the water particles at Earth's surface opposite the         Moon creates a second bulge.
Two lunar bulges on opposite sides of Earth are created on a planet         covered by a uniformly deep ocean. The bulges represent the crests of         the two tidal waves (high tide), directly opposite each other, and the         low water areas are the two troughs (low tide). The equilibrium tidal         theory predicts tides that are semidiurnal, which means two high and two         low tides each day.
Earth and the Moon are moving in the same direction along their orbit         with the Sun. Earth rotates once during a 24-hour period but Earth must         turn an extra 12 degrees, or 50 minutes, for the Moon to be directly         over the same place as the day before because of the Moon's         rotation. Therefore a tidal day is not 24 hours long but rather 24 hours         and 50 minutes, and the tidal period between high tides is 12 hours and         25 minutes. This explains why tides arrive at the same location about an hour later each day. The wavelength of the two tidal waves is one-half         the circumference of Earth.
Solar Tides.
The Moon plays the greatest role in tide-building, but the Sun also         produces its own tidal bulge. Though of much greater mass, the         Sun's distance reduces its tide-raising force to only 46 percent         that of the Moon, and the tide period is 24 hours, not 24 hours and 50         minutes. The lunar
Tidal maxima are greatest during spring tides (part [a]), which             arise during each phase of a new moon or a full moon when Earth,             Sun, and Moon are aligned. Conversely, twice each month when the Sun             and Moon are at right angles to the Earth and hence are opposing one             another, the tidal ranges are slighter and are called neap tides             (part [b]).
bulge created by the Moon has greater influence on the ocean and         continually moves eastward relative to the solar bulge produced by the         Sun.
On land, the tides appear to flood in during a high tide, earning the         name flood tide, and then flow back out to sea as an ebb tide.         Earth's rotation is responsible for carrying the landmasses into         and out of the tidal bulges. It is as if Earth were constantly rotating         inside a fluid envelope of ocean whose tidal bulges are supported by both the Moon and Sun.
Spring and Neap Tides
During the 29.5 days it takes for the Moon to orbit Earth, the Sun,         Earth, and Moon move in and out of alignment with each other. During the         period of the new Moon, the Sun and Moon are lined up on the same side         of Earth so that the high tides that are produced independently of each         other coincide. The tide level is the result of adding the two waveforms         together, producing tides of maximum range between high and low water.         These are called spring tides (see part [a] above).
One week later, the Moon is in its first quarter and moves about 12         degrees per day, until it is at a 90-degree angle to the solar bulge         (see part [b]). The crests of the lunar bulge will now coincide with the         troughs, produced by the Sun, and the same is true of the Sun's         crests and Moon's troughs. These tides are called neap tides.         Tidal effects of the Moon and Sun tend to cancel each other out, and the         range between high and low tide is small.
At the end of another week, the Moon phase is full and the Sun, Earth,         and Moon are again in alignment; however, they are on opposite sides of         Earth. This again produces spring tides with crests that coincide, but         generally slightly less than during the new Moon phase. These are         followed again by neap tides, 1 week later, and the 4-week cycle         continues with spring tides and neap tides every other week.
Tides are an extreme example of shallow-water waves. The extremely long         wavelength of the tidal wave is 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles)         compared to an average ocean depth of 4 kilometer. A shallow wave is one         traveling in water depths less than 1/20 of its wavelength; because         4/20,000 is considerable smaller than 1/20, tides are shallow waves. The         tidal wave is a progressive wave as it moves through the ocean; however,         it is far different than wind-driven, progressive waves. Tidal bulges         move as forced waves, with their velocity determined by ocean depth.
Dynamic Theory of Tides
Fortunately for land-dwelling creatures, Earth is not the watery world         depicted in the equilibrium tidal theory. To study ocean tides, which         are modified by landmasses, the geometry of ocean basins and         Earth's rotation and declination, scientists developed the         dynamic theory of tides.
Tide Patterns.
Tides behave differently in various parts of the world. Some coastal         areas experience a regular pattern of one high tide and one low tide         each day, known as a diurnal tide. This pattern is common in shallow         inland seas, such the Gulf of Mexico and along the coast of Southeast         Asia, and exhibits a tidal period of 24 hours, 50 minutes.
In many areas, including the Atlantic Coast of the United States, there         is a high tide to low tide sequence repeated twice a day, termed a         semidiurnal tide. These tides usually reach about the same level at high         and low tides each day, and have a tidal period of 12 hours, 25 minutes.
The third pattern of tide has two high and two low tides per day, but         the tides reach different high and low levels during each daily rhythm.         Called a semidiurnal mixed tide, it results from combining a semidiurnal         and diurnal tide. Mixed tides commonly have a tidal period of 12 hours,         25 minutes, but may also exhibit diurnal periods. This is the most         common tide pattern throughout the world, and is found along the Pacific         Coast of the United States.
Declination Tides.
If Earth and the Moon are aligned so that the Moon is north or south of         Earth's equator, one tidal bulge will be in the Northern         Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere. A point in the middle         latitudes passes through only one crest and one trough during each tidal         day. This type of diurnal tide is called a declination tide, because the         Moon is said to have declination when it stands above or below the         equator and not perpendicular to it.
The Sun also influences declination tides when it is aligned over 23.5         degrees north or south latitude at the summer and winter solstice. The         variation causes the bulge created by the Sun to oscillate north to         south, making a more diurnal Sun tide during the winter and summer         months. The Moon's declination is at 28.5 degrees north to south         latitude, and because
The Bay of Fundy (between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada)             experiences the highest tidal range in the world. At low tide (shown             here), coastal waters are temporarily reduced to mud flats.
the orbit is inclined 5 degrees to the Earth and Sun orbit, it takes         18.6 years for the Moon to complete its cycle of maximum declination.
Also, the Moon does not move around Earth in a perfectly circular orbit         and Earth does not circle the Sun at a constant distance. In the         Northern Hemisphere, Earth is closer to the Sun in the winter months, so         the solar tides play a greater role as a tide producer in the winter         than summer.
Coriolis Effect
Another influence on waves, tides, and ocean currents is the Coriolis         effect. Earth is constantly rotating towards the east and the speed of         Earth's rotation varies greatly at different latitudes. It         travels fastest on the equator and slows in speed at the farther         latitudes. Because of this, the Coriolis effect forces moving objects on         Earth to follow curved paths. In the Northern Hemisphere, an object will         follow a path to the right of its intended course, and in the Southern         Hemisphere, an object will follow a path to the left of its intended         course.
The Coriolis effect acts on all objects moving freely over the surface         of Earth, and has a dramatic effect on atmospheric circulation and ocean         currents and tides. Most ocean basins in the Northern Hemisphere will         exhibit a circular current flow, known as a gyre, that rotates in a         clockwise direction. The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere         where ocean gyres predominately rotate counterclockwise.
Landforms and Tides
There are over 150 factors that can affect tide behavior along any given         coast or ocean basin. The greatest influences on the tides are the         Coriolis effect, landforms, and ocean depth.
An idealized tidal wave would move across Earth at 1,600 kilometers per         hour (1,000 miles per hour) at the equator. Because tides are an extreme         example of a shallow-water wave, friction with the ocean floor slows         tides to a speed of about 700 kilometers per hour (435 miles per hour).         Continents further restrict tide movement. The tidal waves cannot keep         up
A tidal bore is an uncommon phenomenon created when the force of             tidewater pushes water upstream in a shallow estuary having specific             dimensions and a large tidal range. The standing wave that is             created generally ranges from a half meter to 3 meters in height,             and tends to be largest at spring tide. The small half-meter bore             shown here is moving the Petitcodiac River from the Bay of Fundy,             between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada.
with the rotation speed of Earth and they break up into a number of         smaller tidal cells.
There are about twelve cells worldwide with five in the Pacific Ocean.         In the middle of each cell is a node located near the center of an ocean         basin, termed an amphidromic point, a no-tide point in the ocean around         which the tidal crests and troughs rotate through each tidal cycle.         Owing to the shape and location of landmasses surrounding the ocean         basins, the tidal crests and troughs cancel each at these points.
The tidal wave crests sweep around each amphidromic point, like spokes         on a bicycle wheel. Because a large volume of water moves with the tidal         wave, it is easily influenced by the Coriolis effect. The tidal waves         move counterclockwise around the amphidromic points in the Northern         Hemisphere and clockwise around amphidromic points in the Southern         Hemisphere. The farther from the amphidromic point, the higher the tide         level becomes. The farthest point away from the central node is the         antinode, where maximum vertical movement between crest and trough is         found.
Tides in Bays and Estuaries.
As the tides rise along the coastline, they enter the bays, harbors, and estuaries and travel inland as far as elevation will allow. This point is termed         the head of tidewater. The time of high tide becomes progressively         delayed the farther inland it must travel. As tides enter coastal         waters, they are affected by reflection just as waves are. In certain         circumstances, constructive interference can result in tides with         extreme highs and lows.
A classic example of constructive interference is the Bay of Fundy in         Nova Scotia, Canada. The bay opens into the Atlantic Ocean and extends         inland in two narrow arms for 258 kilometers (160 miles), curving to the         north. Due to its length, the time it requires for the tide to reach the         head of tidewater is nearly equal to that of the tidal period. This         forces a buildup of tidal water in the northern end of the bay.
Coupled with the extra energy of the Coriolis effect (the bay bends to         the right), during maximum spring tides, the Bay of Fundy receives the         highest           tidal range in the world at 17 meters (56 feet). This type of         constructive interference can also occur as tides flow into an estuary         against an outflowing current. Standing waves, termed tidal bores, will         form and progress upstream at heights of several feet.
Because of the effects of friction, as the tidal wave approaches shallow         water, a reversing current forms where the water flows with force, in         and out of restrictive passages. Reversing current is of concern to         navigators due to their high velocities, reaching 44 kilometers (28         miles) per hour between the coastal islands of British Columbia.
Tide Prediction and Tide Tables
In the uniform tidal system (semi and diurnal), the greatest height to         which the tide rises on any day is known as high water and the lowest         point is low water. In a mixed system, it refers to higher high and         lower high water and higher low and lower low waters. Tidal observations         made over a period of time are used to calculate the average or mean         tide levels.
Because the depth of coastal waters is important for navigation, an         average low-water reference is established. Water depths are measured         from this level and recorded on navigational charts. The low water         reference point is usually established at the mean low-water level, and         a zero reference or tidal datum is established at this point. In mixed         tidal areas, mean low water is used as the tidal datum. Sometimes, the         low-tide level may fall below the mean value used as the tidal datum,         producing a minus tide.
Tidal predictions are based on recorded high measurement from past         records, and then are used to predict the future. But because of all the         complex combination of possibilities, it is difficult to predict         Earth's tides from knowledge of physical processes and the         historical record. Yet with a combination of actual local measurements         with known astronomical data, scientists can derive very accurate tide         predictions.
Tide gage recording stations are installed at numerous coastal sites,         which track the rise and fall of ocean waters. * A minimum of 19 years of records is needed to allow for the long         18.6-year period of declination of the Moon. Tide tables are published         annually by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and give         the dates, times, phases of the Moon, and ocean and water levels for         high and low tide at numerous locations along the coast and inland on         some bays and estuaries to the head of tidewater.
