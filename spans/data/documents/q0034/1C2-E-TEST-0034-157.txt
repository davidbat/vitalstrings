PITTSBURGH —
Russell Crowe’s latest movie, which was filmed in Pittsburgh, is set to open in theaters on Nov. 19.
“The Next Three Days” also stars and Olivia Wilde, Elizabeth Banks and Liam Neeson and was shot in numerous areas around the city.
“We are in an 8 mile radius of the city,” production supervisor John Fedynech said while filming.
Most scenes in the movie take place in Pittsburgh.  One that was shot at the Luna Café will appear as a New York City scene, crews said.
The movie crew also shot at a local hospital, the Allegheny County Jail and on the highways.
In the first official photo released from the film, you can see Crowe and Banks running across Ross Street downtown.  Movie extras, many dressed in Steelers gear, can be seen in the background.

“Our director wrote the script around Pittsburgh.  We’re highlighting a lot of the town.  A lot of the other movies may be coming to Pittsburgh just to be here.  We’re really taking advantage of what the city has to offer,” Fedynech said.
The movie is about a married couple's life being turned upside down when the wife is accused of a murder.
The thriller, directed by Paul Haggis, took about 52 days to shoot.
