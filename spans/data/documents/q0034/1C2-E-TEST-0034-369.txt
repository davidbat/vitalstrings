Shown in real time and is real funny.  (My one - liners are getting worse aren't they?)

In this episode; the awesome foursome are sitting through the horrendous show called "Fighting 'round the world" that has Russel Crowe fighting various cultures in different countries to see the trailer for the new Terrence and Phillip movie. But when the boys are repeatedly kicked out of the places that have TV's it looks like Cartman, Stan, Kyle and ButtersÂ are going to miss the historic event. As the plot for this episode is so flimsy it can barely stand; watching the boys move from TV to TV is really the best part of the episode. They go from Stan's house to Kyle's house to Chef's house to the Bar then the retirement home and an alley filled with "crack addicts". I won't reveal the final destination and revelation but it's hilarious.
The key problem of the episode is the Russel Crowe Show is featured far too heavily with brain - dead content of Russel Crowe fighting random people and Trey Parker's dreadful Australian accent, it's painful. And although the joke was that it was bad was meant to be funny they take it too far. Plus the trailer that they've so keenly wanted to see makes the 20 minutes of suspense and desperation seem in vain, perhaps not for the boys but certainly for the audience. The episode looks very nice; the killer TV deserves special mention though and this episode features many different sets which is especially cool since this episode is shown in real time. The audio fares slightly worse; Trey Parker is the key voice actor here, Matt Stone remains pretty tight - lipped and you get sick of the voices that we've been hearing for 10 straight years and don't get any better.
All in all this is a great South Park episode that's made better with its fast pace and build - up but because of the incredibly poor Russel Crowe shtick, it gets an 8.moreless
DO YOU AGREE?
