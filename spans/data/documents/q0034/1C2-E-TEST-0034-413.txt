Australian actor (and sometime rocker ) Russell Crowe talked briefly with the Sydney Morning Herald last week about a project he is working on based on the life of the late comedian Bill Hicks.
Crowe, who is currently on break after filming for Ridley Scott's  Nottingham , which was postponed until March '09, has not confirmed that he is set to star as Hicks in the biopic but is rumored to be considering taking on the role. If the Aussie does portray Hicks, he will be at least 10 years older than the comedian was at the time of his death in 1994. The actor did tell the paper that the film is still in the very early stages and is "going from treatment to draft stage with Kiwi writer Mark Staufer."
Hicks' official website confirms that a script is in development for a production company owned by Crowe but will not comment on cast or director until the script is done and the project is "formally set up." The site also points out that the biopic is in no way related to the documentary American: The Bill Hicks Story, slated for a television or DVD premiere in the fall of 2009.
