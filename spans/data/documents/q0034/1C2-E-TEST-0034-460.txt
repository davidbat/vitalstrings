Collider reports that the 10th annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City will open with Cameron Crowe’s documentary of the collaboration between Elton John and Leon Russell, The Union, which will be followed by a live performance by John.
Crowe is no stranger to the music scene, having written and directed one of Paste’s Top 50 Movies of the Decade in Almost Famous.
With The Union, he’ll take an intimate look at the collaboration between John and Russell, which was produced by T-Bone Burnett, including all of the writing and recording process. The film festival’s press release also mentions that “John’s lifelong lyricist Bernie Taupin, icons Neil Young and Brian Wilson, legendary R&B organist Booker T. Jones, steel guitarist Robert Randolph and a 10-piece gospel choir are featured on the album.”
The Tribeca Film Festival takes place April 20-May 1 in New York City. Its “feature film slate” will be announced on March 7 and 14.
