This contest is like answering the question, 'Which of your children do you like the best?'
Surprised at some of the pics especially the absence of Proof of Life and the Insider.  BUT, Russell's, The Sum of Us (1994) and Romper Stomper (1992) should have been offered (if they weren't cause they were Australian films and not shown in the USA)..run, don't walk to get a copy and watch the young lad at his best.
Yes, Gladiator deserved to be #1 with A Beautiful Mind a close #2.  cheers
