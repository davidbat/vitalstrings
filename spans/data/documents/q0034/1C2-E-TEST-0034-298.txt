Darren Aronofsky's Noah Will Flood Theaters inÂ 2014
This just in: Paramount and New Regency will release Darren Aronofsky's Biblical tale Noah on March 28, 2014. No filming date has been announced just yet, but that gives the Black Swan helmer just about two years to get Russell Crowe in gear as the eponymous wino/boat-builder; Aronofsky will direct from a script credited to himself, Ari Handel, and John Logan. The date puts Noah opening right before Captain America 2, which means... superhero season will start even earlier  in '14, kinda. I know, I know: But when will we see a big-screen adaptation of Fightin' Around the World ? [ Deadline ]
