Disclaimer:                    This site is maintained by me, an admirer of Russell Crowe's                    work. I have no affiliation with Russell Crowe or any of his                    employees. All materials and information on this site collected                    from existing websites (titles listed on links page), various                    publications and/or  visitor submissions.  The pictures                    have been released to press and into cyberspace by the producers                    and publicists of the films they come from. None of them are                    mine, even if I messed with them (I can assure you the originals                    are better) and the only creative claim I can make is for the                    background, the montages,
the animations and the buttons, though                    those are of course cobbled together from other people's stuff                    at some point or another, so they aren't mine per seeither.   (Is the internet what John Lennon was talking about when                    he said "imagine there's no possessions"?)  I                    hope you enjoy your visit.
