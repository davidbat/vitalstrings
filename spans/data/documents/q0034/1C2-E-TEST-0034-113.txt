Russell Crowe has joked he had a “nightmare” that he was appearing in a movie alongside Vinnie Jones.
The actor is known for appearing in big-budget blockbusters such as Robin Hood, as well as in thought-provoking dramas like A Beautiful Mind. Vinnie tends to play hardmen, and is best known for being in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
Russell seems to have been thinking about his favourite actors of late, having posted various messages about other people in his profession on Twitter. One of them included a jokey reference to Vinnie, with Russell quick to poke fun at himself too.
“Had a dream last night that I was in a movie with Vinnie Jones...figure he has probably had the same nightmare (sic),” he wrote.
Robert Downey Jr., Daniel Day-Lewis, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were some of the other stars to get a mention – thought to be people Russell would love to work with.
Moviemaking wasn’t the only thing on the star’s mind last night. He began reminiscing about some of his previous parts, and seemed to be particularly proud of appearing in a theatre production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show which toured New Zealand.
“Technically, it was fish nets and a garter belt, not pantyhose...415 performances in Rocky Horror Show, my porn days (sic),” he laughed.
