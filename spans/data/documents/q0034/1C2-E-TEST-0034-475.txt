Dinosaurs will be the bad guys, that's why they weren't on the ark. Neeson will be providing the voice of their leader, Stegron the Dinosaur Man.

do you know why there are flood myths all over the earth? thatp's because there are catastrophic floods happeneing everywhere. and considering that all major civilizations were created near or by the banks of big rivers, then it's all just inevitable.
The myths of flood from the cultures the fertille crescent are fromthe same sumerian source. But all the other takes of floods are independent. All most certainly based on soe real event in a distant pass whose tale was passed down and became the food of myths, as it wont to be.
There's nothing particulary magical about it at all.

i sant corrected. i did mixed the stories of Noah and Lot. The daughters of Lot, for some reason, believed that the end of the world had come and fucked daddy to perpectuate the race. Noah just got pissed drunk and made an ass of himself.

It's not improbable,and it's very plausible that there moight be some historicalç validity in the myth of the flood, in that some notorious flood might had happenedin the earlier days of the sumerian civilization that nearly destroyed it. The myth can be based on one of more floods.
Sumer was based on what later was called Mesopotamia by the greeks.  The Land Between Rivers, those rivers were the Euphrades and the Tigris.   Unlike the River Nile, this rivers were notorious for their unpredictability and their flash floodings. Starting with the sumerians, all the civilizations in Mesopotamia had to build a network of cannals to control the flooding flow as well to irrigate the land. So, a distant memory of a flood or floods became a moral story.
It's useless to try to find some histortical background for the take of Noah's ark because most certainly noah story, which is directly taken from the story of Utnapishtim, must be an expanded folklore tale thay got expanded into becoming a morality tale and thus incorporated into tradition. Tradition which found it's way to the religious books, not just of the hebrews but of even more ancient people like the akadians and even the sumerians themselves.
The bible itself, or rather, the Torah, is a collection of at least 3 different traditions, from 3 different sources. Different traditions which got to be compiled into one text, sometimes by compromise, since some of those traditions are contradictory. This is why the Torah has two different accounts of Genesis, with conflicting details. Also of note is how in parts of the Torah there's tories with talking animals, like the snake at the garden of eden, which is a notorious exception to the rest of the text.

Also about the flood, of course the myth relates to a localized event that happened in a distant past in the area of old sumer.

it's only people of today that take to heart the notion that a flood that submerged the world to mean the whoe planet. But that's a mistake of using modern assuptions in a very old text. Back then in old times, the concept of world was not the same as today. what a people mean by the world was, literally, their world. A sumerian saying that a flood sunk the world means it sunk HIS COUNTRY, his region, his home place.
What ancient people called the world had a far more limited range then we today give to the meaning of the word.
This is always the danger of taking such an old text like the bible and take it's meanings literally. The bible, due to it's antiquity, and the fact it's the product of ancient people from a different time from a much different cultue then ours today, all that's writen in it has to be taken into the proper historical context. or else it will be fated to be misinterpreted. specially if taken the text literally.
