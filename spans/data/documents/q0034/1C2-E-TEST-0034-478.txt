3 big screen versions of Robin Hood in 20 yrs? Doesn't anyone have an original idea anymore.

I saw "Letters to Juliet" on Saturday night. Sweet movie with no real surprises. Wait for the DVD. Great to see Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero work together again (Guinevere and Lancelot in "Camelot").

"Ironman" appeals to a wider audience so it is now surprise it did better. They are two entirely different types of movies. Both need to be seen on the big screen to get the full impact of the films.

Don't really understand the Crowe accent controversy as I didn't hear him speak with an Irish accent in the movie as has been claimed.  Some of the dialogue was difficult to understand due to background noise.

I saw "Robin Hood" on Friday night and it is a decent movie.  It is obviously a prequel. Crowe did a great job as did the rest of the cast. I want to see it again as I found it hard to follow at times.
