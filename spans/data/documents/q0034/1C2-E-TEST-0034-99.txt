Russell Crowe Films         List
"Marina,       your eloquent words have expressed the feelings of many Russell Crowe       fans.  Much of your insight truly touches the core of who we think       Russell Crowe is.  It would be presumptuous of me to truly know what       Russell Crowe thinks of life, work, etc. since I do not know him       personally, however, through the movies and roles he has carefully chosen,       and the stories he tells in his music, lead me to believe what you have       written is true.  Thank you." -         Gail Silberberg, Millburn, New Jersey, silberberg@comcast.net .
