Celebrities are all up in God's business these days.
First, Gwyneth Paltrow wondered if the bible truly preached intolerance against homosexuals .
Now, Russell Crowe is speaking up for the Big Guy Himself and asking about circumcision: What the heck, people?!?
“Circumcision is barbaric and stupid," the Oscar winner Tweeted yesterday. "Who are you to correct nature? Is it real that GOD requires a donation of foreskin? Babies are perfect. I will always stand for the perfection of babies, i will always believe in God, not man’s interpretation of what God requires."
And if you disagree with Crowe? If you dare take a scalpel to your child's private part?
"Unfollow and f-ck off," the actor wrote. "I’ll take attentive parenting over barbarism."
At least he's a man who stands up for his convictions, we guess. What do you think? Circumcision is...
Against God's plan!
