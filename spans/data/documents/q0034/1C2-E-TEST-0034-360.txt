Russell Crowe stayed in character on the set of a new "Robin Hood" movie when a crew member's car went up in flames - and he gave her $8,000.
Denise Yarde, a boom mike operator on the London set, was on the way to work when her car caught fire.
She called her boss to say she would be late and when she arrive, Crowe made a joke at her expense, The Mirror reports.
Yarde said to Crowe: "Well, I suppose it's okay for you Russell. You've probably never had to worry about finding five grand for a new car."
Crowe felt bad and later have the young woman 5,000 pounds -- equivalent to $8,000 -- in cash.
"There you go," Crowe told her. "You can buy a $10,000 car now."
Yarde gave the actor a hug, then went out to buy a 2007 Saab.
Oscar-winner Crowe is starring in the new Robin Hood flick directed by Ridley Scott and co-starring Cate Blanchett. It will be released next summer.
