Russell Crowe is already eyeing a sequel to his upcoming 'Robin Hood' blockbuster - insisting he and director Ridley Scott would happily produce a follow-up if the film is a hit.
The Oscar-winner has spent years trying to get his adaptation of the legendary folklore tale off the ground, after problems with the original script halted work on the movie for a year.
The female lead was also re-cast - Cate Blanchett was drafted in after moviemaker Scott and Crowe, who also produced the film, freed Sienna Miller from her contract.
But despite the difficulties, Crowe is convinced he would love to return to the story - but only if film fans enjoy it.
He tells Britain's Daily Mirror, "We don't have a script ready or anything like that. If people like this one and the studio has an appetite for it, would Ridley and I like to go on a film set of that size again and make another movie like this, in a day and age when everything's done with computer-generated images and comic book characters? Yeah, we'll be fine with that. Great."
