Last week, we got our first look at Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in Tom Hooper‘s adaptation of the musical Les Miserables.  Now we have the first image of Russell Crowe as Valjean’s relentless pursuer, Police Inspector Javert.  Crowe certainly cuts a fine figure as the character, and I’m eager to see how he’ll play the character, and particularly how he’ll perform “Javert’s Soliloquy”.
Hit the jump to check out the full image.  The film also stars Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter.  Les Miserables opens December 14th.

Here’s the official synopsis for Les Miserables:
Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, Les Misérables tells an enthralling story of broken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice and redemption–a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit. Jackman plays ex-prisoner Jean Valjean, hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman Javert (Crowe) after he breaks parole. When Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine’s (Hathaway) young daughter, Cosette, their lives change forever.
