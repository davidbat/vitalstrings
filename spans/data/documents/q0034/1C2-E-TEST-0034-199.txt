Watch The Next Three Days Description
Man was this fun! Russell Crowe plays John Brennan, an ordinary school teacher whose life is turned upside down when his wife is falsely accused, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder that she did not commit.
Russell Crowe is fantastic as the husband who goes from disbelief to fear to despair to outrage as his wife goes through the criminal court system after being wrongly accused of murder. When the process is over and his wife begins serving her life sentance, he has two choices … move on with his and his son’s life or break her the hell out of prison. He decides to spring her. And he doesn’t care who gets hurt.
We watch as Brennan, who supposedly had no previous knowledge of prison escape, slowly plans, selects and assembles everything he needs for the escape plot. Now the movie shows this process very cleverly in that we see all the individual parts, but we are kept in the dark as to how they will all fit together when the actual escape is executed.
When the long escape is finally executed, all the parts come together and the audience is blown away by the plan … or at least I and the people I was with were blown away. The escape actually makes sense. The only downside is that a major part of the plan is that everything must work flawlessly, which I don’t think would really happen in real life.
No matter, this movie is smart and very entertaining.
