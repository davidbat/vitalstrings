JUNE 6--In a move straight out of the Naomi Campbell playbook , actor Russell Crowe was arrested early this morning for allegedly assaulting a New York City hotel employee with a telephone. The Academy Award-winning actor, 41, was hit with a felony assault count and a misdemeanor weapons possession rap, according to the below Criminal Court complaint. It is unclear why Crowe allegedly struck the Mercer Hotel concierge in the face with the phone during the 4 AM incident (the blow left the victim with minor lacerations, cops said). Crowe spent the rest of the morning in police custody before being released (without bail) after his arraignment early this afternoon. The actor, who stars as pugilist James J. Braddock in his new film 'Cinderella Man,' faces up to seven years in jail if convicted of the phone fracas. (1 page)
