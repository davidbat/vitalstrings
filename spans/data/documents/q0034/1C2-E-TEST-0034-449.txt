Breathless - Russell Crowe Slideshow
Jan 22, 2008 11:36 PM
Russell Crowe is an awesome, talented actor! I wanted to make a slideshow of Russell to one of his songs. I used Pinnacle Studio Plus 10 for a change instead of Windows Movie Maker. I am unhappy with Pinnacle and I DO NOT recommend it. As you can tell, when the picture changes, the quality goes bad.
