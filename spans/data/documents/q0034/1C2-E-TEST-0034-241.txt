We have Superman , Superman's girlfriend , Superman's adoptive parents , and one of Superman's greatest enemies all lined up for Zack Snyder's upcoming " Man Of Steel " reboot movie. Now we have his Kryptonian dad, too.
Variety reports that Russell Crowe is in negotiations to play Jor-El, the biological father of Superman, in the upcoming relaunch of the Warner Brothers film franchise. While the studio has yet to confirm the casting, the report indicates that an A-list actress is also being sought to play Lara, Superman's biological mother.
If the report proves true and Crowe takes on the role, he'll have big shoes to fill.
Jor-El was famously played by award-winning thespian Marlon Brando in 1978's "Superman," and more recently by veteran actor Julian Sands in the long-running "Smallville" television series .
If all goes as reported, Crowe will join a cast that includes Henry Cavill as Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and Michael Shannon as Zod. "The Dark Knight" director Christopher Nolan is one of several producers on the film, and one of the chief shepherds for the character's upcoming reboot.
"Man Of Steel" is scheduled to hit theaters in 2012.
