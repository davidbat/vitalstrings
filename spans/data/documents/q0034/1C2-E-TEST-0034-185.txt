The latest issue of Empire magazine includes an interview with our beloved phone throwing actor Russell Crowe. In the interview he talks a little about Robin Hood, which he will start filming in April. Turns out he wants to make the best Robin Hood movie ever.
“The challenge is to make a great film. There’s no point in making the second-best Robin Hood movie. If we are going to do it, we have to do it with the thought in mind that we’ve got the chance of making the best Robin Hood movie ever. Doing a Robin Hood movie is a childhood dream; doing a bad Robin Hood movie – that doesn’t come into the dream. It’s got to be fully realised and really worth the effort – as we sit and talk it’s been 18 months of effort, and that’s the sort of stuff that people don’t see or quantify.
With Ridley Scott directing and an impressive cast including Cate Blanchett and Mark Strong, we may end up getting the best Robin Hood movie ever. However according to Wikipedia there have been over 50 adaptations since 1908 , so it’ll have to be good.
