Crowe in "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World."
Actor Russell Crowe was arraigned Monday afternoon in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of second-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon for allegedly throwing a hotel telephone that struck a hotel employee in the face.
According to the criminal complaint accompanying the charges, Crowe admitted to the arresting police officer that he picked up the phone and threw it at the Mercer Hotel concierge "because he was angry," the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.
NYPD Sgt. Michael Wysokowski earlier told CNN that Crowe "was upset because he couldn't get a call out to Australia."

Police said the victim was transported to St. Vincent's Hospital. Crowe was booked into the First Precinct and later escorted out, wearing handcuffs and sunglasses, for his arraignment.
His next court appearance was set for September 14, the D.A.'s office said.
"This arose because he was trying to get his wife on the phone in Australia. He was in his room. He couldn't get a line and there was a disagreement," Crowe's lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, told reporters earlier outside the police precinct where Crowe was booked, according to The Associated Press.
Universal Studios -- which released Crowe's latest film, "Cinderella Man" -- said it had "no comment" on the incident.
CNN has been unable, so far, to reach the actor's publicist, Robin Baum.
Crowe was in New York promoting "Cinderella Man," a biopic based on the life of world heavyweight champ James J. Braddock, which opened in theaters last weekend.
According to Nielsen the movie ranked fourth place in theaters and grossed $18.6 million.
Crowe won an Oscar for Best Actor in 2001 for his movie "Gladiator."
