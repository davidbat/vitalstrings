Just don't get too miserable, Russell.  We don't want any phone's being thrown around set!
Russell Crowe recently tweeted the above pic of himself as Javert on the set of Tom Hooper's Les Miserables.
And he is looking ruggedly, miserably, handsome!
The star-studded cast who all have to sing LIVE during each take, includes Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, Sacha Baron Cohen as Thernardier, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thenardier.
We want to hear the people singing, NOW!! Oh, this film will be just as epic - if not more - than the stage version!!
