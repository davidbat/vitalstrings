About Russell Crowe (1964 - )
Russell Ira Crowe was born on April                            7, 1964 in Wellington, New Zealand. Russell Crowe                            has made his home in Australia since he was a small                            child. Russell Crowe got an early start in acting                            as a child, when he became a star of an Austrailian                            TV Show. Crowe was first noticed in America because                            of two Australian films: "Romper Stomper" and "The Sum Of Us." Sharon Stone was                            instrumental in getting Russell Crowe in his first                            American movie, " The Quick and the Dead," which in turn opened up more doors for Crowe. "L.A.                            Confidential" made him a star with the film                            going public, delighting his old fans and making                            a lot of new fans.
Russell Crowe's next huge hit was                            in 1999, "The Insider," for which he received                            an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, in his portrayal                            of Mr. Wigand, a tobacco executive-turned-whistle                            blower, a character that is the heart of the film.
The year after receiving his Oscar                            for "Gladiator," he was nominated again                            for his wonderful performance in "A Beautiful                            Mind," which he unfortunately didn't win, but                            truly deserved it.
