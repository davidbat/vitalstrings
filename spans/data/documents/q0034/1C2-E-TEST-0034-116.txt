Gladiator was what kicked everything off with these two.  The oscar winning movie which starred Russell Crowe as a General turned Slave turned Gladiator, showed that these two really know how to work together.  After that, they took another shot at success with a film called “A Good Year”.  This was in a totally different direction than “Gladiator” and suffered as a result.  It wasn’t that the acting or direction was poor, it just wasn’t a story people were interesting in seeing.
The latest movie the two have worked together on is another smash success.  Teamed up with Denzel Washington, “American Gangster” has been a huge hit for the two.  Everything body loves gangster movies, and these two together with Denzel Washington thrown into the mix can only make a movie better.
On the heels of “American Gangster”, Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott have two more movies lined up for 2008 and 2009.  In 2008, “Body of Lies” will be released with Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio starring on screen.  The story centers on a former journalist injured in the Iraq War that is hired by the CIA to track down an Al Qaeada leader in Jordan.
In 2009, “Nottingham” will be released.  This is obviously a retelling of the legendary story of “Robin Hood”.   A love triangle forms between the legendary do-gooder Robin Hood, his Maid Marion and the archer’s arch nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham.  I’ve been waiting for another Robin Hood movie, I just had a feeling it was on the way.
