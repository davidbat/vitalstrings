Late last year, the “Museum of Interesting Things” opened at the Nymboida Coaching Station Inn in Australia. Russell Crowe has donated original movie props and costumes from many of his films for display at the museum.  Aaron of HeroProp.com was kind enough to provide photos and videos from his recent visit to share with readers of the Original Prop Blog.
Props and costumes on display include pieces from Gladiator, Master and Commander, American Gangster, 3:10 to Yuma, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, Romper Stomper, L.A. Confidential, and more.  Aaron also mentioned that a representative for the museum indicated that there is an additional shipping container of memorabilia, which includes an original chariot from Gladiator.
A mainstream media report was published by MSN/AOL earlier this month with details about the museum (clicking portal below will open new window and player – does not embed):
