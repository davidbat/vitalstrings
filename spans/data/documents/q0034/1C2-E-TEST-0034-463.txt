Russell Crowe: Ryan Gosling Oscar Snub Is 'Bull----'
Ryan Gosling suits up in Gucci at the opening ceremony of the Hua Hin International Film Festival on Friday (January 27) at the InterContinental Resort in Hua Hin, Thailand.
The 31-year-old actor hit the red carpet with his Drive director, Nicolas Winding Refn , who arrived with wife Liv Corfixen, and Thai actress Krystal Vee.
“Ryan Gosling didn’t get an Academy nomination? There’s some bullshit right there,” Russell Crowe recently tweeted .
“Albert Brooks you were excellent in Drive. Excellent,” he wrote in another tweet.
Albert took to his own Twitter page to joke about the Oscar snub, writing, “I got ROBBED. I don’t mean the Oscars, I mean literally. My pants and shoes have been stolen.”
