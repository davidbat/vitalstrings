[ edit ] Production
In January 2007, Universal Studios and Brian Grazer 's Imagine Entertainment acquired a spec script written by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, creators of the TV series Sleeper Cell . Their script portrayed a more sympathetic Sheriff of Nottingham and less virtuous Robin Hood , who becomes involved in a love triangle with Lady Marion . The writers received a seven-figure deal for the purchase. Actor Russell Crowe was cast into the role of the Robin Hood with a salary of $20 million against 20% of the gross. [13] The following April, director Ridley Scott was hired to helm Nottingham. [14] He had attempted to get rights for himself and 20th Century Fox , but had collaborated with Grazer on American Gangster and signed on as director rather than producer. [15] Scott was not a fan of previous film versions of Robin Hood, saying "the best, frankly, was Mel Brooks 's Men in Tights , because Cary Elwes was quite a comic". [16]
Scott's dissatisfaction with the script led him to delay filming, and during 2008 it was rewritten into a story about Robin Hood becoming an outlaw, with the position of sheriff as part of the story. Scott dropped the latter notion and Nottingham was retitled to reflect the more traditional angle.
In June, screenwriter Brian Helgeland was hired to rewrite the script by Reiff and Voris. [17] Producer Marc Shmuger explained Scott had a different interpretation of the story from "the script, [which] had the sheriff of Nottingham as a CSI -style forensics investigator". [15] Scott elaborated the script, portraying the Sheriff of Nottingham as being Richard the Lionheart 's right-hand man, who returns to England to serve Prince John after Richard's assassination. Though Scott felt John "was actually pretty smart, he got a bad rap because he introduced taxation so he's the bad guy in this", and the Sheriff would have been torn between the "two wrongs" of a corrupt king and an outlaw inciting anarchy. [18] Locations were sought in North East England including Alnwick Castle , Bamburgh Castle , and Kielder Forest . A portion of filming was intended to take place in Northumberland . As a result of the WGA strike , production was put on hold. [19] Scott sought to begin production in 2008 for a release in 2009. [20]
Filming was scheduled to begin in August in Sherwood Forest if the 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike did not take place, [21] for release on November 26, 2009. By July, filming was delayed, [22] and playwright Paul Webb was hired to rewrite the script. [15] The film was moved to 2010. [23] The Sheriff of Nottingham's character was then merged with Robin. [24] Scott explained Robin "has to retire to the forest to resume his name Robin. So he was momentarily the Sheriff of Nottingham." [25] Hedgeland returned to rewrite, adding an opening where Robin witnesses the Sheriff dying in battle, and takes over his identity. [26] Scott chose to begin filming in February 2009 in forests around London, having discovered many trees which had not been pollarded . [16] Scott was also pleased that the 200-acre (0.81 km2) Nottinghamshire set that was built during 2008 had aged into the landscape. [27] By February 2009, Scott revealed Nottingham had become his version of Robin Hood, as he had become dissatisfied with the idea of Robin starting as the Sheriff. [28]

[ edit ] Critical reception
Reception for the film has been mixed. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 43% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 215 reviews with an average rating of 5.4/10. [37] Among Rotten Tomatoes' "Top Critics", which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, the film holds an average approval rating of 44%, based on a sample of 32 reviews. [38] Another review aggregator, Metacritic , gave the film 53% based on a normalized rating of 40 reviews. [39]
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 stars out of 4, writing that "little by little, title by title, innocence and joy is being drained out of the movies." [40] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, writing that "the problem with Russell Crowe's new take on the legend is that it has one muddy boot in history and the other in fantasy. The middling result is far from a bull's-eye." [41]
David Roark of Relevant Magazine accused Scott of replacing depth with detail and manipulative themes, like vengeance and unjust war, and stated that Scott had sucked the life out of a cherished fable, writing that "Scott has turned a myth, a concept essentially, into a history which emerges as dry, insensible clutter." [42]
Russell Crowe received criticism from the British media for his variable accent during the film. Empire said his accent was occasionally Scottish, [43] while Total Film thought there were also times when it sounded Irish. [44] Mark Lawson , while interviewing Crowe on BBC Radio 4 , suggested there were hints of Irish in his accent, which angered Crowe who described this as "bollocks". [45] [46] [47]
Some reviewers mentioned historical liberties taken in the film. [48] [49] In the film, King Philip Augustus of France is shown as keen to invade England, and actually attempts it. Historically, Philip had been trying to gain territories owned by the Plantagenets in continental Europe (today in France) in a series of conflicts with Richard the Lionheart , and by 1198 Philip was on the defensive and the two kings had agreed to mediation. [50] After Richard's death, Philip conquered Normandy and other independent territories in France , that were included in the Anglo-Norman kingdom, with John launching an invasion of France (under pressure from the Anglo-Norman barons) instead of vice versa. [51] It was only after the English defeat at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, that the future Louis VIII of France landed on England with an army in 1216, entered London, and was proclaimed king at the cathedral , during the First Barons' War . The film shows John negotiating a "bill of rights" immediately after becoming king, but refusing to sign it. However, the Magna Carta was in fact signed 16 years after John became king, following the civil war and significant loss of face over his reign. The less well-known supplement to the Magna Carta, the Charter of the Forest , was signed two years later, by John's son Henry III of England . The historical perpective is wrong and printed with anachronistic 20th century nationalism , for instance : the beginning of the movie shows Richard, who is supposed to be "English" attacking the castle of Châlus , that is supposed to be in "French" hands. In fact, Richard only wanted to display his strength to a rebellious vassal, who did not accept any authority. It was something widespread and typical for the feudal system in the Middle Ages. Richard′s men originated mainly from his continental lands and not from Great-Britain. Compared to the Limousin people, he was together with his army the more "French" of both.
The script is filled with implausible details : the scene depicting a meeting between Eleonor of Aquitaine, John Lackland and the French princess is surrealist. In the movie, both Eleonor of Aquitaine and king John are talking in English, whereas the princess is speaking French. In fact, Eleonor did not speak English and king John probably very bad. Both of them would have spoken Langue d'oïl to the princess. The everyday language between Eleonor and her sons was probably more the Limousin language. In the movie, Richard dies a few minutes after he was wounded, even though he died of blood poisoning 15 days later. When Richard died in 1199, Eleonor was not in London, but at Fontevraud Abbey , where she was later buried. Among other implausible details, we can notice barbutes (sort of 14th-15th century helmet) and Sallets (sort of 15th century helmet).
[ edit ] Box office
On its opening week the film took £5,750,332 in the UK ahead of Iron Man 2 and $36,063,385 in the US, [52] and grossed a total of £15,381,416 in the UK, $104,516,000 in the US and $321,669,741 worldwide. [53] The box office figures were seen as somewhat of a disappointment though films set in medieval times tend to fare poorly and Robin Hood actually ranks as the second highest-grossing medieval movie.
