Russell Crowe Favorites
My name is Gladiator ! Must-suggest.  Must-have.  Must-watch over and over.
Two westerns made a decade apart.  One a serious and classy re-make, 3:10 to Yuma and one a camp classic, The Quick and the Dead .
An acting tour de force in a movie where the story doesn't quite live up to the skills of the talented cast but the Academy gave it a Best Picture Oscar - we'll let you be the judge of A Beautiful Mind .
A fun sports movie that is lighter than most Russell Crowe fare ... Mystery, Alaska .
The one where everybody seemed to take notice of Russell Crowe's acting prowess ... L.A. Confidential .
