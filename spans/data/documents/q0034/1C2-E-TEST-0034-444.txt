Russell Crowe Knitting Wallpaper
Barbara Breiter
Knitters have their own urban legends and one of them is that Russell Crowe is a knitter. Clearly, if you look at the photos, he's not knitting at all. Still, the myth persisted and it was widely reported in many mainstream media outlets that he indeed knits.
The wallpaper I created from publicity photos and my questioning this legend appeared in People magazine and they cleared up the question by contacting his publicist who verified that Russell does not knit.
