Great Big Sea , London , England , Canada
Great Big Sea singer Alan Doyle has been added to the cast of the Russell Crowe/Ridley Scott movie, playing Troubadour Allan A'Dayle.
The movie, which is untitled as of yet, is a Robin Hood adventure film set during the time of Richard the Lionheart. Local actor Gordon Pinsent is also set to star in the film, as a character called Sir Walter.
"I wanted Friar Tuck, but I guess I didn't put on enough weight," Pinsent told The Telegram with a laugh in December.
The movie, which will be filmed in London, England, was supposed to have started production last fall, but was postponed until the spring due to a looming strike of the Screen Actors' Guild.
"I am so excited to work with Russell and Ridley and all the cast and crew. This is certain to be the ride of a lifetime. Hang on," Doyle said in a media statement.
Crowe is a longtime supporter of Great Big Sea, having written the song "Company of Fools" for their latest album, "Fortune's Favour." Doyle produced and co-wrote several songs on Crowe's album, "My Hand, My Heart," and has played a number of shows with his band, The Ordinary Fear of God.
Great Big Sea will be touring Canada this month, stopping at Mile One Centre March 14.
