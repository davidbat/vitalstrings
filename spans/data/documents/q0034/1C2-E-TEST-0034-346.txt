American Gangster - Denzel Washington And Russell Crowe In Ridley Scott's American Gangster Movie
American Gangster, directed by Ridley Scott,                      , starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe
A drug lord smuggles heroin into Harlem during the                      1970s by hiding the stash inside the coffins of American soldiers                      returning from Vietnam. Formerly titled "Tru", American                      Gangster is a biopic of Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas.                      Lucas grew up in rural, segregated North Carolina where he                      watched as his cousin was shot by the Klan for looking at                      a white girl. In the early 1970s he became the biggest heroin                      dealer in Harlem with a smuggling scheme that imported heroin                      out of Southeast Asia in the caskets of dead Vietnam soldiers.                      He soon made upwards of one million dollars a day in drug                      sales. American Gangster centers on narcotics lawman Richie                      Roberts' struggle to bring down Lucas, whose flamboyant style                      earned him the street name "Superfly", and catching                      the crooked cops and drug dealers who profited from Lucas's                      scheme.
