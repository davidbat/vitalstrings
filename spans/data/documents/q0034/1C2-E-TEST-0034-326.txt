Russell Crowe Needs To Scarf Down Another Vegemite Sandwich And Calm The Fuck Down

Russell Crowe.  Do you remember when he was all hot and box office magic?  Me neither, but I guess he was at some point.  Apparently, he is in the land of the lost and thinks he’s still relevant in Hollywood.  I could try to blame his assholeishness on the carbs, but I think Russell Crowe was always a phone-flinging bitch.
In pre-production of his new movie, Nottingham, he’s been demanding rewrites, a new director and now his costar Sienna Miller has been “released”.  The media is playing it like Miller quit this movie but, please.  The producers realized that there was no way in hell people were going to buy the vision of Sienna Miller screwing fat, flabby Robin Hood/Sheriff of Nottingham; Yes, he’s playing both roles.  Casting directors are now in search of an actress in her late thirties or early forties to replace Sienna.  Have they considered Kathy Najimy?  Because that’s Russell’s league right now.
Rumors are floating around that, during the holidays, Crowe was calling around trying to find a replacement for director Ridley Scott.  The studio is denying that, natch. 
And this is just pre-production, folks.  Filming is going to be an absolute nightmare.
As an aside, can I tell you what I love so much?  A spell-check that doesn’t question me on the use of the word “assholeishness”.
