Posted March 21st, 2012 by Binh Ngo
Deadline has been reporting that Russell Crowe is circling Darren Aronofsky's bibilical epic Noah, now they've learned that the deal is done . Russell Crowe is set to play the title character, with the movie scheduled for a July shoot.
While no other cast members were announced, we can expect those roles to be filled soon. Look for them to pop up in the coming weeks. Aronofsky was reportedly interested in having Liam Neeson in the movie so don't be surprised to see him in a pivotal role.
In the story of Noah, for those who are not familiar, God will flood the world to punish the wicked, and he instructs Noah to build a huge ship to save himself and his family, as well as two of each animal.
According to a second hand account by Hollwood Elsewhere's Jeffery Wells , the movie is going to feature a villain of sorts -- someone who will doubt Noah's warning of the impending flood and ridicules his efforts to build the ark.
The budget for Noah was not revealed, but from the sound of things, it's not going to be under $100 million.
Russell Crowe is currently filming the musical Les Miserables with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway and the soonest you can catch him in theaters is December 14, 2012 when Les Miserables is released in theaters.
