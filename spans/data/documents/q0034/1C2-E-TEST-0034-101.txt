Russell Crowe
Ever since he agreed to oversee the franchise reboot of Superman, Christopher Nolan had been seeking a star for the role of Jor-El, Superman's biological father.
Nolan now has his man: Russell Crowe.
Crowe is in negotiations for the key role in "Man of Steel," which has Zack Snyder on board to direct for Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures. Brit thesp Henry Cavill is set to play Superman. Warner Bros. declined to comment on the talks with Crowe.
Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Michael Shannon are already set for the pic. David Goyer penned the script and developed the story with Nolan, who has kept plot details under wraps, as usual.
Charles Roven will produce along with Emma Thomas, Nolan and Deborah Snyder. Thomas Tull and Lloyd Phillips will exec produce for Legendary.
With production set to start next month, Jor-El was one of the last roles to cast, though they also are looking for a name to play Superman's biological mother.
Marlon Brando played the part of Jor-El in Richard Donner's 1978 rendition of "Superman." Other thesps who were pursued for the "Man of Steel" role included Sean Penn and Clive Owen.
Crowe is currently filming "The Man With the Iron Fists" for Universal.
He is repped by WME.
