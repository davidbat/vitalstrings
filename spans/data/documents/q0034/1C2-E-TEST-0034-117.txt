Russell Crowe let some details slip on the highly-protected plot from the big Superman reboot, " Man of Steel ," last night on Twitter, and even answered a fan question. The big news? Jor-El is getting his hands bloody!
"15km bike ride,umpteen hours fighting Michael Shannon . He's very hard to put down," Crowe wrote early this morning on his Twitter feed.
If we're to believe Crowe, this means a much more active role than we've seen from his character, Supes' dad Jor-El, than ever before on film. In previous versions, Jor-El has been relegated to scenes in the prologue before the destruction of Krypton and ghostly visions of a floating, bloated Marlon Brando head. An epic fight scene with Shannon's General Zod, the main villain of the film, would be a major upgrade for the Superdad.
One fan was quick to ask about the tweet, posting "so you [get] to whip General Zods ass?!?! How cool is that !?"
Crowe was quick to clarify that he didn't know who was going to wind up the victor. "Hard to tell who wins, we are still fighting tomorrow," Crowe wrote.
The most surprising part about the impending Crowe-Shannon showdown? When we spoke with Shannon while he was promoting "Take Shelter," he said that he didn't even know that Crowe was in the movie!
"Russell who? Oh, Russell Crowe's in the movie?" he said when asked whether he'd share any scenes with the Aussie actor. "I didn't know that."
Shannon most likely knows now.
Are you pumped to see a more rough and tumble Jor-El? Let us know what you think in the comments below and on Twitter !
