When nobody has heard of the lead actor in your multi-million dollar blockbuster, you better make sure there are a few big names in supporting roles. Realising this, Zack Snyder has followed the example set by Richard Donner’s  1978 ‘Superman’ and cast a superstar to play the role of Jor-El (Superman’s biological father) in his upcoming ‘Superman: Man of Steel’. In Donner’s film it was screen icon Marlon Brando; this time round it’s none other than Aussie thesp Russell Crowe. Snyder will be hoping that Crowe can bring the same level of gravitas to the role that Brando did. Equally he will be hoping that Henry Cavill will be as successful in his portrayal of Superman as Christopher Reeve was.
Also recently revealed was the news that Crowe will be joined by his Gladiator co-star Connie Nielsen and Harry Lennix, best known for his role as Commander Lock in Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions.  Lennix’s role is as of yet unknown but Nielsen is set to play Superman’s mother Lara.
So the cast is certainly shaping up well. Don’t forget we’ve already got Kevin Costner and Diane Lane cast as Jonathan and Martha Kent. It is rumoured that at some point during the film a bloody, slow-motion battle will break out between Superman’s biological and adoptive parents- a battle with only one survivor…
Just kidding. Fanboys scare easy.
