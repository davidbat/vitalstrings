Details on the Man with the Iron Fists
by kmiller
The RZA has been working on a project known as the Man with the Iron Fists. He wrote the script along with Eli Roth, who is serving as a producer of the film along with Quentin Tarentino. The RZA will be playing the lead role, but has a plethora of supporting members including Gordon Liu, Leung Kar-yen, Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Daniel Wu, Celina Jade, and Rick Yune (just to name a few.)
The choreography for the film will be done by Corey Yuen, while Marrese Crump and Ian Powers will be providing the doubling work in the film. It seems like the RZA has all the cards in his hand, but I can’t help but feel a little worried about the film. Of course, that’s probably more of a personal thing than anything else.
Those of you that have been around me know that I don’t like the RZA, but I’m also aware that there are fans of his work. I can’t say that I’m excited for the project, but I’m eager to see if I’m proven wrong. I have no problem with admitting being wrong if the trailer blows me away, and I haven’t seen any images or footage from the film. While having a strong cast and choreographer is a great start, it all depends on the vision of the team and where they go.
I’ll keep you guys posted on any new info I find.
