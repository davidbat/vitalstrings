 
Russell Crowe in as Javert
Tom Hooper is lining up quite a cast for the upcoming movie version of Les Miserables the musical.  We’ve now got confirmation that Russell Crowe is officially “in” for the film.  With Hugh Jackman in as Valjean, the role Crowe is slated to take is presumably that of Javert.
Russell Crowe has some singing experience and tours with an Australian rock band.  Still–rock standards aren’t exactly the stuff of broadway.  The question of the day: can the man sing broadway?  Is he up to Javert’s Suicide?
From The Guardian: Russell Crowe is to star in a musical for the first time after being cast in the big-screen adaptation of Les Misérables. Variety magazine reports that Crowe beat several other contenders to play Inspector Javert, opposite as Jean Valjean, in the film version of the musical that has been running since 1985….
According to Variety, Crowe’s experience as guitarist and singer with Australian rock band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts was a key factor in his being given the role.
