Oscar winner Russell Crowe flew to England this week to share his wisdom about acting with a thrilled group of students at Durham University.
The 'Robin Hood' star, 47, was all smiles while posing for photos with his new protegees. Crowe told the BBC , "We did a little vocal warm up, then I took them outside to do an exercise in leadership and using the space around you." He called Durham "gorgeous," adding, "I'll be bringing the wife back."
The actor-turned-educator raved about the students on Twitter after the master class: "Brilliant day at Durham University. Many thanks." Calling the experience "a privilege," he added, "Great group of kids, funny, smart, brave, I really enjoyed myself."
Crowe's visit was facilitated by a longtime friend, U.S. journalist and author Bill Bryson, who has been the school's chancellor since 2005. Fulfilling an old promise to Bryson to visit the campus as a guest mentor, Crowe went public last month with a tweet announcing his plans to teach.
Once he arrived, Crowe taught a class titled 'Leadership and Original Theatre.' The college reportedly lacks a drama department, so a select group of students from the campus theater club were chosen to attend Crowe's lecture. The Aussie star explained his teaching approach to a local radio reporter here .
Bryson said, "It's just unbelievable. It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me at least since my wife married me."
"He has found space in his life to do this, and not just to do it, but to do it so well," added Bryson. "It was an absolute inspiration to the students....He's given them 100% of his attention and all his energy. It was just fantastic."
