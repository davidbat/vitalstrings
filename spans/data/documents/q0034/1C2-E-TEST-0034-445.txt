Just last week, it was revealed that veterans Russell Crowe and Liam Neeson were in fact circling Darren Aronofsky's bibical epic "Noah" as the titular character and a villain, respectively. This was exciting enough, however, Variety writer Jeff Sneider soon tweeted that this wasn't the only big role Crowe was up for and that he may be starring in Jose Padilha's upcoming "RoboCop" reboot. Now, it looks like Crowe himself has taken  to Twitter to respond to the news, single-handedly confirming his potential involvement with "Noah" and, at the same time, denying anything to do with "RoboCop."
In response to a MovieWeb story tweet about Aronofsky "eyeing" him for the project, Crowe replied -- with a little tongue in cheek -- that he's "eyeing him right back...Liam's eyeing both of us...and Paramount are eyeing us all, including you. Whole lot of eyeing." It's not too much, we guess, but it's probably as much as we'll get out of any party without an official announcement. Either way, after a run of supporting roles in "Man Of Steel" and "The Man With The Iron Fists" it looks like Crowe is ready to step back into the limelight and will make a nice addition to his slate of upcoming films that also includes "Les Miserables" and "Broken City."
As for "RoboCop," Crowe doesn't seem too interested in the rumor, simply replying "No" to two seperate questions about his potential involvement. Of course, it may be that one casting process requires a little more discretion than the other, but the openness he displays in replying to the "Noah" story suggests there truly is nothing in this one for now.
