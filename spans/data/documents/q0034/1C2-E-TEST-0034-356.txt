“GIVE ME BACK MY SON(‘S FORESKIN)!”
Apparently Tracy Morgan and Russell Crowe decided to star in a buddy comedy without telling anybody because while Tracy handled the gays, Russell gladiated the Jews this morning by tweeting and simultaneously outing himself as an Anne Geddes fan:
Circumcision is barbaric and stupid. Who are you to correct nature? Is it real that GOD requires a donation of foreskin? Babies are perfect
He later added , “wasn’t intending offense, certainly wasn’t intending to provide fodder for lazy journalists. I can’t appologize [sic] for my heartfelt belief,” which is when I’ll assume his publicist called because the circumcision tweet magically disappeared followed by that apology he said he couldn’t make:
- This is a great forum for communication,I,like any human have my opinions and you all have yours, thank you for trusting me with them
- I have a deep and abiding love for all people of all nationalities, I’m very sorry that I have said things on here that have caused distress
- My personal beliefs aside I realize that some will interpret this debate as me mocking the rituals and traditions of others. I am very sorry
Anyone else disappointed this story didn’t end with Russell Crowe chucking a phone at a rabbi? What happened to that guy? “Anne Geddes says Shalom.” *WHIP-PANG*
