Robbins: Embedded in his play
In the film, Moe meets Larry and Curly in an orphanage, but they have to adapt to the outside world. The one thing that they do adapt to is 'passing gas as a means to blow up balloons'.
Sean Penn  [ Images ] is being considered for Larry's role and Farrelly's childhood buddy Mike Cerone for Curly's role.
If Crowe passes, the Farrellys have admitted having spoken to Benicio del Toro to play Moe. But apparently, he quoted a huge price. Mel Gibson  [ Images ] is another actor being considered for the role.
