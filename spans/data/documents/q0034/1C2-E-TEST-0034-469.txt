It’s pathetic how many people are using Russell Crowe’s name to get some publicity for themselves lately.

Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors and I am shocked that Joan Rivers and the Gaelic Storm would stoop so low as to say this kind of garbage about a fine young man.  I’m so sorry to see all of this press about it.  The band is looking for any kind of publicity and Joan Rivers has proven once again that she has no class and is obviously no lady!  They both should publicly apologize to Mr. Crowe.

It is so plain to see. Those individuals who dig for dirt around Russell Crowe are simply jealous of the fact that he excells in his acting, and some people hate his kind of perfection it makes them mad and the only thing they can do is to hang on to his name and make money from this. Somehow I think it’s all water off a duck’s back to a man of his stature. I’ve read about how he looks at his work with a truly working class attitude; cries when a farm animal or pet dies;and he admits himself that he detests fame. Russell Crowe is an original. Leave him be.
