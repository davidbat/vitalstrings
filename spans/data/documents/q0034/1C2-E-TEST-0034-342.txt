Russell Crowe , Hugh Jackman , Les Misérables
Hugh Jackman‘s Jean Valjean and Russell Crowe‘s Inspector Javert are seen above in the upcoming Les Misérables movie, the big-screen version of Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil‘s highly successful, Tony Award-winning stage musical, itself based on Victor Hugo’s novel. Tom Hooper , Oscar winner for The King’s Speech , directed. [Definitely not a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, as previously stated in this article. See comments below.]
Les Misérables, of course, will arrive covered with a patina of "prestige." In addition to Tony Award winner Jackman (The Boy from Oz), and Oscar winners Crowe (Gladiator) and Hooper, the film’s cast boasts the following: The Dark Knight Rises star and Oscar nominee Anne Hathaway (Rachel Getting Married) as Fantine; two-time Oscar nominee Helena Bonham Carter (The Wings of the Dove, The King’s Speech) as the villainous Madame Thénardier; Mamma Mia !‘s Amanda Seyfried as Cosette; My Week with Marilyn‘s Eddie Redmayne as Marius, The Dictator ‘s Sacha Baron Cohen as Thénardier; and Colm Wilkinson, Jean Valjean in the original West End production, as the Bishop of Digne.
The Les Misérables screenplay is credited to William Nicholson, whose previous work includes Michael Apted’s Nell, Richard Attenborough ’s Shadowlands, and Ridley Scott ’s Best Picture Oscar winner Gladiator. Among Les Misérables‘ producers are Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Senna). Cinematography by the Oscar-nominated Danny Cohen (The King’s Speech). Production design by two-time Oscar nominee Eve Stewart (The King’s Speech, Topsy-Turvy). Costume design by The Skin I Live In / Bad Education ‘s Paco Delgado.
Les Misérables opens December 14. Also in the musical’s cast: Samantha Barks, Aaron Tveit, Ella Hunt, George Blagden, Bertie Carvel, Daniel Huttlestone, and Isabelle Allen.
