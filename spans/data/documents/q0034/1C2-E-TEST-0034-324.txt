Wow, did not see this casting coming! Russell Crowe playing Superman's dad in a Zack Snyder-directed reboot of Superman? Awesome! Variety is reporting that Oscar winning actor Russell Crowe has been set to play Jor-El, Superman's biological father from Krypton. Though other talented actors like Viggo Mortensen and Sean Penn have been vying for the role (Variety says "Christopher Nolan had all along been seeking an A-list thesp for Jor-El"), it was Crowe who finally agreed to it in the end. That must mean this role is very important to the story, which is great to hear, especially because this is a strong cast Snyder pulled together.
Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is already set to star Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Kevin Costner & Diane Lane as Clark's Earth parents, Jonathan & Martha Kent, and finally Michael Shannon as the Kryptonian villain Zod. I'm looking forward to seeing Crowe play an important fatherly role like this, but it'll be hard for him to live up to Marlon Brando's Jor-El. Production is set to begin next month. This announcement is perfectly timed, as DC Comics is about to launch Green Lantern in theaters this week. Crowe was last seen in Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days last year and Ridley Scott's Robin Hood before that. I'm already looking forward to this new Superman purely based on the cast alone!
