Plot for Body of Lies
The movie is coming out on oct. 10. It has been a long time since Dicaprio's last movie. I can't wait to watch it.
Leonardo DiCaprio is Roger Ferris
Russell Crowe is Ed Hoffman
Here is a summary of the movie:
A CIA operative attempts to uncover a major terrorist operation in Jordan, but he doesn't know which of his allies he can fully trust.
