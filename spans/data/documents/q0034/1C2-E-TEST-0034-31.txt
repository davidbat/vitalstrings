Russell Crowe has had a hard time lately. His last four films -- 'Body of Lies.' 'State of Play,' 'Robin Hood' and 'The Next Three Days' -- have all been inauspicious, though 'Robin Hood' pulled in big boxoffice (no thanks to Crowe's acting). That may be remedied by his next projects, which include his role as Jor-el in 'Man of Steel' and the just announced co-starring gig opposite Mark Wahlberg in the thriller 'Broken City.'
According to Deadline, Wahlberg plays an ex-cop-turned-private detective hired by the mayor (Crowe) of a big city to see if his wife is cheating on him. The private eye confirms those suspicions, and when the mayor's wife's cheating partner ends up dead, the private eye immerses himself in the mayor's business and uncovers a real estate scandal and a lot of big city corruption.
Allen Hughes ('Menace II Society,' 'The Book of Eli') will direct the independent film which is budgeted for $60 million and is being bankrolled by Emmett/Furla Films. That company is investing heavily in features lately, injecting cash into the Rob Cohen-directed Tyler Perry-starrer 'I, Alex Cross,' the Nicolas Cage and John Cusack fact-based Alaskan murder mystery 'The Frozen Ground,' the Stephen Fears-directed 'Lay the Favorite,' starring Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rebecca Hall and Vince Vaughn, and several other projects.
'Broken City' begins production in November.
