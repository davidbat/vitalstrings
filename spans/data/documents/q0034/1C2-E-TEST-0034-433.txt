John Nash: 1994 Nobel        Prize in Economic Sciences Acceptance Address
 
Nash:        Thank you. I've always believed in numbers and the equations and logics        that lead to reason.
But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask,
"What        truly is logic?"
"Who decides reason?"
My quest has taken me through the        physical, the metaphysical, the delusional -- and back.
And I have made        the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of        my life: It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or        reasons can be found.
I'm only here tonight because of you [wife,        Alicia].
You are the reason I am.
You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
