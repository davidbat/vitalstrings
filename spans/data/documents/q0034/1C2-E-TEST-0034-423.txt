Russell Crowe to be 'baddest man alive' in RZA movie
He’s battled "Gladiators," shot arrows at the Sheriff of Nottingham and now, thanks to RZA, Russell Crowe will become a kung fu master.
In an interview with E! News , RZA opened up about his forthcoming movie, “The Man With the Iron Fist,” which features Crowe. RZA said that he will co-star and direct the Universal-released feature, which boasts a $20 million budget.
As for the details of the plot and Crowe’s character in particular, the Wu-Tang frontman is keeping a tight lip.
“I won’t spoil it for you, but Russell’s gonna be the baddest man alive,” RZA told E!'s Marc Malkin. “That man is in fighting shape. That man will knock you out.”
Development for “The Man With the Iron Fist” started almost five years ago when RZA sat down with Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth ("Hostel") to discuss the story. Roth is now signed on as a co-writer and co-producer.
Shooting kicks off in December on location in Shanghai. Though RZA and Crowe worked together in 2007’s “American Gangster” (even recording a song that didn’t make the soundtrack), the legendary hip-hop musician admits he’s got jitters on directing a Hollywood giant.
“It’s nerve-wracking,” RZA said. “He’s a master of the craft. I’m quite sure that I may learn something from him.”
