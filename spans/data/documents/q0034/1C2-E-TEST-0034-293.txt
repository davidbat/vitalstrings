How Meg Ryan Trapped Russell Crowe
With her marriage to DENNIS QUAID falling apart, MEG RYAN deliberately set out to ensnare RUSSELL CROWE with a series of romantic ploys - including staging a phoney nervous breakdown.
According to American tabloid THE GLOBE, the WHEN HARRY MET SALLY beauty trapped the hunky GLADIATOR star into falling in love with her by staging emotional scenes over her crumbling marriage to Quaid for his benefit.
"Russell never knew what hit him," insists one pal. "Meg scoped him out, set her sights on him and never let up until she got him." The friends adds Ryan courted Crowe with a barrage of special gifts and actually had the script reworked for him. And after he finally agreed, she set out to lock him up as her lover. "She wanted him for that movie and she wanted him badly," says the friend. "It was love at first sight for Meg - but Russell needed some coaxing, and Meg was more than happy to oblige."
According to set sources, Crowe was having an affair with a young girl who was working on set as an extra, but Ryan quickly got her out of the picture, banning her from the set without his knowledge and leaving the field open. (LE/TG/NFA)
