All material on these pages was taken from a variety of print and broadcast media, not to mention countless hours of watching the man in action over the years! We are just fans, and have no personal contact with Russell or any of his friends, neighbors, old girlfriends, band mates or farm animals (and if we did we wouldn't tell you anyway!). We get no money from this whatsoever, although if you want to send us your life savings, we won't stop you. It's not our intention to do anything that could land us in jail or cause anyone to dislike us. However, if you are an important person or company and you see something here that might make you want to sue us, just let us know and we'll remove it immediately. We like Russell a lot, but hey we aren't willing to go to jail for him! Similarly, to the best of our knowledge, everything in these pages is true. But if you spot any errors, please let us know. We hate to look like idiots. We are also open to suggestions, comments (and of course, praise) for this site, as well as any news on Russell, his co-stars, band mates or farm animals that you'd like to share.
