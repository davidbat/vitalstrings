Robocop (2013)
Flying Brian Banana Hammock February 3, 2012 8
Robocop is the story of a Detroit police officer who is gunned down on duty, but through Frankenstein-esque witchcraft, is brought back to life as half-machine, half-man, and all awesome. But he still has to live and work in Detroit, so really.. it’s not that awesome in all reality.
Robocop (2013)
In the new Robobcop Movie, the plot remains the same. Officer Murphy was hunting down drug dealing criminals when he was killed in action, but Murphy’s, much like O’donnel’s, but nothing like McCready’s, don’t stay dead.  Through the OCP corporation, he is brought back as a cyborg officer of the law.  The new version will no doubt not be as great as the first, which is like the Citizen Kane of cyborg related, Detroit set films.
Rumour has it, Russell Crowe is being begged to play the role of Murphy, but we doubt Crowe will take this role. Our guess is Channing Tatum could get the lead role. Did we mention Detroit sucks?
Trailer
I know it’s the trailer for the original, but this is the greatest movie ever.
The Robocop Remake
Director Darren Aronofsky, know for trippy films like The Fountain, but also the more recent and far more reality based film The Wrestler, is taking his time with Robocop.  The tentative release date for the film, which does not currently have an approved script or any casting news, is 2013.  His style could work beautifully for Robocop.  The original was brilliant social observation, especially when Robocop shot that one dude in the nuts between the rape victim’s legs.
