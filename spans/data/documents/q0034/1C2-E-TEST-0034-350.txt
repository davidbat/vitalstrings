Russell Crowe as Maximus in Gladiator.
Amazing sets, incredible special effects, big names even in the small parts, and beautifully choreographed, over the top fight scenes. What else could it be but the start of the Summer Movie Season! And this is definitely a Summer Movie.
Gladiator is a movie that while watching, you can enjoy; for a while. The action moves fast enough, the visuals are amazing, and Russell Crowe, as the brooding General, does command your attention. As an action movie, it succeeds, sort of.
The problem with this movie though, is that for all of its grandeur, that is all that is; an action movie, and not a very good one. Between the fight scenes it attempts to have a plot, but it's pretty standard -- and considering the subject matter -- very tame stuff.
The plot, what there is of one, merely consists of Russell Crowe seeking revenge for the death of his wife and son. Wow, that's never been done before. The person who he is seeking revenge against is (shock, gasp!) the Emperor of Rome.
Now as a gladiator, imprisoned in chains, you wouldn't think he would have much chance of ever getting his revenge, but wait this is Hollywood. The Emperor, with all of the power of Rome behind him, will enter the Gladiator Ring and face his mortal enemy in combat. An Emperor whose bravest act up until this point in the film is to smother his aged, diseased father.
Of course he does try to rig the fight in his favor, but why get in the ring in the first place? Does he somehow fail to realize that Russell Crowe's only goal is to see him dead? Wasn't he watching the movie?
