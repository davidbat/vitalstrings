ABOUT ME
Russell Crowe was born the son of movie location caterers.  He got into acting as a teenager on the Australian TV soap opera Neighbours (1987).  He then served time in Australian movies such as Prisoners of the Sun (1990) and Spotswood (1992) until a blazing performance as a neo-Nazi skinhead in Romper Stomper (1992) brought him to international attention.
After a shaky U.S. start as Sharon Stone 's cowboy love interest in the Western The Quick and the Dead (1995), and a computer-generated serial killer in Virtuosity (1995), Crowe landed a lead role in L.A. Confidential (1997) as a violent but gallant cop.  His remarkable streak of varied high-profile performances continued with the buttoned-down, middle-aged whistleblower Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand in The Insider (1999); the vengeance-seeking Maximus in Gladiator (2000), which won him an Oscar for Best Actor; the schizophrenic mathematics genius John Nash in A Beautiful Mind (2001); seafaring Captain Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003); and a down-at-heel boxer Jim Braddock in Cinderella Man (2005).
Although he sometimes takes easy acting options, especially in his Oscar-winning Gladiator turn and A Beautiful Mind, he remains capable of exceptionally fine work.  L.A. Confidential and The Insider stand as his best screen work to date.  A tendency to get into offscreen brawls has led to him having a wild-man image, but this has not so far detracted from his growing stardom.  He plays guitar and sings in a rock band, a nod to an early desire to make a career as a rock singer.  He has made his home in Australia, where he married his longtime girlfriend, Australian singer and actress, Danielle Spencer, and the couple have two children.
