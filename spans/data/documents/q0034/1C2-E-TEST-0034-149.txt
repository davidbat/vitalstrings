Proof of Life
How does someone choose among the very best?  Can any other A-lister come up with such a list.....don't think so.  Does anyone think that Training Day can compete with A Beautiful Mind?  By the way, Virtuosity didn't make the list.  Have you seen The Sum of Us?  If not, find it and you will be in for a treat.  See what mean....Russell Crowe is one of the top actors.  cheers
