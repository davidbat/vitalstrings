STATE OF PLAY
Movie Plot:
Handsome, unflappable U.S. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is the future of his political party: an honorable appointee who serves as the chairman of a committee overseeing defense spending. All eyes are upon the rising star to be his partys contender for the upcoming presidential race. Until his research assistant/mistress is brutally murdered and buried secrets come tumbling out.
McCaffrey (Russel Crowe), has the dubious fortune of both an old friendship with Collins and a ruthless editor, Cameron (Helen Mirren), who has assigned him to investigate. As he and partner Della (Rachel McAdams) try to uncover the killers identity, McCaffrey steps into a cover-up that threatens to shake the nations power structures. And in a town of spin-doctors and wealthy politicos, he will discover one truth: when billions are at stake, no ones integrity, love or life is ever safe.
