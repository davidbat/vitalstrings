Born in New Zealand, Russell Crowe Russell Crowe is dead but the reason of his death is not known as yet.
Now will u believe that? I think no one will believe this news surfing the internet as now we have become accustomed to the hoax internet news and pranks. Few days back, Tom Cruise was reported as dead in Russell Crowe’s place of birth i.e. in New Zealand and the cause of the death was a suicide. However, in the case of Russell Crowe, the cause is unknown.
So it can be no more than hoax news. I personally checked Russell Crowe’s webpage and his twitter, there was no such news as is circulating now.
Russell Crowe is an incredibly talented actor. He won Academy Award for best actor in 2001 for his movie “Gladiator” and for his movie “A Beautiful Mind” Russell Crowe won the Bafta Best Actor Award.
Currently Russell Crowe can be seen in his latest movie “Robin hood” in which once more Russell Crowe manifested his talent.
