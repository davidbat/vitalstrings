So it seems tough guys do dance.
Russell Crowe has signed on to join the big-screen adaptation of the musical Les Miserables, playing the heartless police inspector Javert, who persecutes Hugh Jackman’s impoverished Jean Valjean after the man steals bread to feed his family, Universal and Working Title confirmed today. 
Tom Hooper, Oscar-winning director of The King’s Speech, will helm the film, which is aiming for release Dec. 7, 2012. William Nicholson (Gladiator, Shadowlands) has adapted the screenplay from the long-running play based on Victor Hugo’s sprawling 1862 novel.
Sir Cameron MacKintosh, who produced the stage version of the musical, is also producing the film, and praised the two lead actors for taking on roles that are not just challenges to act, but also sing: “Not only were they born to play these roles vocally, but they thrillingly inhabit this great score.”
