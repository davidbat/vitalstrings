How Russell Crowe's Getting Back Into "Super" Shape
You can't play the Man of Steel's father with a soft body!
Russell Crowe's been getting back into shape after piling on the pounds for the 2008 film "Body of Lies." His next role is as Jor-El, the father of Kal-El (Superman) in the "Man of Steel" reboot. We don't blame him -- if we had to work out next to the shirtless perfection that is Henry Cavill, we'd be insecure too!
The photo on the above left is from June, and the one on the right is from last week. The Aussie actor has been tweeting his fitness regime and results. Setting and stating goals is a valuable motivator, fitness experts explain. Russell's routine: walking, biking, and hitting the weights.
"Yesterday 1 hr walk 1 hr gym, today pitiful bike ride but it is a very  special day and i've got other things I need to do. go hard tomorrow," Tuesday's entry read.
"41 km bike ride , all hills, I'm shattered but off to the gym, it'll be short and sharp," read a tweet from last week.
So far so good; Russell has lost 16 pounds so far and on track to lose more. Way to get your new year's resolution going early mate!
