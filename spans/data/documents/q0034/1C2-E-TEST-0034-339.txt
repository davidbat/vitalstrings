There have been reports about director Darren Aronofsky trying to get a movie about the biblical tale of Noah off the ground for a while now. At one point he even had Christian Bale interested in taking on the title role of the boat building messenger of God, but his schedule didn’t allow for that to ever happen. The movie itself looks like it’s ready to get off the ground though, only instead of Batman as Noah, Aronofsky is going to have to settle for a gladiator. Deadline Daberath reports that the deals are done, and this movie is ready to set sail with Russell Crowe as its star.
This will be the first film Aronofsky has directed since his seriously well received movie about killer ballerinas (or at least that’s what Billy Crystal told me), Black Swan. When talking about his interest in this project, Aronofsky said, ”Since I was a kid, I have been moved and inspired by the story of Noah and his family’s journey. The imaginations of countless generations have sparked to this epic story of faith. It’s my hope that I can present a window into Noah’s passion and perseverance for the silver screen.”
Reportedly, Aronofsky sees this as epic in scope and wants to spend somewhere around $130m on it. It’s going to be the first project stemming from Arnon Milchan’s new vision for New Regency, which entails a return to making edgy movies like L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Fight Club. That all sounds pretty promising, but let’s be honest here… they had us at Aronofsky.
