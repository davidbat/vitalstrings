Nash: ( A Beautiful Mind ):
"If we all go for the blonde and block each other, not a single one of us is going to get her. So then we go for her friends, but they will all give us the cold shoulder because no on likes to be second choice. But what if none of us goes for the blonde? We won't get in each other's way and we won't insult the other girls. It's the only way to win. It's the only way we all get laid."
Maximus Decimus Meridius ( Gladiator ):
"At my signal, unleash hell."
Maximus Decimus Meridius ( Gladiator ):
"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."
Jeffrey Wigand ( The Insider ):
"I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!"
