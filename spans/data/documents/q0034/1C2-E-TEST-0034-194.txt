ok quizmaster, you know that spotswood and blood oath are the australian names for the movies, right? I had to look them up, and they are not listed on his imdb. blood oath is listed as prisoners of the sun, and spotswood is listed as  the efficiency report. please fix this.

Funny - I got the data from IMDB.  They must have changed their tune since the quiz was originally released.  In any case, I updated the quiz. Thanks!
