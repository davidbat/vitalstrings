"Robin Hood" star Russell Crowe feels pretty comfortable swinging a sword or shooting an arrow -- but singing with Beyonc√©?
Crowe sat down with "Extra's" Terri Seymour to talk about his new medieval actioner -- and the rumor he might be starring in a remake of "A Star Is Born" with the R&B singer.
"I think she's pulled out," Crowe said. "But I'm still chatting about it. It's one of those movies that has been made a lot, but I think it's still quite a big focus. You can see that in terms of the popularity of things like 'American Idol'."
Oh, does he watch "American Idol"? "I have been known to spend many an hour watching "American Idol," Crowe confesses. "It's a compelling piece of TV."
