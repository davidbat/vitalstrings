Russell Crowe will hunt down Hugh Jackman in 'Les Miserables.'
As previously speculated , Russell Crowe is now confirmed to play Javert opposite Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in the big-screen adaptation of Les Miserables, according to Deadline.com. The film, directed by Tom Hooper, has set a release date of December 7, 2012.
"Even though I have dreamt about making the film of Les Miserables for over 25 years, I could never have imagined that we would end up with the dream director Tom Hooper, and the dream cast of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe as the two great protagonists Jean Valjean and Javert," Cameron Mackintosh, who produced the original stage version and will oversee the film, said. "Not only were they born to play these roles vocally, but they thrillingly inhabit this great score. I canâ€™t wait to hear the people sing at my local cineplex."
Crowe received an Oscar for A Beautiful Mind and has earned additional nominations for The Insider and Gladiator. His many other film credits include State of Play, American Gangster, 3:10 to Yuma, Cinderella Man, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World and L.A. Confidential. He also performs with the band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts.
Anne Hathaway, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter are also rumored to be interested in the film, but no further casting has been confirmed. Tony winner Jackman is expected to return to Broadway this fall.
