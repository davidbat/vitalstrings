RUSSELL CROWE BIOGRAPHY
Russell Ira Crowe was born April 7, 1964, in Wellington, New Zealand, to parents Jocelyn and Alex Crowe. Young Russell was raised in Sydney, Australia after his family relocated down-under when he was four years old. 
Since his parents were set caterers and his father was a hotel manager, the Crowe family led a rather nomadic life, the reason for which Crowe only lived in his first actual house at the age of fourteen. Acquiring a taste for acting when he served as a child extra while accompanying his parents to work, the high school dropout was more passionate about performing as a musician rather than an actor.
While he had several acting credits under his belt, 16-year-old Crowe dubbed himself Russ Le Roc -- of the rock group Roman Antix, that is -- and performed in order to supplement his income. Working as a bartender, waiter and bingo-number caller wasn't enough to pay the bills, so playing music served as an additional source of income.
