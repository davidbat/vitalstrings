Russell Crowe
The actor will join Hugh Jackman and Helena Bonham Carter in Universal and Working Title's musical adaptation, to be directed by Tom Hooper.
Russell Crowe is in negotiations to star opposite Hugh Jackman in Les Miserables, Universal and Working Title's big-screen musical adaptation being directed by Tom Hooper. The two companies have also set a Dec. 7, 2012 release date for the movie.
In addition, Helena Bonham Carter, who starred in Hooper's The King Speech, are also in talks for a key role.
Crowe will play Javert, the uncompassionate police inspector who will stop at nothing to recapture Jean Valjean (Jackman), the man who steals bread to feed his sister and spends the ensuing years in prison (or trying to escape it) while also becoming the guardian of  a young woman named Cosette. The story is set against the backdrop of a 19th century French rebellion.
Carter would play Thenardier's greedy wife.
William Nicholson wrote the script and the movie will use Claude-Michel Schoenberg's score from the beloved musical, which is based on the Victor Hugo book.
WME-repped Crowe is scheduled to shoot Broken City with Mark Wahlberg this fall.
Crowe’s addition to the production was first mentioned on Broadway.com.
