Oh My God! Oh My God! Oh My God! Love love them both! I can not wait to see them both together at the movies. Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe ROCKS!

NO! They should play the opposite roles! Crowe IS Valjean and Jackman would be the best Javert ever. This is SO close to perfect.

I think we are very lucky to have them both…as a ten year veteran of Les Miz, this actually is good news. I just hope they don’t do a Britney or Brandy or Selena type of Eponine..Please. Just hire Lea Michelle!

Helena Bohnam Carter as Madame Thenardier!!! <3
Russell
Nick Jonas did an amazing job on stage as Marius. I think he would be fabulous in the movie!

I’m seeing it on the stage in early February – cannot wait for the movie – and I agree, it seems the casting should be reversed; but, I just hope they don’t mess it up!!
whatever
i have no problem with anne hathaway or russell croew, but hugh jackman as jean valjean?!?!?!? hugh jackman has a great voice but he’s a BARITONE! valjean’s songs should be sung by a tenor. i’ll give this movie the benefit of the doubt, but barely.
whatever
oh, and nick jonas SUCKED as marius!
