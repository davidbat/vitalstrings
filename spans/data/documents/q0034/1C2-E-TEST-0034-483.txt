Val Kilmer as Danny Parker/ Tom Van Allen in ” The Salton Sea”.  His tattoo on his back is one of the best ever seen. (link to picture) http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3657668608/tt0235737

ummm…not sure if this is strictly for movies, but michael scofelds tattoos of his prison escape from the show prison break are seriously bad ass.  also, val kilmer in the salton sea has a HUGE back piece that would honestly replace snake on this list at least.  pretty good, though.

@ Ben and ricky
Wow!  That Kilmer tat from Salton Sea is pretty gnarly.  I definitely would have added it if I had seen that flick.  great call, guys.
@ Buceante
Thanks for reading, but I couldn’t put Vineyard’s Nazi tattoo on here!  I hate Nazis!

i also just remembered johnny 23 from con air.  couldnt find a picture, but if i remember right, it was a sleeve of roses and he would get a new one for every chick he raped.  thats pretty tough in a messed up kind of way!  i also dont see the need to include american history x nazi tattoos either.

Dude?! How could you not include Danny Trejo? Come on! In both Con Air and Desperado, the Annie Oakley (I think) tattoo is one of the best and most memorable in Hollywood!

My goodness, what an omission.  Even worse, Trejo’s tattoo is real.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Jim Carrey in The Number 23 has an awesome tribal thorn vine climbing his back and around to the front.

What, No Leonard Shelby from Memento?
Admittedly, they are home made tattoos, but still, pretty Bad Ass to use your body as a notepad, that really says something, like “Forget about Post-Its, those are for pussies, I’ll tattoo my damn arms…

I definitely considered Shelby, but the tattoos themselves weren’t really bad ass.  I mean, they’re just a bunch of notes/reminders all over his body.
HOW he applied the tats is pretty bad ass, I guess, but I don’t think “John G Raped and Murdered My Wife” is something that screams “tough guy,” ya know?

Hello?! … De Niro in Cape Fear? Why is it so creepy when someone tats a giant cross on themselves. Shouldn’t that kind of negate some of the general badassness of the tattoo? Instead, it has the opposite effect.

I approve b_sinning!
The Number 23, Fingerling (Carrey) Tattoo is pretty hard to beat! Totally Badass!

Nightcrawler in X-Men 2 had all those crazy designs on his skin, though it’s not really specified whether or not they were tattoos or scars.
Clarence & Alabama’s matching tattoos in True Romance, while not inherently badass, were important to the characters’ evolutions into badasses.
Mickey O’Neil’s tats in Snatch were insane.

There is also Father Laurence from Romeo+Juliet, he had the large cross on his back. Having a similar tattoo, though a bit larger, I know the pain.
Any back tattoo is badass by default because that needle is grinding into bone all up your spine and shoulder blades, hurts much worse than arms, chests and legs where you have all that padding.
Great list of them, I always thought the Romper Stomper tat was neat but could never bring myself to get something like that put on forever. I do have some limits.

Hi how about a spoiler warning before the description of Eastern Promises.  A great movie that may have been ruined if you read that post.  Or better yet just leave that detail out of the description, they’re still bad ass.

The Boondock Saints’ “Veritas” and “Aequitas” tattoos on their hands????  One of the most badass things I’ve ever seen.

Hey
Mark Dacascos’ huge dragon tattoo in Crying Freeman, covering amost all of his back and winding around down his chest, arm and down onto his legs, is surely worth a mention?
