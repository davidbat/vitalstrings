Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe is in negotiations to play Jor-El in the new Superman film, “Man of Steel,” according to Variety .
Marlon Brando famously portrayed the doomed scientist father of baby Kal-El in director Richard Donner‘s 1978 big-screen “Superman,” in which Christopher Reeve wore the iconic red cape. Brando also got top billing in the film despite fleeting time on screen.
