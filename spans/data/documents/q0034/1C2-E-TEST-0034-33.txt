Russell Crowe is in the news for a reason other than his belief that circumcision goes against the will of God .
The Oscar-winning actor is in negotiations to play a key role in Zack Snyder's upcoming Superman reboot: Jor-El, the biological father of this caped hero.
Henry Cavill has already signed on to portray Superman, while Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Michael Shannon will also come on board the franchise.
Production on Superman: Man of Steel gets underway next month, as Jor-El is the last major role to be cast. Sean Penn and Clive Owen are also under consideration, insiders say, but it is Crowe's part if he wants it.
Think Crowe is the right fit?
Yes, he's perfect!
