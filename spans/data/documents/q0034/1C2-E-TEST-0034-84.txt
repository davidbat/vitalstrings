Happy Birthday, Russell Crowe!
I know I'm throwing a lot of these birthday posts up lately, but it gives me another chance to feature a specific actor or actress, so I think I'd like to keep doing it. Today, it's Russell Crowe, who's celebrating his 47th birthday. Now, you can have your opinions on Mr. Crowe - he has had a bit of a storied life in the past few years, with all of his legal situations - but you cannot take away the fact that he's a brilliant actor who continues to prove he's one of the best right now. The three time Oscar-nominee (and one-time winner) has definitely made a huge impact on my film-viewing experience, so I've listed my five favorite Crowe roles. I have a feeling a lot of people would agree with this group, but hopefully you'll enjoy this list. Once again, happy birthday, Russell Crowe!
