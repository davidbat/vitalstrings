After a couple decades of speculation, the official film version of Cameron Macintosh's epic musical, Les Misérables, will finally begin filming in February 2012.
Joining previously announced Tony Award winner Hugh Jackman as "Jean Valjean" will be Academy Award winner Russell Crowe as  "Inspector Javert." Not a singer by trade, Crowe has more than proved his acting skills in films such as L.A. Confidential, A Beautitul Mind, and his Oscar-winning performance in Gladiator.
The Les Miz film will begin shooting in Britain in early 2012 with a tentative release date of December 2012. Other acting stars who attempted singing roles in big musicals include Gerard Butler who sang the title role of the Phantom of the Opera. Let's hope Crowe backs off his rock music a bit before tackling Broadway showtunes.
