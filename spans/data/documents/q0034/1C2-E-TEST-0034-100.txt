Man of Steel star Russell Crowe, who plays Jor-El in Zack Snyder's Superman movie, took to his Twitter account last night and posted a couple of interesting tweets about the filming he's doing in Vancouver.
"15km bike ride,umpteen hours fighting Michael Shannon. He's very hard to put down," he said. He was then asked if he will win, and he answered, "Hard to tell who wins, we are still fighting tomorrow."
Shannon plays villain General Zod in the film so it sounds like there is a big fight in the movie between the two, possibly on Krypton? We still have a long wait to find out, as the movie doesn't hit theaters until June 14, 2013.
