Russell Crowe is still in Pittsburgh filming “ The Next Three Days “. Last week, Crowe must have taken a break from filming so he could play Santa Clause for the holidays. He gave the gift of warmth by handing someone  a winter coat right off his back. The homeless fan, known as “Radio Man”, rode his bike all the way from New York just so he could hang out near the movie set. Russell Crowe heard about the guy and generously gifted him a puffy gray down jacket with a fur hood.
