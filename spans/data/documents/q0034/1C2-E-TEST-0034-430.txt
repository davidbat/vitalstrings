From Sue: Lovely memories...
Hellos and hugs to the lovely family of friends who enjoyed TOFOG's first Austin, Texas shows exactly eight years ago today -- August 3, 10, and 17, 2000.  In addition to the unforgettable memories of seeing TOFOG perform live, we made some great and lasting friendships with fans from all over the world (still e-mailing and getting together today for visits -- thank  you, TOFOG!).  These were truly magical moments - beautifully captured and portrayed in the "Texas" dvd.  Just for those (mostly) ladies who spent all that time together with me in long lines and squashed at the front of the stage in Stubb's, the high temperature today in Austin will be a record-breaking 107 degrees F - I know you can all appreciate that (lol)!!  > Thanks so much, Murph, for the great site and all the news, book info, poetry, etc. -- Sue -- Austin, Texas
