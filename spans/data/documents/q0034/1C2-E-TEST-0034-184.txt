10/09/2011 Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe to star in LES MIZ movie!
Working Title's live-action film adaptation of Cameron Mackintosh's hit stage musical LES MISERABLES by Boublil and Schonberg will be directed by Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech) and written by William Nicholson. Universal Pictures are releasing the film worldwide.
The film is produced by Working Title’s Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner with Cameron Mackintosh and Debra Hayward. Liza Chasin is the executive producer.
The stage version of LES MISERABLES holds the record as the longest running musical in the world. To date it has been seen by nearly 60 million people in 42 countries and 21 languages.
Last year, it celebrated its 25th anniversary.
Cameron Mackintosh commented, “Even though I have dreamt about making the film of LES MISERABLES for over 25 years, I could never have imagined that we would end up with the dream director Tom Hooper and the dream cast of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe. Not only were they born to play these roles vocally but they thrillingly inhabit this great score. Producing this film with Eric Fellner, Working Title and Universal Pictures is indeed a dream come true and I can’t wait to hear the people sing at my local cineplex.”
US release date is set for December 7, 2012.
