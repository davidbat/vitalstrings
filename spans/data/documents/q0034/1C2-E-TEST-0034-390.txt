He was born in New Zealand in 1964 and started acting very early on.  Russell Crowe acted as a child in Australian television programs and then moved to film in 1992 with "Romper Stomper".  He became well known throughout the continent and his next film, "The Sum of Us" attracted the American market to him.  Russell Crowe got his break from Sharon Stone, who insisted on having him in the movie "The Quick and the Dead" in 1995.  That opened doors for him in the states and Crowe has not looked back since.  In the       above poster, Russell Crowe stars in "Gladiator", which was       released in 2000.
