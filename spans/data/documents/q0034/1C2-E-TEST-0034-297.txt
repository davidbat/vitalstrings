Robin Hood by Director Ridley Scott
Director Ridley Scott is working on a new movie based on the story of the legendary Robin Hood. Once titled Nottingham, the movie has been retitled to the more marketable 'Robin Hood'. Besides Russell Crowe as Robind Hood the movie is also starring Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion and Mark Strong as Sir Godfrey, King John's henchman. The movie Robin Hood is set to be released in May 2010.
Here below a first look at Russell Crowe as Robin Hood:

Plot:
"In the film, Robin (Russell Crowe) is an archer in Richard the Lionheart's army, and the villains are the French. This version of the character was abandoned as a child and has problems trusting people. After Richard's death, Robin returns to Nottingham, becoming an outlaw and trying to win the heart of the widowed Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett). Producer Marc Schmuger said this is about how Robin Hood became an outlaw and this is how those guys became the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest."
A new film based on Robin Hood's story may not seem that much exciting at first. But with Director Ridley Scott helming the project and teaming up again with Russel Crowe (they worked together on Gladiator), this Robin Hood movie can but arouse my interest: impatient to see Ridley Scott's take on Robin Hood!
