Caption Cannes: The ‘Robin Hood’ Cast Sings
CANNES, France -- Robin Hood and his Merry Men are living up to their reputation at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.
“We busked in the streets,” Russell Crowe, who plays the title role in Ridley Scott’s “Robin Hood,” told Access Hollywood’s Tim Vincent at the French festival. “We went to a restaurant in Antibes and put on a show for the staff and the other patrons in the alleyway outside.”
However, the star said he had more luck taking from the rich on screen than off.
“We didn’t make a single franc,” he said.
Alongside Alan Doyle, Kevin Durand and Scott Grimes — the film’s band of Merry Men — Russell led his co-stars’ demonstration of their singing skills with a rousing rendition for Tim of Sean Kingston’s “Beautiful Girls.”
While Russell may have an extended family in his “Robin Hood” cast mates, he also brought along his actual family to the festival – something, he said, that made his trip to Cannes even better.
“The thing that you yearn for is that simple thing of being able to see your kids and have a cuddle and all that,” he said. “It’s hard traveling with them… but it’s so much better than the other option, which is being apart from each other.”
“Robin Hood” is due in theaters on Friday following its Wednesday night Cannes premiere, kicking off the prestigious film festival.
