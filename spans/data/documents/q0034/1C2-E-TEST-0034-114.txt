Russell Crowe Tweets About “Man of Steel”
October 19, 2011 By Dan Koelsch
Russell Crowe is not afraid to speak his mind (or throw phones), so it should be no surprise that he has started tweeting about his experience filming the upcoming Superman movie Man of Steel. In the film, Crowe plays Superman’s biological father Jor-El, who sends his son Kal-El to Earth to save him from the destruction of Krypton. After the break, read what Crowe had to say lately about the production.
15km bike ride,umpteen hours fighting Michael Shannon. He’s very hard to put down.
@alanthomasdoyle Stay around for the Saturday. That really is the only day I can guarantee you any time . I’m trying to save a planet here.
@HMack3 Hard to tell who wins, we are still fighting tomorrow.
@alanthomasdoyle Alas, I’m no superhero.Just related to one.
There’s been a lot of secrecy surrounding plot details of the film, so we’ll take tidbits wherever we can get them. I’m excited to see Jor-El fight General Zod (played by Michael Shannon), even if they don’t have super powers. This seems to imply that Jor-El has a more substantial role than we’ve seen in past films, which could mean more scenes on Krypton. We’ll have to wait and see exactly how this all goes down, but you can see photos of Crowe on set dressed as Jor-El here . Follow @RussellCrowe to see if we learn anything else!
