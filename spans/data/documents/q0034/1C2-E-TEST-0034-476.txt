After months of rumors, Russell Crowe’s involvement in the film version of the Biblical story of Noah's Ark is now confirmed, with him set to take the title role.
The director Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan), who co-wrote the screenplay, said in a statement, “I rejoice that Russell Crowe will be by my side on this adventure. It's his immense talent that helps me to sleep at night. I look forward to being wowed by him every day."
Aronofsky also thanked Paramount Pictures for helping him “breathe new life” into the classic story. Crowe joins co-stars Saoirse Ranan (The Lovely Bones) and Jennifer Connelly (Blood Diamond), according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The Australian actor next appears in Broken City, a crime thriller costarring Mark Wahlberg and Catherine Zeta-Jones, due in January 2013, and out in June 2003, Man of Steel with Henry Cavill and Amy Adams, by Zack Synder (Sucker Punch).
