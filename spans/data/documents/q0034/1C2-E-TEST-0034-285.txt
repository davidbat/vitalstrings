Hey guys,
Listen, I appreciate the attention you’re giving my movie, but please show a little respect for me as an actor and my resulting creative choices in hair.
As a free-flowing liberal, it made common sense for my character to maintain a free-flowing tumble of handsome hair and/or wig.
I have won more than one Oscar, I think, so please be humble before me.
It’s been a busy night.
Thanks you,
