MOVIE star Russell Crowe is the latest celebrity set to bring a touch of Hollywood to Scotland.
The Kiwi actor is expected to shoot scenes for Ridley Scott’s big budget Robin Hood sequel at DunCarron Fort in Stirlingshire next year.
Crowe is pals with Charlie Allan, who leads the trust building the replica of a medieval fort.
The pair met when the Scot was an extra on the set of Gladiator 13 years ago and have forged a firm friendship, based on their mutual love of motorbikes.
Charlie, 49, said: “I was with Russell in London last week. We’re expecting Robin Hood 2 to film at DunCarron. If Russell Crowe says it’s going to happen, then it’s going to happen.”
The father of five is the subject of a documentary, Charlie’s Army, to be screened on Tuesday on STV.
