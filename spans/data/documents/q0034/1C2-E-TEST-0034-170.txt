Russell Crowe's Voice Is 'Pinging Off The Rafters' In Today's Twitter-Wood
Posted 4/26/12 2:37 pm EST by Fallon Prinzivalli in Twitter-Wood
We're chomping at the bit waiting for the release of " Les Miserables ." It's a story we enjoy and even though we know how it plays out, we're excited to see how the A-List ensemble cast brings their characters to life. In particular, Russell Crowe who plays Officer Javert. Crowe's recently taken to Twitter to write snippets about filming on set. Along with his voice "pinging off the rafters," he also wrote , "I know it's him, he knows I know...when I confront him tonight, I'll be all... 'Valjean...at last..we see each other plain.' #lesmis"
My voice is pinging off the rafters , cool, will probably sing the confrontation 50 times during the course of the day #lesmis

Crowe is of course referring to the scene where Javert confronts Jean Valjean — a wanted thief who repents for his ways and becomes an honorable factory owner. We can't wait to see Crowe go toe to toe against Hugh Jackman's Valjean.
