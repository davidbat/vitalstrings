Russell Crowe is a famous Australian A-list celebrity actor who has starred in some of the biggest Hollywood movies in the last decade. He got his big break into Hollywood in 1995 and has since gone on to be nominated for an Academy Award 3 times for 1 win (won an Oscar for his role in Gladiator). He is well known for his gravelly Australian accent and it surprises many people that Crowe was actually born in New Zealand and his cousins played for the New Zealand national cricket team (Crowe is a big sports fan himself).
