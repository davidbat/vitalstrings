Oscar winner Russell Crowe will play Noah in an upcoming film based on the well-known biblical story.
Paramount and New Regency Pictures agreed to produce the movie, saying it will be a "close adaptation" of Noah's "divine mission" in the Bible.
"Noah" will be directed by Darren Aronofsky, who's been nominated for an Oscar.
"I'd like to thank Paramount and Regency for backing my team's work to breathe new life into the biblical epic," Aronofsky said in a statement. "I rejoice that Russell Crowe will be by my side on this adventure. It's his immense talent that helps me to sleep at night. I look forward to being wowed by him every day."
Aronofsky also co-wrote the screenplay, along with two other writers. One of them is John Logan, who has been nominated for three screenplay Oscars.
"Noah" is set to be released at the end of March in 2014. Filming will start this July.
