#10 Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)
Out of all my favorite Russell Crowe films this one receives the least amount repeat viewings.  It's a marvelously well crafted and cast film, but it's one I usually don't gravitate to much simply because I find it to be somewhat of a chore to sit through if I'm only looking for a fast moving entertaining adventure.  Don't get me wrong it's a great film, but it's probably one of Crowe's more taxing films to watch.
#9 Robin Hood (2010)
Out of all the Robin Hood films I've seen Ridley Scott's vision is definitely the best.  Still I feel the film could have been better and would have loved to of seen that usual gritty action we've learn to expect from Ridley's films.  If a sequel ever gets made I'll definitely be there to see it!
#8 The Quick and the Dead (1995)
The oldest film on the list is Russell in one of my favorite westerns, and his first real breakthrough role into American cinema.  I guess we have Sharon Stone to thank for that, although I'm quite sure Russell would have made it sooner or later without her requesting he be cast.  This is simply a fun film minus all the talking and riding that makes westerns long and boring.  With a cast of great actors, if you can't sit down and enjoy this campy western then there's no hope for you.
