Olivia Wilde joins the Formula 1 racing pic Rush as supermodel Suzy Miller.
The 27 year-old actress stars opposite Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl with the possibility of Russell Crowe joining the flick as legendary actor Richard Burton.
The official synopsis: Set against the 1970′s golden age of Formula 1 racing, “Rush” portrays the fast-paced and exhilarating true story of two of the  greatest rivalries the sport has ever witnessed – that of James Hunt  (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Brühl) and their illustrious Formula 1  racing teams, McLaren and Ferrari. A privileged, charismatic and  handsome English playboy, Hunt could not be more different from his  reserved and methodical opponent, Austrian born Lauda. “Rush” follows  their personal lives both on and off the track and charts their rivalry  from its inception in Formula 3. Here they competed viciously against  each other until Lauda’s business acumen and surgeon like precision  behind the wheel propelled him all the way to Formula 1; eventually  landing him the number one spot at Ferrari. However it was not long  before rambunctious golden boy Hunt fought his way into Formula 1, and  into the hearts of a nation, dramatically seizing the championship from  Lauda and proving to the critics, and more importantly himself, that  there was real substance beneath the stylish exterior.
Wilde’s role as Miller will find her in love with and married to Hunt when she meets his friend, actor Richard Burton. Burton and Miller fall in love and the actor infamously paid Hunt $1 million as a divorce settlement that Miller owed. Crowe has not signed on but is reportedly the actor wanted for the part of Burton.
Directed by Ron Howard with a script from Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen) filming began in early September in the UK and Germany.
