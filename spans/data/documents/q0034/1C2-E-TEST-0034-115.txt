Poland:
With the production based in Poznan, a city located in the Paris-Berlin-Moscow               rail line, the scenes that are to take place in Chechnya were shot               in a secure military area about 30 minutes by car, northeast of               town. The Polish Army gave their full cooperation, including furnishing               Russian tanks and military personnel to play Russian soldiers.               In addition, Poland has had a long and special relationship with               Chechnya, and therefore, Hackford was able to find Chechens to               play the rebels.
The filming of this key scene took nine days, and upon completion,               the cast and crew continued their journey to Ecuador.
Russell on filming in Poland: "It's cold enough to freeze               the nuts off a brown dog on a rusty chain at 50 yards before he               had time to eat his tucker."
Ecuador
With the production based in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, at               2850 meters (9,348 feet) above sea level, all exterior locations               of the fictitious country 'Tecala', was within a one-hour drive.               Climbing up to 14,000 feet, ' Camp Insanity' was near Papallacta               Pass. Traveling in the opposite direction was Las Palmas, an area               in the cloud forests 6,000 feet above sea level that was dubbed               'Hollywood del Sur' (' Hollywood of the South') by the crew. This               is where they created 'Ca ñon Verde', the guerilla camp               where Peter is held. In addition, scenes were shot around San Francisco               Plaza, the center of historic Quito where the oldest church (1534)               in Ecuador is location. The final shot in the movie is of Cotpaxi,               the world's tallest active volcano.
"When Russell Crowe crawls through a dense cloud forest,               there's rain and mud all over him… this is real… it's               not called a rain forest for nothing." —Taylor Hackford.
London
"We were able to use one of the most beautiful and modern               buildings in all of Europe – Lloyd's of London – which               is a spectacular, ultra modern, ultra commercial building. It reeks               of capitalism"—Taylor Hackford.
In addition, the river scene was filmed on the River Thames with               the famous Tower Bridge in the background. Interior sets were built               at Pinewood studios.

Plot Summary:
People take hostages all over the world, wait for contact, make               a demand and then negotiate it. For the family, it's emotional.             For the kidnappers, it's just business.
While constructing a dam in Tecala, a country located in the               Andes, American chief engineer Peter Bowman (DAVID MORSE) is captured               by anti-government forces during a raid on the capital city. When               the rebels learn his identity, they demand $3 million for his safe               return. Peter's Houston-based employer, however, is on the verge               of bankruptcy and has cancelled the kidnapping insurance policy               and they cannot provide the money for his ransom.
Abandoned by the company, Peter's wife, Alice ( MEG RYAN), must               deal with it on her own. She retains the services of professional               hostage negotiator Terry Thorne (RUSSELL CROWE), an Australian-born               SAS veteran who over the past nine years has handled numerous high               profile kidnappings, using every means at his disposal.
After an encouraging start, the negotiations deteriorate into               a lengthy haggling session. During these discussions, Peter is               moved from one remote guerilla camp high in the Andes down to another               camp in the Amazonian jungle, suffering the most hellish physical               and mental hardships. By rediscovering his love for Alice, and               focusing on that positive image, he sustains his will to survive.
Meanwhile, the emotional stress of the kidnapping has taken its               toll on Alice, magnifying the uneasiness that existed in their               marriage before the abduction. Further complicating matters is               Alice's guilty realization of a growing fondness for Terry, her               protector and her husband's potential savior. Terry intuitively               reciprocates and becomes frustrated and conflicted by his decidedly               unprofessional feeling for her.
When they reach a breakdown in the negotiations for her Peter's               freedom, Terry devises a daring yet desperate plan with the help               of fellow negotiator Dino (DAVID CARUSO) and a trio of highly trained               mercenaries, to mount a bold rescue operation.

Did you know…?
Castle Rock hired the oldest and most established           of the kidnap-and-ransom companies, the Control Risks Group of London,           to protect the movie company. Ironically, it also is the prototype           for the kidnap-and-ransom company fictionalized in Proof           of Life.
In January, with filming a month away, Hackford called his actors           to London, where the movie would be produced and onstage filming done,           for rehearsals. On a Friday night before Monday's first run-through,           the news clattered in abruptly: a coup d' état had just occurred           in Quito. President Mahuad had been thrown out.
The actors fretted, whispered, and looked at their escape clauses.           What has this guy gotten us into? Volcanoes, kidnappers, now a South           American revolt? The studio said move it to Mexico. The insurance people           wobbled—not the kidnap-and-ransom types, but the suits who insure           against force majeure (acts of God, civil strife, strikes, revolutions).
The coup was a sight to behold—a Peter Sellers set piece.
Four thousand unarmed Indians marched down out of the mountains and           occupied the house of Congress, which was closed and empty for the           weekend. They demanded the president's resignation. He resigned. The           army told the Indians to go home. They went. The vice president took           over within twenty-four hours and told his countrymen to "stop           the buffoonery" and get on with business.
Thell Reed struts down the hallway stomach first. I can say that           because he is fifty-five now and has nothing more to prove. I hope.           Reed is the fastest gun alive, proved when he was fifteen in a quick-draw           contest that hasn't been matched since.
Reed taught Russell Crowe how to quick-draw and shoot five years           ago for The Quick and the Dead.
Reed found Crowe a natural as a shooter. Despite his rough-and-ready           reputation, the actor had never fired anything other than slug guns           and .22s in Australia. "No bad habits to unlearn," Reed says. "Now           he shoots better than most SAS men.
Just to prove a point, Crowe came to Ecuador, a place that frowns           on guns, there being enough violence on all sides of them—and           said he wanted to pack while he was here. Security. Kidnappers. Girls… The           Ecuadorian paratrooper colonel assigned to the movie tried to talk           him out of it. No need. Dangerous.
Crowe would have none of that—he, Reed and Crowe's bodyguard           (Adam Hamon, a former SAS man and a New Zealander with ancestors from           the same New Zealand Maori tribe as the actor) wanted gun permits.           The colonel warned him that they had to pass a rigid test at the firing           range. The top score was five. The colonel got a four. The three outsiders           got fives.

Memoriam
A tragic accident took place in the first weeks of filming in Ecuador.           A second unit was filming a minor scene with David Morse' stand-in           Will Gaffney and five Ecuadorian extras when suddenly the truck they           were in, careened off the road and down a three hundred and fifty foot           ravine. Gaffney, a twenty-nine year old English teacher who had been           on holiday in Quito, died on a stretcher as he was being carried back           up to the road. The extras survived.
