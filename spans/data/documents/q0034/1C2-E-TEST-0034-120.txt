Russell Crowe
Born                  Russell Ira Crowe in Wellington, New Zealand, on April 7, 1964,                  at age four Crowe moved with his family to Australia, There he                  frequently went to work with his parents catering film shoots                  - and on the set is where the young Crowe was said to have eventually                  caught the acting bug.
Today                  recognized as one of the leading Hollywood actors in such blockbusters                  as A                  Beautiful Mind and Gladiator, Crowe began his professional                  career in such Australian-produced films as The Crossing in 1990, following up with a critically praised performance in Proof in 1991.
The                  following year, worldwide attention was given to what is now recognized                  as an early trademark, "Crowe intense" performance as                  a skinhead in Romper Stomper.
It was actress Sharon                  Stone who later championed Crowe's move to Hollywood, and                  who appeared opposite the rising star in The Quick and The                  Dead in 1995, which eventually lead to his breakthrough performance                  in L.A. Confidential two years later and, finally, an Oscar                  nominated performance for The Insider in 1999.
In 2000, Crowe                  achieved superstar status with a riveting performance in the summer                  blockbuster, Gladiator - almost single-handedly reviving the once-dead 50's Roman epic genre. He also gained millions of new fans around the world and,                  in the process, triumphantly won the Oscar for Best Actor in 2001                  for his performance.
His multilayered                  portrayal of a schizophrenic mathematician John Nash in A                  Beautiful Mind also netted Crowe a Golden Globe award                  and an Oscar nomination for Best Actor the following year.
