Ray Winstone And Russell Crowe To Get Biblical In New Movie

Due to the past few weeks' weather one thing every Londoner has probably wanted is an ark and someone to sail the thing to somewhere it doesn't tip it down every day.
For noted cockney Ray Winstone, that dream appears to have come true, as he's reportedly set to star alongside Russell Crowe in an epic on screen retelling of Noah's Ark. Crowe of course captained a stricken ship to safety in 'Master and Commander', and will be well able to guide in game betting's chief spokeshead through the choppy waters of biblical history.
According to Deadline, the pair are wanted by 'The Social Network' writer Darren Aronofsky as Noah (Crowe) and an unnamed villain (Winstone). One isn't sure if Hollywood is hugely aware of the bible, but this writer certainly doesn't remember a burly East Londoner scuppering Noah's search for dry land.
In fact, even those of us are less devout seem to remember God rather than the bloke from 'Sexy Beast' as the main antagonist in the rather damp animal based tale. However with Aronofsky at the helm, perhaps the benefit of the doubt should be given to the new venture.
Engendering further excitement is the fact that according to The Guardian Emma Watson will also star. So long as Winstone doesn't start calling God 'the guv'nor' or 'the daddy', nor tells Noah to 'jog on', movie fans should give this utterly bonkers idea for a film a chance.
