Aronofsky Wants Winstone To Play Villain
According to Deadline reports, British actors Ray Winstone and Emma Watson will star alongside Russell Crowe in Darren Aronofsky's movie version of Noah's Ark.
New information has been reported by film website Deadline about the new movie adaptation of the Biblical story Noah's Ark. The film is entitled Noah and will be directed by Darren Aronofsky , famous for his work on Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan and The Wrestler. It is likely to be a very big budget project, with filming to take place in New York and Iceland, and an expected 2014 release.
So far Russell Crowe is officially attached as the film's protagonist Noah, Douglas Booth and Logan Lerman will play Noah's sons, and Emma Watson has been chosen as the love interest of Booth's character. According to Deadline, Aronofsky is set on having Ray Winstone play the film's villain, joining fellow Brits Booth and Watson in the cast.
With its epic storyline and cast of animals, Noah's Ark has rarely been adapted for TV or film in the past. A film entitled Noah's Ark was released in 1999, starring 24 actor Jon Voight as Noah, while the 2007 comedy movie Evan Almighty also featured Noah's story and used extensive CGI special effects in addition to real animals for the filming. However, the production attracted opposition from animal rights organisation PETA, so the new film will also need to take into account the animal rights issues involved in their ambitious project.
