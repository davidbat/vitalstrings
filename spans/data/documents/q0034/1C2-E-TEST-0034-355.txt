Russell Crowe seems to have got himself a dream role as Moe Howard, one of the Three Stooges, in a comedy to be written and directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (There's Something About Mary).
The film, which will begin shooting in October, will be produced by Warner Bros. 
People magazine quotes Peter Farrelly as saying, 'Crowe would be the perfect Moe because he's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder and a block-nosed Moe look.'
The New Yorker claims that Crowe liked the script, except for the ending, which is being worked on.
