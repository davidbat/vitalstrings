Russell Crowe will make his feature directorial debut on Universal Pictures "Bra Boys", a feature film adaptation of the much talked about recent Australian documentary which Crowe narrated reports Variety .
That doco focuses on the three Abberton brothers (incl. professional big wave surfing champion Koby Abberton) who began an underground surfer movement on Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs (a better beach than Bondi, but not as pretty  as the likes of Dee Why or Bilgola  Beach in the north).
The gang has grown into a large membership and whilst not involved in the famous 2005 Cronulla Beach race riots, the Abberton brothers held well-publicised meetings with other uninvolved groups to help ease tensions.
Brian Grazer will produce, and Stuart Beattie ("Collateral") will pen the screenplay of this adaptation of both the doco and a current non-fiction book in the works.
