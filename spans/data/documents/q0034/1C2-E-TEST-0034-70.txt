Russell Crowe to Officially Play Noah for Director Darren Aronofsky
Posted 04.23.12 by Ryan
There was a time when director Darren Aronofsky was going to helm the sequel/spin-off The Wolverine as his follow-up to his award-winning Black Swan. Instead, Aronofsky will take the director's chair for his passion project, the Biblical epic Noah , with the lead actor he has sought since February . Aronofsky announced the casting news in a fawning (even for Hollywood) press release .
I'd like to thank Paramount and Regency for backing my team's work to breathe new life into the biblical epic. I rejoice that Russell Crowe will be by my side on this adventure. It's his immense talent that helps me to sleep at night. I look forward to being wowed by him every day.
