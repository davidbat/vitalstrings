About a year ago Warner Bros. announced a new Dracula film project called Harker. The movie was described as a reimagining of Bram Stoker's classic novel. Today, we learned from Vulture that Russell Crowe is currently in talks with the studio to take on the role of Jonathan Harker.
The story is told from the point of view of Jonathan Harker, who is a Scotland Yard detective in the film instead of a lawyer. He's tracking Dracula, who is murdering people in England. The script sets up the sleuth as a potential new franchise character.
When the project was first announced, director Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, Orphan) was hired to make the movie. Later on down the road they pulled him off of the project to take over their live-action Akira adaptation. As you know Akira has hit another road bump, and the studio wants the director back on board to take on Harker before jumping back onto Akira, the budget for which will be ridiculously low. 
Crowe is a solid actor that would be perfect for the role of Harker so I hope he takes it. The actor is currently playing Inspector Javert in Tom Hooper’s musical adaptation of Les Miserables. What are your thoughts on Crowe possibly taking on Harker?
