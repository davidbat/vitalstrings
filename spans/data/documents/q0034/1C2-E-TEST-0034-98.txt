Russell           Crowe - Academy Awards 2001
 
 
With           The Quick and the Dead (1995) under his belt as his first American           film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuosity (1995),           starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual           Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far.           Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again,           opened the door to even more American offers. L.A. Confidential           (1997), Russell's third American film, brought him the US fame and           attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the           Oscar nod this time around, he didn't seem deterred and signed to do           his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mystery, Alaska (1999).           He has recently achieved even more success and awards for his           performances in Gladiator (2000) and A Beautiful Mind (2001).

Personal           quotes
 
"One           of the most painful things of the L.A.           Confidential (1997) character I played was that the author, James           Ellroy , kept telling me that Bud White wasn't a drinker. I           said, 'come on, this is 1953. He's a blue-collar bloke, a cop.           You're telling me he doesn't sit around with the boys after his shift           and have a beer?' And Ellroy says, 'absolutely not'. So for           five months and seven days, I didn't have a drink. It's probably           the most painful period of my life".
 
[on           winning the Best Actor Oscar] "If you grow up in the suburbs of           anywhere, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and           completely unattainable. But this moment is directly connected to           those imaginings. And for anybody who's on the downside of advantage,           and relying purely on courage, it's possible."
 
"It's not really what I'd call a movie. I was stunned that Miramax wanted to           buy it. I mean it's really rude. It showed me in a really bad light.           It's also shoddily made. It's cobbled together." -- expressing           surprise that a low-budget documentary of his band, 30 Odd Foot of           Grunts, has been picked up for worldwide distribution.
 
"I'd           move to Los Angeles if Australia and New Zealand were swallowed up by           a huge tidal wave, if there was a bubonic plague in Europe, and if the           continent of Africa disappeared from some Martian attack."
 
"I           felt this tap on my shoulder and I turned around and, you know that De           Niro fellow? Well, he didn't say a word. He didn't say 'Hello', 'Good           evening' or anything or 'Hi, I'm Robert'. He just looked at me and he           nodded his head and he smiled. And he walked off." - About           meeting Robert De Niro .
 
"You           don't have to like an actor to do a scene with him. You don't have to           like a director. But it's just better if you do. And I think, you           know, you've got to begin that with respect."
 
"All           that stuff, this public persona of me - let's call him 'the wild man'           - that is not helpful. It doesn't make me more of a box office draw.           It's the quality of my work that makes people want to go to my           films."
 
"I           always say I've given 24 insufficient performances and I'm looking           forward to the time in my life when I'll do something that I think is           good. There's always stuff you can do better, stuff that maybe you           didn't uncover enough. But if you do something that you truly believe           is perfect, then that's got to be the last movie you do."
 
"I'd           like to play passionate women, but no one will let me."
 
"If           there's anything about someone's life that's important enough to make           a movie about it, I have to take responsibility to get all of it           right. It's a huge responsibility."
 
"The           older I get, the crotchetier I'm going to get about that integrity. I           don't think, just because you have the public's attention, it's now a           prerequisite for you to completely sell out your moral center. I don't           think that's OK. If I ever stop being the guy that can answer your           question straight and look you in the eye and give you my opinion,           then I should stop making films."
 
"I'm           still excited by it. I still love the process. I want to make movies           that pierce people's hearts and touch them in some way, even if it's           just for the night while they're in the cinema; in that moment, I want           to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin.           That's what motivates me, and it may sound strange but if you're not           focused on the audience, why are you bothering to make a movie?"
 
"He           has disappointed me many times over the past ten years, with his           performances in substandard movies." [About Robert De Niro]
