Russell Crowe and his wife Danielle Spencer enjoyed a lovely day at the Sydney Harbour with their children Charlie, 8, and Tennyson 5 1/2, on Monday (January 2).
The 47-year-old Oscar-winning actor put on a life jacket and took a green kayak out for a spin.
Russell is currently filming Broken City and Man of Steel.  Both films are set to release in 2013.
