Logan Lerman
Up-and-Comers to Get Biblical
Deadline has reported some fresh casting news for the upcoming film Noah from director Darren Aronofsky ( Black Swan , Requiem for a Dream ).  Logan Lerman ( Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief ) and Douglas Booth ( LOL ) are set to play Noah’s ( Russell Crowe ) sons Ham and Shem, respectively.
This news seems to be more concrete than recent previous announcements of both Jennifer Connelly and Saoirse Ronan possibly being cast (Connelly being the more likely, what with her previous film experiences with both Aronofsky and Crowe).  And with the rumors of Liam Neeson quashed, there is still casting for the film’s antagonist to wonder about.
Noah will apparently follow the biblical story of the character quite closely, with him being given a divine mission to save creation from a flood by building an Ark.  However, it seems with the casting of his wife, sons, and “nemesis” being a priority, we may be treated to a more character-driven story than one relying on world-ending special effects—this would be Aronofsky’s usual style.  As a fan of his work, something thematically along the lines of his beautiful and criminally under-seen film The Fountain would be very interesting to see.
The film is set to begin filming this July in Iceland and New York for a March 28th, 2014 release.
