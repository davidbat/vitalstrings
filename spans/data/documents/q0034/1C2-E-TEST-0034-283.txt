Ron Howard and Russell Crowe Teaming Up Again?
Posted by ActSean on  January 14th, 2012
Together they teamed up for the Best Picture of 2001 with A Beautiful Mind. In 2005 they joined forces for one of the best reviewed films of that year, Cinderella Man.
Now it appears director Ron Howard and actor Russell Crowe could be working together again very soon.
Rush will tell the tale of Formula 1 champion driver Niki Lauda and the people in his life. His 1976 car racing crash was so severe that it nearly claimed his life. Weeks after the accident, he got behind the wheel to challenge his rival, James Hunt.
Crowe would be playing legendary actor Richard Burton. So what does one of the greatest actors of all time have to do with car racing? Follow me here…
Burton was married to Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde) who became Suzy Hunt when she married James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The role of Lauda is set to be played by Spanish-German actor Daniel Brühl.
While the role of Burton will be a supporting part,  it should be a meaty enough role for Crowe to sink his acting teeth into. Having Howard directing sure helps also.
Crowe has been compared to Richard Burton ever since Gladiator. In fact, he has been on the short list to play Burton in some Elizabeth Taylor biopics currently in-development.
As much as Ron Howard respects the acting talents of Russell Crowe, he also understands how difficult it can be working with him.
Back in 2005, after completing Cinderella Man, Howard had this to say about his Oscar winning actor…
“Working with Russell, I always say, is a little bit like filming on a tropical island. You know the weather’s going to change several times during the course of the day, but you also know it’s a beautiful island and you want to be there, and if you just wait a few minutes the sun will come out. You know, he does have a quick temper. But I always approach him at these moments with simple logic and I always find that it works.”
