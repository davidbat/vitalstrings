The Best Films Starring Russell Crowe
By Steven Alexander
One of the better actors around these days is Russell Crowe. If he is starring in a film, you can probably assume that it will, at the very least, end up being an enjoyable movie. He seems to have his pick of the litter when it comes to choosing roles, and I personally like almost every movie he has ever starred in.
This article will discuss what I consider to be the top five Russell Crowe movies.
I went into The Insider not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised. This movie was simply fantastic. This film was directed by the very talented Michael Mann and also stars the legendary Al Pacino.
Another movie that I definitely feel is worth mentioning is 3:10 To Yuma. In this movie, Russell Crowe plays an outlaw who is captured and is being transferred to get sent off to jail. The only problem is his posse isn't going to let that happen so easy. Action ensues.
I will get Gladiator out of the way, because it obviously makes the list. This film is easily one of my favorites of all time and I could not picture anyone doing a better role than Russell Crowe did. Joaquin Phoenix is also incredible in this movie as the evil emperor.
It is tough to make a list of the greatest films of Russell Crowe without giving praise to his performance of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind. I could not believe he did not win the Academy Award for Best Actor In A Leading Role for this film, but after wining it the previous year for Gladiator, I guess it makes sense.
The last movie that makes the cut for me is Cinderella Man. Any time you are going to take Ron Howard, Russell Crowe, Rene Zellweger, and put them behind an inspirational boxing film based on a true story, you are going to hit gold.
As it stands, this is my personal list of the best Russell Crowe movies. I am sure he will continue to come out with excellent movies for years to come.
