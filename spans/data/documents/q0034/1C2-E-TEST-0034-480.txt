He’s a joke. My husband has decided to get circumsized when he has his vasectomy so we will do it for our son also. Regardless of anyone elses belief it is a decison each family has to make on their own factoring in many different situations.

I can’t believe we are talking about this at all. This is mutilation. Comparing it to needed surgery is ridiculous.   How is it any different to female circumcision? I mean mutilation? California might be voting on this soon. Thank God

As a Jew, I found his ignorant comments about loving our “apples and the honey and the funny little hats,” much more offensive than anything he said about circumcision.  Oh, but he qualified it by assuring us that he has many Jewish friend who he loves (insert eyeroll).  Maybe his many Jewish friends could educate him that the “funny little hats” are called kippahs (or yamulkes, in Yiddish) and Jewish men don’t wear them to amuse an arrogant movie star with a history of violent behavior.  They are worn to show respect for G-d, our ultimate Authority, who is always above us.  Of course, I’m assuming he meant kippot – he might be mocking the traditional hats worn by various denominations of Chasidic Jews.
Mr. Crowe might be interested to learn the Muslims also practice male circumcision.  In fact, they are the largest religion to do so.
I agree with the previous comments – I don’t need any celebrity advice on how to raise my child (or their advice on any other aspect of my life, for that matter).

Sara – Female circumcision has no benefits and leaves a woman unable to climax. Male circumcision does have medical benefits, like lowered rates of UTIs, bladder infections, and STDs, and doesn’t prevent climax. BIG difference.

On that vote in CA, whether you agree with the practice or not, I wouldn’t align myself with the guys behind this campaign.  There was some offensive stuff put out by the group.  A comic book featuring “Foreskin Man”, and it was really disgusting and disrespectful to the Jewish faith (IMO, and many others that I read).  I hope that vote fails not because I live in CA, but because that group is really awful.

Julius – my understanding is that the Torah refers specifically to the first 5 books of the Old Testament, and the Bible – in Judaic terms – refers to the entire O.T.
I’m with those who think it was moronic to ask an actor for his opinion on circumcision.
I’m more interested, though, in what caused his change of tone. Did his publicist get involved, or did one of his “many Jewish friends” [sic] help him to understand that he was behaving like a jerk?

Being circumcised prevents STDs Jessica? LOL. If a man has adequate cleanliness none of that will be a problem. It originated as a religious practice not for medical reasons. It is still taking your baby and having a piece of him cut off. The reason for female mutilation is different but it is still unjust mutilation.

Well, I think with his “public relations” history, Russell Crowe should perhaps stay away from twitter.That said,I don’t agree with circumcision for supposed preventative measures.(I don’t have an opinion about it in religious terms). I was raised outside of North America and circumcision of newborns for non-religious reasons is very uncommon in the country of my birth. As I understand it, the same goes for most of Europe. But to each their own I guess.

Circumcision is totally analogous to certain forms of female circumcision. The removal of the clitoral hood is the female equivalent of removal of the foreskin. The problem is that many Americans are too blinded by ethnocentrism to view their practices with the critical lense of others.
The fact is that circumcision is a cure looking for an ailment. It became widespread in this country due to the Victorian era belief that it could prevent masturbation. Since that time it has been touted as a cure all for everything from unheard of cancers(such as penile) to syphilis. The rest of the world realizes that it is needless cosmetic surgery. If the US was right about this Eruropean, Canadian, Australian, and South American men would have more urogenital problems. They don’t! If you don’t believe me take a look at what some of these national medical organizations have to say about it:
It’s about time we got with the rest of the Western world and let go of our ignorance in the name of tradition and stopped surgically altering non-consenting baby boys in the name of blind tradition.

Good for him! He could have been a bit more polite in his wording, but perhaps someone will now reconsider having their son circumcised.  To people in most other western nations, it really is shocking how many American baby boys are circumcised.

there are some instances in which research has shown less transmission of STDs (including HPV) and bacteria in men who are circumcised versus men who are not.  also, I have been involved with patients who have required circumcision as adults for recurrent urinary tract infections and other urological needs- for an adult man this surgery is painful and requires stitches and long healing time.
I think it is definetely a parent’s choice, but I am a “to each their own” type. I left the decision up to my husband who wanted our son circumcised for hygeine reasons and so they would have the same “look”

Well said Nicole. My boys are intact and I am grateful I didn’t give into the pressures of society. Circumcision rates increased in Africa and the rate of AIDS transmissions increased right along with it. Other than this instance rates of STD’s and cancer is not significantly different in American than in countries where circumcision is not routine.

Why does everyone on God’s green earth believe that it is their right to tell parent’s how to take care of their children?  This, just like vaccination, breast feeding, and a host of other things are decisions that each parent should research and discuss with a pediatrician that they trust.  As if having a celebrity tweet about it is justification for making this kind of decision?  What the hell have we come to when your “information” comes from a man who only has a public voice because he can pretend to be someone else on a movie screen.
Katie

I’m proud of him for speaking up for children’s rights. The fact is, people around the world overwhelmingly do not have their sons circumcised. Doctors, outside of those totally immersed in American culture and unable to take an objective look at circumcision, will tell you that there is no reason to have it done. The more you look into it, the more disturbing it is. I am well aware that some people are passionately religiously motivated to do it, but others in those same religions will tell you they believe circumcision is man’s response to G-d and not G-d’s requirement of man. It’s all a matter of perspective.

I have to say, I don’t see the logical chain in the argument, “Circumcision was initially popularized as a means of preventing masturbation and should therefore be banned.” Even if this is true about its origins – heck, even if some people *still* circumcise for that reason – why does that mean that others shouldn’t do it for other reasons? Some people take birth control pills so that they can have sex with anything that breathes and not get pregnant; does that mean I should not use it to plan my parenthood with my husband in our monogamous relationship? Some people use kitchen knives to murder others; does that mean I shouldn’t use one to cut up my carrots? Just because someone has done or currently does something for a poor reason does not mean that another person will have no good reason for doing it.

I quote, “I love the apples and the honey and the funny little hats but stop cutting yr babies.” WTF?? Are you freaking kidding me?
And for the record, I am CATHOLIC not Jewish but that quote was just utterly disgusting and ignorant and prejudiced and I am really ashamed of Babycenter for repeating that. Yuck!
Frankly, I didn’t expect much better than that from Russell Crowe who is someone that I don’t respect but I DID expect more than that from Babycenter.

If it is mutilation to you, then I hope you don’t have anything pierced or tattooed. I also hope that you never have a medical issue that requires you to change anything on your body, since it is deemed “mutilation”.

Considering the fact that he’s an Aussie, I’m not the least bit surprised. Circumcision is frowned upon here, and doctors everywhere tell parents not to do it. There are probably only 2 or 3 places where the procedure is done in the whole state of Victoria and they are Jewish temples.

I am a Christian and I even found his comments of making fun of jewish practices and their “funny little hats” to be pretty insulting and disturbing. I don’t think its his place, nor anyone elses place to make fun of a religious sect and what they hold sacred. It is insulting to anyone who has compassion and understanding of those around you who hold things in a honored, sacred place. I also think it isnt anyone’s place to judge if a child is circumcised for religious purposes. Yes, I do think circumcision is done to readily in this country for cosmetic purposes but if it’s a religious act that is done it isn’t anyone’s business to say it is wrong. If you read the old testament it states in their why God ordained or told his people to do this. Jewish people follow the old testament teachings and this is something that they believe they still should do for their children as instructed by God so who an argue with that?!?! It should be respected in those instances and those who are not Jewish or Muslim, if they choose to do it for cosmetic purposes should research and make sure that is the best decision for their family. I don’t think it is anyone elses business to choose for families what they decide to do to their family when it comes to circumcision, vaccination, breastfeed, co-sleeping and the list can go on.

I think this is one more science vs. God debate.  Someone believes in what some scientist said (and they don’t agree with each other on this issue.  You’ll find science behind both sides), another believes God.
As for Mr. Crowe’s proclamation that all babies are perfect, I would have to say that MY religion believes that all babies are born sinners.  I don’t believe that God requires that my son to have his foreskin removed in order to have salvation, as the Apostle Paul clearly addresses in the New Testament (yes, this was argued about 2000 years ago as well…)  However, they are not perfect, and that’s where I would disagree with him on this argument.  In some circles, they believe that circumsision has been replaced by baptism.
At any rate, it’s not just Russle Crowe that makes fun of any religion that does not conform completely to some random scientist.  I mean, science has a great history of always being right…right?
(Or was that last year’s study that said science was always right…I forget.)

I don’t understand why people need to make Circumcision a political issue.
If you want your sons to have it done great!
If you don’t.. thats great too!
I decide whats best for my two sons whether its leaving the forskin on or get it taken off..
But as a parent of 2 boys it is MY decision.
I think people are informed enough now a days that we should just let each person do their own thing instead of hiding behind a computer telling others what we think is best for their kids.. That goes along hiding behind Twitter as well..

People just need to get informed whats right for them

I dont really get why God would ask his followers to snip their babies, but who am I to say?? If any parent wishes for their child to have the procedure that is really no one elses business… Female Genital Mutilation is a completely different matter, sometimes ALL the external genitalia is removed, often the vagina is sewed up tight and must be cut open when the woman is to have her first sexual encounter AND it is usually done to an older child, often without adequate medical care… I’m SO tired of people comparing FGM to circumcision. FGM is abuse, it is used to torture and control young girls/women. Stop comparing the two! They are nothing alike!! ARGH this gets me so agitated!!! State your opinion about circumcision, but leave FGM out of it

I’m not surprised by his comments at all. He does come from a country with a low circumcision rate and may be following the status quo in regards to the matter. I personally see nothing wrong with circumcision but hey, to each their own. There’s really no right or wrong answer in my opinion when it comes to making a decision about male circumcising since there’s pros and cons for and against it.

Over half a million children get their tonsils removed every year b/c of repeated infections. Medical consensus is that the longer one waits to have this procedure done, the more painful it will be. Why not just take out all babies’ tonsils soon after birth as well? We can prevent so many millions of strep infections. Oh and if we remove all our girls’ mammary gland then no one will have to suffer the injustice of breast cancer…

Ready, ready, ready? ….. OFF WITH HIS HEAD!
That was my very horrible joke before my own sons circumcision. It did get a few laughs from a couple doctors and some family. I’m not religious at all; I’ve never even opened a bible. It was mine and my spouses choice. Opinions, beliefs, choices, “because the bible told me to,” whatever your reason or justification…
Remember it is your choice and no one elses. You decide what is right for you and your family. Your beliefs are your own and you shouldn’t push them on others. Your choices are your own and share them if you want but don’t force them upon someone either.

I never even knew there was such crazy debate over circumcision until I became pregnant with my son.
I’ve done a lot of reading on this topic and can I just say two things– on all the comments of stories that I read there is always someone comparing it to FGM. They are NOT the same. FGM would be more comparable to castrating a man. A man can be fully functional without his foreskin.
There is also a comment about circumcision lowering rates of STDs and someone against circumcision always says something about it preventing STDs. Lowering the chances and preventing are again, NOT THE SAME.

I thank those who were against circumcising.  As part of cultural norm not really religious but more on societal norms, we are dead set on circ’ing our boys.  However, seeing that other people are very passionate about keeping their boys in tact, I looked into the matter and decided to hold it off.  Upon consultation, I was advised by my doctor that these kids will ask for it when they want it, and that’s the time to let them d it in their own terms but it’s not really not for me nor my husband to decide.  I really appreciate people who have differing opinions than my own ideals, it leads to educated decision making.  So I agree with mr. crow, you have an opinion say it, might irate lots of people but it not fail to enlighten some.

While I don’t like the way he came across (very culturally insensitive Mr. Crowe) I have to agree with him.  I’m against circumcision.  When I became pregnant the first time (with my DD) I had told DH before we knew the sex that it was up to him, he had the parts, so on and so forth.  Had DD been a boy she would have been circ’d.  Next time (with DS) I was telling DH (again before we found out the gender) that there was no way I’d let him do something like that to my child without very good reason.  So we looked and we looked.  No good reason, unless you feel that the religious views of Jews and Muslims are a good reason, which I do, we just are neither Jewish or Muslim.  DH had a hard time coming over to my side, for cultural reasons, but finally he asked the OB who would preform the procedure (and please don’t get me started on why docs who specialize in the female anatomy do them, that’s a whole different argument for me.  If you are going to do it please, PLEASE go to a pediatric urologist.) about it, and its purpose, so on and so forth.  Well the doc said that yes, HE numbs the area, but most OBs don’t, and even said that the numbing only helps for the actual procedure, that baby will still experience pain after the fact and gave some pointers on how to deal with that.  As for purpose, he said that it was for cultural cosmetic purposes.  Cosmetic surgery? On my 1 day old baby???  We also questioned him about the common “medical” reasons for circ’ing.  Yes it can cut a baby boy’s chances of UTIs down by 50% (which in actual numbers means from a 2% chance to a 1% chance, mind you little girls have a 4% chance of UTI, and when they get them, you know what we do?  Give them antibiotics, that’s right!) and the studies on circ and HIV are actually being discredited b/c of the way they were done.  They were attempting to measure if circing would increase the time before one would get HIV, not if it would prevent it, and yes, those that were circ’d were not allowed to participate in sexual activity for a 6 week healing period AND when they were that group was given condoms (the other group was not) so yes, they did contract HIV later, but most still contracted it.  Also he told us that that babies were twice as likely to need it REdone as they would be as adult men to need it done (again only a 2%vs 1% but still sounds scary when you don’t use the actual numbers doesn’t it).  So for us it came down to we are not Jewish or Muslim, and we saw no medical benefit.  Add that to the fact that only about 50% of boys now being born are actually being circ’d we saw no real cultural relevence.  All I ever say to anyone that asks me about it (and lots do when they find out my son is intact and they are preggo) it to make sure that BOTH parents do their research and no one is bullied into a decision in either direction.  Ultimately as a parent you have to make  tough calls for your babies, the ultimate right decision is one that both parents (and I believe the child when they are older) agree on.
