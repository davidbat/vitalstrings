And how did you come to that conclusion?  I haven't seen anything conclusive on it one way or the other.  From what I have seen though, it is my strong guess that deaths of soldiers bothers him A LOT.  I have seen NOTHING to suggest otherwise.
I heard Bernie Goldberg remark how the very word of "Bush" brings up vile hate and foaming at the mouth from haters.  He is right.  I didn't vote for the guy either and am disappointed that the American people choose him.  But they did and that is how things work in this country.  I respect the voters and our president we choose.
Please do disagree and challenge Bush.  Don't thrown out some piece of crap about him not caring about our troops and try to color it as truth.
As much as I dislike Bush, I would still take him over Kerry or Gore anyday.  It disappoints me that the choices in the past two elections have sucked.
