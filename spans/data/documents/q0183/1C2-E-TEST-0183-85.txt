Flags At Half Mast Today April 29 2010?
Why are flags flying at half mast in Washington DC today April 29 2010? (4/29/2010)
Is there a specific reason flags are this way today? Was it an order from president Obama?
Did something happened and I'm not aware of it?
Please let me know the answer.

Answer Question!
Flags will be flown at half-staff today April 29 2010, as a tribute to civil rights leader Dorothy Height.
The request comes from President Barack Obama, who will deliver the eulogy at Height's funeral. The President has ordered flags at the White House and federal agencies at half-staff from 8 a.m. until sunset.
President Obama shed a few tears while attending the funeral of civil rights icon, Dr. Dorothy Height at the National Cathedral in Washington this morning.
Obama described Height as "a drum major for justice" during his eulogy, and said that she had visited the White House not once or twice since he's been in office, but 21 times. "We came to love her," he said of getting to know Height with Michelle Obama. "We came to love her stories. We loved her smile. We loved those hats she wore. Regal."
In related news, flags will be lowered to half-staff across the state of Michigan tomorrow to honor a fallen soldier from southeast Michigan.  Governor Granholm issued the order in honor of Army Sergeant Michael Ingram Jr.  He was killed by an improvised explosive device while on patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan on April 17th.  The 23-year-old was promoted to sergeant from corporal upon his death.  The funeral for Sergeant Ingram will be held Friday at Stewart Road Christian Ministries in Monroe, followed by burial in St. Joseph Cemetery in Monroe.

At the direction of Obama, all U.S. flags on state facilities are to be flown at half-staff on Thursday April 29 2010 in memory of civil rights leader Dorothy Height. Height died last week at the age of 98.
President Barack Obama ordered the move as a mark of respect for Height, who helped to found the American civil rights movement and worked for racial justice and gender equality for more than 60 years.
Also as it's been stated above flags will be lowered to half-staff across the state tomorrow to honor a fallen soldier from southeast Michigan.

Tomorrow will be the third time in the month of April 2010 that flags are at half mast.
The first time was when President Barack Obama proclaimed April 19, 2010 as National Day of Service and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors of Terrorism, 2010.
Today the reason is Dorothy Height and tomorrow flags will be flown at half mast in honor of Army Sgt. Michael K. Ingram Jr., of Monroe, Michigan.

Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm has ordered that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff statewide to honor a soldier from southern Michigan. He died April 17 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, of wounds suffered after an improvised explosive device detonated near him.

Half Staff not Half Mast
The flags were flown at half staff not half mast. The difference is that half mast designates a Naval, maritime, or nautical site.  Half staff relates all other sites. So unless you're at a U.S. Naval base, Naval Reserve facility, Coast Guard station, private or public marina, etc., the flags you've seen are at half staff.
