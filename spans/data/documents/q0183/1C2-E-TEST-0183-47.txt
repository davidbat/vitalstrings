) Flag as…
¶
@Sunny2 Thank you for the follow-up.  In thinking about it, if someone showed up on my doorstep that I didn’t know offering food because of the position of the flag, it would be sort of weird and suspect.
@lillycoyote Thank you for the additional information and the link.  That is what I have always heard.  I’m in Tennessee.
@erichw1504 You may be joking, but I just got back from a walk up to the house thinking that it might be Motorcycle Guy’s place.  It wasn’t.
He does have an American flag as well as a Confederate flag hanging on the walls of his garage.
@WasCy I’ve checked both the state and city sites for announcements.  Nothing cropped up.
@All After closer inspection on the walk past the house, it appears that the flagpole holder is mounted so close to the eave that there is no way the flag could be put up in the proper upright position.  I couldn’t tell if the flag was at half-mast on purpose or not without leaving the sidewalk to go up to the house.
