Flag Etiquette
There are no standardised international regulations governing flag etiquette.  Some         of the general guidelines used in flag flying are detailed below:
General
Display the flag only between sunrise and sunset.
It is not good practice           to fly two flags on a single flagpole.  This         signifies that the top flag has captured the lower flag.
Flag Precedence
The national flag should not be displayed in a position inferior to         any other flag.  It must be flown on the senior flagpole.
Where two         or more flagpoles are present the senior flagpole is either the highest         or, as the observer you are viewing the flagpoles with the building behind         them, the flagpole on the left hand side.
When flying the Union flag with         other national flags the Union flag occupies the senior flagpole and         all others should be flown on individual poles of equal height and in         alphabetical order.
A guide to the order of precedence of more than one flag in the UK           is as follows:
(1) Union Flag
(2) Any other national flag
(3) Flag of Europe
(4) Flag of England / Scotland / Wales
(5) Regional / city / county flag
(6) Corporate / house / club / school / organisation flag
Half Mast
When hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-staff, it should             be hoisted to full staff for an instant, then lowered to half-staff.             Likewise when it is lowered at the end of the day, it is to be hoisted         to full staff for an instant, and then lowered.
In the UK, the correct           way to fly the flag at half mast is two-thirds between the top and           bottom of the flagstaff, according to the Department of Culture, Media           and Sport, which decides the flying, on command of the Sovereign. The           flag may be flown on a government building at half mast on the following         days:
From the announcement of the death up to the funeral of the                 Sovereign, except on Proclamation Day when flags are hoisted               to full staff, from 11am until sunset.
The funerals of members of the royal family, upon command of               the Sovereign.
The funerals of foreign rulers, upon command of the Sovereign.
The funerals of prime ministers and ex-prime ministers of the               UK, upon command of the Sovereign.
Other occasions, by special command of the Sovereign.
If a flag flying day coincides with a half-mast flag flying                 day (including the death of a royal), the flag is flown at full               mast unless a specific command is received from the Sovereign.
If more than one flag is flown on a half mast day, they must be all           be flown at half staff, or not at all. The flag of a foreign nation           must never be flown at half mast on UK soil unless that country has         declared mourning.
A flag used as a coffin drape should be placed so that           the hoist is at the head and the top edge of the flag runs down the           side of the left shoulder.
