Candlelight Vigil For Police Officer Killed by Suspected Drunk Driver
El Paso -- Flags across El Paso will fly at half-staff today in honor of Officer Karl McDonough.
Governor Rick Perry's office gave the City of El Paso and the El Paso Police Department permission to lower the flags after learning about the deadly wreck.
McDonough was killed early yesterday morning in East El Paso after the police car he was a passenger in was hit by an alleged drunk driver.
Flags were also lowered yesterday.
