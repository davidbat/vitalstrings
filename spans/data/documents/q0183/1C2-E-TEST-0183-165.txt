TV's Riddler actor Gorshin dies
Actor Frank Gorshin, who played the Riddler in the Batman TV series, has died at the age of 72.
A renowned impressionist, Gorshin had a long-running show in Las Vegas as well as a long list of TV and film credits.
He died on Tuesday having "put up a valiant fight with lung cancer, emphysema and pneumonia," his wife Christina said in a statement.
His agent and long-time friend Fred Wostbrock said Gorshin had died at the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in California.
Gorshin played the dastardly Riddler from 1966 to 1969, opposite Adam West as Batman.
West said: "Frank will be missed. He was a friend and fascinating character."
Well known for his maniacal laugh, Gershin said the Riddler's laugh was actually based on his own.
"I fooled around with all kinds of different laughs and then I found out that when I do laugh I get this high-pitched laugh and I thought, 'This is what I'm going to use'," he said n 1997.
