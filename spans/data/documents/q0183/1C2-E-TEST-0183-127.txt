Gov. Brian Schweitzer released a proclamation in honor of fallen firefighters.
He ordered all flags on property of the state of Montana be flown at half-staff today, Oct. 16, in observance of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.
This falls on the coattails of President Barack Obama’s recent proclamation of Fire Prevention Week, which was Oct. 9-15.
The theme this year was, “Protect Your Family from Fire,” and encourages all Americans to promote fire prevention awareness both inside and outside the home. 
“This week, our nation honors the dedicated firefighters and other first responders who do the hard, dangerous work of keeping our communities safe from fire,” Obama said. “Many have laid down their lives to save our friends and neighbors, and their selfless sacrifice defines the nature of courage. As we pay tribute to their memories, let us resolve to maintain our vigilance and take proactive steps to stop fire emergencies before they begin.”
Obama said the flags of the United States will be flown at half-staff on all federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.
“I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences,” he said.
