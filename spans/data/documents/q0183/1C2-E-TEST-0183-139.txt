When former Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr. died Sunday after a long illness, Gov. Rick Perry reached out to the U.S. government, asking for flags to be flown at half-mast at federal buildings in Texas. The response, Perry's office says, was a resounding no.
Under the United States Code , "In the event of the death of a present or  former  official of the government of any State, territory, or  possession of the  United States or the death of a member of the Armed  Forces from any  State, territory, or possession who dies while serving  on active duty,  the Governor of that State, territory, or possession  may proclaim that  the National flag shall be flown at half-staff."
But when Perry's office made the request to the Department of Homeland Security's Denver Megacenter — which distributes flag orders from the White House — Perry was flatly rebuffed, his spokeswoman says. She says federal officials told him he didn't have the authority to make the request.
DHS officials have not yet been reached for comment — and Perry's office says they think it was just bureaucratic confusion.
Update:
Sources are reporting that flags are now at half-staff at Texas  federal buildings — and that the Denver Megacenter never should've been  the governor's point of contact. DHS officials say it's a law  enforcement intelligence center, and has nothing to do with flag  lowering or raising.
