I agree. Have other presidents done this when there have been mining accidents?
I really hate Obama.

I’m sure if you asked most miners they would want the flag flown at half-staff for Obama

Come to think of it, I had mixed feelings about seeing the flag at half mast after 9/11 too. I wanted it high.

Our family hails from that neck of the woods in WV, and we are old enough to remember that things like this use to happen all the time. The safety practices and technology have eliminated the deaths to a tiny fraction of what it was like in my grandfathers time.
I feel sorry for the miners, but good grief they are paid good money now to go into those mines and do a mans work, there will always be risk no matter what laws are passed and these men understood that every day they walked in.
They knew that they were being paid good money to go down there and work, and that there were risks involved that no amount of prevention and technology will ever eliminate. It’s horrible, but if Obama thinks it’s shocking then he knows nothing about coal miners, their history or the families that have done it.

He did it becaue it makes him feel good, and because he probably thinks it makes him look good.

Not to sound like a curmudgeon, even as I am, in fact a curmudgeon, but it seems our flag is flown at half mast more than it is flown at full mast lately. I think we should reserve this action for the most serious of matters. Not to diminish the loss of these brave workers. We keep their families in our prayers. But...
Maybe its s sign of the times...

i guess your right in the sense that this is just a horrible non-national accident. What should be done maybe is fly the WV flag at half-mast on national flagpoles. (?)

And I would bet the families of those killed are those Americans who “cling to their religion and guns”.

This was a terrible accident, but flying the flag at half staff for a week is not really in line with flag protocol at the national level. I mean, when a sitting congressman dies the flag is only at half staff until his burial (I think).but as the president, he can have the flag at half staff for any reason he wants. @lease correct me if I am wrong. This is an interesting civics issue.

But not for Gen Robert White, genuine American Hero, who recently passed away. If you don’t recognize the name you would would be glad you looked it up.
