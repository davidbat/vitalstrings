Mayor Rob Ford expressed his condolences to the family and colleagues of Toronto Police Sgt. Ryan Russell Wednesday.
"This is a very, very sad day for all of us," Ford told reporters inside the mayor's office Wednesday afternoon. "On behalf of all members of city council and every resident in Toronto I want to extend my deepest condolences and sympathy to the family of Sgt. Ryan Russell, his colleagues in 52 Division and throughout the Toronto Police Service.
"Sgt. Russell, an 11-year veteran of the Toronto Police Service, died this morning while on duty, acting to protect the people of this great city. His bravery and service to the City of Toronto will never be forgotten."
Ford stressed Toronto has "the best police service in the world."
"Sgt. Russell is a shining example of the men and women of our police service who put their lives on the line every day to protect us," he said.
Earlier in the day, Ford ordered flags outside City Hall and all civic centres to fly at half-staff in honour of the fallen officer.
He concluded his short statement by speaking directly to Russell's family and colleagues.
"Our thoughts and our prayers are with you," Ford said.
