Flags above New Jersey's federal and official buildings will fly at half-mast on Saturday during Whitney Houston 's funeral in Newark.
The state's governor Chris Christie insists it's the least he and other New Jersey business and political leaders can do to pay tribute to the superstar, who died on Saturday in Los Angeles.
He says, "Obviously, Whitney Houston was an important part of the cultural fabric of this state... She is the pantheon of great New Jersey musical talents.
"Her terribly premature death is an awful loss for her family and the incredible New Jersey musical family."
Christie made the same order to lower flags last year following the death of Bruce Springsteen's saxophonist Clarence Clemons.
Houston's remains were flown home to Newark on Monday night.
An invitation-only funeral will take place at noon on Saturday at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where the superstar first showed off her impressive vocal talents as a young choir member.
