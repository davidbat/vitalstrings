Flying the American Flag at Half-Staff
The President of the United States can direct how the entire executive branch of the government flies the flag , including traditions or customs for flying the flag at half-staff (PDF document). While you can follow how the executive branch flies the flag, it is not a requirement. For instance, a local community, a company, a school district, or a federal agency can decide to have all of their flags at half-staff because of the death of an employee, a student, a mayor, or a local police officer.
However, an easy way to remember when to fly the United States flag at half-staff is when the nation is in mourning. These periods of mourning occur by Presidential proclamation .
