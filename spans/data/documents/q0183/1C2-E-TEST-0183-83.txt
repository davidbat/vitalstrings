Flags to Fly Half Staff for Dorothy Height

*President Obama signed a proclamation on Monday ordering flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and all public buildings and grounds Thursday “as a mark of respect for the memory of Dorothy Height.”
Known as the “godmother of the civil rights movement,” Height died last Tuesday at Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C. following a brief illness. During her career, she served as chair and president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women and has received among her many honors the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Ronald Reagan Citizens Medal.
Obama’s proclamation also ordered the flag to be flown at half-staff at all military posts and naval stations and at half-mast on all naval vessels nationwide and in U.S. territories and possessions until sunset each day.
“I further direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations,” Obama wrote in the order.
Services for Height begin this evening in Washington, D.C. with a wake from 6-10 p.m. at the National Council of Negro Women’s headquarters.
At 2 p.m. Wednesday, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority will conduct a public Omega Omega Service at Howard University. Dr. Height served as national president of the sorority in 1947. At 7 p.m., a “Community Celebration of Life” memorial service will be held at Shiloh Baptist Church.
Height’s funeral will take place at 10 a.m. Thursday at Washington National Cathedral.
