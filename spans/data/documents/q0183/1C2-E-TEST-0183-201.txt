The national flag flying at half-mast
January 4, 2011
The Minister of National Security, in keeping with proper Flag Protocol, wishes to advise that the National Flag will continue to be flown at half-mast until the funeral service of the late First President of Trinidad and Tobago Sir Ellis Clarke, on Friday 7th January 2011.
The Flag in Mourning: Half-masting
The Flag is flown at half-mast (or half-staff) when the Nation is in mourning. By half â€“mast is meant lowering the Flag by its own depth from its normal position at the peak of the staff.
When the Flag is flown at half-mast, it is first hoisted to the top of the staff for an instant, then lowered to the half-mast position. Before hauling it down for the day the Flag is again raised to the top of the staff.
The flag should be flown at half-mast on the day of the death and funeral day of:
1. The President;
3. The President of the Senate;
4. The Speaker of the House of Representatives.
5. Members of the Cabinet;
6. Other notable citizens and residents of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago as may be announced by the Minister of National Security.
On other occasions as may from time to time be prescribed by the Minister of National Security.
When any of these days of mourning on which the Flag is required to fly at half-mast falls on one of the special days of national significance referred to above, the National Flag should nevertheless be flown at full mast on that day, unless special instructions to the contrary are received from the Minister of National Security.
