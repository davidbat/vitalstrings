In accordance with the U.S. Flag Code and with a proclamation issued by President George W. Bush, the United States flag is to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the June 5, 2004 death of Ronald Reagan, ex-president of the United States, This is the first time in history that the U.S. flag will be flown half-mast on the 4th of July.
When the flag is raised on the pole, it should first be raised briskly to the top of the pole, and then it should be lowered ceremoniously to half-staff. This should be about mid-point on the pole. No other flag should be higher than the U.S. flag. Other flags such as State, city, corporate, etc. should be lower than the U.S., whether on the same or another pole. Otherwise, all other flags should be taken down.
In situations when it is not possible to half-staff a flag, for example when it is permanently fixed to a staff, displaying a black ribbon above a full-staffed flag is an appropriate alternative form of expressing mourning.
While the sight of the U.S. flag flying at half-mast on the 4th of July may seem unusual, citizens should both celebrate the spirit of the Independence Holiday and recognize the death of a former U.S. President.
