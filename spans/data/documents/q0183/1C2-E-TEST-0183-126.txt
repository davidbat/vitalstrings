The Ennismore man killed in a boating accident over the weekend will be remembered for his kindness and how much he loved his friends and family.
Paul Heffernan, 54, died when the boat he was driving crashed into two docks and several other boats near the Causeway View Rd. at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday.
His passenger, Debbie Boulter, remains in hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries.
"Paul is a great friend and a neighbour, he'd do anything for anybody," said Lee Jones, a good friend of Boulter and Heffernan.
"He loved his boats, his snowmobiles, his kids and Debbie," she said.
"There are a lot of flags flying at half-mast on Chemong Lake right now in his honour."
Mr. Heffernan owned Overhead Door in Peterborough. The store manager declined to comment Monday until he had cleared it with the family.
Peterborough County OPP are still trying to determine the cause of the collision. Police said Sunday that Mr. Heffernan was not wearing a life-jacket when he was ejected from the boat.
On Sunday, police said the collision occurred at a great speed and it was possible Mr. Heffernan misjudged his location. It hasn't been determined whether or not alcohol was a factor.
