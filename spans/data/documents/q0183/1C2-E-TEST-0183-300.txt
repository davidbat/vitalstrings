COLUMBUS: The state's official period of mourning begins for Ohio Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, who died Friday following gastrointestinal problems.
Gov. Ted Strickland has ordered that flags fly at half-staff beginning Monday and continuing through the burial day for Moyer, the 70-year-old head of the Ohio Supreme Court.
The court says funeral arrangements are pending.
When he died, Moyer was the longest-serving state Supreme Court chief justice on the bench in the United States. His tenure lasted 24 years, making him Ohio's second-longest-serving chief justice ever.
Until Strickland appoints a successor, the court's acting chief will be Justice Paul Pfeifer, now the justice who has served longest. The court has no oral arguments scheduled until Friday.
