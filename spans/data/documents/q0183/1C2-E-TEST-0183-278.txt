Captain Pawanexh Kohli                            CONTENTS                          INTRODUCTION                          The Flag Etiquette was evolved many years ago for displaying flags on large                          vessels. Captains of International Ocean going ships are usually able to follow                          that code, but on instances the configuration of masts, spreaders, etc., on modern                          boats is so different from tradition, many skippers and owners have been                          confused and likely to wear their ships flags improperly and inconsistently.                           The points of honour have been established by long tradition but with new                          designs and configurations of boats, occasionally rigging and the like have                          modified the location of these points. Case is example, the aircraft carriers where                          masts are displaced from centre line or the Ro-Ro/Lash ships where the stern is                          occupied with cargo access openings. In lieu of traditional flag posts, antennas,                          fishing towers, outriggers, portside halyards, double hoisting or other practices                          are used for the flag code. Though many may think these are incorrect, these                          varied flag display techniques, if your boat’s configuration requires you to do so,                          are appropriate, provided the code is followed correctly.                            FLAG TERMINOLOGY                                                                             Canton: any Quadrant of a flag                                                                             but usually refers to the upper                                                                             left (Hoist) quarter.

Courtesy Flag: The national Flag or civil ensign of the country you are visiting.                           Dimension: For most countries it varies depending on shape and specifications.                          Usually though, the Fly is twice as long as the Hoist (1:2 ratio).                           National Ensign: The Flag of the country your ship is registered with; signifies the                          Ship’s nationality                            FLYING FLAGS                                   SHIP                                                 A B O A R D YO U R                          Notice that flags are worn or flown, what’s the difference? Vessels wear flags;                          people fly flags on their vessels.                           Flags are basically signals and each is intended to convey something specific;                          whether it be nationality, maneuvering situation, courtesy, or any number of                          other things. Each flag has a specific location where it is worn, and a specific                          time when it can be flown.                           There is a logical pattern followed, even though it may seem that there are many                          locations for the various categories of flags one might fly. There is both an “order                          of preference” and a sequence of “points of honor.” Simply stated, the Order of                          Preference follows from the highest allegiance you bear, i.e., Nationality (India),                          down to your personal preferences (company or personal flag) to communication                          signals. The Points of Honor relate to the order of importance of the various                          locations from which you might fly a flag. Obviously, the flag highest in your                          order of preference should be flown from the point at which it is awarded the                          greatest honor.                            ORDER - POINTS                HONOR                                                   OF                          There is an “order” of prominence. The points of honor in descending order, are                          understood as follows:                                         gaff                                        flagstaff at the stern                                        bow staff                                        starboard spreader (Cross Tree or Yardarm)                                        truck of the mast (masthead)                                        port spreader (Cross Tree or Yardarm)                                                                                                 Captain Pawanexh Kohli

Captain Pawanexh Kohli                          The highest place of honor is always reserved for your national ensign. Every                          other flag should be worn at a lower point of honor, even when you are not                          flying the national ensign.                           For example, if you are flying only your company flag, it should never be worn at                          the point of honor from which you would display the national ensign. So, when                          you are not flying the national ensign, the point from which you would normally                          fly it must remain bare even when you are flying other, important flags or                          pennants.                            WHERE                               NATIONAL                                       TO FLY YOUR                               FLA G                          The Gaff is the highest point of honor on a flagpole that has one. Alternately, the Stern                          Flagstaff is also reserved for the National Flag.                           Generally, the national ensign should be displayed at the peak of the gaff—if your                          ship has a gaff. If it does not, fly it from the flagstaff at your ship’s stern. If your                          ship has an overhanging boom or a permanent obstruction on the stern, your                          flagstaff may be offset to starboard (preferably) from your ship’s centerline.                           Although another flag may appear higher (at the truck of the mast), no flag is                          ever flown above the national ensign on the same halyard. The national flag                          should be displayed:                           1.      At the gaff of a mast or pole having a gaff.                          2.      At the Stern Flagpost as an alternate to the Gaff.                          3.      At the masthead of a mast with no gaff.                          4.      At its own far starboard among multiple poles of equal height.                          5.      At the masthead of the highest pole if one of the poles is taller than the                          others.                           No other flag in lieu of the National Flag can be worn on either the gaff or the                          stern flagstaff.                           Personal flag masts:                          On a mast maintained at your home or business, fly your flags as follows:                           1.      on a mast with a gaff, fly your house flag (personal or corporate) at the trunk of the                          mast, with the national flag at the gaff.                          2.      on a mast without gaff, fly the national ensign at the trunk.                          3.      fly all other flags to which the display is entitled from yardarm halyards, if any, or                          below the national ensign if there’s no yardarm. In either case, fly the flags from                          starboard to port or top to bottom in their order of dignity.

Your ship should wear it from 0800 until sunset or when underway—day or                          night, weather and rig permitting.                           Please remember that the national ensign worn by a vessel must be the flag of                          the ships Country of registry (not necessarily the nationality of the owner or                          operator). Also, many commercial and military vessels do not fly any flags when at                          sea, out of sight of land or other vessels.                           Ashore, the Indian Flag may be displayed at night only when illuminated. It                          should not be flown at night aboard a vessel except when underway.

Your courtesy                          flag is not to be larger than the national flag.                           Never fly one country’s flag beneath another’s on the same mast. This is a sign of                          conquest and is something no sailor should ever do. If you display multiple                          foreign flags, arrange them from starboard to port in the alphabetical order of                          the countries’ names in the English language.

Captain Pawanexh Kohli                          If your vessel is mastless, it should wear this “courtesy flag” at the bow, or on a                          starboard antenna strong enough to support it. If your vessel has one or more                          masts, display it single-hoisted at the starboard outboard signal halyard of the                          main mast. Move any flag normally flown there to the inboard starboard                          halyard or, if your ship has only one halyard per side, to the port side halyard.                          Try to learn the correct procedure for the country you are entering. For example,                          in some countries it is customary to fly the courtesy flag only after the                          quarantine flag (see next page) has been                          secured. Do not fly a foreign courtesy flag                                                                                    THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE MUST BE                          after you have returned to Indian waters.

The national ensign is hoisted first - stern staff                                                                                or gaff.                          for having cruised to another country.                                                                                        2.

Other signals are then hoisted.                          When a foreign guest is aboard, you may                                                                               The 'drop' is done in reverse order of the above.                          display the flag of the guest’s country from the                          bow staff or outboard port spreader. Should                          more than one such guest flag be                          appropriate, wear them (on spreader halyards from port to starboard in the                          alphabetical order of their countries names in the English language.)                            OWNER’S / COMPANY PRIVATE FLAG                          This is a personal flag, often called house flag. On a mastless vessel, fly your                          private signal from the bow staff. A single-masted vessel may wear it at the truck                          of the mast (replacing any other signal normally worn at that point) or from a                          spreader halyard.                            QUARANTINE            FLA G                          The international code flag Q (Quebec) (a yellow rectangle)                          when flown alone is prescribed as a quarantine flag worn by a                          vessel requesting pratique (see Glossary).Fly it from the                          starboard halyard or spreader when you enter a foreign port                          or when you return to a Indian port from a foreign cruise.                          Traditionally, quarantine flags are not used for trips where                          Free Pratique had been issued in advance. After health                                                                                                           Captain Pawanexh Kohli

When in doubt,                          ask the inspecting official.                            RESTRICTED             ABILITY          MANEUVER                                            IN               TO                       DUE TO DIVING                          Whenever a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver due to underwater                          operations, such as diving, internationally recognized                          Navigation Rules provide that she may display                          International Code flag A (Alpha), a swallow tailed flag                          with the half nearest the hoist white and the outer half                          blue. The vessel thereby gains a special privilege under                          the Rules and may not be impeded by ordinary vessels                          not entitled to a higher class of privilege. This flag is                          only for vessels and is not carried on buoys, as is the                          Diver Down flag. At night, three vertically arranged, all-                          round lights red over white over red invoke the same privilege as the flag.                            SPEED     TRIA L FLA G S                          You may properly fly speed trial flags whenever your boat                          is undergoing speed trials, i.e., running a measured mile                          or participating in a predicted log contest. Use the two                          International Code flags S (Sierra) and M (Mike), in                          combination, hoisting them to a clearly visible position.                           When you are “swinging ship” to adjust your compass,                          you are reasonably close to the intended meaning of                          these flags and may wish to display them at that time.                           Flying these signals does not absolve you from                          complying with all of the Navigation Rules, or “Rules of                          the Road,” even if doing so disrupts your current                          activity.                           You may fly it only with the hope that approaching craft will voluntarily keep                          clear, but you must maintain a lookout and be ready to take any required action                          to avoid either (a) obstructing the passage of a vessel with a higher class of                          privilege, or (b) a collision.

As an aid to recovery,                          the International Code flag 0 is often flown from buoys to                          mark the location of an accident.                            GAG    FLA G S                          Even though yachting is no longer as formal as it once was, gag flags such as                                            those depicting martini glasses, bunnies,                                            battle   axes,    and      the   like   are unseamanlike and unbecoming to an                                            informed sailor. Don’t allow your boat to wear them!                            ALTERNATIVE         DISPLAY LOCATIONS                          Avoid flying more than one ensign from a single halyard or antenna. On the                          other hand, when the preferred positions for an organizational burgee or officer                          flag are not available, you may fly these from spreader halyards, with more than                          one on a hoist if necessary. In such instances however, you must observe the                          proper order of precedence. If you must multiple-hoist these flags, no more than                          one flag of the same type or stature may be flown from the same halyard. Each                          flag must be senior to the one below it, except that the officer-in-charge                          pennant may be placed above the officer flag when it is appropriate to do so.                          When neither the preferred location nor a spreader halyard is available, a radio                          antenna may be used.                           Never fly any other flag on the same halyard as — or on a halyard to starboard                          of a courtesy flag.                            SIZE   OF FLA G S                          Flags are often too small. When you purchase your flags, use the following                          guidelines, rounding up to the next larger commercially available size where                          necessary.                           The national flag flown at the flagstaff should be one inch on the fly for each                          foot of overall length of the vessel.                                                                                            Captain Pawanexh Kohli
Captain Pawanexh Kohli                          All other flags on power boats should be 1⁄2 inch on the fly for each foot of overall                          length. On sailboats, however, they should be 1⁄2 inch on the fly for each foot                          above the waterline of the tallest mast on the boat. (That is, if the top of the                          mast is 30 feet above the waterline, these other flags should be 15 inches on the                          fly.)                            ORDER                        COLORS                                     OF MAKING                          Typically neither the Indian flag, nor a courtesy flag, should be flown from                          sunset to 0800, except when underway. All other flags to which you are entitled                          may be displayed day and night. Colours are made at 0800 and at sunset, with                          the following exceptions: colours are raised after sunset and before 0800 when                          getting underway and lowered when securing alongside, or anchoring, after                          sunset and before 0800.                           When raising (making) your colors, the national flag is raised first, followed as                          applicable by a foreign ensign, organizational flags or private signal ,and then by                          any other signals not already flying, such as a guest flag. When lowering (also                          “making”) your colors (no later than sunset), the flags should be lowered in the                          reverse order of that in which they should be raised, as described above.                            FLAGS          HALF-MAST                                    AT                          The national flags are always at full hoist except when so announced by                          government authorities, who may direct that all national flags be flown at half-                          mast (sometimes called quot;half-staffquot;). The only other occasion the national ensign is                          half masted is when one vessel salutes another passing vessel. As a courtesy, foreign                          merchant vessels salute local Naval ships when in the territorial waters of another                          nation. The Naval ship returns the honor by lowering and raising their own ensign,                          after which your own national ensign is smartly returned to full hoist.                           When you fly your national flag at half-mast commencing at colours, hoist it                          smartly and fully to it’s normal position at the peak of the gaff or flagstaff, and                          then ceremoniously lower it to it’s half-staff position.                           When lowering the flag, first raise it ceremoniously to it’s full height and then                          lower it in the normal fashion. If the period of half-masting is to commence or                          end at a time other than when colours are made, lower or raise the flag                          ceremoniously from or to the full height position. All other flags on a vessel                          remain in their normal positions.

Captain Pawanexh Kohli                          At the stern of a vessel, or on a flagpole ashore, the half-mast position is                          approximately three-fourths the height of the truck. If the flagpole has a yardarm,                          the half-mast position is where the top of the flag is level with the yardarm.                            DISPLAYING         FLA GS ASHORE                          There are numerous methods for flying flags ashore, a simple flag pole, multiple                          simple flag poles, a flag pole (with gaff), a flag pole (with yardarm), and the                          preferred method, a flagpole (with gaff and yardarm). The latter provides the                          greatest number of points for display a minimum of four, more often six or eight                          through use of multiple halyards at the yards.                            OUTDOOR FLAGPOLE                ORIENTATIO N AND FLAG PO SITIO N S                          A mast should be installed as if it is the mast of a ship putting out to sea, i.e.,                          heading toward an intended viewer. That is, the gaff should point aft. If you stand                          at the base of the pole looking forward (toward the intended viewer), the                          extremities of the yardarm are termed port (on your left) and starboard (on your                          right), just as they would be on a vessel.                           When the pole is associated with a particular building, the gaff (if any) should                          extend from the pole in the general direction of the building. Thus, if you stand                          in or next to the building looking at the pole, think of yourself as looking forward                          on a ship; the starboard side of the pole is on your right as you face the flag-                          pole.                            INDOOR       FLAG DISPLAYS                          When displaying flags from staffs indoors, the flags should be at the head of the                          room or, if there is no head of the room, at the most logical arbitrary point in                          the room usually some distance from the room’s main entrance. In a meeting                          room with several flagstaffs of equal height, the point of honor for the Indian                          Flag is at its own right the viewer’s far left. Display foreign, state, or municipality                          flags at the left end of the dais or head table from the viewer’s vantage point,                          but to the viewer’s right of the national ensign. Organization flags should be on                          the opposite end of the dais, that is, on the viewer’s right.                            MISCELLANEOUS                          Always handle the Indian Flag with dignity. Don’t let it touch the deck, the ground                          outdoors, or the floor indoors. Always hoist it smartly and lower it ceremoniously.                                                                                               Captain Pawanexh Kohli
Captain Pawanexh Kohli                          DISPOSAL                          When your national flag is no longer serviceable or is tattered or faded, burn it                          in private with dignity. If you are unable to burn it safely it is okay to bury it                          with honors.                            DRESSING SHIP                          On special occasions such as Republic Day, Independence day, etc., yachts and                          boats that have a set of International Code Signaling Flags may dress their ship.                          The set consists of 40 flags representing letters, numbers, and other signals. A                          vessel is dressed only while not underway, although it may also be dressed for                          unique situations such as parades and the vessel’s maiden and final voyages.                              The flags of the Code set extend from the forward waterline over the bow to the                          masthead, then over the stern to the aft waterline. Since there are about twice                          as many letter flags as there are number pennants and other signals combined,                          the best practice is to follow a sequence of two flags and one                          pennant from stem to stern.                           The sequence of the code flags can be any order but the                          following is the long accepted 'recommended order' to give a                          harmonious color pattern.                           Starting from the waterline forward, to the masthead(s), and to                          the water line aft . . .
