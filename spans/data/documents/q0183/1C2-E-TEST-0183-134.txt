These are the only two recent one's I could find:
September 17, 2008 This is to advise you that Governor Martin O’Malley has ordered the United States Flag and Maryland State Flags flown at half staff on Wednesday, September 17, 2008 from sunrise to sunset. This is in memory of Marine Capt. Jesse Melton, III, of Randallstown, Maryland, who died on September 9, 2008 while supporting combat operations in Parwan Province, Afghanistan.
September 11, 2008 This is to advise you that the United States Flag and Maryland State Flag are to be flown at half staff on Thursday, September 11, 2008, from sunrise to sunset. President George W. Bush has proclaimed September 11, 2008 as Patriot Day and has called upon the states to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, as well as flying the flag at half staff.
In honor and memory of the lives lost on September 11, 2001, and to mark the seventh anniversary of the tragic day, Governor Martin O’Malley has ordered the United States Flag and Maryland State Flag to be flown at half staff on the above date.
