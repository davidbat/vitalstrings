In honor of the late Dr. Norman E. Borlaug?
Perry Orders Flags Lowered
Borlaug, Nobel laureate and distinguished professor of international agriculture at Texas A&M University, died Sept. 12 in Dallas at age 95.
(Media-Newswire.com) - Gov. Rick Perry has ordered the lowering of Texas flags to half-staff throughout the state Tuesday ( Oct. 6 ) in honor of the late Dr. Norman E. Borlaug.
Borlaug, Nobel laureate and distinguished professor of international agriculture at Texas A&M University, died Sept. 12 in Dallas at age 95.
A public memorial will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesday in Rudder Auditorium on the Texas A&M campus.
In making the announcement, Gov. Perry stated that "the world has lost a dedicated researcher and scientist with the passing of Dr. Borlaug, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
“Dr. Borlaug was widely acclaimed as the founder of the Green Revolution in agriculture and a leading expert in the effort to relieve world hunger. As a mark of respect for this widely-regarded researcher and professor, it seems fitting that flags in Texas be lowered to half-staff,” he added.
Dr. Borlaug's career was dedicated to using science to combat world hunger. He received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for developing high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat, which was credited for ending famine in developing countries.
Texas A&M has established a website at http://borlaug.tamu.edu with information about Dr. Borlaug, a portal for writing condolences online and other information about the services.
“The First Lady and I extend our prayers of comfort to his family in their time of grief, and urge all Texans to remember and honor his life of research and humanitarian service to our state, nation and the world,” the governor said.
