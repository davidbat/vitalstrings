Question ID: 36255
Some days I notice that buildings that fly the American Flag have it at half mast. Usually the local news gives me the reason for that particular day, but often I am left in the dark. Being a naturally curious person it drives me nuts to not know why. Is there a site online that is updated daily with (for lack of a better term) "Flag Status" and if it is to be flown at half-mast, the reason? Also, I do know that it can also be a very local or regional decision and not just a national one. If possible, isolate the reference to California.

What a truly interesting question!  Thanks for asking.  The short answer is: Flying the flag at half-staff is governed by United States law.  The general rule is that flags will be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day (until noon, when it should be raised to the top of the staff), and on Peace Officers Memorial Day.  The Statute (4 U.S.C. 7(m)) sets forth the requirement that the flag will be flown at half-staff on the following occasions:  30 days from the death of the President or a former President;  10 days from the day of death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives;  from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession;  and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.  The President of the United States may order the honor:  upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory;  In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law.  STATE GOVERNORS also have authority under the United States Code: In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State . . . the Governor of that State . . .may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff. http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/7.html The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. See id. But there is a lot of license taken with the decision to fly the flag at half-staff. For example, the Modesto City Council has authorized its mayor to make the decision in certain cases where a prominent local citizen has passed away: http://www.modestogov.com/cmo/releases/2002/nr02079.htm Witnessing the Modesto ordinance, it appears clear that although United States law (the supreme law of the land) sets forth the authority to order the flag lowered, and appears to limit that authority to the President and the governors, anyone with a flag pole may have been known to make their own decisions. I was curious too as to whether there was a central clearing house for instructions on when to fly the flag at half-staff in California. I have called the State Library who referred me to the California National Guard who, as far as the Library is concerned, is the point of dissemination on flag protocol. I talked to a master sergeant in the Adjutant Generals office, who was also intrigued with this question, knew there was someone somewhere who did it. She promised to call me back and I will post a Clarification when I hear from her. Incidentally, the Veterans Administration web site has a handy condensation of guidelines: http://www.va.gov/pubaff/celebAm/halfstaf.htm This site contains a list of when the flag should be flown: http://www.americanflagstore.com/etiquette/etiquette.htm NEW YEAR'S DAY..............January 1 MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY......Third Monday in January INAUGURATION DAY............January 20 (every 4 years) LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY..........February 12 PRESIDENT'S DAY.............Third Monday in February WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY.......February 22 EASTER SUNDAY...............Variable ARMY DAY....................April 6 V-E DAY.....................May 8 MOTHER'S DAY................Second Sunday in May ARMED FORCES DAY............Third Sunday in May MEMORIAL DAY................Last Monday in May FLAG DAY....................June 14 FATHER'S DAY................Third Sunday in June INDEPENDENCE DAY............July 4 LABOR DAY...................First Monday in September V-J DAY.....................September 2 CONSTITUTION DAY............September 17 COLUMBUS DAY................Second Monday in October NAVY DAY................... October 27 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DAY...First Tuesday after first Monday in November VETERAN'S DAY...............November 11 THANKSGIVING DAY............Fourth Thursday in November PEARL HARBOR DAY........... December 7 CHRISTMAS DAY...............December 25  If I can help with anything else, please feel free to ask for clarification.
