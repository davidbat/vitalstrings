The proper protocol for flying the American Flag on Memorial Day slightly differs from other occasions when flags are flown at half-staff.
On Memorial Day, flags are flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon only, and then raised quickly to full-staff.
Protocol for Flags Mounted on Homes
For flags that cannot be lowered, such as those mounted on homes , the American Legion says an acceptable alternative is to attach a black ribbon or streamer to the top of the flag pole, directly beneath the ornament at the end of the pole. The ribbon or streamer should be the same width as a stripe on the flag and the same length as the flag.
