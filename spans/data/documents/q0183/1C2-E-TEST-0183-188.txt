Why is the Flag Flying at   Half-Staff Today?
GOVERNOR    CUOMO DIRECTS FLAGS TO HALF-STAFF
 
Governor Andrew M.    Cuomo has directed that flags on state government buildings be flown at    half-staff on Wednesday, June 27 in honor of a New York soldier who died    in Afghanistan on June 22.
Major Paul C. Voelke died in Mazar E. Sharif while supporting Operation    Enduring Freedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry    Regiment, 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, based at    Fort Stewart, Georgia. Major Voelke was from the Town of Monroe.
"I join with all New Yorkers in mourning the loss of Major Voelke and I    send my deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and fellow soldiers," Governor Cuomo said. "We will be forever grateful for his service and    his dedication to our nation."
Governor Cuomo has directed that the flags on all state buildings be    lowered to half-staff in honor of and in tribute to our state's service    members and those stationed in New York who are killed in action or die    in a combat zone.
