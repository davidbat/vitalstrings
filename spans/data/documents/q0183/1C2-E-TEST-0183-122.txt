Chappaquiddick.
i wondered who "cast the first stone"---speaking ill of the dead can come back to haunt one--especially if one does happen to live in a glass house---and --dont we ALL!?  Did he do that?----------
yep and drinking and partying and immaturity in his youth---and who learned from his mistakes
and  rose above it all to remarry a wonderful woman and went on to sponser to almost every major piece of social legislation for the past 40 years and over 15000 votes cast in the US Senate making him with a record that means he has accomplished more politically then ANY president in the last half century with friends on BOTH side of the great divide that is now rampant in Washington. This man WILL be missed.
Except by the Kopechne family.  It was a bit more than just a "youthful mistake".
