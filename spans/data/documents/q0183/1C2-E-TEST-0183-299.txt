McDonald's Raises American Flag to Full Height After Complaint
Apr. 29--Nancy King loves McDonald's, but when she saw a restaurant in Gurnee flying the U.S. flag at half-staff last week in honor of the company's late chief executive, she had to serve up a civics lesson.
After the Air Force veteran from Antioch and others complained, the fast-food giant quickly admitted its mistake in flag etiquette and asked its restaurant operators to raise the Stars and Stripes to full height.
"I got to work and said, 'I just can't let this go,'" said King, who knew that only the president or a governor can order the flag lowered to half-staff and that it's normally done only for government officials or dignitaries. "I just wanted to bring it to their attention that this was not a right thing to do."
