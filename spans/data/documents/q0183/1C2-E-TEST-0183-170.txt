ADDED COMMENT:   Dorothy Height was and remains a totally awesome person in American history.  Honoring her w federal flags at half mast was in April of 2010 shortly after her passing http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-offi… (this if fr the archives of the prez proclamations).  One of the geeky things I enjoy is reading the daily presidential proclamations & trying to remember the few that order the lowering of the stars & bars to half-wave (for some reason my husband often says "you're such a dork"---really, I don't see it) <3
You were getting warm w your Korean War connection.  Today was proclaimed National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day (as it is every July 27th).  Flag at half-mast from sun-up to sun-down.
The National Park Service will always have this kind of notification in their morning brief http://www.nps.gov/applications/morningr…
There's another site that can give you state-by-state info on daily flag flying: http://flagnotify.com/
Who'da thunk?
