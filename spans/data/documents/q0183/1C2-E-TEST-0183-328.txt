(SALEM) - Governor Kulongoski has ordered all flags at public institutions to be flown at half-staff on Thursday, in memory of 22-year-old Army Specialist Robert L. Jones, of Milwaukie, Oregon.  Specialist Jones was assigned to the Army's 40th Engineer Battalion of Baumholder, Germany. He was killed on June 17, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Ar Ramadi, Iraq. This was the second tour of duty in Iraq for Specialist Jones.  "The loss of this young leader is a tragedy for Oregon," said Governor Kulongoski. "Jones was a very brave soldier and we feel tremendous gratitude for his dedication and sacrifices he and his family have made to keep us safe.   I ask everyone in our state to help Specialist Jones' family through this tragedy by keeping them in their thoughts and prayers. I also ask everyone to honor his service by keeping in their prayers all of the men and women now risking their lives to serve our nation."
