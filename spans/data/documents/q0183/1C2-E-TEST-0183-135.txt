Because funeral homes are non-governmental entities, they may fly the flag of the United States at half-staff at any time.
The flag code of the United States requires only agencies of the federal government to lower their flags upon the procamation of the president. States have similar codes requiring state offices to lower their flags only at their governors' orders.
But no private individuals, organizations or businesses are subject to these codes; they may fly their flags at half-staff-or refuse to do so--for any reason, at any time they wish.
