Flags at half-staff today
( Note: if you are looking for why the flags are lowered July 1st in Wisconsin, click here .)
The post below is from 4/29/2010.
If you’re wondering why the flags were ordered to half-staff today, it’s in honor of civil rights leader Dr. Dorothy Height . Eugene Kane wrote about her on April 20th for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The Los Angeles Times obituary is here .
Update: I just noticed this order from the governor for Friday :
WHEREAS, on April 25, 2010, Vilas County Deputy Sheriff Kory Dahlvig died as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty; and
WHEREAS, Deputy Sheriff Kory Dahlvig served the people of Vilas County and the people of Wisconsin with distinction and honor; and
WHEREAS, the people of Wisconsin mourn the death of Deputy Sheriff Kory Dahlvig;
WHEREAS, a memorial service will be held for Deputy Sheriff Kory Dahlvig on Friday, April 30, 2010; and
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIM DOYLE, Governor of the State of Wisconsin, by the authority vested in me by Federal and State law, do hereby order that the flag of the United States and the flag of the State of Wisconsin shall be flown at half-staff at all buildings, grounds and military installations of the State of Wisconsin equipped with such flags beginning at sunrise on Friday, April 30, 2010, and ending at sundown on that date.
