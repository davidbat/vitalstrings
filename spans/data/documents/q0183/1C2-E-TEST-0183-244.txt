Topeka  Following a presidential proclamation, Gov. Mark Parkinson has directed flags be flown at half-staff across Kansas to honor the late Sen. Robert Byrd.
The West Virginia Democrat died Monday at age 92 after serving 51 years in the U.S. Senate.
Flags will be flown at half-staff until sunset July 6, the day of Byrd's funeral.
The only exception is July 4, when President Barack Obama ordered the flags to be flown at full-staff to honor Byrd and mark the Independence Day holiday.
Parkinson says he had some interactions with Byrd over the years and remembers the senator for his knowledge and willingness to discuss issues at length.
