PAIGE BARBUSH, The Patriot-NewsThe American flag flies at half-staff at the Pennsylvania Capitol to honor the late Lt. Gov. Catherine Baker Knoll.
American and state flags are flying at half-staff at all state facilities, local government offices and other public buildings in honor of Lt. Gov. Catherine Baker Knoll.
Knoll, 72, died Nov. 12 after a long battle with cancer. She was the first woman elected a Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor.
Knoll will lie in repose in the Capitol Rotunda from noon Friday to 2 p.m. Saturday before her body is returned to Pittsburgh, where she will lie in repose at St. Paul's Cathedral.   A public funeral Mass will be held at noon Nov. 25 at St. Paul's followed by a private burial.
On Nov. 13, Gov. Edward G. Rendell ordered all U.S. and Pennsylvania flags throughout the state to be flown at half-staff.  Under the governor's order, flags are to remain at half-staff until Knoll's interment. By custom, local governments honor the governor's order.
The U.S. Flag Code, which stipulates how and when the American flag is to be flown, authorizes the governor of a state, territory, or possession of the United States to order all U.S. and state flags in their jurisdiction flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for a present or former state official or resident who had died.
The governor also may proclaim that flags be flown at half-staff for the death of a state resident who is on active duty with the U.S. military or for any other special days the governor may deem appropriate.
The U. S. Flag Code was adopted on Flag Day, June 14, 1923.  Before then, there were no federal or state regulations governing display of the flag.
