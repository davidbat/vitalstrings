FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) - The flag over Fort Wayne's Law Enforcement and Firefighter's Monument flew at half-staff Friday as a tribute to Indianapolis police officer David Moore.
Moore was shot several times Sunday.  Doctors took him off life support Wednesday.
Officials haven't dedicated the Fort Wayne memorial yet, but the board of directors decided to recognize the rash of law enforcement fatalities, and fly the flag now.
It will remain in place until Officer Moore is burried on Tuesday.
Governor Mitch Daniels also directed that flags in Marion County be lowered to half-staff on Tuesday, February 1 in honor of Officer Moore.
