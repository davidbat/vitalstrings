Interview with Lauren Hart
Traditions - JROTC
On Friday, November 18th, 2005, SGT Henry Gantt and his JROTC Cadets from Lenape High School visited us. Our students took turns asking prepared questions and the cadets answered them all. They also demonstrated flag folding, and gave our students a chance to practice this.
The cadets included:
Battalion Commander LTC Andrew Morgan
Battalion S-3 CPT Elezar Kenig
Battalion S-1 MAJ Riyanka Pai
Battalion S-4 CPT Mike Newman
Company Commander CPT Eron Kranz
Platoon Leader  2LT Andrew Doyle
Questions and Answers
What is JROTC?
The Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps is a program to help young people become better citizens and to introduce them to military life. JROTC cadets who decide to enter the military later will start with a higher rank. JROTC cadets wear a uniform one day each week They sometimes get teased by other students at high school.
Some student cadets go to Basic Training between junior and senior years of High School. Then they graduate from High School and go into the Army. They attend summer training with other JROTC cadets from all over the USA and England.
What is flag etiquette (manners)?
"Respect" in one word. Don't let the flag hit the ground (the flag gives pride to the rest of the troops).
Can you fix or sew a ripped flag?  Is that allowed?
Except on the battlefield, no - get a new one. Take the ripped flag to a disposal site - a local Veterans of Foreign Wars group, for example, where they will ceremonially destroy it (by burning).
Do you throw old flags in the trash?
No.  They are ceremonially destroyed (burned) at the VFW, or at Fort Dix, etc.
Are you allowed to burn the flag if it is old?
No.  Take it to the proper place Â– a local American Legion Hall, VFW, etc.
Can you wash the flag or clean it at the cleaners?
No. Do not wash it or clean it. Take good care of it, then when it's not perfect, dispose of it correctly.
When do you fly the flag at half mast?
Some examples would be a President's death or a tragedy such as September 11th . Flying the flag at half mast shows respect for people who died. The President decides when the flag should be flown this way.
Are there rules about handling the flag?
Yes, there are thirteen rules total. But the Number One Rule is don't let the flag hit the ground. If a flag starts to go down, troops or cadets will jump to get it before it touches the ground. When a flag goes down in battle, nearby soldiers will immediately rush to pick it up.
Another rule is that when the flag is hung, the part called the "union" (the blue part with the stars) should always be on your left as you face the flag.
Don't hold the flag upsidedown. Don't drape the flag over anything. Don't cover holes with it.
Why would the flag ever be flown upside down?
That is a sign of distress and emergency.
Can you make things out of the flag?
Never.
Can you wrap things in the flag?
No.
Will we have a flag with more than 50 stars someday?
Could be.  Maybe if Puerto Rico becomes a state.
How do you fly the flag at night?
Shine a light on the flag. Never fly it in darkness. If you don't have a light, then take it down and fold it before dark.
How do you fold the flag?
(The JROTC cadets demonstrated this several times, then guided students in folding the flag. If you would like to see an animation of how to fold the US Flag, click here .).
When the flag is folded, it is folded into a triangle. You should only see the blue and stars - no red or white showing.
When the flag is over a casket, the union (blue part) should be over the person's left side. It is taken off the casket and folded. If there is a 21 gun salute fired, then the shells are put into a bag and then placed inside the folded flag. The flag is given to the family of the person who died.
Who flies the flag?
Any government paid place - federal, state, county and local (towns and cities) all fly the flag. And anyone else who wants to can fly it.
