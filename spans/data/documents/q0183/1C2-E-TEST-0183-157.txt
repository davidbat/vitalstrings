Christchurch from the Port Hills
Flags will fly at half-mast on Government buildings on February 22 to commemorate victims of the Christchurch earthquake.
Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said today Prime Minister John Key, Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae and their wives would attend the memorial services at Latimer Square and North Hagley Park.
"Their attendance shows that these are commemorative events not only for our community, but also for the people of New Zealand, who will be with us in spirit on the day," Parker said.
Parker said Key had requested that the New Zealand flag fly at half-mast on all Government and public buildings on February 22.
"This is a tremendous sign of respect not only for those lost, but for those left behind who will find the first anniversary a difficult time," Parker said.
"This is a day of remembrance for the whole nation."
