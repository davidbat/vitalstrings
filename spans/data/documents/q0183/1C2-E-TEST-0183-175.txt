TRENTON â€” Flags at all New Jersey state buildings will be flown at half-staff Tuesday in recognition of a fallen soldier with ties to the Garden State .
Army Sgt. Michael Scusa, a former Lower Township resident and a Lower Cape May Regional High School graduate, was among eight soldiers killed Oct. 3 in an attack in Afghanistan. His death came as hundreds of insurgents armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked two U.S. outposts.

The flag directive was made in an executive order issued by Gov. Jon Corzine.
"Sergeant Scusa's patriotism and dedicated service to his country and his fellow soldiers make it appropriate and fitting for the State of New Jersey to remember him and his family, to mark his passing and to honor his memory," Corzine said.
Scusa, who was 22, is survived by his wife and 1-year-old son. His unit was based at Fort Carson in Colorado.
