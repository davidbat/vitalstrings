This may not be National. Governors can order all flags in a given state to half mast too!? I do not know who died but anyone a Governor wishes to honor upon death can be a reason! I did not see any news or messages come by in regards to the death  of a past Admiral  or General today!?
Nothing in the DOD directive!

Edit: Looking at news I see orders for half mast in the following:
