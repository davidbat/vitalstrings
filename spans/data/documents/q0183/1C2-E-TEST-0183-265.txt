JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- All state offices in Missouri were ordered to fly flags at half-staff Friday and Saturday to honor former Negro leagues star Buck O'Neil.
"Buck O'Neil was an outstanding baseball player and remarkable Missourian," Gov. Matt Blunt said Tuesday in announcing the decision. "He was a tremendous citizen who also was a great role model for young Missourians. He will be missed."
O'Neil died Friday of congestive heart failure and complications of bone marrow cancer at 94. He was a player and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs, the first black coach in the major leagues and a well-known promoter of the Negro Leagues in his later years.
On Friday, O'Neil will lie in repose at the Negro League Baseball Museum in Kansas City. After a private funeral and burial Saturday, a public memorial will be held at Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium.
