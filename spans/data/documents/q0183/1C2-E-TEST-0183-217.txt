Flag Code
This page was established to identify periods when the United States flags should be flown at half staff.
This page is also dedicated to all those who have served our country past, present and future and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice at any time especially since the Operation Enduring Freedom and the Iraq War are still going on.
There are a few means in which the flag is ordered to be flown at half staff.  First a Federal    proclamation by the President of the United States or pre-established Federal law or mandate and lastly by order of the    Governor in a state for that state.
Unfortunately, I am no longer tracking on the site the state orders.  However - you can still sign up for email notifications and if I get notice from that state I will forward the information to you.
There is no Presidential Proclamation that I am aware of at this time to fly the    flag at half staff -     so, Display National Flag at full staff
"Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it." - Mark Twain
How do I display the flag at half mast?
The flag should first be raised to the peak of the pole, held there for an instant, then lowered to the half staff position. At the end of the day, the flag should again be raised to the peak before being lowered.
Should I fly my flag at half-mast today?
See above or for more information see Section 7-M of the US Flag Code.
Can my company decide to fly our flag at half-mast for a former employee?
No. Only the President or your state governor can order the flag lowered to half-staff.  Although the company flag can be lowered to honor those individuals.
I want to Thank my Dad for all his help with this.  He is my inspiration for doing this.  - Love you Dad!!
