Gov. Gregoire orders flags flown at half-staff Tuesday, March 2
For Immediate Release: March 1, 2010
OLYMPIA â€“ Gov. Chris Gregoire has directed that flags at all Washington state agency buildings be lowered to half-staff Tuesday, March 2, in memory of Specialist William C. Spencer of Tacoma. Spencer died last week while serving in Iraq.
Flags should remain at half-staff until close of business Tuesday, or first thing Wednesday morning, March 3.
Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to give governors the authority to lower flags when a state resident in the military is killed in the line of duty. Other government entities, citizens and businesses are encouraged to join in this recognition.
