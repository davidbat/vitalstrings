The governor cited the late Massachusetts senator's effective leadership in support of historic legislation on health care, civil rights, education and immigration.
He also noted Kennedy's "many quiet deeds of humanity that have made him beloved to so many New Jerseyans: rich, poor, old, and young."
Kennedy, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in May 2008, died Tuesday at his home on Cape Cod. He was 77.
