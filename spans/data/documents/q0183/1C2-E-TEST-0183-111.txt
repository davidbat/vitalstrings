Governor Chris Gregoire has directed that flags at all Washington State agency facilities be lowered to half-staff on Friday, February 8, 2008, in memory of U. S. Army Sergeant James E. Craig who was killed in action in Mosul, Iraq on January 28.
A memorial service for Sgt. Craig will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 9 at Fourth Memorial Church, 2000 N. Standard Street, Spokane.
Flags should remain at half-staff until sundown Friday or first thing Monday morning, February 11, 2008.
Other government entities, citizens and businesses are encouraged to join this recognition.
No point in  looking to the news, the Governor has the power to order flags lowered for any reason, as does each county and city government.
