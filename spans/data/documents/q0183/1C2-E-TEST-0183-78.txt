In response to a letter to the editor in which a reader asked why Wilson Borough did not mark the passing of police department secretary Wanda Karp with flags flown at half-staff , community user iwonyoulose says:
"Flying a flag at half mast should be and is reserved for those as a show of respect for contributions made to the country, not one town. I am sorry to hear about Wanda's death, but being a loyal, well-liked employee does not give you the honor of a flag at half-mast. If that was the case then there would be flags flown at half-mast everyday in the US. Being in the field of law enforcement, I would not expect to half a flag lowered if I ever died in the line of duty."
In today's featured news comment, reader nannyof6 makes a case for conditions that might fall outside of reader iwonyoulose's examples:
"iwonyoulose, yes I guess I would happen to agree with you, but I have seen our local flags flown at half staff after a former mayor, fireman, policeman that have not been employed by these boroughs and cities for years being flown half staff for their years of service. All that Susan was asking was that this borough do the same for one of their own. She was serving our community just as a fellow policeman or fireman, maybe not as important, but she was very well-known to all departments.
Also, I would like to know why Michael Jackson got this honor when all he was was a singer and performer. People made such a BIG deal over his death not saying they shouldn't, but he was not a serviceman or importan official. I liked Michael and it was sad when he passed, but he got this recognition in some states and cities."
Do you think that it should be up to the municipality as to whether flags are flown half-staff to honor local law enforcement personnel?
