Flag half-staff notification
Hi Jay,
Thanks for you question about getting a notification of orders on flying the flag at half staff.
We currently have our programmer looking into this. So many people are interested in flying the US Flag properly that it would make sense to have a central database here that would let you know when you should fly your flag at half staff.
Please check back with us in a few weeks for an update.

Flag half-staff notification
Has the administrator posted a solution to Jays question concerning notifying this forum (or the general public) on when to fly Old Glory at half-staff?

I was curious about this as well.  My co-workers and I were trying to find when we are supposed to fly the flag at half-staff and came across your site.  I would love to be notified by email if and when the flag should be at half-staff.  Has anyone found a solution to this?
