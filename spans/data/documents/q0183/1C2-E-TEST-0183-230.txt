Arlington is wrong, I saw a picture of the USS Arizona Memorial with the flag at half-staff,
so that's wrong. The Betsy Ross House web site says the flag is flown at half-staff. Someone
else can find a source about the Alamo and Iwo Jima, but I think the flags there are flown at
half-staff as well.

This website has many places listed .. including The White House,Arlington Cemetary and The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (all not lowered as they are already there to commemorate the dead)Another flag is the one at The Alamo which is nailed on and therefore never lowered to half staff.
