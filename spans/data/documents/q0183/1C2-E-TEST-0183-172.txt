He lived life struggling all his life for something 50 years ahrad of himself. If all people who struggle for creating something for peace rather than creating destructive ideas and and attain power for destruction of others and snatching resources of others to make them poor. ALL praise to Steave Jobs. People must follow his creativity and promote peace on the Planet Earth. May Almighty help us create an example like him.
