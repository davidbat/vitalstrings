In  response to inquiries we have received, the Office of the Secretary of State  would like to explain the recent implementation of Public Law 110-41 . This  federal law authorizes the Governor of a State to order that the U.S. flag be  flown at half staff in the event of the death of a member of the Armed Forces  from that State who dies while serving on active duty. To further honor the  sacrifice of this individual, Governor O'Malley has ordered both the United  States Flag and the Maryland State Flag flown at half staff.
