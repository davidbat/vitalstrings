Why not fly flags at half mast for SEAL Team 6?
I believe that as a community, and as a country, we should pay tribute and honor the Thirty Americans, (22 of them SEALs) killed this past week. We should fly all flags at half mast, especially the flag in front of Town Hall. Does anyone know are the flags in Washington at half mast? What about the White House? The Pentagon?
Not for nothing but a Navy Seal is special, and it strikes me as wrong to transport so many in a cumbersome circa 1960's Chinook for any mission. From what I understand we have other better helicopters  that are smooth and more stealth-like. Chinooks are big, noisy, large, slow and "easy" targets.
It is troublesome to know that our elite troops, (from the very same unit credited with killing Osama bin Laden), were killed by a single RPG launched by an enemy combatant. I have to believe and have faith that some smart guy out there can tell me who is responsible for putting our elite troops all in one big bus-like vehicle. That was an egregious error. Action must be taken to insure that nothing like that ever happens again.  We lost some of the best of the best and it saddens me that more of an effort hasn't been made to honor those lost.

Its a terrible loss without question.  But we don't fly our flags at half mast on behalf of the 1000's of other less "elite" troops that have been killed almost daily for the past several years.  The Seals are extraordinary, but their deaths do not deserve special recognition above other soldiers.
