Notice how the requirement level for being labelled  a “crank” gets lower every day? EXTREMELY disturbing trend. 10 years ago it was believing in alien cover-ups and stuff like that, now merely having a loud and somewhat “divergent” opinion on a celebrity death (and indeed the death of a celebrity who hadn’t done anything noteworthy other than engage in self-destruction for like 10 years or more) is enough for this site to  label Bill O’Reilly “crank”. Not merely having a different take. No, a “crank”. You little quasi-Stalinist pukes are disgusting.
If the insane gay media’s hysterical emotional control freakery continues at this rate, by 2014 we’ll have people who dared to disagree with a HuffPo columnist on whether a musician’s performance at an awards ceremony was “bad” or not, being summoned to congressional hearings by Media Matters (which will by then have been renamed The Ministry of Truth and have been given powers by Obama or Romney to fine people and companies and close their internet commenting accounts or whatever).

How can you agree with such an atrocity? Flying flags at half-mast is an HONOR that was SUPPOSED to be reserved for VETERANS, not CRACKED OUT has beens. Shame on you and shame on the NJ gov. IMPEACH, IMPEACH, IMPEACH!

Giving the high level of corruption in politicians dignitaries ambassadors and media made Camelots that had flags flown half staff in tribute Houston actually made a positive difference as well as bad personnel choices that only did herself harm not the country. Not many beyond the military hero who had the flag flown in there honor really deserved the tribute.

As the child of two members of the military (Dad – USMC and Mom – USN) and the older sister of a Marine about to go into combat, this story is so disgusting. One of my brother’s friends was killed in action last November; even though he was from Chicago, the state of California lowered the flags for him because he had been stationed there. He fought and was killed. He deserved that honor.
Shame on Gov. Christe for giving such an honor to a drug addict who didn’t contribute to the world. Soledad O’Brien, that Twitter comment was right on the point – she’s a dead junkie. How dare you all honor her in the same fashion that fallen military members are honored. How dare you defend this disgusting decision. She did nothing to earn it.
She had a great voice in the 80′s and early 90′s, but then she screwed it all up by getting into drugs. Don’t sit here and say that she “contributed” to society. How? By showing people how messed up she was? Did anyone watch that tv show? And now those actions are getting her the same honor as fallen Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines. Get some perspective and appologize to the members of the military and their families who are rightfully offended by this.

Mr Christie .. let me give you an example to show you how ludicrous your rationale for lowering flags for Whitney is.. You will be able to find many people who felt Gerry Sandusky did a great job as a football coach , many who feel his 2nd Chance did great work for kids. Now that we know the true nature of the man should he be given that same honour based on the good work he did. BTW many think Pedophilia is a disease too.. I believe both drugs and pedophilia are choices .. Whitney cared more for her drugs, than for  her daughter, and now she has left her with only 1 parent, who just happens to be the worst thing that ever happened to Whitney. She deserves no honouring at all.

The prism of anger and hatred distorts one’s point of view.
Showing sympathy for Houston does not diminish the sacrifice of those who serve.
It’s NJ’s call and it beats being callous.

>> QUOTE: “(Soledad) O’Brien displayed some of the tweets that Christie has had to contend with, including one from Danielle Olivieri that said “She’s not a fallen hero. I am not alone in taking offense to this. She’s no role model. She’s a dead junkie.”  O’Brien didn’t seem prepared for the viciousness of that tweet, immediately adding “Totally inappropriate.”
Just another example of WHY Soledad herself is brain dead.
What the hell was she EXPECTING the reaction of people to be?
Because — TRUTH be told — Houston IS a dead junkie, no question about it.
Which is also why — TRUTH be told again — we’re now being treated to yet another talking head dope (like Soledad) showing once again just how out of touch those IN the media are with the “average” person out there.
Look, if you’re a music fan who enjoyed her songs or albums…or enjoyed watching her in a movie like the “The Bodyguard” with Kevin Costner…hey, good for you. Because in the digital age that we live in, good news for you. You can always revisit those songs or that movie.
But sorry — people like Soledad can KISS MY ASS with this usual blathering, sloppy wet French tongue butt-kissing BULLSH*T that takes place whenever a celebrity dies, where everyone wants to now completely REWRITE HISTORY.
Personally, as a kid, I was taught to “not speak ill of the dead” — which is why I basically haven’t ranted about Houston’s death to date. Frankly, I think Greg Gutfeld said it BEST yesterday on “The 5″ when he noted that those singing praises for Houston right now must live in some sort of ideal world, where nothing is wrong AT ALL in their own personal REAL LIVES, since they now are feeling soooooo darn much for a person that they never actually met or ever personally knew.
But that’s okay — she was a star and people liked her. She had her moment in time. Hey, back in my early teen years, I thought she looked totally adorable bopping around in the video for “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” too. But that DOESN’T change the cold…hard…fact…that Houston threw it all away. That she wasted MILLIONS of dollars on drugs…that she TRASHED her God-given voice…and yet for all of the BAD choices that she CONSCIOUSLY made…every step of the way…suddenly now utter dopes like Soledad want to say it’s “totally inappropriate” to point out the cold…hard…fact that Houston died as — sorry, but she did — a junkie.
As for lowering the flags, if Christie feels she’s enough of a New Jersey-er to warrant such a thing, that’s his business. Personally, I think it’s LAUGHABLE given that Houston’s fame was LONG since passed — I mean, come one!  Till she died were you REALLY missing her or even thinking of her? Plus, I think it’s LAUGHABLE that he’s claiming they lower the flag to half mast for ALL fallen soldiers as well.
REALLY? Because if that were ACTUALLY true, then I’d like to see a listing of the DAYS the flag was lowered…or given the URL for a web site that I can visit…where you can show me that EVERY fallen NJ soldier got THEIR proper day of remembrance TOO.
(Crickets chirping)
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
Nice attempt at BULLSH*TTING your way out of this, Christie.
I expect TV morons like Soledad O’Brien to be complete clueless clods.
But as an actual Governor I like you, though sadly you made a bad, bad call on this one…

Sympathy OK, flags half staff? Over the top.

I’m surprised Christie does not order the flag half staff whenever a Dunkin Donuts closes. Houston was a washed up drug addict who never wrote any of her songs, did not play a musical instrument, and did not participate or help any local charities. This governor is a disgrace and will obviously never be elected to public office again. Ask any active solider or vet what they think of this weeble-wobble, especially in Jersey.

She had a very slight career given her talent.  We were in Honolulu in ’96 and she played one of the big concert halls.  We did not catch it of course, but what I remember is that all night long her caravan of three stretch limos cruised up and down the strip, no doubt full of hangers-on while she was back at her hotel room.

Contrast Whitney with Tina Turner.  Whitney had more talent.  Tina more drive.  Whitney was a goddess (for a few years, anyway).  Tina had (and still has) great legs.  Whitney made a crappy movie with Kevin Costner.  Tina put out a dozen big radio hits that she wrote herself.  If I am lucky enough to be above ground when Tina passes, I’ll feel a certain loss.  With Whitney, I felt sorry for her.

 No he did not.  So you choose a character from a movie, Great Movie at that, and then choose to label the entire Military as something less than what the whole is and always has been,  People, for what ever reason, willing to go, willing to do, willing at times to die so people like Houston can do as they please in a freedom found no place else on earth.  Give Houston her due,  but her due is never on par,  never to be given the same honor as dieing for ones country.  Our Fallen Soldiers get little in this world,  many died making less than a 100.00 a month.  Houston made millions and chose to slowly kill herself.  Cristie is free to fly the flag of NJ if he likes, but I will never agree Houston deserves the American Flag to be half-staffed for her death.

 No she did not.  She died from excess indulging in substances that she and everyone else knows is never going to make you live LONGER.   You people choose to call it a disease if you like, but you only succeed in making excuses for those who need that little extra to feel good, and then whine how they are now victims of your new found disease.   You do them no favor friend.   By the way, Cancer is what it is,  yes some people do things to bring it on by choice Most do not.  Please do not equate dying from choosing to over indulge in a known fatal lifesyle to dying from Cancer.   That would be a new low in what we can now call socialized dying.  Level dying field,  I personally do not give a rats what rich spoiled over indulged fools from the entertainment community do to themselves but I seriously detest they be given the same honor when that lifestyle kills them, as we give to the death of an American Soldier dying to preserve our fast dying freedoms.

 So are you suggesting we fly the Flag at half-staffed for everyone who dies from some illness?   If you read what I said, I did not denigrate Houston, I simply state her death is not on par with that of the death of a Soldier dying in service for his Country.  My Sister died of Cancer,  do you suppose asking the state to fly the American Flag at half-staffed would have been proper for her?  I sure as hell dont.   I spent 23 years in the US ARMY.  When I die I do not deserve to have the Flag flown at half-staff either, because I did not or will not die defending or serving my Country.  I am beyond that time of my life and am  just like any other citizen.

 No, she died of over doseing and mixing drugs with alcohol, or drowning because she was incapacitated from such use.  That is no disease friend, that was a choice.  You want to make excuses for them, fine, now you  have made them victims, and we are now to feel sorry for the poor victims.  You dont help, you enable.  Shame on You and all like you.

Governor Christie, I am very disturbed with your decision, you gave Whitney Houston the same rights that an American soldier, an American President, or a public servant, who has given their all for their country.You have tweeted that you give them their dues by flying the flag at half mast as an Honor to them. Honor : 
(n.) That to which esteem or consideration is paid; distinguished position; high rank.(n.) A token of esteem paid to worth; a mark of respect; a ceremonial sign of consideration; as, he wore an honor on his breast; military honors; civil honors.(n.) To dignify; to raise to distinction or notice; to bestow honor upon; to elevate in rank or station; to ennoble; to exalt; to glorify; hence, to do something to honor; to treat in a complimentary manner or with civility.(n.) A cause of respect and fame; a glory; an excellency; an ornament; as, he is an honor to his nation.(n.) To regard or treat with honor, esteem, or respect; to revere; to treat with deference and submission; when used of the Supreme Being, to reverence; to adore; to worship.(n.) That which rightfully attracts esteem, respect, or consideration; self-respect; dignity; courage; fidelity; especially, excellence of character; high moral worth; virtue; nobleness; specif., in men, integrity; uprightness; trustworthness; in women, purity; chastity.(n.) Esteem due or paid to worth; high estimation; respect; consideration; reverence; veneration; manifestation of respect or reverence.

NO, all these people proclaim and try to don the same merits – veterans are different dont try to relate unless your a vet, and because you didnt serve FOR WHATEVER REASON doesnt mean you give away our customs. i served in baghdad, i received combat awards- while whitney was receiving room service- i flew to a combat zone 06 07 that had the highest death rate IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- she flew to some resort- EVERYONE IS NOT THE SAME. EVEN IN THE MILITARY, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN BURIAL  HONORS- COMBAT VETS GET DIFFERENT SALUTES FROM REGULAR VETS- STOP EXTENDING IT TO ANYONE WHO IS “ALRIGHT”- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HER NOT BEING A VET– ITS SANCTIMONIOUS BS

IT has nothing to do with her problems and everything to do with her not being a service member or a vet. do you see me wearing a green beret even though im special operations? no , i have not earned that right. most republican leaders are chickenhawks who used money to dodge service- the majority, alot of dems served, and im not taken anything away from the awesome and honorable Colin Powel who should have ran for president and saved this country.

.theres a whole book on how to treat the flag, even boyscouts know that. the flag means nothing anymore but a marketing tool- it only means something to service members and their families. this country is doomed if they dont see that.

it doesnt matter its all about service, and it doesnt matter what you do after that service, its just vet vs non vet. thats it. stop giving my honors away- 21 gun salute for the nice lady who works at Cinnabun- because she made millions of customers smile and brighten their days, and if you think about it , its like shes a hero, so she should be treated as a hero.

i love how my honors are given to be who havent served, by people who havent served. does this mean i should get paid more?
