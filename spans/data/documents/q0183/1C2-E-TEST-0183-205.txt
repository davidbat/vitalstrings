why is the American flag flying half mast today
Answer
It depends where you live. Oregon is flying their flag at half mast today because a Joshua Price (I think that was his name) was killed in Afghanistan yesterday, and he's from Oregon.
A governor of a state can order all flags to be flown at half mast for different occassions. You need to find out what happened in your state recently.
