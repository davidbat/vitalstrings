Bartholomew County flags are flying at half-staff today because of a presidential proclamation honoring civil rights icon Dorothy Height.
President Barack Obama made the declaration on Monday. Height's funeral is today.
Height began her activism in the 1930s, marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and led the National Council of Negro Women for 40 years.
In a statement, President Obama called her "the godmother of the civil rights movement."
Height received two of the nation's highest honors: the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.
Former President George W. Bush hailed her grace and determination, and her efforts to make America "a more compassionate, welcoming and just society."
