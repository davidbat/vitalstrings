In case you're wondering why flags on all state buildings were flown at half-staff Thursday, it was to honor police officers who have been killed in the line of duty.
Gov. Jim Gibbons earlier signed a proclamation declaring the week of May 11 through May 17 Police Week in Nevada.
Thursday was declared National Peace Officers' Memorial Day.
Since Nevada has lost a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper and a tribal police officer this year, the governor ordered the flags flown at half-staff.
Both trooper and officer were killed in traffic accidents while responding to emergencies.
