What is half-mast and    when should flags be flown at half-mast?
When flags are to be flown at half-mast they should be    two-thirds up between the top and bottom of the flagstaff with at least the height of the flag    between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole.
When raising the flag it should always be hoisted right up and then lowered back down to half-mast.    Likewise before it is lowered at sunset, it should first be hoisted right up and then lowered back    down.
Flags should be flown at half-mast on the following    occasions:
From the announcement of the death up to the          funeral of the Sovereign, except on Proclamation Day (the Day of the announcement of the Accession          of the new Sovereign), when the flags are hoisted right up from 11:00am to sunset,
In the event of the death of a member of the          Royal Family, flags should be lowered from the day of death to the day of the funeral, subject to          special commands from Her Majesty in each case,
The funerals of foreign rulers, subject to          special commands from Her Majesty in each case,
The funerals of Prime Ministers and ex-Prime          Ministers of the United Kingdom, subject to special commands from Her Majesty in each case,
