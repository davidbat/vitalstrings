The American flags at all Whatcom County buildings fly at half-mast today in honor of Capt. Daniel Bartle , a Marine from Ferndale who died Jan. 19 in a helicopter accident in Helmand province Afghanistan.
County Executive Jack Louws ordered the flags to be flown at half mast beginning today and continuing through close of business on Monday Jan. 30, or start of business, Tuesday Jan. 31 in respect to Capt. Bartle.
Captain Bartle will be returning to Whatcom County tomorrow, and the public is invited to line the streets in his honor along the procession route from Bellingham International Airport to Westford Funeral Home.
The procession is scheduled to leave from the airport at about 1 p.m. Saturday, and begin on Mitchell Way, which turns into Airport Way. It will then turn left onto Airport Dr., proceed South on I-5 exiting onto Northwest Ave, which turns into Elm St., and end at the funeral home on Broadway. For any updates about the route or proceedings, text the word HERO to 68398.
The Heritage Flight Museum will be open during their normal hours, noon to 4 p.m. for anyone who wants to watch the procession from the airport, and line the Captain's route to I-5.
The procession provides an opportunity for the community to show their support for the fallen Marine, but the following service is private and reserved for family and friends only. A public memorial will be held for Capt. Bartle on Sunday at 6 p.m. at Ferndale High School.
