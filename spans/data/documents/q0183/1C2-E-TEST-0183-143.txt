Florida Governor Rick has ordered all state and national flags in Escambia County to be flown at half staff Friday for Lance Corporal Travis M. Nelson who died August 18 in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
Nelson’s funeral will be held Friday in Atmore. Flags in Escambia County, Alabama, and Atmore have not been ordered to half staff. A spokesperson for Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said his office does not order flags to half staff for fallen soldiers.
