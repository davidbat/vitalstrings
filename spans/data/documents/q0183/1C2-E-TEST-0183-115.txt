Fly your flag at half-staff this week
 
Shortly after we notified more than 1,500 members of the North Carolina Flag Alert listserv of the Governor’s call to lower flags to half-staff at all state facilities through sunset Friday, Jan. 14, we heard from a member that one of the victims of the Tucson tragedy has a North Carolina connection.
Kevin Reid of Greensboro wrote to state his support for the Governor’s order and to note that John Green, father of 9-year-old victim Christina Taylor Green, pitched for the Winston-Salem Spirits in the Carolina League in 1987. He is now a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Her grandfather, Dallas Green, pitched for the Reidsville Luckies, a Carolina League team in the mid-1950s. He later coached or managed several major league teams, including taking the Philadelphia Phillies to the World Series Championship in 1980.
E-mail and social media make the world a great deal smaller, and it is heartbreaking to realize that the citizens of North Carolina share a special bond with the Green family. We send our sincere condolences to them, and to all affected by this senseless event.
Please show your solidarity and patriotism by flying your flag at half-staff this week. If you would like to be notified when the Governor orders flags to be lowered at state facilities, please register at http://lists.ncmail.net/mailman/listinfo/flag.alerts .
