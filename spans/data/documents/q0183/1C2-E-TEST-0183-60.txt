Newark, NJ, United States (AHN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has irked a great many people with his decision to fly flags on government state buildings at half-staff Saturday in honor of Whitney Houston.
The singer’s funeral services will be held in Newark Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church, the same church were Houston first showcased her powerful voice and undeniable talent.
Critics were vocal on social media sites arguing that the flag tradition should be reserved for members of the military, and that it is wrong to honor a drug addict. Houston’s battles with addictions are no secret. Prescription medication and alcohol are believed to be the cause of her death, although the official cause of death has not yet been made public.
Christie said Wednesday that he rejects complaints that Houston “forfeited the good things that she did” because of drugs, and stands by his decision to honor Houston, a native and favored Jersey girl.
Houston’s funeral will be a private, invitation only service, but it will be streamed online for fans.
