Gov. Scott Walker has ordered flags at public buildings in Wisconsin to fly at half-staff in honor of Fond du Lac Police Officer Craig Birkholz who was shot to death by a suspect Sunday morning.
Birkholz, 28, was a two-year veteran of the police department and served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Army before becoming a police officer. He was responding to a sexual assault complaint at a home on Fond du Lac's west side when he and another officer, Ryan Williams, were shot by a 30-year-old suspect who later committed suicide. Williams remains in critical condition Monday at Theda Clark Medical Center.
Flags will fly at half-staff through Saturday in Birkholz's honor.
