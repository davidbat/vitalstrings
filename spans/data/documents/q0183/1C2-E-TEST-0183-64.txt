Rescind the order to fly the flag at half mast Sat Feb 18, 2012
By order of the president of the United States, the flag is flown at half-staff when certain officials die. By federal law, these people include "principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory."
A state governor may order the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff if a member of state government dies. Also, upon the death of a member of the military engaged in active duty, the governor of that person's state of citizenship may also order the flag to fly at half-staff.
Governor Chris Christie signed a executive order to fly the American Flag at half staff. Although legal is it the right thing to do when in fact these orders are not issued upon the fall our NJ Military or Police? Seriously what message is being perpetrated to our young?  You honor a troubled entertainer over those who fight and serve to protect our liberty and freedom! If not for their sacifices she would not have been able to sing or entertain with these same liberty's!
