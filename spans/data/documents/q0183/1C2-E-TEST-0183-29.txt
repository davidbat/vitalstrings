Flags across the United States will fly at half mast today in tribute to the September 11th 2001 attacks, but why do people do this and what is the proper etiquette for flying a flag at half staff?
Flags began to be flown at half-mast or half-staff centuries ago to show, respect, mourning or distress. It is only half way up the flagpole to allow for the invisible flag of death to be flown at the top of the pole.
When a flag is flown at half-mast, it should be raised to the top of the pole, then lowered down and the same applies when taking the flag down, it should be raised to the top first and then taken down.
