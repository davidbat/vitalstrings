Steven: According to the Gettysburg Flag Works:
•Only the president of the United States or the governor of the state may order the flag to be at half-staff to honor the death of a national or state figure.
•In addition to the traditional half-staff salutes when proclaimed by the President, the Flag Code mentions the use of our Flag for honoring citizens who have died, especially government officials and prominent citizens. However, the Flag Code does not exclude any citizen, whether they belong to an organization or not, whether they are recognized very locally or regionally. Examples of deceased citizens that might be honored with by lowering the Flag to half-staff include local religious leaders, youth leaders, honored teachers or sports coaches, local politicians, or a local hero. There need be no authorization from the government for the private sector (non-government) to use the Flag to honor any citizen. It is important to note that the Flag Code is a code, it is intended to provide guidance and is not obligatory. It carries no civil or criminal penalties for "misuse" of the Flag. Individual are not acting illegally when using the Flag according to their own usage. Only on government / public building is the flag code required to be followed.
==============================================
So that is not to say that the honor is given ONLY for those who died while serving the country, but it is an honor that is usually reserved for those who have.

It's outrageous and a disgrace.
People have every right to remember Paterno how they would like to remember him.  On one side, you have the folks who would like to remember him as an icon in college sports, maybe even THE icon of college sports. On the other side, there are folks who feel he really dropped the ball on how he handled matters (or chose not to handle the matters) concerning the sexual abuse of children under his assistant coach.  Both opinions are valid I suppose but having known the latter, I'm not sure how even the greatest sports achievements outweigh the bad.
Paterno himself admitted he should have done more. I would like to believe that and none of us can claim to be guilt free of having a lapse in judgement. It's unfortunate that it ended this way for him. I would like to think he was better than this. However it's also wrong to celebrate all his achievements even after death knowing what we now know. It's wrong to portray him as a hero worthy of a flag at half mast.  If what was done was worthy of him being terminated from his job which is where his icon status was built, it should be worthy of his passing being a reason to leave the flags where they are.
It's just not right for those who suffered.
