My question is where is Osama Bin Laden? Our resources (read here the lives of our Military) would be better utilized bringing him to justice and eradicating a Al-Quada than trying to bring peace to a nation who will not know peace because of long held religious beliefs. People forget the cost of war. Not that there are not times that the cost is justified, but I question the cost vs outcome analysis of Iraq. (BTW, I, my wife, and our Fathers are all veterans and my middle Son is in ROTC.)

It’s gotten to the point now where you could ask Gov. Romney what he wants for breakfast and he will respond something like, “The president has failed to lead on this issue.”
– Michael Scherer, White House correspondent for Time magazine, responding to the question of what Mitt Romney’s proposal is for immigration reform. Romney criticized Pres. Obama, even in the light of the recent Supreme Court ruling which supported the Obama Justice Department’s assertion that federal crimes cannot be created by state laws, such as those in Arizona.
I will be the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign.
— President Obama, quoted by USA Today, in his latest fundraising appeal.

They throw around the term Watergate so much at Fox, you’d think the guy running Fox had been a Nixon operative.
— Daily Show’s Jon Stewart, turning his attention to “Fast and Furious” and Republican outrage over the botched ATF operation. Fox chief Roger Ailes was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and Rudy Giuliani’s first mayoral campaign (1989).
