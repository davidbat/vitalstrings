The flag is known to fly half when an important person in the state has died. In the Nevada state capital flag flied half-staff in 13, March 2011 that is in the honor of Fort Campbell soldier Spc. Brian Tabada of Las Vegas. In United Stated on 15th May all flags are also flown half in honor of federal, state and local officers killed or disabled in the line of duty.
