Flags at Arlington National Cemetary aren't flown at half staff all the time.  They are flown at half staff for a lot of the time, though.

The flags in Arlington National Cemetery are flown at half-staff from a half hour before the first funeral until a half hour after the last funeral each day. Funerals are normally conducted five days a week, excluding weekends.
The webpage for the Tomb of the Unknowns doesn't mention anything about a flag flying there.  A quick check of google images doesn't show a flag on a permenent flag pole in the area.
It only takes a visit to the USS Arizona site to see that the flag doesn't always fly at half staff.  [ETA]When I hit the site the first time, there was a photo of the memorial with the flag at full staff.  I just went back to it and the site has a different photo.  Must be one of those changing ones. From the Histroy and Culture page on the site:

Contrary to popular belief, the USS Arizona is no longer in commission. As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship. The USS Arizona Memorial has come to commemorate all military personnel killed in the Pearl Harbor attack.
Seems if it always flew at half staff they would mention it there.
The Betsy Ross House website includes flag code and no mention that it is excluded from that code.
