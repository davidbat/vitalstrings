To clarify–is it correct that Memorial Day is no longer May 30th, by Federal edict?  Since May 30th was the traditional day, is it at all appropriate to fly the US flag in the same manner on that day–half-staff to noon?
This change (to the last Monday in May means that only occasionally will May 30th be the "official" holiday–correct?
What happens when Sunday is May 31sr–is Memorial Day then the Monday prior (ie. May 25th) in those particular years?
Somewhere along the way, the actual reason for Memorial Day was lost…so sad.

What if your business is closed on Monday and there will be no staff around? Is it better to leave them up through the weekend or take them down for the weekend.

It would be a small sacrifice to arrange to fly your closed buisness’s flag properly on Memorial Day.  Ask if there’s an employee that would like to volunteer to take care of this honor.  If no one steps up to the plate, I’d ask local law enforcement or the fire department to take care of this.  Flying no flag on this day is not really a good option.

Why is the flag only flown at half staff only until noon on Memorial Day?

What if your flag is hung from a smaller type pole attached to the side of the house or hung vertically out front? How do you half mast a flag displayed in this manner? Thanks much

Would it be appropriate to lower my flag to half-staff at close of business Friday and leave it there until Noon Monday?
My flagpole is at my office and I’m going out of town for the weekend.  It IS lighted at night!
Thanks!

I have a similar situation as Duane.  If our company has to choose between flying the flag at half-mast Friday afternoon/evening until Tuesday morning or not lowering it at all, which is the lesser of two evils, so to speak?
I would think this issue–and how to best handle it–would apply to many flags on a holiday, but finding any information that addresses it directly is proving difficult.
Thanks for any feedback you can provide!

Holly,
If you fly a flag at home on a pole that will not allow the flag to be lowered, then you should put a black bow/ribbon at the top. You can make this yourself or stop by a florist and have one made.

I just read somewhere that the Flag gets raised at 12: 21 PM on the last Monday of May.  the 21 minutes past the hour is supossed to represent a 21 gun salute. your thoughts?

If you cannot properly display the flag, do not display the flag at all. Do NOT place a streamer above the flag since streamers are only authorized by the POTUS for parade purposes only. The flag is at noon tomorrow IAW flag etiquette. NOT 12:21. Flags are not half masted when flown from a small pole outside the house since it is impossible. Since I have duty tomorrow in Newport, RI, I drive around town and FIX those that do not follow etiquette, however, most do here.

Holly, Most flag holders that attach to the side of the house (to hold the pole the flag is attached to) have a two places to insert the pole. One at a rising angle, and One that holds the flag horizontal. The one that holds the flag horizontal is the correct one to use to represent the flag being flown at half staff. Some cheaper flag sets probebly do not offer this option. Look in your “Yellowpages” for a flag store near you… you can get a holder that does for a very reasonable price.

Wow! Getting lots if different answers! Mike, then according to you would I not display it until noon then? Yes, I agree, I knew not to attach streamers. Chuck- that makes sense! I’ve often wondered why the two differing holes upon the more old fashioned flag pole brackets- like the ones I always see at my grandparents up invthe adirondacks, bur not here in The South as much. Well, I suppose I will just not hang my flag until noon. They didn’t have this two setting type of bracket anywhere near me and I’m hanging my flag vertically again, so I’ll just wait to be safe I guess.
