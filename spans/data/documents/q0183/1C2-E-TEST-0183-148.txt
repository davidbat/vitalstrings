Political donations ethical issue: Palmer
Jun 27, 2012
NSW Premier Kristina Keneally has called on all government agencies to fly their Australian flags at half mast on Thursday as a mark of respect for the 29 miners killed in New Zealand.
She has also asked that the Australian and New Zealand flags on Sydney's Anzac Bridge be flown at half mast and the same be observed on the Harbour Bridge.
"I send my heartfelt condolences to the men who were killed, their families and their friends," Ms Keneally said in a statement on Wednesday.
"This was a tragedy that has touched the lives of people from New Zealand, Australia and around the world."
The miners, including two Australians, are dead after a second explosion on Wednesday ripped through the Pike River Coal mine five days after an initial blast trapped them underground.
Ms Keneally asked that flags on all government buildings in NSW be flown at half mast as well.
