EXERPT FROM THE US FLAG CODE :
Section 7.M
The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be
first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff
position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for
the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon
only, then raised to the top of the staff.
