SC flag flyin at half staff today
I asked everyone at work if someone died because the flags were flying at half staff today.  No one new so I searched on the newspaper on line and found that another SC soldier died (the 32nd from SC since the beginning of the war).  It's a shame that I had to search this out and that no one new about it.  TV is all Michael Jackson and Laura and Mary Kay Latourneau and whatever nonsensical crap our MSM tries to push down viewers throats as a priority for this nation.
S.C. native dies in bombing
From Staff and Wire Reports
THE U.S. AND IRAQ
FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. — When Army 2nd Lt. Clifford “CC” Gadsden left for Iraq, the South Carolinian told his mother he was mostly scared of one thing.
“‘I’m so afraid my son’s not going to remember me,’” Minerva Gadsden recalled her son saying. “That was his greatest fear.”
Now his relatives say they’ll work to keep the soldier’s memory alive.
The father of Karistophere, 17 months, and Kinshaza, 5, was killed by a truck bomb Friday in a convoy between Baghdad and Kuwait, his family said.
The 25-year-old was based in Fort Polk, La., with the Army’s 603rd Transportation Company. He was the 32nd servicemember with S.C. ties to die in the Iraq war.
