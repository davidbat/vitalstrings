SALEM, Ore. – Flags at public buildings in Oregon will be flown at half-mast until sunset Tuesday in honor of Frank W. Buckles, the last surviving veteran of World War I.
Governor John Kitzhaber made the order at the request of President Barack Obama.
“As a mark of respect for the memory of Army Corporal Frank W. Buckles, the last surviving American veteran of World War I, and in remembrance of the generation of American veterans of World War I, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that, on the day of his interment, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half staff,” read the presidential proclamation.
Buckles died in February at age 110. He had enlisted in the Army at 16 after lying about his age and served in France. He will be buried Tuesday at Arlington National Cemetery.
