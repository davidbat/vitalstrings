Presidential Proclamation -- Veterans Day, 2011
VETERANS DAY, 2011
BY THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
Today, our Nation comes together to honor our veterans  and commemorate the legacy of profound service and sacrifice they have upheld  in pursuit of a more perfect Union. Through their steadfast defense of  America's ideals, our service members have ensured our country still stands  strong, our founding principles still shine, and nations around the world know  the blessings of freedom. As we offer our sincere appreciation and  respect to our veterans, to their families, to those who are still in harm's  way, and to those we have laid to rest, let us rededicate ourselves to serving  them as well as they have served the United States of America.
Our men and women in uniform are bearers of a proud  military tradition that has been dutifully passed forward -- from generation to  generation -- for more than two centuries. In times of war and peace  alike, our veterans have served with courage and distinction in the face of  tremendous adversity, demonstrating an unfaltering commitment to America and  our people. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the country  they loved. The selflessness of our service members is unmatched, and  they remind us that there are few things more fundamentally American than doing  our utmost to make a difference in the lives of others.
Just as our veterans stood watch on freedom's frontier,  so have they safeguarded the prosperity of our Nation in our neighborhoods, our  businesses, and our homes. As teachers and engineers, doctors and  parents, these patriots have made contributions to civilian life that serve as  a testament to their dedication to the welfare of our country. We owe  them a debt of honor, and it is our moral obligation to ensure they receive our  support for as long as they live as proud veterans of the United States Armed  Forces. This year, as our troops in Iraq complete their mission, we will honor  them and all who serve by working tirelessly to give them the care, the  benefits, and the opportunities they have earned.
On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to our veterans, to the  fallen, and to their families. To honor their contributions to our Nation,  let us strive with renewed determination to keep the promises we have made to  all who have answered our country's call. As we fulfill our obligations  to them, we keep faith with the patriots who have risked their lives to  preserve our Union, and with the ideals of service and sacrifice upon which our  Republic was founded.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions  our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the  world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each  year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's  veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United  States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2011, as Veterans Day.  I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our veterans  through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I call upon  Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States  and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call  on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of  worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative  expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third  day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the  Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.
BARACK OBAMA

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
On Veterans Day, we come together to pay tribute to the men                   and women who have worn the uniform of the United States Armed                   Forces. Americans across this land commemorate the patriots                   who have risked their lives to preserve the liberty of our                   Nation, the families who support them, and the heroes no longer                   with us. It is not our weapons or our technology that make                   us the most advanced military in the world; it is the unparalleled                   spirit, skill, and devotion of our troops. As we honor our                   veterans with ceremonies on this day, let our actions strengthen                   the bond between a Nation and her warriors.
In an unbroken line of valor stretching across more than two                   centuries, our veterans have charged into harm's way, sometimes                   making the ultimate sacrifice, to protect the freedoms that                   have blessed America. Whether Active Duty, Reserve, or National                   Guard, they are our Nation's finest citizens, and they have                   shown the heights to which Americans can rise when asked and                   inspired to do so. Our courageous troops in Iraq, Afghanistan,                   and around the globe have earned their place alongside previous                   generations of great Americans, serving selflessly, tour after                   tour, in conflicts spanning nearly a decade.
Long after leaving the uniform behind, many veterans continue                   to serve our country as public servants and mentors, parents                   and community leaders. They have added proud chapters to the                   story of America, not only on the battlefield, but also in                   communities from coast to coast. They have built and shaped                   our Nation, and it is our solemn promise to support our Soldiers,                   Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen as they return                   to their homes and families.
America's sons and daughters have not watched over her shores                   or her citizens for public recognition, fanfare, or parades.                   They have preserved our way of life with unwavering patriotism                   and quiet courage, and ours is a debt of honor to care for                   them and their families. These obligations do not end after                   their time of service, and we must fulfill our sacred trust                   to care for our veterans after they retire their uniforms.
As a grateful Nation, we are humbled by the sacrifices rendered                   by our service members and their families out of the deepest                   sense of service and love of country. On Veterans Day,let us                   remember our solemn obligations to our veterans, and recommit                   to upholding the enduring principles that our country lives                   for, and that our fellow citizens have fought and died for.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our                   service men and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom                   around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a))                   that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal                   public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States                   of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2010, as Veterans                   Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice                   of our veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private                   prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to                   display the flag of the United States and to participate in                   patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans,                   including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship,                   schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative                   expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth                   day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten,                   and of the Independence of the United States of America the                   two hundred and thirty-fifth.
