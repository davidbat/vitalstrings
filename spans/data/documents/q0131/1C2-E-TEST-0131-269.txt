Time is running out before school is back in session, so pack your bags for a final summer fling at the best places to visit in August.
Jersey Shore
Going down to the Jersey Shore is a popular summer tradition with mid-Atlantic residents from New York, Philadelphia and, of course, New Jersey. Busy city dwellers trade a subway for a beach cruiser and embrace a vacation of boogie-boarding, beachcombing and cruising the boardwalk.
Cruise
It’s never a bad time of year to set sail; cruise lines launch new trips and ships perfect for any time of year. Take advantage of the school vacation and plan a family cruise or the ultimate kid-adventure aboard a Disney cruise .

The Mountains
When everyone else is heading to the beach, bring along your hiking boots for a trip to the mountains. Bring along the kids for a family mountain vacation or take advantage or warm, dry weather in national parks like Acadia in Maine or Mount Rainier in Washington.

Aruba
While the rest of the Caribbean is anticipating possible hurricanes from June through November, Aruba is safely tucked into a generally hurricane-free zone, making it a top Caribbean destination even in the height of summer. Soak up some sun on the tranquil sandy shores of Aruba's Palm Beach .
Theme Parks
Sure, there may be long lines and aggravating crowds, but for many travelers, riding a roller coaster is an annual summer tradition. Brave the humidity and hot weather to mingle with the mouse and his entourage of princesses at Disney , get wet at the nation’s best water parks or check out the best amusement park closest to your hometown.
