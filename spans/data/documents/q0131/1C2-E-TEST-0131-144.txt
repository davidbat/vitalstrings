Animals                            Everywhere
Dear                            Families,
Swift Nature Camp is a Children's Summer                            Camp for boys and girls ages 6-15. Our                            focus is to blend traditional summer camp                            activities while increasing a child's                            appreciation for nature, science and the                            environment. As Camp Directors, we are                            often asked "What are the benefits of a                            Nature Summer Camp experience?" Our                            primary answer at Swift Nature Camp is to                            facilitate a Fun and Safe Summer Camp in                            Wisconsin. But we know that there is so                            much more to a Children's Summer Camp. For                            years, parents have found summer camps as                            an amazing opportunity to help their                            children mature and grow.
 
 
Summer                            Camp Hiking and Canoe Trips
At                            Swift Nature Camp, a kids summer camp our                            small size allows us to promote each                            child's personal development by providing                            fun, friendship and leadership in a                            supportive and noncompetitive environment                            away from home. While children are home all year long, that's your time to plant                            the seeds and direct the thinking patterns                            which guide your child to how they should                            behave and socialize. But at summer camp                            children will have an opportunity to act                            on their own, be self-reliant and try                            things for themselves.
 
 To                            put it in one word, summer camps provides                            independence, and that's a major part of                            growing up. When Children at camp find                            adult friends called counselors,                            who model perseverance, listening,                            teamwork and appreciation of differences,                            campers set new and high standards for                            their own behavior. This in turn brings                            their new found independence more in line                            with your at-home                            teachings.

New Friends to Make at Summer                            Camp
 We                            see Swift Nature Camp as an opportunity                            for Children to come to a new place and                            try new things and make new friends. Our                            NatureSummer Camp is a new world. Who you                            were before has no bearing on who you want to be, because summer camps are a new                            beginning. Many of our kids return year                            after year saying that "Swift                            allows me to be my real self with                            real people" and we feel that's a                            good thing.
All                            this happens in the fun and sun of the                            north woods of Wisconsin. For staff and                            campers alike, Swift Nature Camp is more                            than just a place to be: it is their                            summer home. So why not have your child                            join our summer camp family this                            summer?
