Creating Positive Choices for the Future of Our Children.™
Summer Camp Now Forming! 
Come join us to enhance your child's martial arts skills and make new friends this summer by enrolling them in one of our martial arts Summer Camps. These are "Active Camps" small and personalized as you may remember as a child. Filled with a variety of fun activities and exciting field trips. Throughout the day your child will be introduced to all forms of martial arts, including forms, sparring, and weapons.
Your child will have a great time in a rewarding, safe                    environment. Camps are open to people with or without previous martial arts experience. The cost is only $149 per week and includes the cost of the                     activities, field trips and and all day care.
You can select your weeks as you wish but since we have a student to instructor ratio we must                     keep, you will want to reserve your camp days before certain weeks fill.
