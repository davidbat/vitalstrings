6.   Let Me Play Sports Camps
Courses / Programs
Located in the UK, Let Me Play are leading specialists in sports camps and sports tours. As the name "Let Me Play" indicates, the organisation is all about providing opportunity for young people to play and enjoy sport.
Each year we provide residential summer camps throughout the UK for young people that include accommodation and meals as well. We also offer non-residential options. We offer camps in street dance, basketball, football, tennis, athletics and cheerleading. Our camps are a great way to meet new friends, build self confidence, keep fit and learn more about whatever sport you are most into.
Coming from overseas? We offer English lessons alongside all of our camps! Just ask and we can create a custom English program just for you so you can learn a new language as well as a new sport! Best of all we offer competitive prices too. Group discounts are available. Sightseeing tours are also available with each camp as an extra.
We take sport seriously and our coaches are there to help each individual develop, enjoy and reach his/her maximum potential. Our camps are a fantastic experience!
Let Me Play - Sport for a Better Tomorrow!
