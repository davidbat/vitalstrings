The Globe and Mail recently ran an article on the best camping sites in Canada, the article itself only had room to list six, but the readers wrote in and added many more.
Here are the camp sites for British Columbia :
GARIBALDI PROVINCIAL PARK, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Comment “Watching the glacier change colours with the setting sun is a
delight at dusk, preferably with a refreshing and well-deserved
beverage in hand.”
Highlight More than 90 kilometres of hiking trails wind past
evocatively named alpine geography such as Black Tusk, Panorama Ridge,
Sphinx Glacier and Castle Towers.
Ambience It’s a nine-kilometre trek from the access-point parking lot
to the reader-recommended Garibaldi Lake Campground, so it’s safe to
assume few campers will have toted boom boxes or beer kegs.
Amenities Garibaldi Lake Campground is a bare-bones, 50-site setup:
four day-use cooking shelters, pit toilets and a sink (the water isn’t
potable). Open fires are prohibited, as are pets.
Diversions In summer, it’s all about hiking around Garibaldi Lake.
Several renowned trails branch out from the access parking lot or the
campsite, including treks to Panorama Ridge and the Black Tusk.
Swimming is refreshing to say the least, as all the park’s lakes are
glacier-fed.
Flora and fauna Many dense Douglas fir, western red cedar and western
hemlock forests cover the park, as do alpine meadows. Grizzly and
black bears, mountain goats and deer roam the area.
Pest factor Visitors should take precautions against bear encounters.
Insider tip Sites 12 to 18 are clustered right next to Garibaldi Lake.
Information The Garibaldi Lake parking lot is a 90-minute drive north
of Vancouver. Campsites are available on a first-come, first-served
basis. Visit www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks.
RATHTREVOR BEACH PROVINCIAL PARK, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Comment ” A beautiful spot with lots of hiking trails, a fabulous
beach that goes for miles and a great campground that is well-
maintained and monitored.” – Anonymous, Nanaimo, B.C.
Highlight It’s a short stroll from any of Rathtrevor’s many campsites
to the celebrated sandy beach. At low tide, the Strait of Georgia’s
waters recede almost a kilometre; when the ocean rolls back in over
the hot sand, swimming prevails.
Ambience The park is especially popular with families, but the sheer
size of the beach prevents overcrowding.
Amenities The park’s 174 vehicle-accessible campsites include three
hot-shower buildings, flush toilets, an adventure playground and
several freshwater taps. There are 25 more walk-in campsites, with pit
toilets and two picnic shelters nearby, and four group sites.
Diversions Rathtrevor buzzes with activity over the summer. A Nature
House and amphitheatre run interpretive programs seven days a week;
there are 5.5 kilometres of easy walking trails; and swimmers,
fishers, paddlers and windsurfers flock to the beach. The park is
famous among birdwatchers for the Brandt geese migration, from March
15 to April 15, in which these shore birds use the beaches of
Rathtrevor and Craig Bay as staging and feeding areas on their spring
migration to Northern Canada and Alaska.
Flora and fauna Along with Douglas firs, Western red cedar, hemlock,
balsam, spruce, arbutus and maple trees cover the park. Several
species of wildlife can be spotted in the park, including deer,
otters, mink, eagles, osprey, hawks, vultures and owls.
Pest factor During the Brandt geese migration, dogs are not allowed on
certain parts of the beach. Backcountry areas are also not suitable
for dogs, owing to possible bear encounters. Raccoons
can be troublesome in the campsites.
Insider tip Campsites 20 and 21 are among the closest to the beach –
less than 50 metres away – and there’s no road separating them from
the sand.
Information Rathtrevor is a two-hour drive north of Victoria.

Jack Jones from Clearwater, BC, Canada writes: No question, the
Berg Lake Trail in Mount Robson Provincial Park, British Columbia.
My family makes it a yearly trip. It’s such an incredibly
beautiful place up behind Mt Robson in the sub-alpine. The views of
the glaciers and sawtooth peaks are breath-taking. The best part of
the trip is the hike. It’s not for the out of shape or faint-hearted.
It is a 2 night, 3 day excursion of about 50 km round trip. There are
no garbage cans. Everything you pack in you must pack out. There is a
grueling 1000m climb over 3 km. This is the part the separates the
adventurers from the tourists. Everyone that you meet up top has the
same attitude, a reverence for nature. When you camp across Berg Lake
from the glacier, you can hear the glacier ‘calve’ at night, which
means part of the glacier breaks off and falls into the water. There
is this tremendous roar and then crash and then two minutes later you
can hear the waves reaching the shore. It is truly spectacular. Most
importantly is the journey we make as a family. When you spend that
kind of time together and endure the physicality required by the trip
you can’t help but bond and come together as a family unit. I get
choked up just thinking about it. We first did the trip when my son
was 6 and my daughter 8. They were awesome! I think about his little
legs doing the 50 km round trip in three days. Last year, we took
Gramma who turned 60. Robson has always been one of my Mom’s favorite
spots but she had no idea that the best part of it couldn’t be seen
from the road. She had recently recovered from a hysterectomy and this
was truly a life-affirming event for her. Again, the hike is a real
metaphor for life. The struggle, the reward, the beauty and the
journey we make together. You’ve got to be in shape to do it but the
challenge is amply recompensed. The Berg Lake Trail in Mt Robson
Provincial Park is by far the best camping experience I’ve ever had.
We’ll go again this year, see you up there!

Edward Ralfe from Fernie, Canada writes: Long Beach, south of
Tofino. Pitch your tent just off the edge of the sand.
==============================================
Kathryn Murray from Toronto, Canada writes: The Tatshenshini
River and the Alsek River meet in the wilds of northern British
Columbia. There is no finer campsite in Canada than at this
confluence. The flat plain at the river’s edge makes for an
unbelievable location for a campsite. Tents are scattered among the
wildflowers. In every direction are snow capped mountains, with
glaciers dotting their sides. The river, glacier fed and fast flowing
is laden with salmon. During the day, grizzly bears wander the banks
and sandbars feeding on the salmon. At night, the stars are forever.
And in the morning, the mist hangs over the land as the sun’s rays
break through. Nature abounds — eagles, ospreys, bears, lynx, owls,
and the list goes on.
I have camped for over 30 years across Canada. There is no
campsite that even comes close to this. you are left with the feeling
of peace and harmony and one with nature. And after all, that is what
camping is all about.
Kathleen Snyder from Parksville, Canada writes: My favorite
camping spot is right on the water at 4 All Seasons at Cedar on
Vancouver Island. There are only about four sites right on the water
where you can pitch your tent. Beautiful views of the sunsets. There
is a natural pool built into the rocks.
==================================================
Michael Banfield from Vernon, bc, Canada writes: my favourite
camping spot is the Sandy Beach-3rd cove South of parkig lot at
Sombrio Beach, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Lovely sandy
spot under and immense overhanging spruce tree. A fresh and potable
water creek flows across the beach to the ocean. The Roicky cove (2nd
one south)is full off small bits of dry firewood for the picking.
Following the creek into the cleft you come across a beautiful
waterfall which is carving away the sandstone. the closer to the
falls, the less vegetation on the walls of the cleft. the headland
between the third and fourth cove has been undercut by the ocean,
producing a standing height cave with openings to the sky which can
produce some spectacular ephemeral images. If you go around or over
the headland to the fourth cove, you will see Sombrio Creek waterfall,
which plunges directly into the ocean. At night you can drift of to
sleep to the gentle sussurus of the waves, sometimes accompanied by by
the barks of sea lions or the blowing of whales. A truely magical
place, which I have been tavelling to for almost forty years now. When
we first went there, my kids were in backpacks, and we hiked about 90
minutes through old growth forest. Now, one can drive to within about
100m of the first cove. A twenty minute beach walk takes you to my
special place. ENJOY!
John Mullrooney from Calgary, Canada writes: To me, the best
place to pitch a tent in Canada is Gray Bay, Queen Charlotte Island,
British Columbia. My girlfriend and I have camped from coast to coast
to coast for many, many years and this place is truly magical. What
could be better than watching the sun move horizontally across the sky
for hours deep into the night, sleeping peacefully by the water, and
making up late to the call of orcas mere metres from shore??
It’s truly heaven on earth for us and anyone else that travels
the great distance to be there…

Chris Killey from Canada writes: In a country blessed with so
many scenic spots to camp, one sticks out in my memory from 15 years
ago. My wife and I were on Vancouver Island, heading to the Carmanah
Valley to hike in the majestic old growth forests. Just before we took
our rental car on the (forbidden, according to the rental agreement)
dusty, gritty logging roads, we spent one night camped at Gordon Bay
Provincial Park, by Duncan, on the shore of beautiful Lake Cowichan.
Our stakes were sunk into the soft forest floor, admidst the same
large old trees that we would drive 2 1/2 hours the next day to marvel
at.
I have only been there once, and have camped so many
spectacular places since (rugged Gros Morne, Bon Echo with its awesome
granite rock face, the reedy north shore of St. Lawrence past Quebec
City, wind swept Tofino, also on Vancouver Island, Lionshead on
Georgian Bay surrounded by limestone cliffs), but that one night in
the peaceful forest on the shore of the clean, blue lake) is indelibly
etched in my mind.
I will be back there one day.

M Smith from Canada writes: Tsusiat Falls, West Coast Trail is
my pick for best place to pitch a tent. Giant driftwood logs provide
private little ‘rooms’ in which to set up camp; smaller logs are
perfect for an evening fire, enjoyed against the sun setting over the
Pacific. The ‘never-ending falls’ make a naturally beautiful backdrop
for the pool below where one can enjoy a refreshing dip after the
day’s hike. And there is nothing like drifting off and waking up to
the sound of the surf washing up on the golden sand.

Jake Kayak from Canada writes: The Broken Group Islands in
Barkley Sound, part of Pacific Rim National Park is one of my favorite
places to camp. Accessible by paddling, water taxi or the Francis
Barkley out of Port Alberni. We have kayaked here a number of times on
self-guided trips (inexperienced people should consider a reputable
tour operator for safety and comfort). On all of our trips, we have
brought friends or family who have had limited if any previous
kayaking experience. This is a wonderfully beautiful area with pretty
islands and some amazing beaches. It can get busy in the summer, but
we enjoy meeting other fellow voyagers. Last summer, we hired a water
taxi so that our four-year old could experience this with us. We base-
camped and did day trips. Upgrading our gear from ultralight to
ultracomfortable really helped (thicker sleeping pads, bigger tent,
two stoves, etc.). Check out Alberni Marine Transport for more info
(they rent kayaks and have a lodge at Sechart Whaling Station). I hate
to share this with everyone! If you are looking for something more
secluded, take the Uchuck III from Campbell River to get to Kyuquot
(and the Bunsby Islands).
Rebecca Shields from Vancouver, Canada writes: I have never
seem more beauty then Desolation Sound on the north end of the
Sunshine Coast in BC. The water access only protected marine park
boasts the most stunning array of wildlife, where you can pick fresh
oysters right off the bottom of the inlet floor. Take or rent a kayak
and enjoy!
fleur beleski from surrey, b.c., Canada writes: The best place
to pitch a tent in British Columbia is in Bowron Lake Provincial Park,
along the shores of a chain of lakes, but you will have to paddle your
canoe to get there. The lakes are located in central B.C. close to the
old historic gold town of Barkerville in the Cariboo Mountains. They
form a 360 degree traverse totaling 116 km, which you canoe and at the
end of each day, pitch your tent, cook your meal, exhausted but
exhilarated. The wilderness experience can be completed at your own
pace, usually 5 – 10 days. You will have to bring all necessities with
you and portage your canoe and grub in several places where the lakes
join. Take care that the black bears don’t steal your food as there
are no stores to replenish your supplies once on the route. In such
cases, campers have been known to share, but only the essentials. Your
camping experience is gratifying because you arrive at a different
location every day under your own power, then appreciate the joys of
cozying up in a two-person tent. There are few places left where you
can experience the beauty of nature—moose, waterfalls, sandy
beaches, rapids, mountains and glaciers—in an entirely uninhabited
part of the planet but still not so remote and yet easily accessible.
It’s not for everyone; only those with a sense of adventure. (details

Rachel Capon from Kingston ON, Canada writes: In a past life, I
was a Kayak Adventure Guide in British Columbia. I had the honor of
traveling through the waters of BC, and sharing the beauty and wonders
of this place with my clients and fellow guides. On one particular
trip in Nootka Sound, I found the perfect spot for my tent. Our group
had found a gorgeous bay to spend the night. Jetting out from one side
of this bay was a little tiny island. It had about ten trees on it and
just enough room to pitch two small tents. I found a little area with
the softest earth ever (for an avid camper, this is a very important
detail). Positioning my tent perfectly I was perched just above Nootka
Sound looking out into the Pacific Ocean. It was this view from my
tent that inspired me to take a view from my tent door for the next
couple of years. I hope one day that I will get to pitch my tent hear
again. Until then, I will be forever searching for that gorgeously
soft earth that brings the most peaceful of dreams to a tired camper.
Happy Camping
