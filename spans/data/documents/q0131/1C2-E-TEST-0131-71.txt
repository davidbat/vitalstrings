What do Palm Springs, California, New York City, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona have in common? They're at the top of Jaunted.com's best places in the U.S. to enjoy the summer heat.
Palm Springs for its low season prices (yes, the extreme heat makes summer the low season), New York for its outdoor dining, open parks and empty streets, and Lake Havasu City for houseboats galore and easy access (3 hours away) from the Grand Canyon.
While these are all safe bets, there are, however, a couple of other U.S. destinations that we would pick, too: the Outerbanks of North Carolina for it's pristine beaches, laid-back appeal and awesome fried food and Charleston, South Carolina for its beautiful walking tours of historical homes and places and Southern charm.
