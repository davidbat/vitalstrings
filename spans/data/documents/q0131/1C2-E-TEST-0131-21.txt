Advice on Best camping spots in Cali ??
Hello again,
So the roadtrip for this summer is well on its way. We had to cut down a lot of it because of money issues (AKA GAS PRICES.....) but basically we're still going from Jersey to San Francisco, then Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and back across to the East Coast.
We decided that instead of hitting as many parks as we can on this trip, we were going to keep the same trip length (1 month approx) and camp for 4 or 5 days instead of 1 or 2 at each park we visit.
So our major stop is Yosemite. Any advice from people who camp there on the best campgrounds to stay at? We're planning on staying at about 3 different campgrounds so we see as much of the park as we can. We're looking for the most beautiful and interesting places to camp and hike.
Also, same question for Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Death Valley... Best places to camp there?
Looking forward to the advice! Thanks
