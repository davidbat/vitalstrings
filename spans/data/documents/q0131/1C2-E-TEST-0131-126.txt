Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent for Sale: Spring Sale 17% Off
Finally you've found an easy to set up family tent!
I've bought plenty of "easy to set up" family tents - and many of them were pretty easy to set up - if you had three people and were doing it in the daylight with no wind. The Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent is the first large tent that lives up to the "easy to set up" moniker.
The secret to the quick set-up is the pole system, which comes pre-attached to the tent. You'll find set-up almost fun, well maybe I won't go that far but at least you can get the tent up quick so you can get that fire going and hit the toasted marshmallows.
Amazon Just slashed the price on the Coleman Instant 14- by 10- Foot 8- Person Two Room Tent basically selling it out, and this 6-Person Coleman Instant is going to sell fast too.
This was a brand new family tent from 2011 and I think Coleman has a winner on their hands with this one - camper's agree as it is one of the top selling family tents right now. Amazon anticipates a hot camping season and wants this Coleman Instant Tent to stay the best selling family tent so look out for some pretty good sales as camping season hits full swing this summer.

Amazing Deal on the Coleman Montana 8 Family Dome Tent
WeatherTec rain protection system keeps rain outside
If you've done some serious family camping or even just gone a time or two you'll understand me when I say it gets a bit stuffy in there as the sun beats down on you in the morning. Well this Coleman Montana 8 Family Dome Tent (model number 2000001594) has a vented Cool-Air Port for improved airflow which helps the air circulate when it gets hot in the summer or steamy during a rain storm. And while we are on the subject of rain the Coleman Montana 8 has a WeatherTec rain protection system that keeps the rain outside so you don't wake up in a puddle. Trust me not fun - last summer we had a blast huddling in the center of the tent soaking up rain with spare towels and dirty laundry. (We were trying out a free tent and found out fast why it was free..)

Eureka Tetragon 1210 Family 12- Foot by 10-Foot Eight-Person Tent
Large family dome tent with divider for two rooms
Another top family tent for you is the Eureka Tetragon 1210 Family 12- Foot by 10-Foot Eight-Person Tent which is an 8-Person two room dome tent that gives you a lot of quality features for your money.
Pros: Plenty of room but not too big, 2 doors for easy access, good ventilation, easy set up for 2 people, a lot of tent for the price
Cons: Seal those seams and get quality stakes! (pretty much a must with any tent), Zipper can be a bit tricky to zip because of added rain flap, a bit too much ventilation for cooler weather camping, poles are so-so quality (your typical corded poles that sometimes separate when pulling them through the guides.
Overall, this Eureka Tetragon Eight-Person Tent
is a nice affordable family camping tent. If you have a family of five or six you'll fit right in - I grew up using Eureka tents so I know they hold up well. Here's what Scout says from Eagan Minnesota about her experience with this tent:
Amazon Price: $299.50 (as of 06/30/2012)
List Price: $239.99
"This is a great family tent! We had two adults, one toddler and one infant (in a Pack'n'Play) in this tent - and still had room for all of our stuff. LOTS of ventilation, which is great for warmer weather. We did seal the tent - and had no leaks during a huge storm. It's nice being able to stand up in the center - and the kids love all of the room! "
Tent Seam Sealer
Seal Those Tent Seams - Just to be safe
While tent construction has improved over the years, tent seams are still a week point even on some of the best tents. And since I'm sure you don't really like waking up with a drip of rain to the forehead spending a few bucks on seam sealer is probably a pretty good idea for next Summer's camping season.
