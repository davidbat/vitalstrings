For those in Kuwait, you need not feel dis-spirited and pensive. There are lot of places in Kuwait where you can go during the summer holidays and enjoy with your family and friends.
My daughter is 2 1/2years old and so sending her to summer camp doesn't arise. But my friends, whose kids who have started going to school are really going crazy as to what to do with the kids this summer. So I have made a list that I hope will help them and you out, if you have kids.
