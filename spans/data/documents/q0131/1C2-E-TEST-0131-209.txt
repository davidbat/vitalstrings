Welcome!
Since 1948, Sanborn Western Camps have been creating outdoor experiences of exceptional quality and depth. Our fun, relaxed atmosphere and caring staff provide a supportive environment for individual growth in self-confidence, independence, and awareness of others. Each child's contributions are valued in a community based on mutual respect and shared adventures.  Learn more about our Colorado summer camps for girls and boys by requesting a catalog and DVD when you see Artie the Abert squirrel!
Surrounded by spectacular wilderness areas and stunning peaks, Big Spring Ranch for Boys and High Trails Ranch for Girls lie at an elevation of 8700 feet in the center of Colorado, 35 miles west of Colorado Springs. The camps own more than 6000 acres of open pine forest, wildflower meadows and rocky bluffs, an unparalleled setting for outdoor adventures.
Each year the camp community consists of campers and staff members from over 40 states and 10 countries, providing opportunities to make new friends from many places.  Our permanent staff of 25 educators and support personnel work throughout the year to provide depth and consistency of programming as well as outstanding well-maintained facilities.
