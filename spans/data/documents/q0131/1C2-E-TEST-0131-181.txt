Arizona has just about every type of camping opportunity available. From the Mountains near Flagstaff, to the deserts of the Colorado River valley, there are great possiblilties.
As mentioned already, Arizona has several National Forests, and you can get info on the rest of them not mentioned already at Arizona US National Forest Service website .
Arizona has a lot of state owned land available for recreation use from motorized to remote area camping. An inexpensive pass is requried and you can get information about it at Arizona Recreation Permit Info
BLM is major land manager in Arizona as well. The state is divided up into districts and are managed by various Field Offices. BLM offers almost unlimited "dispersed camping", and a few developed campgrounds. BLM sites are often underused as they are off the beaten path in many locations. Here is the Arizona BLM website .
There are some great remote camping opportunities at National Wildlife Areas! US Fish and Wildlife Service has some great camping locations available in Arizona. Here is the Arizona US Fish & Wildlife website .
The same is true for state wildlife areas when it comes to camping. Not all wildlife areas permit camping, but you can find the ones that do on the Arizona State Wildlife webside . Search the term camping on that site.
How about camping on the rim of the Grand Canyon. There are some places on the north rim WAY off the beaten path that offer tremendous rewards for the person that wants to explore. Both National Park Service and BLM managed lands mentioned above have possibilities.
These are just some of the resources available to help you find places on your own. For specific recommendations with maps and directions try Arizona RV Camping .
Happy Camping!
