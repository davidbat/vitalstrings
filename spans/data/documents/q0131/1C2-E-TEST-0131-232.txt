Ontario Camps
Quality kids' and summer camps abound
Ontario is fortunate to have many quality camps offering a range of innovative programs. The province's wilderness provides a wonderful location for many Ontario summer camps. Meanwhile, urban settings, with their many cultural, artistic and educational institutions, offer children in Ontario camps that can inspire them to dance like a ballerina, create like a sculptor or invent like a scientist.
Wilderness and nature camps offer children the opportunity to connect with nature, to learn about wildlife and to spend many days in the great outdoors of this beautiful province.
Ontario kids' camps have a long history and tradition.
The first Ontario summer camp was founded in 1900. By 1925, Ontario had many established camps, by both private and community organizations. Today, the Ontario camp spirit remains strong. Camps in Ontario give children the chance to develop, learn important life skills, make lasting friends and discover new interests.
Check out the pages of Our Kids Go to Camp to find out about family camps, residential camps and many other options. We list wilderness camps and other northern Ontario camps in places like Temagami, Renfrew and Huntsville as well as urban Ontario camps in Toronto, Hamilton, London and Ottawa. Our sister site, camps.ca, also features a strong focus on Ontario summer camps (although the listings are the same as what you will find below).
