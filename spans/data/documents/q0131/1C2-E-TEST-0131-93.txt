Why go: When it comes to soaking up the sun in the lap of luxury, there's no better place than the French Riviera. Perched on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, Nice makes for a great home base for a Riviera getaway. If you tire of Nice's museums, shops, sidewalk caf√©s, and pebbly beaches, Cannes , Antibes , and Monaco are just a short train ride away. Just make sure to bring your credit card; if you're going to roll with celebs in the French Riviera this summer, you're going to rack up quite a bill.
