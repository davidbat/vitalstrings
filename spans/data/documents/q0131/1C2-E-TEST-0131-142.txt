Medomak is a weeklong, all-inclusive family camp that runs throughout the summer. Families stay in one-room cabins with private bathrooms. Some comforts include reading lights, rocking chairs, queen beds for the parents, twin beds for the kids, and a writing desk. Activities range from typical camp activities (archery, sailing) to the more atypical (stretch classes, blueberry picking). Medomak also offers events just for parents like gallery visits, local beer and cheese tastings, and sessions with an on site massage therapist. All meals are served family-style in their farmhouse dining room, and--- it is Maine, after all---a lobster dinner is offered once a week. Tuition includes all dining hall meals, lodging, activities, and equipment.
