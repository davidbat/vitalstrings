The Best Places to Go Camping in the US
By Wes Hagan
Camping is a very popular hobby for many families across our country. Taking a family camping joining, the boy scouts, or getting away for the weekends with the boys are all types of trips that involve going camping. Identify the type of experience desired from a trip to help select the perfect venue for a camping trip.
Our nation's national parks are spread out through all corners of country. A great place to go camping is in Yosemite National Park. It is a great family environment and has many locations for different styles of camping. They can accommodate RV's and more traditional tent campers. This park is a great place for an informative family camping trip.
Another great American park is Yellowstone National Park. The national park system was created by President Theodore Roosevelt so all citizens could see the wilderness for all its beauty. Yellowstone National Park can also house RV's and tents. This camping area is safe for families because paid park rangers monitor campers and wildlife on a regular basis.
For more rustic experiences, campers trying to find the best local sites can view a map of public camping areas. It is important to never camp, hunt, or fish on private property because severe fines and penalties can be incurred. When trying to find your own place, factor in fishing and wildlife resources, the locations of ranger stations or towns that are nearby in case of an emergency.
America has one of the greatest systems of national parks in the world. Millions of dollars a year are spent on upkeep and preserving the natural beauty of our landscape so our citizens can enjoy the sights as much as our former President did. When choosing the perfect place to go camping, factor in the environment and who owns the land a campsite is set up on.
