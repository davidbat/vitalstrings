Snowboard Camp
DYK? Windells has hosted more snowboard campers than any other camp on the planet!
For over 24 years, snowboarding has been the backbone of Windells Camp. No expense is spared in the design and upkeep of camp facilities both on and off the mountain. Our Snowboard Camp boasts a Private Park that extends over a mile, has two bag jumps, up to 48 rails, boxes and wall rides, stair cases and jibs, and up to 25 jumps of all shapes and sizes. We have something for everyone! Windells builders are on the cutting edge and the sheer amount of pros riding Windells throughout summer proves their ability. Two private lifts keep riders lapping through our three parks. Last season, Windells campers were riding the 1.5 miles of park well into August. Mt. Hood has never seen a park as long and as awesome as this. You can count on Windells to bring it this summer!
Windells has been an evolutionary stepping stone for the world’s best. We are deeply rooted in the progression of snowboarding. Every US Olympic medalist to date has been through Windells’ snowboard camp program; 18 in all. The top 10 men and 8 of the top 10 women in this season’s Dew Tour were all former Windells campers.
