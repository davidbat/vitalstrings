Re: Best Places to Camp
For the past twenty years I have been tent camping all around the U.S. My family and I are trying to visit at least one campground in every state. We have made it to 33 states so far, our criteria for a great camping spot include the following: mountains/beautiful terrain, hiking trails, weather, and activities at or near the campground.  While we haven't made it to Death Valley or Yellowstone yet, after reading your article they are definitely on our radar. While it's hard to narrow it down to just one, here is a list of our top five places that we have camped at.
Everglades National Park - Florida
Great Smoky Mountains National Park - Gatlinburg, TN
Palomar Mountain State Park - San Diego , CA
Springmill State Park - Mitchell, IN
Lamoine State Park - Ellsworth, ME
