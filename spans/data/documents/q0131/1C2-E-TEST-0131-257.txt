"I just got back from a FEMA Detainment Camp"
There over                600 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and                ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded                by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to                be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should                Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States.
The Rex 84                Program was established on the reasoning that if a mass exodus of                illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be quickly                rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 allowed                many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons.
Operation                Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will                be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper                purpose. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable                Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and                local governments by the federal government. FEMA is the executive                arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations.                The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal                Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation.
The camps                all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from                the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The                majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners.                Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks,                Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility                and can hold approximately 2 million people.
A person                  named Terry Kings wrote an article on his discoveries of camps
located in southern California. His findings are as follows:
Over                the last couple months several of us have investigated three soon-to-be                prison camps in the Southern California area. We had heard about                these sites and wanted to see them for ourselves.
The first                one we observed was in Palmdale, California. It is not operating                as a prison at the moment but is masquerading as part of a water                facility. Now why would there be a facility of this nature out in                the middle of nowhere with absolutely no prisoners? The fences that                run for miles around this large facility all point inward, and there                are large mounds of dirt and dry moat surrounding the central area                so the inside area is not visible from the road. There are 3 large                loading docks facing the entrance that can be observed from the                road. What are these massive docks going to be loading?
We observed                white vans patrolling the area and one came out and greeted us with                a friendly wave and followed us until we had driven safely beyond                the area. What would have happened had we decided to enter the open                gate or ask questions?
This facility is across    the street from the Palmdale Water Department. The area around the Water Department    has fences pointing outward, to keep people out of this dangerous area so as    not to drown. Yet, across the street, the fences all point inward. Why? To keep    people in? What people? Who are going to be it's occupants?
There are                also signs posted every 50 feet stating: State of California Trespassing Loitering Forbidden By Law Section 555 California Penal Code.
The sign at                the entrance says: Pearblossom Operations and Maintenance Subcenter                Receiving Department, 34534 116th Street East. There is also a guard                shack located at the entrance.
We didn't venture into    this facility, but did circle around it to see if there was anything else visible    from the road. We saw miles of fences with the top points all directed inward.    There is a railroad track that runs next to the perimeter of this fenced area.    The loading docks are large enough to hold railroad cars. [lrec]
I wonder what                they are planning for this facility? They could easily fit 100,000                people in this area. And who would the occupants be?
Another site                is located in Brand Park in Glendale. There are newly constructed                fences (all outfitted with new wiring that point inward). The fences                surround a dry reservoir. There are also new buildings situated                in the area. We questioned the idea that there were four armed military                personnel walking the park. Since when does a public park need armed                guards?
A third site                visited was in the San Fernando Valley, adjacent to the Water District.                Again, the area around the actual Water District had fences logically                pointing out (to keep people out of the dangerous area). And the                rest of the adjacent area which went on for several miles was ringed                with fences and barbed wire facing inward (to keep what or who in?) Also, interesting was the fact that the addition to the tops of                the fences were fairly new as to not even contain any sign of rust                on them. Within the grounds was a huge building that the guard said                was a training range for policemen. There were newly constructed                roads, new gray military looking buildings, and a landing strip.                For what? Police cars were constantly patrolling the several mile                perimeter of the area.
From the parking                lot of the Odyssey Restaurant a better view could be taken of the                area that was hidden from site from the highway. There was an area                that contained about 100 black boxes that looked like railroad cars.                We had heard that loads of railroad cars have been manufactured                in Oregon outfitted with shackles. Would these be of that nature?                From our position it was hard to determine.
In searching                the Internet, I have discovered that there are about 600 of these                prison sites around the country (and more literally popping up overnight                do they work all night). They are manned, but yet do not contain                prisoners. Why do they need all these non-operating prisons? What                are they waiting for? We continuously hear that our current prisons                are overcrowded and they are releasing prisoners because of this                situation. But what about all these facilities? What are they really                for? Why are there armed guards yet no one to protect themselves                against? And what is going to be the kick-off point to put these                facilities into operation?
What would bring about a situation that would call into effect the need for                these new prison facilities? A man-made or natural catastrophe?                An earthquake, panic due to Y2K, a massive poisoning, a panic of                such dimensions to cause nationwide panic?
Once a major disaster    occurs (whether it is a real event or manufactured event does not matter) Martial    Law is hurriedly put in place and we are all in the hands of the government    agencies (FEMA) who thus portray themselves as our protectors. Yet what happens    when we question those in authority and how they are taking away all of our    freedoms? Will we be the ones detained in these camp sites? And who are they    going to round up? Those with guns? Those who ask questions? Those that want    to know what's really going on? Does that include any of us? The seekers of    truth?
When first coming across    this information I was in a state of total denial. How could this be? I believed    our country was free, and always felt a sense of comfort in knowing that as    long as we didn't hurt others in observing our freedom we were left to ourselves.    Ideally we treated everyone with respect and honored their uniqueness and hoped    that others did likewise.
It took an intensive year    of searching into the hidden politics to discover that we are as free as we    believe we are. If we are in denial, we don't see the signs that are staring    at us, but keep our minds turned off and busy with all the mundane affairs of    daily life.
We just don't care enough    to find out the real truth, and settle for the hand-fed stories that come our    way over the major media sources television, radio, newspaper, and magazines.    But it's too late to turn back to the days of blindfolds and hiding our heads    in the sand because the reality is becoming very clear. The time is fast approaching    when we will be the ones asking "What happened to our freedom? To our free speech?    To our right to protect ourselves and our family? To think as an individual?    To express ourselves in whatever way we wish?"
Once we challenge that    freedom we find out how free we really are. How many are willing to take up    that challenge? Very few indeed, otherwise we wouldn't find ourselves in the    situation that we are in at the present time. We wouldn't have let things progress    and get out of the hands of the public and into the hands of those that seek    to keep us under their control no matter what it takes, and that includes the    use of force and detainment for those that ask the wrong questions.
Will asking questions    be outlawed next? Several instances have recently been reported where those    that were asking questions that came too near the untold truth (the cover up)    were removed from the press conferences and from the public's ear. Also, those    that wanted to speak to the press were detained and either imprisoned, locked    in a psychiatric hospital, slaughtered (through make-believe suicides) or discredited.
Why are we all in denial    over these possibilities? Didn't we hear about prison camps in Germany, and    even in the United States during World War II? Japanese individuals were rounded    up and placed in determent camps during the duration of the War. Where was their    freedom?
You don't think it could    happen to you? Obviously those rounded up and killed didn't think it could happen    to them either. How could decent people have witnessed such atrocities and still    said nothing? Are we going to do the same here as they cart off one by one those    individuals who are taking a stand for the rights of the citizens as they expose    the truth happening behind the scenes? Are we all going to sit there and wonder    what happened to this country of ours? Where did we go wrong? How could we let    it happen?
