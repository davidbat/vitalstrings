Summer Camp USA
Be part of the great American tradition. As a Summer Camp USA counsellor you can                 look forward to a summer of camp fires, outdoor living and maybe even a glee-style                 sing song!
If you have experience working with children and have an activity or sport you’re                 able to teach, this is an affordable and unforgettable way to spend your summer                 holidays.
Request a                     call back today to chat through your skills, experience and general camp                 info with a member of the summer camp team.

Many Camp Directors start hiring early and like any job application it’s all about                 standing out from the crowd. The sooner you’re interviewed, the quicker we can process                 your application and get it in front of camp directors all over the USA. Book an interview and start                     my application
