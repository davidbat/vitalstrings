Best places to go camping in california?
So my friends and I want to go Camping for our Spring Break and we want to go somewhere that has a lake we can swim in and maybe hike around and just have fun
so if you can help us by any suggestions that would be awesome, Thanks!
P.S. we done want to be in a log cabin or an RV we have our Tents if that helps.....
