CLEVELAND - Frommer's is one of the best-selling travel guides in America, and it has just released its favorite 100 places to take kids this summer.
Two Ohio destinations made the list and lucky for Northeast Ohioans, both are the kinds of places you can return to time and time again, because they are constantly evolving with new attractions. Frommer’s list can be found at bit.ly/wvCSnd
First on the list:
- Cleveland’s Rock N Roll Hall of Fame is a Frommer’s favorite. I found an exhibit that is “Right Here, Right Now.” In fact, that’s the name of the exhibit and it showcases up-and-coming musicians who are creating a buzz. You can find clothing and artwork from the likes of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. Kids will find that way-cool. Here’s a link to the exhibit: http://rockhall.com/exhibits/right-here--right-now/
Also, the Rock Hall offers student projects, including Voice your Choice- a national project that invites students to create their own Inductee class. Check it out on the Rock Hall’s education page. http://rockhall.com/education/
Rock N Roll Hall of Fame tickets: children 9-12/$13. 8 and under are free with the purchase of an adult ticket.
- Cedar Point makes Frommer’s list. New attractions include Dinosaurs Alive featuring 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs. Luminosity is a laser light show that transforms the night sky of Cedar Point. And the new Fast Lane allows you to speed through the line of 20 favorite attractions.
For special hours, tips and family attractions, including height requirements for kids, go to Cedar Point’s Family page at http://www.cedarpoint.com/plan-a-visit/helpful-hints-for-families
