Guide to Choosing Summer Camps
Before sending kids to camp for the day, week, or entire summer, adjust the filters to the left of the comparison based on your response to these considerations:
Does your child have any special interests?
Use the 'Camp Type' filter to view interest-specific camps that focus on sports, education, aviation, archery, etc.
What kind of camp fits your family's summer plans?
Use the 'Camp Length' and 'Cost Per Week' filters to find camps that align with your family's other vacations, work schedules and budget.
Remember to narrow down search results with the 'Location' and 'Youngest Age Admitted' filters for desirable destinations and age restrictions.  With 2,055 summer camps to choose from, we can help find the best one for you.
