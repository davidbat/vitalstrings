Busy parents find free nature retreat, exercise with kids
One of the hardest things about bring a parent for me is finding time to play with my kids. I don't think I'm alone. Whether you work in your home—cleaning, cooking, teaching or running a business from your home-office—or you commute out daily to your office, at the end of the day, escape for play sometimes seems impossible for many parents.
But I've recently found a great escape close to home that offers stress release, exercise, nature exploration and is free! Best of all, my kids actually want to go there!
