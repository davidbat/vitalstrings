-Why                  Rock Climbing?
Indoor rock                    climbing promotes confidence, coordination and balance, muscle                    development, teamwork, problem solving skills, and much more                    in a safe, supportive, and fun environment. We are a safety-oriented                    facility. Our walls are professionally engineered and certified                    by the Climbing Wall Industry Group. All our equipment is inspected                    daily.
It is our privilege to work with your children; SAFETY PERMEATES                    EVERYTHING WE DO.
ARG staff will                    supervise your kids from 9am to 1pm, focusing on the basics                    of climbing safety and climbing technique. We have developed                    a fun curriculum that will foster both physical fitness (climbing                    makes the young ones tired!) and entertaining and engaging                    climbing related activities. Camper to instructor ratio will                    not exceed 8:1.
The bottom line                    is that rock climbing is a lot of FUN. Couple this with                    the direction of enthusiastic group leaders and your child is                    guaranteed a constructive and unforgettable experience.
