From Four Corners the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon to Vegas and Back
From Four Corners the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon to Vegas and BackStarting this adventure at Four Corners is a unique experience. It’s the only place in the country where four states touch (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado), and thus it’s the only spot where you can put your hands and feet in four states at the same time. The place to do just that, Four Corners Monument is just off US 160. Managed by the Navajo Nation, the monument is open for visits from the public.
The area surrounding Four Corners Monument is 25,000 square miles of Native American land on which the Navajo, or Dine, the Ute and the Hopi people live. That means multiple opportunities to explore their rich history, with two options for the journey from Four Corners to Las Vegas going through Flagstaff, AZ.
The first takes you west through the lush Chinle Valley across US 160 until its junction with US 191. Drive south on US 191 to Chinle, the gateway to Canyon de Chelly National Monument. One of the longest continuously inhabited sites in the U.S., the canyon once was home to the Anasazi, now known as the Ancestral Puebloans, and features ruins, trails and two scenic drives.
The next stop is the town of Ganado, home of the Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, a 19th-century trading post, which offers a museum, Navajo goods for sale and a farmer’s market in the fall. The town of Window Rock, miles to the east of Ganado via Arizona 264, plays host to the annual Navajo Nation Fair.
When you reach Interstate 40, you’re now on Historic Route 66, so it’s fun to keep your eyes peeled for markers and original or refurbished diners and lodgings. Drive west toward Petrified Forest National Park for the largest collection of petrified wood in the world, with its miles of views, dramatic overlooks, and hiking. From there, the cities of Holbrook and Winslow, AZ, offer opportunities to resupply as well as to visit museums and shop for Navajo and Hopi crafts before coming into Flagstaff.
Your other option from Four Corners runs past dramatic red cliffs along US 160 toward Kayenta, the gateway to Monument Valley. If you have the time, Monument Valley is worth the 31-mile drive north of the town on US 163. Also, in the most unlikely of locations, a museum dedicated to the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II resides in the Kayenta Burger King along US 160.
