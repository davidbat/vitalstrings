Recommended Places in the USA to Visit during      Summer
Arizona
Phoenix
Phoenix (pronounced FEE-nicks) is located    in central Arizona about 150 miles south of Flagstaff and 150 miles north of    Tucson. It is situated on a broad, flat desert basin amid scattered barren rocky    mountain peaks. It is a large sprawling city that has expanded to envelop the    surrounding communities of Scottsdale, Mesa, Tempe, Glendale and Sun City. It    has a small downtown area containing a few dozen high-rise buildings surrounded    by a large metropolitan area that has expanded outward rather than upward. Phoenix    has attracted many retired people who come to enjoy the year-round warm climate,    the dry desert atmosphere and the relatively modest cost of living. Unfortunately,    this popularity has given rise to increased population density, urban sprawl    and traffic congestion. Nevertheless, Phoenix and the surrounding areas retain    a pleasant arid climate free of the rains and mosquitoes in Florida and without    the exorbitant cost of living in Southern California.
There are many things to see in Phoenix    and the surrounding area. The Desert Botanical Museum has a wonderful collection    of desert plants from arid regions around the world. It is a great place to    learn about the flora of the southern Arizona desert. The museum is located    near the popular Phoenix zoo, which contains a fine exhibit of animals living    in the surrounding desert. Heard Museum features Native American culture and    art including an extensive collection of artifacts that depict the lifestyle    of local indigenous people. Deer Valley Rock Art Center is dedicated to the    preservation and interpretation of petroglyphs or prehistoric Native American    rock art. Pueblo Grande Museum features an archeological site revealing some    of the ancient dwellings. These attractions in addition to the Mining and Mineral    Museum and the Chicano Museum help form a complete depiction of the Central    Arizona heritage.
Tucson
Tucson (pronounced Too-sawn) is small    city located in southern Arizona about 100 miles south of Phoenix and 60 miles    north of the Mexican border. It is situated on a flat desert valley nearly surrounded    by barren, rugged mountains. Like Phoenix, it has become a retirement community    for elderly citizens that appreciate the year-round warm weather and inexpensive    living. It is less congested than Phoenix and well situated for tourists wishing    to explore the many surrounding attractions. The climate in Tucson is always    dry with temperatures ranging from warm to extremely hot. The city normally    receives less than 25 cm of rainfall per year. Daytime temperatures can exceed    45 deg. C during the Summer with a much more pleasant 20 - 25 deg. C during    the winter months. High tourist season extends from November through March.    Fall and Spring are good times to visit this area if you want to avoid the tourist    crowds.
The surrounding desert is filled with    giant Saguaro cactuses that stand up to 10 meters high. (pronounced Sa-war-owe)    You can drive through forests of these cactuses or hike the many trails in Saguaro    National Park located just outside of the city. The Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum,    located about 15 miles west of the city near Old Tucson at the southern entry    to Saguaro National Park, is a great place to experience the flora and fauna    of the surrounding desert. It is open 8:30AM until 6PM daily and admission costs    about $9. Old Tucson is a simulated western town originally constructed as a    film set for cowboy movies. Today it is a theme park with entertainment, restaurants,    gift shops and many actors dressed in western costumes. It is open daily from    10AM until 5PM. Admission is about $15. It can be great fun to experience this    tourist oriented cowboy theme park, but probably think Tombstone is much more    authentic.
Tombstone, Arizona is an hour-and-half    drive from Tucson across the desert and into the sparsely populated rangelands    that still support numerous cattle ranches. It is an authentic, old-west, gold-mining    town best known as the site of the "Gunfight at the OK Corral". Main    street has been restored as it was in 1881 when Wyatt and Virgil Earp along    with Doc Holliday killed Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers in the famous    shootout at the OK Corral. Most of the old buildings now contain restaurants,    gift shops and tourist attractions, and the OK Corral has been enclosed and    converted to a museum. Along the streets, actors in western costumes promote    gunfight shows, old-west museums, saloons and stagecoach tours of the town.    You can visit "Boot Hill", the graveyard at the edge of the town where    250 residents of Tombstone were buried, most of them murdered, killed by Apache    Indians, shot in gunfights, lynched or legally hanged. Billy Clanton and the    McLaury brothers are buried there. Tombstone is very tourist oriented, but it    is an authentic old west town well worth seeing. There is no admission charge    to visit the town or Boot Hill.
The mission San Xavier del Bac is located    nine miles south of Tucson on the O'odham Indian Reservation. This eighteenth    century mission is an excellent example of early Spanish colonial architecture    and is still used by the local inhabitants for daily religious services. About    40 miles south of Tucson, the abandoned but well-preserved mission San Jose    de Tumacacori is a National Historical Monument. It is located near the old    Spanish settlement of Tubac, which is now filled with shops selling the works    of local artists and craftsmen. Twenty miles further south is the border town    of Nogales, a great place to cross into Mexico for a few hours of shopping.    Like most border towns, it is filled with shops and street vendors selling native    pottery, jewelry, leather goods and gifts at very reasonable prices. Be careful    where you eat and drink in any Mexican border town, as the water supply and    sanitation may be lower quality than you normally expect.
For a very different experience, visit    the Pima Air Museum just south of the city. In addition to viewing their wonderful    collection of military and civilian aircraft, you can take guided tours of the "Boneyards" at neighboring Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Over 5000    military aircraft including hundreds of huge B-52 bombers awaiting destruction    are parked in endless rows at the Aerospace Maintenance and Reconstruction Center    (AMARC). It is hard to even imagine so many aircraft parked in one place. There    are huge open pit copper mines near Sahuarita just south of Tucson and in Bisbee    south of Tombstone. Both mines offer public tours. A 29-mile road winds its    way up the Catalina mountains to the 3000-meter high peak of mount Lemmon where    temperatures average 10 deg. C lower than the city below.
La Fiesta de los Vaqueros Rodeo is held    in late February. The Yaqui Easter Ceremony combining Native American traditions    with Christian beliefs occurs during Easter week in early Spring. The Tucson    International Gem and Mineral Show is held in late February. It is the largest    such event in the world, so hotel accommodations will be hard to find during    those two weeks.
Sedona
Sedona, Arizona is one of the most beautiful    vacation locations in the USA. It has been revered as a magnificent spiritual    haven since prehistoric times. Native Americans have been coming to Sedona for    their religious ceremonies, their spiritual awakenings, their rites of passage    and their weddings for hundreds of years. The first time you visit this marvelous    valley with its awe inspiring beauty, you will understand why it has been venerated    for so long. Red sandstone cliffs rise a thousand feet above the valley floor.    Buttes, mesas and pinnacles of rock rise throughout the valley. Everywhere the    rocks have been eroded into fantastic shapes resembling giant fortresses, towers,    pinnacles and other exotic visages. The village of Sedona is located in the    midst of this scenic splendor surrounded by cascading mountain streams, lush    green meadows, and forested hillocks all dominated by the imposing red rock    formations.
The Grand Canyon, just a 90 minute drive    to the north, is similar to Sedona but on a much larger scale. Other geological    attractions like Yosemite Valley are equally magnificent. Yet, no other scenic    attraction is as accessible as Sedona. You can drive through the valley absorbing    the scenic views from your car. You can bike or hike through the canyons and    explore the rock formations. You can golf in the shadows of the red rock cliffs    or even photograph the exotic formations from your hotel window. Sedona is located    in northern Arizona just a 30 minute drive southwest of Flagstaff and less than    90 minutes from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. It is only two hours drive    north of Phoenix. You can easily fly to Flagstaff or Phoenix and drive to Sedona.    The valley is about 4,500 feet (1.500 meters) above sea level. The climate is    semi arid, so it gets little rain or snow, but it has a plentiful supply of    water from the nearby mountains. Summers are a bit milder and winters a bit    colder than the low altitude deserts near Phoenix.
Sedona reputedly is the location of several    universal vortexes that provide spiritual healing and metaphysical enlightenment.    New age advocates come to this beautiful valley seeking spiritual and physical    rejuvenation. You can easily visit some of these vortexes and sit on the rocks    absorbing the metaphysical energy sources. But probably, a bottle of good wine    helps. Shops and boutiques in the village sell power crystals, Indian amulets,    copper bracelets and other spiritual appliances. Many of the resorts and spas    offer yoga classes and various esoteric spiritual regimens in addition to the    usual massages, facials and traditional cures. A wide selection of accommodations    is available in the village of Sedona with some exclusive resorts located in    nearby canyons and some tourist cabins and camping along Oak Creek Canyon. There    are plenty of restaurants, groceries, gas stations, boutiques and souvenir shops    in Sedona. It has a small airfield located atop a mesa overlooking the town.    The airport offers some airplane and helicopter tours of the area and a limited    number of charter flights to nearby locations.
The scenery in and around Sedona is spectacular    and most of it is easily seen from the various roads throughout the area. Oak    Creek Canyon is the main entry to Sedona from Flagstaff. This road follows Oak    Creek through a narrow defile of colorful rock walls as is cascades beneath    towering pine trees. In many places, this canyon is only a few hundred feet    wide (100 meters) with red, pink, brown and white rock walls rising a thousand    feet (350 meters) or more on either side. Airport road climbs to the top of    the mesa overlooking the village of Sedona. The airport parking lot offers a    great panoramic view of the town, the valley and many of the spectacular rock    formations. Visitors flock here at sunset to watch the red rocks become inflamed    in glowing scarlet from the rays of the setting sun. Near the bottom of airport    road, a small parking place provides access to a short trail up onto a large    rounded rock that is supposedly the location of one of the universal vortexes.    New age advocates and bemused tourists often flock to the top of this rock to    absorb the metaphysical energies of the vortex. Bell rock, Cathedral Rock, the    Coffeepot, the Soldiers, Chimney rock and numerous other formations are easily    visible from many parts of the village. The magnificent Holy Cross Chapel sits    atop a rocky spine overlooking the eastern end of town. It provides a magnificent    view of the valley and is a spectacular piece of architecture. There are plenty    of other fabulous locations for weddings in Sedona.
If you are adventuresome, you can attempt    a drive up Schnebley Road, the original roadway into this isolated valley from    Flagstaff. It is paved for only about one mile, but its unpaved portion extends    another seven miles up through a spectacular canyon with fantastic views of    the valley and many immense red rock formations until it culminates on the rim    of the cliffs thousands of feet above the valley. It can be rough driving at    certain times of the year. If you prefer, you can sign up for one of the jeep    tours that will take you up this scenic route. Walking, hiking, bicycle touring    and horseback riding are some favorite activities for visitors to Sedona. You    can rent mountain bikes or riding horses at several locations in and around    the town. The rangers at the visitor centers will provide you with free maps    indicating all of the trails and will cheerfully offer advice on the best routes.    You can take airplane rides, helicopter tours, balloon adventures, jeep tours,    hummer tours or horseback rides in Sedona. There are numerous tourist adventures    available from the many tour operators in Sedona. If you are less inclined to    adventurous activities, the many resorts and spas will provide you with plenty    of pampered luxury. Some of them have golf courses, swimming pools and tennis    courts within the very shadows of the spectacular red rock cliffs. Shopping    and dining are also favored activities in Sedona. It provides plenty of choices    in both. Designer shops, boutiques and quality restaurants abound in this little    village. Some of them can be rather expensive, but there are plenty of moderately    priced alternatives as well.
The quaint reconstructed mining town    of Jerome sits high upon the flanks of a mountain about 30 miles west of Sedona.    The Ghost town of Gold Queen is next to it. You can drive there in less than    one hour. It makes a nice half-day excursion from Sedona. Flagstaff is less than an hour northeast. It offers shopping malls, cultural activities and all    the amenities of city life. Old route 66 once passed through Flagstaff, and    you can still find some of the original flavor of the mother road in the nearby    town of Williams. Sunset Crater, the great hole caused by a meteor impact is    near Flagstaff. You can visit the Grand Canyon by driving two hours north of    Sedona to the South Rim Visitors Center. It is an easy day trip, but it is worth    spending more than a single day to see that magnificent sight. If you prefer,    you can even drive to Williams Arizona on old route 66 and take the Grand Canyon    Railway to the South Rim Visitors Center.
California
San Francisco
San Francisco is on the coast of California    about 400 miles north of Los Angeles. It is situated along the shore of a large    bay sheltered behind the California Coastal Mountains. The city is renown for    its steep streets with panoramic views of beautiful San Francisco bay and the    surrounding mountains. It has a very moderate climate with warm summers and    chilly winters but without extremes. Constant breezes off of the Pacific Ocean    keep the summers from becoming too hot and also prevent freezing winter weather.    Take a sweater, as the evening breezes can be quite brisk all year round!
Oakland and Berkley, California lie just    across the bay from San Francisco and are easily accessible via the Bay Bridge.    The more famous Golden Gate Bridge spans the narrow inlet that extends from    the Pacific Ocean into the bay. The Golden Gate Bridge connects San Francisco    with a mountainous peninsula called the Marin headlands that is primarily known    for beautiful scenery and expensive homes with spectacular views. Sausalito,    a small village on the bay shore of the Marin headlands is famous as a local    artist's community. Alcatraz Island with its abandoned prison is situated in    the middle of San Francisco Bay. The city of San Jose lies about 30 miles south    of San Francisco at the southern tip of this extensive bay. The area near San    Jose and Santa Clara is known as "Silicon Valley", home of the largest    concentration of electronics and computer firms in the USA. San Francisco was    founded in 1776 when father Junipero Serra constructed the mission San Dolores    to Christianize the local native Indian population. At the same time, Spanish    troops constructed a Presidio, or fort, to protect this colony for the Queen    of Spain. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the village of Yerba Buena,    consisting of whalers, traders, adventurers and pirates, occupied the present    site of San Francisco. In 1848, gold was discovered in the foothills of the    Sierra Nevada Mountains about 100 miles to the east. By 1849, San Francisco    was inundated with "forty-niners" as the gold seekers were commonly    called, and the population of the city exploded. Ever since, it has remained    the center of commerce, entertainment, culture and tourism for Northern California.
San Francisco is one of the most popular    vacation destinations in the USA. Steep streets lined with Victorian era houses,    a great turquoise bay surrounded by low mountains, and antique cable cars that    still shuttle passengers up and down the city slopes all make San Francisco    one of the most picturesque cities in the US. The city has developed a unique    character from its mixture of diverse cultures including Native American Indians,    Spanish colonials, gold seeking adventurers and numerous European, African and    Asian immigrants. This is reflected in the great San Francisco cuisine found    in the many fabulous restaurants of the city. Among the many attractions of    San Francisco are the ethnic neighborhoods like Chinatown and Japantown with    their traditional shops and restaurants. Each of these communities houses a    large population of Asian immigrants and has a unique oriental character. North    Beach is renown as an Italian neighborhood, the Mission District as a Hispanic    community and Castro Street for its gay and lesbian population.
The Embarcadero, a broad avenue along    the bayfront, is now lined with shops, restaurants and tourist attractions including    several piers that have been converted to specialty shopping malls. Most famous    is the historic Fisherman's Wharf which still hosts a fleet of working fishing    vessels as well as fish markets, seafood restaurants and gift shops. Excursion    boats and ferries depart from piers near Fisherman's Wharf. They are a great    way to see the sights around the bay. The Alcatraz tour takes you to "The    Rock" and allows you to visit its abandoned prison. This trip usually fills    up, so it is best to make your reservations at least one day ahead. You can    also take a ferry to visit the USS Hornet Aircraft Carrier Museum in Oakland,    or you can ride a ferry to Sausalito and Tiburon for some sightseeing and shopping.    A cable car line terminates a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf, and many tourists    congregate there to watch the motormen manually rotate the cars. This is a good    place to photograph the cable cars but not a good place to board one as the    wait can be long. It is easier to take a bus or taxi to the downtown area where    you can quickly board a passing cable car. Golden Gate Park and Seal Rocks,    along the Pacific side of the city are worth visiting.
Other California tourist attractions    are located near San Francisco. Across the Golden Gate Bridge, the first pullout    on the right provides a nice view of the city from across the bay. If you follow    the small road under the highway and climb the mountain behind the bridge, you    will be rewarded to some spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the    bay area. From the top of the mountain the road continues high above the Pacific    Ocean with pullouts at many scenic vistas and hiking trails. This road eventually    leads to Stinson Beach, a popular Pacific Ocean swimming and surfing area, and    to Muir Woods, an impressive reserve of Giant California Redwood trees. Beautiful    Monterey Bay is an hour-and-half drive south along the scenic Pacific Coast    Highway and Big Sur extends about 100 miles further. Napa and Sonoma valleys,    in the heart of California Wine Country, are just an hour drive north of San    Francisco. The Sierra Nevada Mountains and exquisite Yosemite National Park    are within a half-day drive to the east.
The downtown area of San Francisco is    the center of business, commerce and shopping. There are a wide variety of large    department stores and smaller shops near Union Square and a big shopping mall    on Market Street. The Embarcadero especially in the Fisherman's Wharf area offers    many small shops, specialty stores and tourist attractions. Chinatown and Japantown    have many small shops specializing in oriental artifacts and Asian foods. Sausalito    and Tiburon across the bay have many boutiques, art galleries and specialty    shops. For serious shoppers, the immense "Great Mall of the Bay Area" in Milpitas, near San Jose is a wonderland of factory outlet stores. There are    also a few outlet malls in Sonoma Valley near wine country and several in the    Monterey Bay area.
Los Angeles
Los Angeles is the largest city in California    and the second largest city in the USA. It is located on the southern coast    of California about 75 miles (120km) north of the Mexican border and 400 miles    (600km) south of San Francisco. The original name of the city was "El Pueblo    de Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles" or "The Village of Our    Lady the Queen of Angels", but the name was shortened for obvious reasons.
Los Angeles is situated on an irregularly    shaped coastal plain about 30 to 60 miles across. It is bounded on the west    by nearly 60 miles of Pacific Coast beaches and ocean cliffs. The San Gabriel    and San Bernardino Mountains form a 2500-meter high wall to the east. The Santa    Monica Mountains define its northern limit and the Santa Anna Mountains define    the southern. Los Angeles natives inhabit the entire plain and all the local    hills plus the sides of the mountain ranges and into all of the connecting valleys.    The city now covers over 1000 square-miles in dozens of interconnected communities.    High-rise buildings only exist in a few isolated clusters. From nearly every    vantage point, you can gaze across miles of low rooftops with palm trees towering    above. In order to commute between these widely dispersed neighborhoods, Los    Angeles has constructed a remarkably efficient system of broad streets and avenues    including the10-14 lane wide freeways. These enable you to quickly navigate    across the vast metropolitan complex most times. Try to avoid the freeways between    7 to 9 AM and 4 to 6 PM. when millions of cars commuting to and from work clog    the roads. Air pollution from these millions of cars combines with the moist    air from the Pacific Ocean to form a dirty gray haze known as Los Angeles Smog.    Unlike most cities, Los Angeles does not have a distinct urban center. It is    a collection of individual communities tied together by a complex network of    roads and freeways. Each community offers a uniquely different character. Together,    they make up this huge metropolitan complex called Los Angeles.
Along the Pacific shore, Malibu, Santa    Monica, Marina Del Rey and Palos Verde are high-class residential beach communities.    Venice Beach, on the other hand, is known for bikini clad roller bladers, muscle-bound    weight lifters and an odd assortment of slightly off-beat characters. Long Beach    is a thriving seaport with a vibrant commercial district and oil wells. Laguna    Beach houses a large artist's community. Hollywood is the historic home of the    old movie studios, and Beverly Hills is still the home of the movie stars. Here    you can drive along the western terminus of historic route 66 on Santa Monica    Boulevard. You can stroll along famous Hollywood Boulevard and the Sunset Strip.    In nearby Burbank, you can visit many modern movie and television studios. In    Anaheim, you can see the original Disney Land and Knott's Berry Farm. Downtown    is certainly a commercial district, but it is no more the urban center of the    city than many other neighborhoods. Near the downtown area are ethnic neighborhoods    with large Asian populations called, Korea Town, China Town and Japan Town.    Nearby are several predominately Afro-American neighborhoods and many predominately    Hispanic-American neighborhoods. Los Angeles has four major airports; Los Angeles    International, Burbank-Glendale Airport, John Wayne Airport and Ontario International    Airport. In addition, the Orange County Airport is less than one hour from the    city and San Diego Airport is within a two-hour drive.
San Diego
San Diego lies along the southern coast    of California near the Mexican border. It is 125 miles (200 km) south of Los    Angeles and about 600 miles (1.000 km) south of San Francisco. It is situated    along the shores of a large bay sheltered behind several low-lying peninsulas.    This great natural harbor enticed the Spanish missionary Father Junipero Serra    to found the first of his series of 21 missions here in 1769. During the Second    World War, the US Navy established its primary Pacific naval base and naval    airfield at San Diego. Today, San Diego is the second largest city in California.    It is a large modern metropolitan center, a year-around tourist resort and a    thriving commercial seaport with a large naval base. Despite its size, San Diego    seems less congested and frenzied than Los Angeles. It has a very hospitable    climate with comfortable temperatures in all seasons. During the winter, days    are usually warm and sunny and the nights are cool. In the summer, a pleasant    breeze off of the Pacific Ocean moderates the heat from the tropical sun. It    does not suffer from the problems of air pollution, which plague Los Angeles.    San Diego has spread north and south along the coast and eastward into the foothills    of the mountains and now encompasses several distinct communities. Downtown    San Diego is a combination of high-rise hotels, modern office buildings and    a restored "Gas Lamp Quarter". Here, you will find a large convention    center alongside an extensive yacht basin, several unique shopping centers and    a wide assortment of restaurants, bars and clubs. Balboa Park, on the eastern    hills skirting downtown, offers a wide assortment of museums, cultural attractions    and one of the best zoos in the USA. San Diego International Airport is located    near the downtown section of the city.
Coronado Peninsula stretches across the    harbor from downtown. It is a beach resort community that offers a wide assortment    of recreational activities like swimming, boating and fishing and many resort    hotels. Mission Bay, just north of downtown, has an extensive shorefront park    with two family amusement facilities: Sea World and Belmont Park. The "Old    Town" section of San Diego to the northeast includes six square blocks    of historic buildings restored to their colonial splendor. There are a lot of    restaurants, clubs, boutiques and souvenir shops in the Old Town area. A bit    further north along the shore lies the beautiful seaside community of La Jolla    with its up-scale shops and exclusive hillside homes. Any trip to San Diego    should include a visit to the beaches on Coronado Peninsula and a stroll through    the historic Coronado hotel. Balboa Park can occupy several days of sightseeing    in the numerous museums and the world-renown Zoo. A trip to old town San Diego    including a tour of the Junipero Serra museum and the reconstructed Mission    San Diego will occupy another day. Add a boat excursion around the harbor, a    stroll along the embarcadero, and a walking tour of the Gas Lamp Quarter, and    you will have spent an enjoyable week touring beautiful San Diego. For the more    adventuresome, there are fishing excursions, hot air balloon rides, and even    air-combat experiences. The main shopping district in downtown centers around    the architecturally unique Horton Plaza Shopping Center and the Gas Lamp Quarter.    Small shops and boutiques are also found along the Embarcadero especially at    the Fisherman's Village. There are numerous small shops in the Old Town district.    The more serious bargain hunters will wish to visit the suburban Mission Valley    Shopping Center and Fashion Valley Shopping center in Mission Valley, the Grossmont    Center in La Mesa or the La Jolla Village Square.
The Mexican City of Tijuana is just ten    miles south of downtown San Diego. It is famous for its bargain shopping and    wild nightlife. Many native handicrafts, especially leather goods, silver jewelry,    pottery and hand woven textiles are available in numerous shops and from thousands      of street vendors. Bargain-priced alcoholic beverages, Cuban cigars and over-the-counter    pharmaceuticals are also readily available. Be sure to check the US customs    restrictions before you attempt to bring such items back across the border into    the USA. When driving into Mexico, you may be required to purchase additional    auto insurance and the traffic delays at the border crossing can sometimes be    quite long. It is easier to take the tram from downtown San Diego to the border    and walk across to Tijuana. You can also drive to the border and park your car    in one of the large parking lots on the US side, then take a bus to downtown    Tijuana. Be careful when purchasing food and drink from street vendors as the    standards of cleanliness are sometimes far less than you may expect.
About two hours drive north of San Diego    brings you to Los Angeles, the largest city in California and a sprawling metropolitan    center that includes Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Long Beach and dozens of other    communities. One hours drive to the east takes you up into the Santa Rosa mountains    with cooler temperatures, vineyards, cattle ranches and vast forests. About    two hours drive to the east brings you back down to the arid desert valley of    Palm Springs and the Salton Sea. Here you will find eternal sunshine, hot temperatures    and affluent oases with golf courses and luxury winter resorts. Another half-hours    drive and you reach Joshua Tree National Monument with its bizarre high altitude    desert landscape and ecology.
Santa Barbara
The city of Santa Barbara is located    on the California coast approximately 90 miles (150 km) north of Los Angeles.    It is somewhat sheltered from Pacific Ocean weather by a group of uninhabited    rocky isles, known simply as the Channel Islands, situated 30 miles to the west    across the Santa Barbara Channel. Its beautiful beaches and sheltered waters    offer a great environment for swimming, boating and sunbathing. A low ridge    of hills with spectacular views of the harbor nearly surrounds the city. Many    beautiful but costly homes adorn these ridges and hillsides. A few miles further    inland, the great wall of the Santa Ynez Mountains forms a picturesque eastern    backdrop. This part of the California Coast is often called the California Riviera,    as it is a beautiful vacation destination but a very expensive place to live.    You can get to Santa Barbara by driving about two hours north from Los Angeles    on Highway 101. On the way, you will pass some great scenery as the road snakes    between the coastal mountains and many isolated surfing beaches. Santa Barbara    Municipal Airport is small, but it hosts a nice selection of daily flights from    many major western cities. Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner train offers a half    dozen trips a day from Los Angeles and San Diego to Santa Barbara.
The major attraction in Santa Barbara    is its beautiful broad beach fringed by rows of palm trees and pristine parks.    It resembles the gorgeous beach at Santa Monica in northern Los Angeles, but    without any of the surrounding congestion, traffic or air pollution. It even    has a long pier accommodating restaurants, shops and amusement attractions.    On a Saturday afternoon in August, this beach had only a handful of sunbathers    scattered about its vast sandy surface. This is what makes Santa Barbara a favorite    weekend getaway destination for residents of all southern California including    many Los Angeles natives. To the north and south of downtown Santa Barbara,    there are numerous narrower beaches ideal for surfing. Near Carpinteria, about    15 miles south of Santa Barbara, Rincon Point is reputedly the finest surfing    spot in California. Several surfing schools in Santa Barbara offer to teach    you how to surf like a real California beach bum in a single day. From the harbor    basin in Santa Barbara, you can rent kayaks or sailboats. You can go on whale-watching    cruises, on fishing charters or on boat excursions to the Channel Islands nature    preserves. You can rent bicycles and pedal cars nearby.
There are no high-rise hotels or beach    condominiums in Santa Barbara. Small classy hotels, restaurants and shops surround    the beach area. All of the streets in town are lined with palm trees and flowering    shrubs. The major shopping and entertainment area is located along State Street    beginning about 6 blocks back from the beach. This city has a wonderful selection    of fine restaurants, boutiques and upscale shopping malls. On weekend nights,    the bars and clubs along State Street offer lively entertainment to both tourists    and local revelers. The city also offers a ballet, a symphony, theaters, museums    and many art galleries. For golfers, there are several beautiful courses near    Santa Barbara with gorgeous palm-lined fairways and year-round golfing weather.    Sightseers will enjoy exploring the Old Spanish Presidio and the Mission Santa    Barbara in the older parts of the city. The courthouse that combines striking    modern design with traditional Spanish colonial features is worth visiting.    From Santa Barbara, it is less than an hour drive over the mountains or along    the coast to the Santa Ynez Valley with its flower farms and wineries. This    is the heart of the California Central Coast wine region where some great Pinot    Noir and Chardonnay grapes are grown. You can visit many of the wineries and    sample some of their vintages.
Solvang, located along route 101 in the    Santa Ynez Valley, is one of the most unique towns in the USA. It is a complete    Danish village with Danish architecture, Danish restaurants and Danish shops.    It is a good place to stop for lunch during your explorations of the Santa Ynez    Valley. The best times to visit the California Riviera are from May through    October. The temperatures for this half of the year are normally warm enough    to lie on the beach and to enjoy other outdoor activities. Swimming in the somewhat    chilly Pacific Ocean waters is always a challenge. During the winter months,    it is usually warm enough for most outdoor activities like golf or tennis, but    a bit too cool for sunbathing or swimming. It never gets too hot even during    mid summer as the ocean breezes keep the temperature very pleasant.
Palm Springs
Palm Springs is an old resort city located    114 miles (190km) east of Los Angeles California. It is located in the upper    Colorado Desert just east of the 10,804 foot (4,500m) San Jacinto Mountain Peak.    This arid desert valley lying in the rain shadow of the Santa Rosa Mountain    Range offers a warmer, dryer and sunnier climate than the city of Los Angeles    less than two hours drive to the west. It was once known for its natural hot-water    springs. Today it is better known for its many beautifully manicured golf courses.    Years ago, Palm Spring was the weekend refuge for many famous Hollywood film    stars and movie moguls. As far back as the silent picture era, it was the place    where the rich and famous sought relief from the Los Angeles smog, and the crowds    of city dwellers. Many Hollywood personalities built their lavish vacation homes    in the desert surrounding Palm Springs. Some of those magnificent villas still    stand as testament to the glamorous days when Palm Springs was the vacation    retreat for Hollywood legends. Many streets, boulevards and civic centers still    bear the names of its famous inhabitants like Frank Sinatra Drive, Dinah Shore    Drive, Gene Autry Trail and the Bob Hope Cultural Center. Palm Springs has grown    from a small desert spa to a conglomeration of intertwined towns that spread    along the Coachella Valley for many miles. Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs,    Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells and Indio are a few    of the many communities that form this fashionable metropolitan area. As you    cruise along highway 111 through these connected villages, you pass endless    developments of expensive homes, lush green golf courses, upscale shopping malls    featuring designer boutiques and trendy restaurants interspersed with thousands    of palm trees.
As you drive interstate highway I-10    east out of Los Angeles, you pass through a narrow gap in the San Bernadino    Mountains known as San Gorgonio Pass. A windmill farm with hundreds of giant    propellers atop slender towers attests to the fact that this geological feature    acts as a funnel for the coastal winds off of the Pacific Ocean. Then you drop    into the flat desert basin of the Coachella Valley and enter the suburban developments    of expensive desert homes, golf courses, swimming pools and palm trees. You    have arrived at Palm Springs and its neighboring villages. Palm Springs has    a small but very beautiful airport with commuter flights from many destinations    in the USA especially from West Coast cities. Taxi fares from the airport can    vary greatly depending on destination. It may cost only $10 to a hotel in nearby    Palm Springs, but a trip to a resort in Indio can be as much as $40. Rental    cars are usually a better choice. There are more flight options at Ontario airport    about one hours drive to the west or at Los Angeles International two hours    drive from Palm Springs. Amtrak, the US passenger rail system, has a station    in Palm Springs but only one train heading west and one train heading east stop    there each day, and those are in the middle of the night. Greyhound offers long-distance    bus service from Palm Spring to Los Angeles and to destination across the USA.
For many years, Palm Springs was known    as the vacation spot for wealthy elderly folks. It was especially renown for    attracting affluent gray-haired gentlemen in green golf pants who spent their    days on the fairways while their very young glamorous escorts lounged by the    hotel swimming pool or shopped in the exclusive designer boutiques in town.    The scene has changed. Young affluent urban professionals from West Coast cities    like Los Angeles have discovered this weekend getaway a few hours from home.    Today, a younger trendier set of tourists can be seen golfing, shopping and    cruising the classy restaurants of Palm Springs. It is once again becoming more    of a party town like it was in the days when the Hollywood elite spent their    free time here.
There are a wide variety of accommodation    options in Palm Springs. You can find elegant resorts that offer spacious rooms,    picturesque swimming pools, tennis courts and private golf courses. You can    also find plenty of modestly priced hotels with similar accommodations in a    slightly less glamorous setting. You can even find a variety of budget priced    hotels. Check our Palm Springs accommodations page to read about some of the     lodging options in the Palm Springs area, to compare the prices and to book    your reservations.
The major attractions in Palm Springs    are its climate, its golf courses and its elegant vacation resorts. Temperatures    can get quite hot during the summer and a bit chilly during the winter, but    the climate is quite pleasant most of the year. Rainfall is always sparse, and    blue cloudless skies are the norm. Tourists from the cold northern states tend    to flock to Palm Springs from January until May. October or November is preferable,    which are usually very pleasant months with less tourist crowds. Golf is a year-round    activity at Palm Springs, and there are over one hundred courses in the area.    The lush green fairways seem so incongruous to the surrounding barren desert.    It takes over on million gallons (4 million liters) of water every day just    to maintain the grass on the golf courses. Swimming pools and tennis courts    are almost as numerous as the palm trees in this area. Palm Springs is typically    a place to relax, play golf and lounge around the pool under a warm desert sun.
Shopping is another popular diversion    in Palm Springs. There are hundreds of shops, designer boutiques, art galleries,    and markets. Most are located on South Palm Canyon Drive. Every Thursday evening    a portion of this main thorofare is closed to all but pedestrian traffic for    an open-air Village Fest. El Paseo in nearby Palm Desert is another shopping    area that has been compared to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills because of its collection    of elite designer shops. If you are a bargain hunter, the Desert Hills Premium    Outlets in Cabazon, about 15 minutes west of Palm Springs features 120 factory    outlet shops. There are a variety of restaurants in Palm Springs and its neighboring    communities. The dining options include everything from very classy fine dining    establishments to modestly priced ethnic cuisine and inexpensive fast food.    The dance clubs and bistros are favorite after-dark hangouts for the trendy    urban professionals that flock to Palm Springs on weekends. Sometimes, you can    even spot a few Hollywood celebrities.
Indian Canyons, located on the tribal    lands of the Agua Caliente natives, is a delightful place to see some of the    great natural beauty of the desert geology and desert foliage. These picturesque    canyons featuring a natural desert oasis provide a great place for walking and    hiking. A rotating aerial tramway located in Chino Canyon can take you up 8,500    feet (2700 meters) to Mount San Jacinto State Park where the temperature is    often 30 degrees cooler and the hiking trails are surrounded by giant redwood    forests. Palm Springs has a Desert Museum and an aircraft museum. Nearby Palm    Desert offers a large Living Desert Zoo and Gardens. Joshua Tree National Park    is only 35 miles east of the city.
Florida
Orlando
Orlando is located in central Florida    75 miles northeast of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater Beach. It is 50 miles    due west of Cape Canaveral, the Kennedy Space Center and Cocoa Beach. Best known    as the home of Disney World, this city is also the center of the largest concentration    of family entertainment attractions in the world. The climate in central Florida    is semi-tropical. Summers are oppressively hot and humid with almost daily afternoon    Thunderstorms. Winters are pleasantly mild with sunny weather and comfortable    temperatures. Hurricane season, between August and December, can produce some    unpleasant weather on the rare occasion when a tropical storm chances to veer    inland in the immediate vicinity. Many US families brave the heat and flock    to Orlando during the summer school holidays from the beginning of June until    the end of August. They invariably fill the hotels, amusement parks and restaurants    with hordes of raucous children. Adult vacationers and retired folks usually    choose the winter months of December through March to visit Orlando. The off    seasons in the fall and spring are often the best times to visit. Two major    airports serve the Orlando area. Orlando International Airport is located 8    miles southeast of downtown. It has numerous daily fights to major cities throughout    the USA. Orlando Sanford Airport is situated about 15 miles north of downtown.    It serves numerous charter airlines from overseas destinations. The Tampa St.    - Petersburg airport is less than two-hour drive to the west and the Melbourne    airport is a bit over an hour to the east. Airport buses provide convenient,    inexpensive transportation to downtown Orlando and an airport van service provides    quick transport to the International Drive area hotels.
Most of the major attractions in the    Orlando area are located along a ten-mile stretch of route 4 southwest of the    city. The Disney Resort Complex is situated along route 4 ten miles southwest    of downtown. Universal Studios is located just 5 miles southwest of downtown.    Sea World, Wet and Wild, plus many other attractions, numerous hotels, hundreds    of restaurants and several shopping malls are all located along route 4 between    those two giant theme parks. Check our Orlando Attraction Map to view the locations.    The Disney Resort Complex is immense. With over 40 square miles (100 square    km.) of land, it is the size of a small country or at least a province. It contains    four major theme parks. Each of them is equivalent in size to the Disney parks    located in California, France or Japan. The complex also contains three water    parks, eight golf courses, twenty-five themed hotels, hundreds of restaurants,    several shopping centers and a wide variety of additional entertainment and    recreational sports facilities. Universal Studios Great Escape contains two    major theme parks, a luxury hotel and an assortment of restaurants and shopping    facilities. Sea World has a marine theme park and will soon be adding a water    park with a dolphin encounter experience. Wet and Wild is a major water park.    There are dozens of other attractions in this area and along route 192 in Kissimmee,    5 miles east of Disney World.
Accommodations are concentrated in and    around the major theme parks, all along this stretch of route 4 and along route    192 in Kissimmee. There are additional accommodations near downtown Orlando,    in the vicinity of the two airports and scattered throughout the area. Disney    Resorts has at least 18 different hotel and vacation home complexes within its    realm with 7 more just outside the main gates. Each has a different historic    or geographic theme with prices varying from moderate to very expensive. There    are no budget accommodations at Disney, but all the facilities are very nice    and all include free access to the convenient Disney internal transportation    system. Lake Buena Vista offers a number of moderate to expensive hotels near    the entrance to Disney Resorts. The ten-mile stretch of route 192 between Disney    World and the town of Kissimmee is lined with moderate and budget priced accommodations    along with a wide array of restaurants, shops and entertainment facilities.    You can still find hotel rooms in the $25 to $50 range along this highway. Universal    Studios offers luxury accommodations at its Portofino Bay hotel on-site and    is currently constructing a second hotel. There are large concentrations of    moderate priced hotels in this area especially along International Drive and    near the exits of route 4.
In addition to the major theme parks    and water parks, Orlando provides a wide variety of family entertainment options.    For typical Florida diversions, We recommend that you visit Gatorland with its    vast collection of native alligators and crocodiles and its "gator-wrestling" shows or that you try an airboat ride through the swamps at Boggy Creek Airboats.    For adventure and excitement, try a hot air balloon ride with Orange Blossom    Balloons or a high-speed spin in a genuine NASCAR racer at the Richard Petty    Driving Experience. Even dining can become an adventure in Orlando. Theme dinner    shows such as Medieval Times provide you with entertainment like jousting tournaments    and sword fights while feasting. The dinner show themes run from Medieval to    Cowboy, Arabian Nights, Gangster or Broadway Show motifs.
There are great concentrations of souvenir    shops, boutiques, specialty stores and shopping malls in the theme-park strip    along route 4 southwest of downtown. You will find shops scattered throughout    the major theme parks and in the hotel complexes. Disney also offers a variety    of shopping at its downtown area. Universal does the same at its City Walk.    There are many shops and malls in Lake Buena Vista or along route 192 to Kissimmee    and along International Boulevard near Universal Studios. Additional shopping    centers are concentrated in downtown Orlando at Church Street and in the suburban    communities of Altamonte Springs and Winter Park. For serious shoppers, there    are two very large Belz Factory Outlet Malls at West Oakridge Road and along    International Drive. Orlando Premium Outlets and the Lake Buena Vista Factory    Stores are outlet malls located near Disney World.
Miami
Miami is located on the Atlantic coast    of Florida at the southern tip. It is warm year around and usually very hot    and humid during the summer months. Most tourists prefer to visit during October    through April. Outdoor sports and swimming are open all seasons, so be sure    to take your swimming suit and plenty of cool clothing. A sun hat and a good    sunscreen are essential even in the winter months. In Miami, dress is always    casual, with sundresses, jeans or walking shorts appropriate during the day.    A few higher-class restaurants require jackets and ties, but most do not. Hundreds    of thousands of Hispanic immigrants from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Central America    and South America have settled in Miami. Spanish is spoken almost everywhere    in the city. Many signs are in both English and Spanish especially those near    the Latin district known locally as "Little Havana". Cubans originally    settled in the area around Calle Ocho Street (Southwest Eighth Street) more    than 20 years ago. Today, this colorful area embraces immigrants from all over    Latin America.
Miami and Miami Beach are actually two    distinctly different cities. Miami Beach, located on the outer bank is almost    exclusively tourist orientated, and consists mainly of hotels and vacation apartments.    Miami, located on the mainland, is a cosmopolitan city with a distinctly Latin    American flavor. The Art Deco district of Miami Beach occupies a compact one-square    mile area roughly between Lincoln Road, Sixth Street, Ocean Drive and Alton    Road. It is a showcase for this early twentieth century art movement and contains    dozens of restored buildings with that characteristic architecture. To help    find your way around, visit the Miami Design Preservation League's Welcome Center    on 1001 Ocean Drive (305) 672-2014. Pick up the league's audiocassette for a    self-guided introduction to the Art Deco Historic District. The South Beach    section, where fashion designer Gianni Versace lived and died, is one of the    trendiest neighborhoods in the world.
If you can tear yourself away from the    beach, you might want to visit the Parrot Jungle and Gardens, the Monkey Jungle,    the Metrozoo, Vizcaya (a fabulous Italian Renaissance-style villa), the Metro-Dade    Cultural Center, or the Holocaust Memorial. You can also take tours by boat,    plane, helicopter, walking or driving. All sorts of water sports are available    like boating, fishing, skin diving, snorkeling and water skiing. Golf and tennis    are popular. Horse racing, greyhound dog racing and Jai alai are favorite spectator    sports. Miami Beach provides plenty of nightlife. The large hotels have elaborate    stage shows and the Art Deco District is filled with bars and nightclubs. Find    a free copy of "This Week in Miami-Miami Beach" at any hotel. It will    list all of the current shows and entertainment attractions. Both Miami and    Miami Beach offer many excellent restaurants with a diverse selection of cuisine.    Fresh seafood is the local specialty. Joe's Stone Crab restaurant is a very    popular Miami Beach landmark known for its large portions of excellent food.    Wherever you eat, be sure to try some Key Lime Pie, a famous Florida dessert.    There are plenty of good shopping opportunities in the Miami area. For exclusive    shopping, go to the Ball Harbor Mall. Other shopping centers include Bayside    Market Place, Coconut Grove, The Falls, Aventura Mall and Cocowalk. If you are    a serious bargain hunter, don't miss the 173-store Sawgrass Mills Factory Discount    Mall in Sunrise, Florida 40 min north of the city. In the Little Havana area,    there are many small shops with unusual and interesting items, but you may have    to speak Spanish to get the best deals. There are two large National Parks near    Miami. The Everglades National Park is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness    in the USA. It has more than 1.5 million acres of natural habitat with over    half of it under water. The main entrance is reached via Florida City south    of Miami. It is open all seasons. Biscayne National Park is also reached by    traveling south through Homestead. It consists mainly of unspoiled coastline,    islands, crystal-clear ocean waters and coral reefs. The majority of Biscayne    Park is under water along the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula and around    the northern keys. If you visit either park, remember to take your mosquito    repellent and sunscreen!
Tampa, Saint Petersburg and Clearwater
Tampa, Saint Petersburg and the beachside    community of Clearwater are all located around Tampa Bay on the western coast    of central Florida. They are within two hours drive of Orlando, Disney World,    Universal Studios and the surrounding entertainment complexes. This is a popular    beach resort area for families that come to Florida to see the Orlando attractions.    The Gulf Coast along the western side of the Florida Peninsula has a very different    character than the eastern Atlantic Coast. The fine sand beaches are equally    nice on both coasts, but they are usually shallower with warmer waters on the    Gulf side. There is very little surf on the gulf, so it attracts fewer young    revelers and has less wild amusements. The gulf coast is favored by family vacationers    and retired folks.
Downtown Tampa lays at the northern end    of a great shallow bay a few miles inland from the coast. It is a large metropolitan    center with many commercial buildings, offices and retail establishments. Clearwater    is a beachside community just west of downtown on the gulf coast. It has a many    hotels, motels, restaurants and tourist attractions. It also has a fishing harbor    with many excursion boats and fishing charters. Saint Petersburg is just south    of Clearwater on the peninsula extending between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.    Saint Pete is less commercial than Clearwater. It has fewer hotels but many    condominiums and beachside apartments. It has a lot of quiet neighborhoods with    private homes and vacation rentals. If you like to be at a beach near the excitement    and entertainment, choose one of the many hotels in Clearwater. If you prefer    a quieter vacation away from the tourist crowds, rent a condominium or vacation    home in Saint Petersburg where you can be near great beaches and a short drive    from the entertainment in Clearwater and the shopping in downtown Tampa. Tampa    International Airport is located right in downtown Tampa near the causeway to    Clearwater. Several commercial airlines and many charter services land there.    Downtown Tampa and Clearwater are easily accessible via a short taxi ride, and    the airport limo service provides convenient access to St. Petersburg. Orlando    International is a much larger airport with a wider array of domestic and international    flights. It is about a two-hours drive from the Tampa - St. Petersburg area.    Sanford International Airport, with its many international charter flights is    just north of Orlando and about a two and a half hour drive from the Tampa Bay    area.
Tampa attractions include the Tampa Museum    of Art, the Children's Museum of Tampa, the Museum of Science and Industry,    the History Center, the Zoological Gardens and the Museum of African-American    Art. St. Petersburg offers the Salvador Dali Museum, the Museum of History,    several art galleries and numerous parks. Clearwater has an aquarium. Nearby,    Busch Gardens theme park features herds of wild animals that can be viewed on    simulated safaris, and Weeki Wachee Springs amusement park has the world's only    underwater theater. Cypress Gardens, Florida's oldest theme park, still offers    botanical gardens, a butterfly conservatory, amusement rides and their famous    water ski shows. Tarpon Springs, a coastal community about 30 minutes drive    north of Tampa, has an active sponge diving fleet and a thriving Greek community.    It is famous for its restaurants featuring authentic Greek cuisine and its unique    gift shops. Sarasota is less than an hour drive south of Tampa Bay. It is generally    considered the cultural center of Western Florida. Of course, the Tampa Bay    area's most popular attractions are its white sand Beaches especially those    in Clearwater or the quieter beaches in St. Petersburg and the northern suburban    communities. Fishing is another popular activity. The large marina, located    near the Clearwater side of the causeway, has numerous excursion boats and fishing    charters. You can spend a half-day fishing on the Gulf for as little as $25    or you can rent a six-passenger charter for $700. The boats will provide all    of the tackle and will even clean your catch, while a nearby restaurant can    cook it for you. If you prefer fresh water fishing, there are also many inland    charters in the area. Golf is another popular attraction with dozens of area    courses offering year-round recreation. If you prefer spectator sports, you    can find NFL football, NHL hockey, major league baseball, major league soccer,    arena football, horse racing, greyhound racing and Jai Alai.
 
 
Daytona
Daytona Beach is conveniently located    54 miles from Orlando on Florida’s Central East Coast, just an hour’s    drive from many popular theme parks and other favorite tourist destinations.    If you are traveling around Florida, Daytona Beach is easy to reach via Interstate    95 or Interstate 4. Daytona Beach International Airport is served by several    major airlines with service from more than 150 destinations worldwide.
The beach is 23 miles long and up to    500 feet wide at low tide. The gentle slope and tides have packed the hard,    white sands nearest the ocean, enabling automobile access. Of the 23 miles of    beach, 16 miles allow driving and parking during the day and when the tide permits.    The sand becomes softer as one moves further inland from the waterline. Sand    dunes in the area can reach as high as 25 feet. The beach became well known    because it was used as a proving ground for developing the automobile engine.    That technology was also put in use in developing aircraft engines for World    War II fighters. Thus, the world's eyes were on Daytona Beach each time an automobile    raced along the beach in the late '30s and early '40s attempting new land speed    records. From a glamorous Mediterranean-styled villa to intimate beachfront    cottages, the Daytona Beach area is filled with a variety of quality, small    lodging accommodations which provide excellent value and convenience to families    and couples on vacation. Seventy-four small hotels, motels and inns are members    of the Daytona Beach area's Superior Small Lodging program. This program is    a unique accommodations concept that helps visitors choose from the finest small    lodgings this area has to offer. The hotels participating in this program have    no more than 75 rooms and are distinguished by their warm, friendly ambiance    and personalized service. To become a member of the SSL program, each small    hotel must pass an annual inspection and meet quality assurance criteria for    cleanliness, comfort, privacy and safety. Travelers can look for the familiar    SSL logo that designates participating properties.
The Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse Museum,    located at the southernmost point of the area, the lighthouse serves as a faithful    guide to mariners off the Atlantic coast. Historical displays and a gift shop    are located on the grounds. A climb to the top provides a spectacular view of    the Daytona Beach resort area. The Caribbean-themed waterpark and family entertainment    center, Adventure Landing, features three waterslides; a quarter-mile, two-level,    go-kart track; three nine-hole miniature golf courses, and an arcade with over    100 games that feature the latest technology in sports and fantasy video games.    Daytona USA is an interactive motorsports attraction designed to entertain and    inform race fans about the history of motorsports in the Daytona Beach area.    Included in the 50,000 square-foot attraction are opportunities for visitors    to participate in a NASCAR Winston Cup stock car pit stop; design their own    race car; talk to their favorite competitors (via video); take a walk through    the history of Daytona Beach racing and play radio or television announcer by "calling" a race.
Key West
The great peninsula of Florida extends    over 400 miles south from the eastern seacoast of North America. Below its southern    tip, a curved archipelago, consisting of thousands of small islands and coral    reefs, stretches another two hundred miles south and west. It helps to form    a great natural barrier between the South Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.    They call these islands the Florida Keys. Most of them rise only a few feet    above the shallow seabed and are covered with mangrove swamps, shallow beaches    strewn with shells and occasionally a few palm trees. A few islands are large    enough to support thriving villages. In the olden days, these tropical isles    were the refuge of pirates, commercial fishermen, treasure seekers and reclusive    castaways from civilization. Today, you can drive along highway one, hopping    from island to island over hundreds of bridges and causeways, until you reach    Key West over 100 miles southwest of the Florida mainland. As you pass over    the many bridges, you can peer down into crystal clear waters and plainly see    the coral bottom 20 feet beneath the surface with schools of colorful fish swimming    about. It is easy to understand why this is a paradise for snorkeling, scuba    diving and fishing.
Key Largo, the first island south of    Miami and the largest key, contains John Pennekamp Coral Reef Park. The park    is open 8AM until dusk every day and admission is $3.75 per vehicle plus 50    cents per passenger. It would be wise to stop at the shopping center down the    road and buy diving masks before you enter. When you swim at the beach, you    will be amazed by the clarity of the water and the vividly colored tropical    fish swimming around you. The main portions of the coral reef lie several miles    east of the island. You can take a 2.5 hour glass bottom boat tour of the reef    for about $13. If you are more adventuresome, you can take a snorkeling tour    of the reef for about $24. Snorkeling and scuba diving along with sports fishing    are the main attractions all along the keys. Boats of all types and sizes are    available everywhere in the keys. You can rent boats or take guided excursions    for fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving or just plain, island sightseeing. Fishing    excursions can be booked for as little as $25 per person for a half-day on a    large boat or up to $100 per person for a full-day of deep-sea fishing on a    small boat. There are hotels, motels and vacation cottages all along the keys.    Big Pine Key, about 75 miles south of Miami, has commercial camping. There is    a wide selection of accommodations and restaurants at Key West. During the late    summer and early fall hurricane season, you should pay attention to the weather    warnings. There is only one road to Key West and back to the mainland. Getting    stuck on a small island during a fierce tropical storm can be quite uncomfortable    and even frightening. Fortunately, the National Weather Service always provides    ample warning of an impending hurricane.
Panama City
The northwestern extension of Florida    that stretches along the Gulf Coast is usually called the "Panhandle of    Florida". It is less developed than other parts of the state with sparser    population and vast expanses of wild pine forests. The climate is a bit cooler    than the southern parts of Florida but it still offers mild winters, hot summers    and pleasant spring and fall weather. Its beaches are magnificent with warm    shallow waters and fine white sand. The Panhandle attracts fewer tourists, and    remains a favorite "undiscovered" vacation spot for local vacationers    and retired couples from the northern states. Panama City is located along the    coast of the Florida Panhandle about 350 miles northwest of Orlando, Florida    and approximately 350 miles east of New Orleans, Louisiana. It has a small airport    with limited access via commuter flights. There is a much broader selection    of flights going to Fort Walton Beach, sixty miles to the west, to Pensacola,    one hundred miles to the west or to Tallahassee 120 miles to the northeast.    Panama City is a small seaside community with a population of approximately    35,000. It has several large marinas in town and lies adjacent to one of the    finest beaches in Florida. Panama City Beach begins just west of the city and    extends for more than twenty miles along the Gulf of Mexico. Its beaches are    renown for their fine white sand often called "sugar sand" and for    the deep azure-green waters that give this area its nickname of "the Emerald    Coast" Many travel authorities have rated the beaches of Panama City among    the best in the world.
Due to its somewhat isolated location    far from the popular tourist attractions of south and central Florida, Panama    City has remained relatively unspoiled by the tourist crowds. The beachfront    is not dominated by an unbroken wall of high-rise tourist hotels, and there    is still plenty of public access to its beautiful beaches. You can actually    find affordable lodging in small hotels and motels right on the beach. There    are a small number of exclusive high-rise condominiums along the beach and several    more are under construction. Evidently, people are beginning to discover the    unique charms of Panama City Beach, so it may not remain unspoiled much longer.    Saint Andrew Park is situated at the eastern tip of Panama City Beach across    the bay from Panama City. This 1260-acre park contains natural coastal dunes,    wetlands, forests and a large undeveloped island. The entry fee is $2 per person    or $4 per car. It offers swimming at its beautiful white-sand beaches, fishing    from its jetties and piers, camping, hiking and boating. A shuttle service will    take you to nearby Shell Island for a modest fare. Panama City Beach extends    westward from St. Andrew Park for at least twenty miles until it changes its    name to Laguna Beach. The eastern half of Panama City Beach is characterized    by classy condominiums, upscale vacation rentals, restaurants, gift shops, golf    courses and restaurants. The western part of the beach becomes more "honky    tonk" with budget motels, modest vacation rental homes, amusement arcades,    tourist attractions, souvenir shops, convenience stores and fast food establishments.    Laguna Beach becomes more residential with many private homes and vacation rental    units.
The best time to visit Panama City Florida    is between May and October. During the winter months, it becomes a bit chilly    for swimming and sunbathing, but is fine for golf, tennis, biking and other    outdoor activities. From mid March through mid April, several hundred thousands    of college students from around the USA descend on Panama City Beach for their    Spring Break revelries. This is a great time to visit the area if you are looking    for wild parties and a youthful crowd. On the other hand, if you are looking    for a peaceful vacation, you might wish to avoid Panama City Beach at that time.    The primary attraction in this area is the magnificent white sand beaches with    their warm clear waters. Sunbathing and swimming are the most popular activities.    Boating and fishing are also very popular. You can fish from the jetties and    piers along the shore, or you can join a fishing expedition on one of the many    charter boats. Scuba diving and snorkeling are equally popular due to the crystal-clear    warm waters in this part of the Gulf of Mexico. Several businesses in Panama    City and Panama City Beach offer snorkeling adventures, scuba diving expeditions    or charter fishing cruises. Popular year-round activities include golf, shell    gathering, hiking, biking and walking. Shopping is somewhat limited along the    beach with most of the shopping malls and major stores located along Panama    City Parkway and within Panama City.
Most accommodations are located along    the beach. There are also some accommodations in Panama City but they are 15    to 30 minutes drive from the beach. Hotel prices are highly inflated during    March and April due to the Spring Break madness. The rates drop significantly    from mid-September through February. Probably, the best bargain vacations can    be found in late September and October as the weather is normally very nice    and the hotel prices are low.
Sarasota
he City of Sarasota and the surrounding    area are known as the cultural hub of Florida. An abundance of sun, sand and    water provide a stunning backdrop to museums, botanical gardens, wildlife sanctuaries    and professional theater, dance, art and music.

Whatever    your pleasure, the golden gulf coast of Florida has something for everyone.
Silver Springs
Silver Springs is a hidden treasure in    north central Florida that is usually missed by most tourists. It is located    near Ocala, Florida just 75 miles (120 km) north of Orlando. Located at the    headwaters of the Silver river, the springs gush nearly 550 million gallons    (over 2,000 million liters) of crystal clear water every day creating the largest    natural artesian spring formation in the world. The waters of Silver Springs    and the nearby Silver River are so transparent that this has become a favorite    location for the filming of underwater scenes in many movies and television    shows. You can visit Silver Springs and view the underwater creatures in a glass-bottomed    boat, take a jungle cruise, visit the wildlife park, petting zoo and alligator    farm. You can stroll through the botanical gardens, watch an animal show and    listen to a concert. The price of admission is about $30 for the whole day including    all features.

New Jersey
Atlantic City
Atlantic City is located in southern    New Jersey along the Atlantic coast. It is just 60 miles east of Philadelphia,    PA and 115 miles south of New York City. You can easily drive from New York    City to Atlantic City in about two hours. It is less than one hour from Philadelphia    and only three hours drive from Baltimore or Washington DC. One hundred years    ago, Atlantic City was a fashionable summer retreat for the affluent residents    of nearby cities. The wives and daughters of the social elite would escape the    summer heat in the city by moving to their summer homes on the beach. You can    still see their elegant Victorian mansions and beach cottages in the southern    suburbs of Atlantic city. Today, Atlantic City's main attraction is gambling.     The oceanfront is now lined with grand casino hotels. It has become the little    Las Vegas of the east coast. At least a dozen glitzy hotel casinos are located    along the beachside boardwalk. Some of them are quite spectacular, although    on a smaller scale than Las Vegas. They offer entertainment, fine dining and    naturally, gambling. Most of the casinos offer musical variety shows similar    to those found in Las Vegas but at more reasonable prices. Tickets usually cost    about $10 to $25 or about half the price charged in Las Vegas. Often, the Atlantic    City casinos also offer famous name entertainment. Many big-name stars appear    at the Atlantic City casinos for a few shows on the weekends. Tickets to these    shows cost a bit more. (about $25 to $50). It is still much cheaper than Las    Vegas or Broadway. Every year, Atlantic City hosts the Miss America pageant    and frequently, the major casinos hold world-class sporting events such as championship    boxing matches. Tickets may be difficult to find for the really big events.    If you are not a gambler, Atlantic City is still worth visiting. It has a nice    sandy beach for sunbathing and swimming with a broad boardwalk stretching several    miles. The boardwalk includes the usual assortment of restaurants, souvenir    stands, amusement arcades and quaint shops. The Atlantic City casinos are worth    seeing. Their overdone glitzy architecture and massive scale are truly incredible.    You will have no problem finding a nice restaurant and the entertainment opportunities    are excellent. If you are visiting New York City, you can easily take a day    trip or an overnight jaunt to Atlantic City. Excursion buses depart from the    big apple to Atlantic City every day. Many of the major tour bus operators offer    regularly scheduled excursions to Atlantic City for about $25 per round trip.    For a real bargain, find a gambler's excursion bus or van tour. They usually    provide a round trip ticket which includes a free meal at one of the casinos    and a rebate of gambling tokens for nearly the value of your ticket. It is like    getting a free trip!

New Mexico
Santa Fe
Santa Fe, New Mexico, located sixty miles    north of Albuquerque, is a favorite vacation destination in the USA. As the    second oldest city in the United States, it offers a unique mix of history,    architecture, culture, cuisine, outdoor activities and shopping in a setting    that epitomizes the American Southwest. With 65,000 residents, Santa Fe is New    Mexico’s third largest city. It was originally settled by Spaniards before1607,    and is now the oldest state capital city in the United States. Its original    name “La Villa Real de Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asis”, is Spanish    for “the Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi”.    At 7,000 feet above sea level, the city spans nearly 35 square miles in a valley    near the Rio Grande at the southern base of the Rocky Mountains. It is nestled    between the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east and the Jemez Mountains to    the west. Santa Fe can be surprising to first-time visitors who think they will    find a hot, dry desert climate all year-round. While the city is blessed with    abundant sunshine, winters bring sufficient snowfall to makes it a popular ski    destination. Without severe temperature extremes, it offers much to enjoy any    time of the year. The annual Santa Fe Indian Market is held in August. It provides    the opportunity to purchase original works of art directly from 1,200 American    Indian artists who participate from across the country. With the growing interest    in folk art, the city recently launched the Santa Fe International Folk Art    Market, scheduled for July, with artists from 40 countries exhibiting. Spanish    colonial art can be seen and purchased at the Traditional Spanish Market, the    oldest and largest exhibition and sale of its kind in the United States, which    is also scheduled for July. The smaller Winter Spanish Market is held in December.
Allow time to adjust to Santa Fe’s    high altitude and take it easy the first day or so. It is especially important    to drink plenty of water, and to apply plenty of sunscreen even in winter. Albuquerque    International Sunport Airport, about an hour’s drive southwest, is the    closest major airport to Santa Fe. Santa Fe’s smaller Municipal Airport    is served by Great Lakes Aviation with commercial flights from Denver, Colorado.    For a short visit of a few days, no car is needed to enjoy the city’s    major sites. Take a shuttle bus from Santa Fe Municipal or from Albuquerque    Sunport Airport, and stay at one of the many glorious hotels or charming bed    and breakfast establishments close to the Plaza downtown. Most of the historic    sites, restaurants and stores are within an easy walk. For a longer stay, rent    a car and visit some of north central and central New Mexico’s nearby    attractions. Santa Fe boasts the United States’ oldest public building,    church, house and neighborhood. It has 10 major museums and some 200 world-class    art galleries, making it an art and history lover’s paradise. Downtown    Santa Fe is a National Historic District. At its heart is the Plaza. Bounded    by Palace Avenue on the north, Old Santa Fe Trail on the east, San Francisco    Street to the south, and Lincoln Avenue on the west. The park like Plaza is    the main town square. On its north side is the Palace of the Governors, built    in 1610 as Santa Fe’s original capitol building and first major structure.    The one-story adobe spans the block and is the oldest U.S. public building still    in continuous use. The front portal is reserved for Native Americans to sell    their traditional and contemporary jewelry, pottery, sand paintings, and other    arts and crafts. They are there 360 days a year from 8 a.m. to dusk. The Native    American Artisans Program of the Palace of the Governors provides an opportunity    for these talented artists and craftspeople to market their original artwork    in a venue that assures authenticity for the buyer. The goods displayed and    sold by program participants must be made by the seller or by their household    members. East of the Plaza is a turquoise portico with shops, restaurants and    courtyards, and the Sena Plaza. At the end of East San Francisco Street, is    St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral. South on Old Santa Fe Trail is the Loretto    Chapel erected in 1873-1878. Its choir loft staircase which makes two complete    360-degree spiral turns without center or side supports is said to be a “miraculous” architectural achievement. Legend has it that the chapel’s small size    and choir loft height precluded a conventional staircase. Faced with using a    ladder or rebuilding the balcony, the good sisters prayed to St. Joseph, the    patron saint of carpenters, and a carpenter appeared who constructed the staircase    and mysteriously left without payment. Further south on Old Santa Fe Trail is    an area formerly known as Barrio de Analco and part of a National Historic District.    Some homes date to the mid-18th century. On the eastern side of Old Santa Fe    Trail at 215 East De Vargas Street is the oldest house in the United States,    built around 1646. At the corner of Old Santa Fe Trail and East de Vargas is    San Miguel Mission Church, said to be the country’s oldest church structure.    The altar was built by Indians from Mexico in 1610, and mass is still celebrated    every Sunday. The adobe Santuario de Guadalupe, west of the Plaza was built    between 1776 and 1796. It holds a stunning altar painting and is the country’s    oldest extant shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe.
A sampling of works by New Mexico’s    most famous artist can be seen in the small Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, 217    Johnson Street, a few blocks west of the Plaza. The Museum of Fine Arts, 107    West Palace Avenue, has a collection focused on 20th century Southwestern American    art, while the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum, 108 Cathedral Place,    is dedicated to contemporary Native American fine art and a showcase for artists    from the Institute. Four museums are clustered on Museum Hill, a few miles southeast    of the Plaza above the city, on Camino Lejo off Old Santa Fe Trail. The Museum    of Indian Arts & Culture gives a fascinating opportunity to learn about    the culture and history of Southwest Native Americans from their perspective    in an exhibition that combines displays ranging from architecture and the arts    to language and song with videos in which they tell their own stories. A second    permanent exhibit displays nearly 300 pieces of pottery created over 2,000 years    by Pueblo Indians. The Museum of International Folk Art houses the world’s    largest collection of folk art and is regularly voted Santa Fe’s best    museum. The Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, designed after a Navajo “hooghan,” or home, features changing exhibits of contemporary and    traditional Native American art. Its Case Trading Post Museum Shop is worth    a visit on its own. Outfitted to resemble a turn-of-the-20th-century Navajo    reservation trading post, it sells pottery, jewelry and textiles from more than    100 respected artists. The Museum of Spanish Colonial Art holds the most comprehensive    collection of Spanish Colonial art, focusing on works created in New Mexico    since colonized by Spain in 1598 and encompassing art from countries that influenced    this art from the Middle Ages to today. Museum Hill can be reached by taking    the M line bus from the downtown, with bus fare free on Sunday.
From cowboy and cowgirl boots, buckles,    belts and custom-made hats to high-fashion jewelry and collectable works of    art, Santa Fe offers an array of goods to satisfy the most discerning shoppers,    with an eclectic mix of unique boutiques, familiar chain stores, shopping malls,    and art galleries. Several shops and small indoor malls, including the Plaza    Galeria and Santa Fe Arcade, surround the Plaza or are within easy walking distance.    Lincoln Avenue, one block north of the Plaza, offers a collection of shops called    Lincoln Place. More shops are located on West San Francisco Street. For delightful    shopping in a renovated warehouse, visit Sanbusco Market Center, 500 Montezuma    Avenue, in the Guadalupe District adjacent to the historic Railyard. Some two    dozen shops and restaurants are located at Sanbusco – short for Santa    Fe Builders’ Supply Company -- in what was once the Railyard Center, a    pleasant walk southwest of the Plaza. Visit Canyon Road, the internationally    famous, half-mile collection of one-of-a-kind galleries, shops and restaurants,    off the southeastern curve of Paseo de Peralta near East Alameda Street. Lined    with historic adobe houses, Canyon Road is a former route used by American Indians    to travel from pueblos along the Rio Grande to those in the Pecos region. This    is the place to buy original works of art. South of the city on Cerrillos Road    and accessible by bus from the downtown Plaza are three major shopping complexes.    Villa Linda Mall at Rodeo Road; Santa Fe Plaza Shopping Center, and the Santa    Fe Premium Outlets, with a few dozen stores offering bargain prices.
About 70 miles north of Santa Fe is Taos,    a small historical artists’ community with art galleries, museums and    world-class skiing. Especially noteworthy is Taos Pueblo, with its multi-storied    adobe buildings. One of North America’s oldest continuously inhabited    communities, it has been home to the Taos Pueblo Indians for more than 1,000    years. It is both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and National Historic Landmark.    The pueblo is open to visitors except during late winter and early spring. Bandelier    National Monument, west of Santa Fe, has ruins of ancient cliff dwellings. Most    of New Mexico’s 19 Indian pueblos are within driving distance from the    city. Some are open to tourist visits; others are not. Northwest of Santa Fe    about 34 miles is Los Alamos, where the first atomic bomb was created. The small    village still attracts many scientists from around the world that come to visit    the Los Alamos National Laboratories, but there are few attractions for tourists.    New Mexico’s largest city, Albuquerque, is worth visiting to see historic    Old Town and the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. The city celebrates its 300th    anniversary from April 2005 to April 2006. It hosts the Gathering of Nations    Indian Powwow every spring which is the largest Native American cultural festival    in the USA. In the downtown area surrounding the old town district, there are    a number of beautiful hotels designed in the Adobe Spanish Colonial style of    architecture. For the most part, they are luxury hotels in the above average    to expensive price range. There is a much broader selection of hotels along    Cerillos Road a few miles south of downtown. You can find hotels in the budget    to moderate price range in that area. There are also a few moderately priced    hotels near the exits on I-25
Albuquerque
Albuquerque (pronounced al–buh–kirk–ee)    is the largest city in New Mexico. It is located along the Rio Grande River    near the center of the state. Two major interstate highways neatly divide New    Mexico into quadrants. Route 25 comes across its northern border from Colorado,    wends its way through the north central mountains, then follows the Rio Grande    Valley south to El Paso at the borders of Texas and Mexico. Route 40 bisects    the state roughly following the path of old Route 66 from the Texas border on    the east to the Arizona border on the west. These two major traffic arteries    intersect in Albuquerque. At the intersection of these two highways near downtown    Albuquerque, the ramps and bridges are all painted in pastel hues of pink, tan    and turquoise. The bridge abutments and retaining walls are artistically decorated    with Indian designs. The very roads and civil constructions of this city are    imbued with the essence of southwestern culture. The city sprawls across the    wide shallow valley of the Rio Grande River nearly 5,000 feet (1,524 m.) above    sea level. To the east, the Sandia Mountains form an imposing wall reaching    high into the turquoise sky. On the horizon in every other direction, distant    hills and mesas punctuate the vast upland plateau. On the western edge of the    city, the Rio Grande River lies nearly hidden in its shallow channel at the    foot of the low bluffs overlooking the city. The climate at Albuquerque is surprisingly    mild in all seasons. Although located in a near desert environment, it is spared    from intense summer heat due to its higher elevation and spared from bitter    winter cold due to its southern latitudes. It receives some rainfall in the    summer and a spare amount of snow in the winter, but normally has clear blue    skies on most days in any season. Downtown Albuquerque, with its small cluster    of new high-rise building, lies near the intersection of the two highways. Commercial    buildings, shopping malls and hotels cluster along these major highways in all    directions. The old town section of Albuquerque lies just a few blocks southwest    of this crossing of roads.
About ten square blocks of the old town    district have been carefully restored to its original Spanish colonial era atmosphere.    Low adobe structures with protruding wooden Vigas and shaded promenades surround    the main plaza which is dominated by the imposing adobe structure of the San    Felipe de Neri church. Narrow passageways lead to shaded inner courtyards and    hidden fountains.

Tennessee
Nashville
Nashville is a small city that feels    more like a big town. It is situated along the banks of the Cumberland River    in the center of the state of Tennessee. It is commonly known as "Music    City USA" and as the world capital of Country Western Music. Country or "hillbilly" music was born in the 1920s soon after radio and records    made it possible for local "folk" musicians to hear what their contemporaries    were creating in other parts of the US. Country music was originally based on    Scotch-Irish melodies and ballads that were popular at "barn dances" in many rural states. It soon became popular with millions of farmers and urban    factory workers across the country.
Music Valley is accessible from downtown    Nashville via a Cumberland River water taxi that lands at the Opryland dock.    An old-fashioned show boat provides excursions, musical shows and dinner dance    cruises from the same dock. Within walking distance of Opryland are a wax museum    of country stars, a car museum, a toy museum and several clubs offering live    country music entertainment. Downtown Nashville contains many attractions related    to country music including the country music hall of fame, several museums dedicated    to famous country stars, and the "Music Row" area with its array of    international recording studios. It also offers an assortment of interesting    museums; parks and churches including a full size replica of the Parthenon restored    to its original Greek splendor. Nashville's entertainment district is centered    on Broadway and Second Avenue downtown. There you will find a variety of restaurants;    bars and clubs featuring live country music. The Wild Horse Saloon on Second    Avenue is famous for its weekly country dances that are nationally televised.    Yes, you can be on television if you are brave enough to venture out on the    floor with some of the best country dancers in the world. On weekend evenings,    musicians play their instruments and sing country ballads on the downtown street    corners. Every day in Nashville, you can see men and women walking on the streets    in their faded western attire with a guitar slung over their back, looking for    their chance to find fame and fortune in Music City, USA. From Nashville, it    is a short 75 miles drive south to Lynchburg, Tennessee, home of the Jack Daniels    whiskey distillery. It is about 200 miles west to Memphis, Tennessee and "Graceland",    home of "The King of Rock and Roll", Elvis Presley.
Memphis
Memphis is situated on a bluff overlooking    the Mississippi River at the western border of Tennessee. Like its ancient namesake    in Egypt, this city lies above the apex of a mighty river delta. It forms a    gateway between two radically different regions of the USA. To the south, lie    the poverty stricken farms of the delta, the swampy bayous of Louisiana and    that great European flavored port city of New Orleans. To the north and west    are the rich farms of the Midwestern plains and the northern industrial cities    like Chicago and Detroit. Perhaps this strategic location has helped form the    unique cultural heritage of Memphis. A genteel atmosphere of southern aristocracy    has blended with the intensely spiritual soul of its Afro-American community.    This is the birthplace of the Blues and the birthplace of Rock and Roll. It    was also the home of the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley. Downtown Memphis,    stretches along the bluff overlooking the Mississippi. Main Street has been    converted to a pedestrian mall with antique trolleys and horse drawn carriages    providing convenient transportation to the entire downtown area. The Peabody    Hotel, located near the midpoint of the downtown district has a unique tradition.    Every day at eleven AM and at five PM, the Peabody ducks parade to and from    the lobby fountain with the accompaniment of an orchestral march. A giant steel    pyramid, housing a sports and entertainment complex is at the north end of downtown.    Just south of the pyramid a walkway leads to Mud Island, containing a river    museum complete with a working model of the lower Mississippi and the Memphis    Belle, a world war II, B-17 bomber made famous in the movie of the same name.
Historic Sun Studios is situated in a    rather run-down neighborhood just a few miles east of downtown. It is small    and not very impressive looking, but the tour is well worth the modest eight-dollar    fee. You will stand in the very room where Muddy Waters, Ike Turner, and Howlin    Wolf recorded their earliest blues recordings, where a young electrical worker    named Elvis Aaron Presley cut his first demonstration tape and recorded his    first hit, "That's all right". You will even hear the famous recording    of Elvis, jamming with Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash. Graceland,    Elvis' famous estate is located on Elvis Presley Blvd. about 15 minutes south    of downtown Memphis. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is no longer as exclusive    as it was when Elvis lived. Elvis Presley Blvd. is lined with strip malls, small    shops and industrial sites nearly to the doorstep of Graceland. The entry fee    costs about $20. It includes an audio-guided tour (in several languages) of    the Elvis mansion with its vast collection of Elvis' costumes and awards. It    also includes a tour of two jet airplanes built for Elvis and many of his cars    and motorcycles. You can buy a lot of Elvis souvenirs in this neighborhood.    The National Civil Rights Museum is located in an impoverished neighborhood    just a few blocks south of downtown. The old Lorraine Motel, where Doctor Martin    Luther King was assassinated, has been restored and dedicated to the history    of the civil rights movement. It may not have as much relevance to foreign visitors,    but to us Americans, it is a moving reminder of our recent history. The Memphis    Music Hall of fame is located downtown across from the Peabody Hotel. It has    many artifacts and memorabilia from famous blues and rock and roll performers.    The Memphis Queen Riverboats depart from a pier on the riverfront just south    of Mud Island. They offer a variety of sightseeing and pleasure cruises on the    Mississippi. The Pink Palace Museum and Planetarium with its IMAX theater and    its many natural and cultural exhibits is located in the eastern suburbs near    route 240. There are not many shopping options in downtown Memphis. Beale street    has a wide selection of Elvis souvenirs and Blues memorabilia. It also has the    125 year-old A. Schwab Department Store with some interesting merchandise that    appears to be nearly as old as the store. The really big shopping centers are    all located in the suburbs just off the beltway around the city formed by I-40    and I-240. There are a few smaller malls on Elvis Presley Blvd. near Graceland.    For serious bargain hunters, The Belz Factory Outlet Mall is located in Lakeland    about 40 minutes east of downtown Memphis.
May is a great time to visit. The Beale Street Music Festival is held the first    full weekend of May. It is one of the best Blues festivals found anywhere. The    Southern Cooking festival and the World Championship Barbeque contest are held    later in May. The weather is usually very pleasant in the spring and fall. Temperatures    can become quite hot and unpleasant during mid-summer. Winters are usually mild    and snowfall is rare. The biggest attraction outside the city of Memphis lies    about 30 miles south in Tunica, Mississippi. This small town has been converted    to a gambling center with casinos, hotels and entertainment. Tupelo, Mississippi,    about 100 miles south east of Memphis, is the birthplace of Elvis Presley. You    can visit his humble childhood home. Henning, Tennessee, about 50 miles north    of Memphis, is the birthplace and early home of Alex Haley, author of "Roots".    He is buried nearby along with many of his relatives including "Chicken    George". Mississippi Riverboats are a different way to tour the Southlands    of the USA. The Memphis Queen Riverboats depart from the Mississippi river bank    near Mud Island. They offer sightseeing tours on the river, evening dinner cruises    and some special party cruises. The Delta Queen Riverboats cruise the Mississippi    and Ohio Rivers from New Orleans all the way up to Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh,    Pennsylvania about 1,500 miles upstream. They stop at Memphis on their journeys    and it is possible to cruise from one day to a week or more on the greatest    rivers in the USA. Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital of the world    is 200 miles to the east of Memphis. Fifty miles south of Nashville, in the    tiny town of Lynchburg, Tennessee, lies the Jack Daniels distillery, producer    of the worlds finest Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey.
Lynchburg
Lynchburg, Tennessee is a quiet little    village nestled in the hills of southern Tennessee about 75 miles south of Nashville.    It has an eighteenth century courthouse in the middle of an old town square    surrounded by quaint shops. It has only one traffic light and less than 400    residents. Lynchburg was the home of one very famous resident who created the    town's most prominent product over 130 years ago. He now lies buried in the    cemetery at the edge of the village. His name was Jack Daniel. The oldest licensed    distillery in the USA is still located on the edge of Lynchburg. It is the only    place in the world where Jack Daniel's Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey is produced.    This charcoal-mellowed corn whiskey is still made according to a recipe created    by Jack Daniel in 1866. You can tour the distillery every day except holidays    from 8Am to 4Pm. Lynchburg is located in Moore County, Tennessee which is officially    a "dry county". That means, no alcoholic beverages may be sold within    Moore County. Ironically, there are 48 warehouses with over 200 million liters    of Jack Daniel's Sour Mash Whiskey stored in barrels on the hill outside of    Lynchburg. The distillery is permitted to sell special collector bottles of    whiskey only to tourists from outside the county. From Nashville, it is a pleasant    hour-and-a-half drive through picturesque farmlands to Lynchburg. The one-hour    distillery tour introduces you to some wonderful aromas as you learn how Tennessee    Sour Mash Whiskey is produced.
Texas
Dallas
Dallas is located in northeast Texas,    approximately 245 miles north of Houston and 190 miles south of Oklahoma City.    The Trinity River flows through the city and there are more than 60 lakes in    the area. Many of the lakes are used for recreational activities like boating    and fishing. Dallas is basically flat. Some evenings viewers on the outskirts    of the city can see the green outline of the Bank of America Plaza building    in downtown Dallas. Dallas' climate is humid but most of the annual rain falls    in the spring often bringing entrancing thunderstorms. Dallas also sees hot,    dry wind in the summer time. The winters can get quite cold, even icy. Fall    is the ideal time to visit but if you don’t mind the occasional rain shower    spring is also pleasant. The people of Dallas are pleasant, too. They're welcoming    and full of hospitality. Anyone who visits is more than likely to hear the greeting, "Hey, y'all!" Just don’t forget to taste some of their Texas    Barbeque (BBQ) and enjoy a Tex-Mex dinner with a margarita. (Tex-Mex is a Texan    spin on Mexican cuisine.) Local residents refer to the Dallas/Fort Worth area    as "the Metroplex." The Metroplex is in reference to the urbanized    area around the cities, connected by over a dozen major highways. Many of the    Dallas highways are known by two names and can be confusing to those unfamiliar    with the area. The U.S. Highway 75 (Central Highway), Interstate 45 (Julius    Schepps), and Interstate 35 (Simmons) run north and south. Interstate 635 (LBJ    Freeway), Highway 183 (Airport Freeway), Interstate 30 (R.L. Thornton), and    Loop 12 (Northwest Highway) run east and west. The Highway 114 (John Carpenter    Freeway) runs northwest and southeast. In addition to the many major highways    that run though Dallas, an alternative mode of transportation is available,    Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). DART is Dallas' reputable transportation service    which connects Dallas with 12 surrounding towns by three modes of service: DART    Rail, Trinity Railway Express (TRE), and bus service. The TRE serves DFW Airport    and the bus service serves Dallas Love Field airport.

The TRE serves DFW    Airport and the bus service serves Dallas Love Field airport.
Dallas is associated with cowboys and    ranches, but visitors are often surprised to find the city to be such a fast-paced    metropolis. However, visitors can still get taste of the country by visiting    Southfork, best known as the filming location of 1980's TV show, Dallas. The "Ewing Mansion" is located north of Dallas in Plano, about half an    hour from downtown. Guided tours are available year round for individual and    group tours. The "Dallas Legends" exhibit displays the gun that shot    J.R., Lucy's Wedding Dress, the Dallas Family Tree, and Jock's Lincoln Continental.    You can eat at Miss Ellie's Deli and buy souvenirs at the two "Dallas" themed gift shops. General admission is $8.95 with senior and children discounts    are available. Chuckwagon dinners are available for groups over 20. Cowboys    and ranch hands entertain throughout the dinner with songs and cowboy poetry.    The downtown West End Historic District, referred to as the "West End," is recognizable for its restored red brick warehouses. Today the old buildings    host dozens of restaurants, shops, bars, and dance clubs. The famous four-level    West End Market Place used to be a candy-and-cracker factory but now has activities    and entertainment for all ages. On the first level is the West End Market Place    Visitor Center. Escalators connect the levels which are filled with eateries,    ethnic jewelry stores, the West End Comedy Theatre, western wear and Texas-themed    shops. Level 3 has a photo shop where visitors can dress up in costumes and    have their pictures taken with scenes of the Old West and the Victoria Era.    Level 4 has a sports bar and indoor miniature golf. On weekends the streets    of the West End Historic District really pick up as people take horse carriage    rides, roam the streets stopping to watch street entertainers, and enjoy the    summertime's outdoor concerts. Bar patrons have many choices in Dallas Ally    which is a group of several clubs with varying music and on Market Street, the    main road of the West End, is Gator's Croc & Rock which has live piano entertainment.    The West End is great place to sit back after a day of activity and grab a bite    to eat or just enjoy a cold beer before hitting the dance floor.
Reunion Tower is best known as "the    ball" in the downtown Dallas skyline. Built as part of the Hyatt Regency    Hotel, Reunion Tower is the 15th tallest building in Dallas. Elevators with    a view take guests up the 50-story landmark. On the first level is a 360-degree    observation deck, called The Lookout where a splendid view of the Dallas area    and Fort Worth can be observed. Located on the level above is the elegant, full-service    Antares Restaurant, which is open for lunch, dinner, and a Sunday brunch. On    the highest level is The Dome, a cocktail bar open nightly for cocktails, food,    and entertainment. The Dome and Antares are on revolving platforms, which complete    a rotation every 55 minutes. A visit to Reunion Tower is truly a memorable experience.    Deep Ellum is located only three blocks from downtown Dallas and dates back    to shortly after the Civil War when former slaves settled, making it at the    time the most culturally diverse part of Dallas. At one point the area was the    warehouse district, holding several industries including a cotton gin and Henry    Ford's assembly plants. Today Deep Ellum is the foundation of Dallas' music    scene and considered a progressive, trendy area. It’s a great area to    hang out and hear live bands in the different bars and clubs. The Dallas Zoo    is located only a few miles south of downtown, off of Interstate 35 East. The    zoo is divided into two sections: Zoo North and Wilds of Africa. One of the    many attractions Zoo North has an endangered tiger habitat and a section where    children can pet and brush the animals. The Wilds of Africa features six major    African habitats. Admission is $8 for adults, $4 for seniors, $5 for children    3-11, and children under 3 are free of charge. Dallas has many shopping malls    through out the Metroplex. One of the most impressive is the beautiful multilevel    Galleria Dallas where there are over 200 stores including high-end shops Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton. The main department stores are Macy's, Nordstrom,    and Saks Fifth Avenue. Ice skaters can enjoy the newly renovated ice skating    rink which sits under a vaulted skylight, inspired by Milan Italy's Galleria    Vittorio Emanuele. Dallas Galleria is a shopper's paradise. Dallas Galleria    isn’t the only good place to shop. Highland Park Village has great shopping    and great restaurants, which is located north of down town at Mockingbird Lane    and Preston Road. Shoppers can pick up a Starbucks coffee to enjoy as they stroll    in and out of the stores and boutiques.

You don't want to miss hopping on a McKinney Avenue Trolleys    which connect the Downtown Arts District with the historic, picturesque Uptown.    Uptown is an upscale area offering dozens of boutiques, galleries, hotels, and    restaurants, including the Hard Rock Café. Fine dining, fine shopping,    and fine art are all part of the Uptown experience.

Houston has an excellent network of roads    including three beltways circling the city at various distances from the center.    Route 10 loops around downtown at a radius of four miles. Route 8 and the Sam    Houston Parkway form a double belt at near eight miles, and Route 6 forms an    outer belt nearly fifteen miles from the center. Clusters of skyward soaring    ramps highlight the major intersections and sometimes confuse out-of-town drivers.    Despite the excellence of the road system, road repairs or traffic mishaps sometimes    reduce rush-hour traffic to near standstills. The central downtown area has    an exquisitely reconstructed old-town area and an outdoor heritage museum in    adjacent Sam Houston Park.

The best    times to visit are in Spring or Fall. The Alamo and the River Walk are the main    tourist attractions in San Antonio and the top two attractions in the entire    state of Texas. The Alamo is a partially reconstructed Spanish Mission in the    heart of the city and was the place where 189 Texas patriots died in 1836, while    defending their land against a greatly superior Mexican army led by General    Antonio López de Santa Anna. The defenders included the famous frontiersman    Davy Crockett and colorful Texian knife fighter Jim Bowie. You can tour the    small museum of historical artifacts located in the reconstructed chapel for    free. The historic Battle of the Alamo is depicted at the San Antonio IMAX Theatre Rivercenter and at the Texas Adventure multimedia special effects theater within    one block of Alamo Square. The Paseo del Rio, or River Walk is the unique attraction    of San Antonio. More than 2.5 miles of the San Antonio River, flowing through    the heart of downtown, has been converted into a beautifully landscaped riparian    canyon. Its banks are lined with trees, tropical flowers, waterfalls and meandering    walkways. Numerous picturesque bridges traverse it, and tour boats constantly    ply its placid waters. Restaurants, bars, nightclubs and shops compete with    hotels, shopping malls and classy apartments for riverfront views. On weekends,    the River Walk is jumping with music, entertainment and activity. A riverboat    tour costs $5.25 and is a great way to see all of the riverfront scenery. In    the vicinity of Alamo Square, are several interesting museums and cultural attractions    including the San Antonio Children's Museum and the Hertzberg Circus Collection    and Museum. The Buckhorn Saloon and Museum is the most curious. It is an old-time    western saloon and restaurant with a museum of animal horns, cowboy memorabilia    and strange artifacts. It is a nice place to go for a cold drink or a quick    lunch. The 750-feet-high Tower of the Americas sits amidst beautiful HemisFair    Park a few blocks southeast of downtown. You can ride to the top observation    deck for a few dollars, or you can dine in the tower restaurant overlooking    the city. The University of Texas Institute of Texan Cultures at San Antonio    is located next to HemisFair Park, and the Alamodome sports complex is across    the freeway next to the Sunset Station entertainment center. San Antonio Missions    National Historical Park is located in the southern suburbs of San Antonio.    It contains the remains of four Spanish Missions in various states of preservation.    Mission San Jose is the best preserved with its entire compound reconstructed    as it would have looked in colonial times. It enables you to see how the mission    operated as a self-contained farming and manufacturing community with houses    for hundreds of pacified Native American Indians.
There are several theme parks on the    outskirts of the city. SeaWorld San Antonio with its aquatic shows is located    about fifteen minutes west of downtown. The Six Flags Fiesta Texas theme park    and the Splashtown water park are located about 15 minutes north of the city    center. Schlitterbahn, thirty miles north along route 35, is quite interesting.    This German-themed water park complete with replica castle and one of the biggest    and best water rides in the country, sits in the middle of the German colony    of New Braunfels. Restaurants in this little town feature bratwurst and apple    strudel along with the usual Texas barbeque. There are plenty of opportunities    for year-around golf or tennis at the many courses in the San Antonio vicinity.    Horse racing can be seen at the Retama Park racecourse about fifteen minutes    northeast of town. Horseback riding is available at many ranches and stables    outside of the city. Daytrips or automobile tours out of San Antonio could include:    A half-day drive eastward to the beautiful white sand beaches on the Gulf of    Mexico at Corpus Christi and South Padre Island with a stop along the way to    visit the immense King Ranch near Kingville. A half-day drive southward to visit    the border town of Laredo, Texas and to cross the Rio Grande for some shopping    in the town of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. A leisurely drive northward through the    German community of New Braunfels, into the hill country to visit the LBJ Ranch    of President Lyndon Johnson then on to the old German community of Fredricksburg,    is preferable. You can even visit Luckenbach, Texas, that tiny town in the middle    of nowhere, made famous by country music stars Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings.
Luckenbach
If you occasionally like to stray off    the beaten path to visit sights seldom seen by the tourist crowds, Luckenbach,    Texas is a secret corner of the USA worth visiting. This authentic American    town is located in the middle of nowhere with not much to see. Yet, a visit    to this tiny cowboy community is like a trip back in time to a previous era    when life was less complicated. It is hardly more than a bend in the road. A    couple of shabby old buildings stand beneath a grove of spreading oaks. The    whole town covers less than ten acres. A sign as you enter town says: "population    3". The Luckenbach post office stands at the center. It includes a general    store and saloon. Out back, folks sit on benches under the oak trees sipping    Lone Star Beer and listening to country music. A cowboy strums his guitar. The    only other significant structure is the dance hall. It is a genuine old-fashioned    Texas dance hall. Local bands play western music on most weekends. Folks from    all around the area come to dance and party. They have an interesting assortment    of entertainment events in Luckenbach. It includes Armadillo races, cowboy Christmases,    bluebonnet balls, mud daubers days, an annual hug-in, and the world's all women's    chili cook off. Most famous of all is the Fourth of July picnic. It has been    frequented by country music star Willie Nelson. Waylon Jennings and Willie both    recorded hit records about Luckenbach. Luckenbach sits along both sides of ranch    road 1376 approximately 17 miles south of Fredricksburg, Texas. It is about    an hour drive north of San Antonio and an hour west of Austin. You should stop    and ask directions! Luckenbach is not easy to find. You better hurry! It might    disappear before you get there.

Branson, Missouri
Branson, Missouri is a popular US attraction    that is not very well known to foreign visitors. It is a family oriented vacation    resort in the midlands of the USA that has become the "music theater capitol    of the world." Dozens of theaters in Branson now offer shows mostly with    country music or traditional family oriented themes. A whole array of other    entertainment and tourist attractions are also available. The blue haze of early    morning surrounded my encampment. Here and there campfires popped and crackled    as their light projected strange shadows on nearby rocks and trees. Groups of    people eating breakfast sat at lantern-lit picnic tables. Others still slept.    The cool, morning air of the camping area slowly came to life with the sound    of crickets. The Ozark hills boast many stories of wonder, superstition and    mystery. One such story is about the League of Law and Order that developed    the nickname Baldknobbers. At one time after the Civil War, the Ozark mountain    communities were still in a state of unrest. A group of lawless men used violence    to gain control of several of the county governments. These violators went unpunished    because of their complete domination of these various governments. Finally,    a band of 26 citizens came together to rid the Ozark Mountains of the malicious    foes. Dressed in dark clothing and black head coverings they attached white    beards or cattle horns for an even more morbid effect. The group named themselves    Baldknobbers after the high barren hill where they held their first meetings.    This vigilante group decided to rid the Ozarks of the criminals. Some of their    tactics were quite brutal and the name Baldknobbers soon became attached to    all ruthless venturers in the Ozark hills. Today, their memory lives on as a    group of courageous neighbors who demonstrated their unity in a war against    the lawless. On the campus of what is known as United States' most unique college    - the School of the Ozarks, you can take a guided tour. As my young guide pointed    out the various buildings around the campus, he explained the history of the    school. He said the school, founded in 1906, was initially set up to provide    an education for young persons of capable intellect but inadequate funds. My    guide told me about the extensive arts and crafts program sponsored by the school    and the various outlets the school provided for the exhibitions of the work.    The major attraction on campus is the Ralph Foster Museum. Devoted to the history    of the Ozarks region, the museum's collections of more than 750,000 items represents    history, antiques, archaeology, geology, mineralogy, natural history and westward    expansion. The museum is open year round. Those who travel the Branson area    today find that there is a certain spell cast by this wild rustic land that    cannot be forgotten. Perhaps it's the excellent fishing that the many lakes    provide, or the rugged beauty that surrounds the traveler at every step, or    maybe it is the friendliness of the natives that sparks a certain something.    Whatever it is - it's there and forever calling.
Chicago, Illinois
Chicago is located in the northern part    of the mid-western United States about 800 miles due west of New York City and    over 2000 miles northeast of Los Angeles, California. It is usually considered    the third great metropolis in the USA along with its East Coast and West Coast    sister cities of New York and LA. The city is situated on the western shore    of Lake Michigan, one of those five great inland seas known as the Great Lakes.    To the west of Chicago, lies the Great Plains of the Midwest. Vast expanses    of flat lands much of them covered with wheat and cornfields extend nearly a    thousand miles to the feet of the Rocky Mountains. With no natural barriers    such as mountains or hills to protect it, the city is subjected to the full    onslaught of the winds and storms that blow across these "Prairies".    Thus, Chicago deserves to be called the "windy city", although it    really earned that nickname from its abundance of "windy" politicians.    The major tourist attractions of Chicago include a trip to the observation deck    at the 103rd floor of the Sears Tower and a tour along Lakeshore Drive with    its beautiful parks, beaches and museums. Chicago offers visitors over a dozen    major museums, two zoos, a large aquarium and a planetarium. It also offers    lots of shopping opportunities and a variety of sports and entertainment. The    downtown loop area has many stores and shops especially along State Street,    but the real heart of the Chicago shopping district lies just north of the Chicago    River. The section of North Michigan Avenue across the river from downtown is    known as the Magnificent Mile and is lined with world-class department stores,    vertical shopping malls and many fine restaurants. As in most US cities, many    large shopping malls and outlet centers are located in the suburban communities.    For discount shopping, the Gurnee Mills Outlet Mall is along I-94 about one    hour north of Chicago.
Harpers Ferry
Harpers Ferry National Historical Park    is located at the convergence of the Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland state    borders about 65 miles northwest of Washington DC and 80 miles west of Baltimore    Maryland. The park, which includes the village of Harpers Ferry, is strategically    situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. It was the    early pioneer's gateway to the westward route through the Appalachian Mountains    and a significant military objective during the Civil War. It is most famous    as the location of John Brown's aborted attempt to instigate a revolution against    slavery. The picturesque village of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia clings to the    rocky slopes of the promontory between the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers overlooking    the steep wooded river valleys. Many of its shops and houses have been restored    and preserved in the conditions of the Civil War era. Museums and historical    exhibits have been constructed in some of the old buildings. Old houses have    been converted to quaint restaurants, shops and galleries. It is a very pleasant    place to visit. Located only a two-hour drive from Washington DC or Baltimore,    Maryland, this small picturesque historical site is a nice destination for a    day excursion from either city. In an effort to preserve the environment of    the village, the National Park Service has constructed a visitor center with    parking one mile west of the Shenandoah Bridge just off route 340. They provide    free shuttle busses to convey visitors to and from the town center. There is    a $5 per vehicle entry fee that includes unlimited visitation for a 3-day period.    The center is open every day from 9AM until 5PM except Thanksgiving, Christmas    and New Years Days.
Kennebunkport, Maine
The northeastern section of the USA which    includes the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Massachusetts    are commonly called "the New England" states because they reminded    early British settlers of their homeland. The northernmost of these states,    Maine, has a rugged rocky coast and dense forests strewn with pristine lakes    and rivers. Its scenic beauty and cool climate attracts many visitors during    the summer months. Here is Ron Harmon's wonderful description of the picturesque    seaside village of Kennebunkport, Maine. The morning air was clear; and its    freshness mixed with the smell of the sea made the surroundings invigorating.    Sometimes, you would find a damp misty fog that makes everything at a distance    resemble a watercolor painting had held the whole southern coast of Maine in    its grasp. You would enjoy your stay in the serene mood cast upon the area by    the fog, the coastal village took on a new look under the rays of a bright summer    sun. People were coming out of "hiding." It's amazing! During the    fog, a few people strolled the streets, but now under the sun, everything was    alive. Summer is a special time in Kennebunkport -- a time when fun seekers    are plentiful and store proprietors keep busy. Along the streets, shopkeepers     set "sale" items in front of their stores to attract customer's attention.    Visitors were not only looking, but lots of them were buying as well. Young    couples on bicycles pedaled by the shops so quickly that for an instant they    became a blur of color. At several points along the avenue, college-aged individuals    congregated to discuss their plans for the day. Apart from the shops selling    everything from autographed first edition books to original oil paintings, there    were plenty of other things to see and do. A few blocks from the village, an    old gristmill had been turned into a restaurant where visitors can dine in the    atmosphere of a bygone era. Other mills around the area have been transformed    into a museum and playhouses were famous entertainers "pack 'em in." At Kennebunk Landing is the ornate "Wedding Cake" house built in 1846.    Nearby, on Blueberry Hill stands the 200-year-old farmhouse of once-famous pop    singer Jane Morgan. It is thought that the old farm is haunted - in fact Miss.    Morgan believed the story so strongly that she gave the "spiritual occupants" the names of Ned and Nellie.
On Kennebunk Beach huge crumpled granite    rocks dot the shoreline. A large group of persons at one end of the beach played    in the cool waters of the Atlantic. Farther down, a young couple sat on top    of one of the stones while a group of small children played in a tidal pool.    A few miles from Kennebunk beach is Perkins Cove. At one time, the cove's main    industry was fishing, but for some reason, it has now become a home for artists.    At Barnacle Billy's, a colorful eatery, one can sit on the sun deck and sip    cool lemonade or dine on a lobster dinner. Boats of all sorts pass below the    deck while lobster traps lay scattered on the shore. If lucky, a visitor might    see one of the artists sitting in the noonday sun trying to sell his works.    Most of the serious artists, however, have rented space at the cove and exhibit    in a more professional style. Evening in the Kennebunks is something special    in itself. The hot pinks rich reds and tawny golden colors of a setting sun    seem to change even the oldest houses into works of art. This little section    of southern Maine is a place where a visitor could stay a whole summer, explore    every "nook and cranny" and still not see it all. It is a place that    lures a person back so many times that eventually it might be called home.
Las Vegas
Las Vegas, Nevada is a vibrant pulsating    city and the largest adult playground in the world. It is a community that was    created from the wastelands of the Mojave Desert in Nevada specifically to provide    a gambling and entertainment oasis for the titillation seeking residents of    post-war Los Angeles. Everything in Las Vegas has been done (or overdone) on    a grand and spectacular scale. Along the Las Vegas strip, a black glass pyramid    rises over a hundred meters above the desert with a larger than full sized replica    of the Sphinx at its entry. Next to it, sits a larger than life castle with    garishly colored turrets. Across the street, is a scaled-down skyline of New    York City complete with a Brooklyn Bridge and a Statue of Liberty. Beyond that,    you can see a half-sized replica of the Eifel Tower, a near full sized replica    of the Piazza San Marco from Venice and a large volcano that erupts flames every    thirty minutes. In Las Vegas, you often ask yourself, "Is this really a     city, or am I visiting some futuristic amusement park on another planet?" On any given evening in Las Vegas, you will find hundreds of entertainment events    such as the renown Las Vegas stage shows, world class sporting events, performances    by world famous entertainers plus music, dance and comedy at large and small    venues throughout the city. This city never seems to sleep. The frivolity continues    long into the night and the serious gamblers continue their pursuit of riches    until well after the morning sun has risen on a new day.
Most of the newest, grandest Las Vegas    casino hotels are located along the southern end of the strip near McCarran    Airport. Even the smallest of these newer casino hotels has over 2,000 rooms    with MGM Grand offering more than 5,000 rooms. Each casino contains thousands    of slot machines, hundreds of gaming tables, multiple restaurants, numerous    shops, theaters featuring "Las Vegas Shows" plus numerous bars, cocktail    lounges and smaller entertainment venues. Along the northern part of the Strip,    a few miles away from McCarran Airport, and also in the downtown area even further    north, the casinos are older and a bit less spectacular. That means they usually    offer their accommodations, their all-you-can-eat buffets, and their shows at    bargain prices to entice you to come and gamble at their facility. There are    also a few large casino hotels like Sam's Town and Boulder Station located well    away from the strip. Those isolated casinos often offer some super-saver bargains.    Since the time of Bugsy Siegel, Las Vegas has been renowned not only for its    gambling, but also for its free flowing liquor, its fine dining and its extravagant    entertainment especially at the Las Vegas Shows. All these original ingredients    are still available in even greater variety and quantity in modern-day Las Vegas.    The famous old Las Vegas Shows were typically variety shows featuring headline    entertainment, well known bands, scantily-clad dancing girls and ribald humor.    You can still find some of those shows on the Strip. The afternoon performances    and the early evening performances are usually toned-down family-oriented presentations,    while the late night performances are more adult oriented featuing nudity, risque    humor and adult themes. A typical old-time Las Vegas Show in family-oriented    theme is held at the Stratosphere Casino every afternoon, and the admission    is very reasonably priced. Some of the newer shows are even more extravagant    productions than the old-time ones. Cirque du Soliel runs about a half dozen    fabulous productions in Las Vegas including: Mystere, Ka, O, and Zumanity. Each    production is set in an immense specially-constructed theater with fantastic    sets and technological marvels. The prices are fairly expensive, but they are    certainly amazing feats of entertainment. At least two or more Broadway-style    productions of musicals or plays are constantly featured in Las Vegas. There    are a number of Las Vegas "regulars" playing at Casinos throughout    the city, and new famous, world renown entertainers appear for limited engagements    nearly every week. In addition to all this, there are free shows and free entertainments    available at many of the casinos nearly every day. There is certainly no lack    of entertaining diversions in this town.
Las Vegas is ideally situated for anyone    that would like to explore the Southwest of the USA. It is centrally located    amongst some of the greatest natural attractions in the USA like the Grand Canyon,    Death Valley, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. McCarran Airport has nearly    500 flights per day arriving from both domestic and international destinations,    so access is convenient and often very economical. The desert landscape surrounding    Las Vegas is stark and forbidding but strangely beautiful. Red Rock Canyon,    just 20 miles west of the city, looks just like hollywood scenery for a cowboy    movie. Boulder Dam and Lake Mead, located just 25 miles east of the city provides    the strangely contrasting images of deep blue waters set among stark arid hills    and barren rock formations. About 60 miles to the north, the Valley of Fire    offers some unique hiking and sightseeing opportunities in a volcanically created    environment of strange contorted rocks, lava fields and ancient Native American    runes. Grand Canyon National Park, one of the great natural wonders of the world,    is only 150 miles east of Las Vegas. The drive to the South Rim Visitors Center    is 300 miles by road, while the slightly less spectacular West Rim is only a    150-miles drive from downtown Las Vegas. Death Valley National Park is about    150 driving miles to the west and can easily be seen on a one-day drive from    Las Vegas. Zion National Park is about 150 driving miles to the north east,    and Bryce Canyon is about 80 miles past it. If you do not wish to drive to any    of the attractions, there are many tour options to these great natural wonders    via bus, airplane and helicopter. If you intend to visit Las Vegas for a few    days or more, you need only leave the gambling parlors for a single day or even    only a half day to see some of this spectacular Southwest scenery. There are    numerous tours departing from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, Death valley, Zion    National Park, Boulder Dam, Lake Mead, the Valley of Fire and other interesting    places. The tours can be via airplane, helicopter, bus, van, jeep or even hummer.    Normally, the tour operators pick you up at your hotel, take you on a guided    tour of the attraction, then return you to your hotel later in the day. This    is a very convenient way to see some of the fabulous scenery in a very limited    amount of time. Naturally, you can always rent a car and tour these same fabulous    sights on your own.
 
 
New Orleans
New Orleans is the diamond set at the    end of the Mississippi River as it spills into the Gulf of Mexico. It stands    unique in America as the only city that strongly preserved its old world Spanish,    French and African heritage. Originally built along canals (called bayous),    the city is actually an island encompassing 363 miles, and it is the only major    American City built below sea level (-4 to -6 feet). Known as "The Big    Easy" and "The City that Care Forgot," New Orleans is not only    the home of great food and great music, but also the Cities of the Dead, exotic    nightlife, voodoo practices, and, most importantly, a unique blend of cultures    that created the Creole and Cajun people. When local folks talk about the different    sightseeing events, they often refer to the different neighborhoods, called    districts. Each district is distinct from its neighbors and has its own assortment    of wonderful sights. The famed French Quarter is at the heart of downtown. The    structures there are mostly tightly-knit two-story structures of Spanish-style    brick and wrought iron. There, boutiques, art and antiques stores, and souvenir    shops are open in the daytime, but at night that the Quarter comes alive with    restaurants, gentlemen's clubs and blues bars. This area also includes the Jackson    Square shopping area, the dock area for paddleboat and steamship river cruises,    and the Aquarium of the Americas. The Garden District is approximately five    miles to the east of the French Quarter, bordered by St. Charles Ave. in the    north and Magazine Street in the south. Here you will find lovely historic homes    that look like dollhouses, with their large porches, fancy trim and wrought    iron fencing. The local historical society encourages tours through this district    to show off the elegance of a bygone era. The tours also include a stop at the    Lafayette Cemetery, one of the Cities of the Dead. Loyola and Tulane Universities    are located in the University area, as is Audubon Park, the site of the Audubon    Zoo and Aquarium. On the nearby banks of Mississippi River, you can board an    air-conditioned J.J. Audubon river cruise.
The airport is located close to Interstate    10, which is in the far eastern section of town. Airport shuttles and buses,    which are far cheaper than taxis, are readily available. The shuttle costs $10    one way to your destination, while a bus to the downtown depot on Tulane Avenue    is just $1.50. You can easily tour by bus, or you can use the two streetcar    systems. The St. Charles streetcar, more than 150 years old, is a living relic    of New Orleans history. Running from Canal Street (at the edge of the French    Quarter) to Audubon Park, it is a 13.13-mile stretch that is great for sightseeing.    A round trip takes about an hour and a half. A second streetcar line runs across    the Riverfront. The cars, which travel a 1.9-mile route, are referred to as    the "Ladies in Red." They connect the Jackson Square area to the newest    West Side commercial developments along the river. If you are planning a full    day of bus and streetcar hopping, consider buying a visitor's pass from the    hotel or in a local shop. It costs $5.00 for one day or $12 for three days.    If you are driving your own car, park at your hotel or at a Park-and-Ride area    outside of the downtown district, and then do your sightseeing by bus. Downtown    parking can be hard to find and costly. Typical of a tourist center, New Orleans    has a large variety of shopping areas. The French Quarter boutiques, souvenir    shops, and art galleries do big daytime business, as do the shops at River Walk    where you will find all of the well-known national chain stores. Within walking    distance of the French Quarter is the Jackson Brewery, located at the end of    St. Peter Street and on the river. It houses fifty restaurants and shops, many    of which feature art, antique and craft items made by local artisans. Magazine    Street boasts six miles of galleries, boutiques, jewelry stories, and antiques    dealers.
New York City
New York City is located on the eastern    coast of the United States about 1000 miles north of Florida and 200 miles South    of Boston. It is situated at the mouth of the Hudson River, and is divided into    five districts called boroughs. Long Island stretches almost 100 miles to the    east of New York City and the state of New Jersey lies just across the Hudson    River to the west. The "Big Apple", as the city is often called, is    the largest city in the US with over 7 million residents. It is filled with    a diverse mixture of inhabitants including immigrants from many countries. Some    of its many neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, Little Italy, and Spanish Harlem    reflect the rich ethnic heritages of the resident's original homelands. Manhattan    borough, the business and commercial center of New York City, is situated on    a large island in the middle of the Hudson River. Just south of it, across the    main harbor, lies the borough of Staten Island, a large residential community.    Across the East River branch of the Hudson, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens    are situated on the western tip of Long Island. The borough of Bronx is on the    mainland to the north. New Jersey lies across the Hudson to the west. Manhattan    Island is about two miles wide and over 12 miles long. It contains most of the    business, economic, entertainment and cultural sights of the city. A four-miles    long by half-mile wide Central Park, located at the very center of the island,    neatly divides the city into sectors. The southern part of the island is called "Downtown" and the section directly south of Central Park is called "mid-town". Everything from the middle of the park to the northern    tip of the island is usually called "Uptown". The part of the island    closest to Long Island is called the "East Side" and the part closer    to the Hudson River is the "West Side". The two neighborhoods lying    on either side of Central Park are called "Upper East Side" and "Upper    West Side". The numbered streets of Manhattan all run east-west beginning    with First Street just above Greenwich Village, and extending all the way up    to 218th Street at the far northern tip of Up-town. Avenues run north-south    beginning with First Avenue on the East Side and extending to Twelfth Avenue    along the Hudson River on the West Side. These numbered Avenues are interspersed    with named Avenues such as Park Avenue, Lexington, Madison and Broadway. Broadway    is a bit unusual as it starts out as a typical north-south avenue in the middle    of the island downtown, but angles sharply to the west just below Central Park    and continues on up the West Side to the top of the island.
Brooklyn is across the East River on    the southwestern tip of Long Island. It is accessible via bridge or tunnel.    This borough is nearly four times as large as Manhattan Island and has a population    of about four million. It is one of the primary bedroom communities for New    York City. Unlike Manhattan, there are few tall buildings in Brooklyn. Typically,    the tree-lined streets are filled with brownstone townhouses and small apartment    buildings. There are very few hotels in Brooklyn, but those few offer a quiet    alternative to the noisy hectic streets of Manhattan. Coney Island Beach and    Amusement park are located along the southern shore and John F. Kennedy Airport    lies just east of Brooklyn. Queens is north of Brooklyn on the tip of Long Island.    It is also a residential community with many high-rise apartment complexes.    LaGuardia airport, Shea Stadium and the crumbling ruins of the old World's Fair    are located there. There are a few hotels near the airport. The Bronx is another    mainly residential community almost due north of Manhattan on the mainland.    The large and impressive Bronx Zoo is located there. Staten Island is due south    of Manhattan across the main harbor basin. It is most easily reached via the    Staten Island ferry from Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan. The    ferry ride offers spectacular views of the New York skyline and the Statue of    Liberty and is absolutely free for all pedestrians. Staten Island has a small    town atmosphere with many single-family homes. New York is one of the most exciting    cities in the world. It is often called "the city that never sleeps." In fact, Times Square at midnight seems more vibrant and active than most other    cities at noon. New York has many tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty,    the United Nations headquarters, the Empire State building and over 300 museums.    It is renown for its wide variety of entertainments including the world famous    Broadway theaters. There are over 30,000 restaurants in New York City plus countless    bars and clubs. If you like big cities and lots of excitement, the Big Apple    is a great place to visit.
Philadelphia
Philadelphia is the second largest city    on the East Coast and the fifth largest city in America.

The    Philadelphia Music Alliance has established a Walk of Fame along the avenue    that honors many area musicians and music industry icons with more than 100    bronze plaques.
Shopping is a part of every vacation    and Philadelphia has plenty to offer in this area. The best news is that clothing    and shoes are tax-free throughout Pennsylvania. Rittenhouse Row is a high-end    shopping center with brands by famous names such as Nicole Miller, Ralph Lauren    and Tiffany. Jewelers' Row is America’s oldest diamond district with more    than 300 businesses. Antique Row is a paradise for antique and treasure lovers.

The grand staircases are lined with Masonic paintings and    sculptures by William Rush, the father of American sculpture. A museum, located    inside the temple holds artifacts such as George Washington’s Masonic    apron. Philadelphia is situated along Interstate highway 95, the main traffic    artery that extends along the East Coast of the USA from Boston in the north    to Miami Florida in the South. It is an easy drive of just a few hours from    Philadelphia to New York City or to Baltimore and Washington DC. The beach resort    of Atlantic City, often called the little Las Vegas of the East Coast, is only    a one-hour drive to the southeast. There you can find gambling casinos and glitzy    shows just like in Las Vegas but on a much smaller scale. Lancaster Pennsylvania    is less than a two-hour drive to the west. That is the location of the Pennsylvania    Dutch Country, known for its quaint German-speaking communities and its technology-shunning    Amish religious sects. Less than an hour west of Lancaster is Gettysburg Pennsylvania,    location of one of the greatest battles of the US civil war.
Seattle, Washington
Seattle, Washington is located in the    far northwestern corner of the United States, if you don't consider Alaska.    It is approximately 100 miles south of the Canadian border, nearly 3000 miles    west of New York City and over 1000 miles north of Los Angeles, California.    The city is situated on a series of low hills overlooking the deep-water harbor    of Puget Sound about 75 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. It is nearly surrounded    by water with Puget Sound on the west, Lake Washington a few miles to the east    and Lake Union connecting them across the north. On clear days the Cascade Mountains    are visible on the eastern horizon and the Olympic Mountains loom across the    Sound to the west. The snowcapped volcanic peak of Mount Rainier dominates the    southern view. This city is set in the midst of some of the most beautiful natural    scenery in the USA. The climate is surprisingly mild this far north. Warm currents    off the Pacific Coast tend to moderate the local weather. Summers are never    very hot and winters are not very cold. Little snow falls in the city. Seattle    is often called the rainy city, but that is not accurate. The city does not    receive a lot of rain, but it does get about 220 days of cloud cover every year,    and most of the rain occurs during the winter months. Sunshine and blue skies    can be rare from October through March. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport    or Sea-Tac is located about 10 miles south of downtown Seattle just west of    Interstate route 5. Transportation to downtown is available for $7.50 via express    buses. Seattle Center, dominated by the 605-feet high Space Needle, is located    1 mile north of downtown and is easily accessible via a short Monorail ride.    For nine dollars, you can take an elevator to the top and appreciate a spectacular    view of the city with its surrounding lakes and mountains. Seattle Center is    also the location of the Pacific Science Center, the Children's Museum, the    Children's Theater, the Opera House, the Bagley Wright Theatre, the Seattle    Center Playhouse, the Key Arena and the new Experience Music Project. It also    contains an amusement park, a video arcade, a fast food gallery and an assortment    of shops. Pike Place Market is located at the western edge of the central downtown    area overlooking the Puget Sound waterfront. It offers an array of shops, kiosks    and vendors selling fresh seafood, vegetables, flowers and all sorts of wonderful    gifts. It is renowned for its flying fish market, where the seafood vendors    toss their sales over the heads of amused spectators. The market also contains    many restaurants, specialty shops and those ubiquitous Seattle coffee houses.
The Seattle waterfront is located at    the bottom of the hill just behind Pike Place Market. Many of the old fishing    piers have been converted to restaurants, specialty shopping malls and tourist    attractions. The Seattle Aquarium is here. Michelle says it is worth the price    of admission just to see the adorable live sea otters. An Omni-Max theater offers    an interesting view of the 1980 eruption of nearby Mount Saint Helens. Argosy    Harbor Tours depart from a waterfront dock and provide a wonderful way to see    the city from a different perspective. You can also find speedboat tours, sailing    ship excursions and para-sailing adventures along the waterfront. There are    some excellent seafood restaurants in this neighborhood. Pioneer Square Historical    District is just a short walk south of the Pike Place Market and the waterfront.    This neighborhood contains many restored Victorian structures. It includes art    galleries, antique shops, boutiques, a great bookstore and a lot of bistros,    sidewalk cafes and bars. A great picturesque totem pole and a bronze statue    of native chief Sealth adorn the square. An interesting underground tour of    Seattle takes you beneath the streets and sidewalks surrounding Pioneer Square.    Lake Union bisects the city just north of downtown as it wends its way from    Lake Washington on the east side to Puget Sound on the west. The lake is filled    with activity from the commercial fishing vessels, motorboats, yachts, kayaks    and seaplanes that continuously ply its waters. Houseboat communities on the    lake were featured as Tom Hank's home in the film "Sleepless in Seattle." The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, located near the lakeside community of Ballard,    are worth visiting. You can not only watch the incessant stream of maritime    traffic navigating the locks, but you can also watch the incessant stream of    migrating Salmon navigating the fish ladders. Many of the best attractions in    the Seattle area are located outside of the city. Olympic Peninsula with Olympic    National Park lies across the Puget Sound, and on a clear day, its snowcapped    peaks are visible from downtown. Mount Rainier National Park and Mt St. Helens    National Monument are both only a 4-hour drive from downtown Seattle. The Cascade    Mountains rise just beyond the eastern limits of the city. A few hours drive    over Snoqualmie Pass takes you to the Columbia River Plateau and the Yakima    Valley. This is the rich agricultural heartland of Washington and is its wine    country. A few hours boat ride brings you to the San Juan Archipelago where    you can view whales, seals and other wildlife in the natural splendor of unspoiled    wilderness. Seattle is a good city for shopping. It has a wide variety of department    stores, boutiques and specialty shops right in the downtown area. Pike Place    Market, the Waterfront, Pioneer Square, Fremont and the Chinatown/International    District all offer lots of interesting shops featuring unusual merchandise.    There are major shopping malls in Lynnwood, Bellevue, Northgate and South Center.    For serious bargain hunters, there are large factory outlet malls in Auburn,    30 minutes south of downtown Seattle, and in Burlington, 65 miles north of the    city.
Washington DC
Washington DC is located near the middle    of the eastern coast of the USA. It is 230 miles south of New York City, less    than an hour drive to Baltimore and slightly more than two hours to Philadelphia.    The city is near the vast Chesepeake Bay about 100 miles inland from the Atlantic    Ocean. The surrounding landscape is nearly flat with some gently rolling hills    and shallow valleys. Summers can get quite warm with temperatures often exceeding    80 degrees F during June through August. Winters can be quite cold with temperatures intermittently falling below freezing from December through March. They get    a modest amount of precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year. Occasional    Atlantic storms can bring deluges or can dump large amounts of snow on the area    in the winter. Washington DC is more than a city but not quite a state. It is    a "district" created by the Congress of the United States in 1790    as a place to meet and transact their affairs of government. It was originally    a ten-mile, square of land straddling the Potomac River between Virginia and    Maryland. They called it the District of Columbia and named the new capital    city, to be constructed within, Washington in honor of our founding father and    first president. There is a lot to see in Washington DC and most of it is free.    You can tour the US Capitol Building, the White House, the Supreme Court and    many federal government agencies like the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (where    they print the money) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) (where    they shoot a machine gun). You can visit the Washington Memorial, the Lincoln,    Jefferson and Roosevelt Memorials. You can see Arlington National Cemetery,    the Vietnam memorial, the Korean War memorial and the Battle of Iwo Jima memorial.    You can even spend several days touring the many parts of the Smithsonian Institute,    one of the largest and finest collection of museums in the world. None of it    will cost anything! Washington DC offers many historical and educational attractions,    a variety of cultural and entertainment activities, plenty of multi-ethnic dining    experiences and an array of shopping opportunities. Outside of the city, there    are many civil war battlefields within a short drive; and President Washington's    home at Mount Vernon is just south of DC. The port city of Baltimore and Anapolis,    home of the US Naval Acadamy, are within an hour drive. Even Piladelphia and    New York City are within a half-day drive.
Vancouver, British Columbia
Vancouver, British Columbia is the largest    and possibly the most beautiful city in the westernmost province of Canada.    It is located just 24 miles (38 km) north of the US border and less than a three-hour    drive from Seattle, Washington. The city is situated at the Fraser River Delta    on the Pacific Coast. Eighteen surrounding communities spread over the adjacent    2930 square kilometer area make it a large vibrant metropolitan center. Vancouver    is 60 miles (96 km) northeast of Victoria, the capitol of British Columbia,    located on the southern tip of nearby Vancouver Island. The city of Vancouver    sits in the midst of some spectacular scenery. The Ocean Strait of Georgia frames    its western edges with the great harbor basin of English Bay and Burrard Inlet    to the north. Across the inlet, high mountain peaks rise directly out of its    northern suburbs. More lofty mountains define its eastern horizon. Downtown    Vancouver sits astride the hilly spine of a small peninsula jutting into the    bay. It is composed of an interesting mixture of high-rise office buildings,    hotels and apartments interspersed with many private homes and lower structures    containing small shops, restaurants and boutiques. It exudes the atmosphere    of a large cosmopolitan city and simultaneously of a small intimate town. The    northern tip of this peninsula is devoted to Stanley Park, one of the finest    urban recreational areas in North America. The remainder of the peninsula is    covered with various interesting neighborhoods featuring shopping, business,    restaurants, theaters and urban living. Grouse Mountain is the most popular    scenic attraction of the city. Just 15 minutes from downtown, the Skyride Gondola whisks you to a mountaintop plateau far above the city. Attractions at the summit    include an I-Max film, a lumberjack show, a display of giant chainsaw sculpture    and a refuge for two orphaned bear cubs. In the winter, skiing and snowboarding    are popular diversions. Near the bottom of the mountain, the Capilano Suspension    Bridge provides an exhilarating opportunity to cross a 450 feet long swaying    footbridge 230 feet above the rocky gorge of the Capilano River. You can take    bus tours or trolley tours of the city. You can take boat tours of the harbor    or seaplane tours of the environs. The BC Ferries can take you to Victoria,    to the Suncoast or to several destinations on the Channel Islands. Train tours    depart from the city for scenic destinations in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.    You can take fishing or whale watching charter cruises in the nearby waterways.    Luxurious cruise ships depart from the city piers for voyages to Alaska. You    can go sea kayaking. The internationally famous ski resorts of Whistler and    Blackcomb are less than two hours north of Vancouver. The tourism possibilities    are endless.
Vancouver International Airport is located    on Sea Island just south of the city near the suburb of Richmond. It has many    flights to destinations throughout North America and to every other continent.    Taxis to downtown cost about $20 to $30. The Airporter Shuttle Bus costs $12    and a limo costs $35 for up to eight passengers. Many visitors from the USA    drive north on US interstate 5 which turns into Canadian 99 at the border. Vancouver    is at the western terminus of the Canadian Transcontinental railway and the    TransCanada highway. Both connect to the eastern Canadian provinces via spectacularly    beautiful but very long routes. Vancouver is also a major terminus for many    cruise ships that offer voyages to Alaska from mid May through early October.    There are a number of hotels located near Vancouver International Airport and    in the neighboring community of Richmond. Other hotels are located along routes    99 and 99A or in the suburb of North Vancouver. The greatest concentration of    accommodations is in downtown. We stayed at the Park Hill Hotel in the center    of downtown. It was conveniently located near most of the attractions with plenty    of restaurants, convenience stores and shops within a short walk. For a moderate    price, we had a spacious suite with a balcony overlooking the magnificent harbor    and free parking in a secure garage. You can check prices and make reservations    at the Park Hill Hotel, or you can also check the availability of other hotel    accommodations in Vancouver before you pack up to go there.
