Camping
Camping is one of the most popular forms of outdoor recreation and can range from "roughing it in the wilderness" with only a tent and limited cooking utensils to utilizing more modern accommodations like campers and mobile homes. Other outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, are often connected with camping trips. American campgrounds are designated by the National Park Service and other government entities and require a fee if they are privately owned. Due to the overwhelming number of people who go camping every year, especially in the summer months, many campgrounds strongly encourage their potential users to make reservations well ahead of time. This section provides a camping checklist, some camping tips and helpful information for the outdoor enthusiasts.
