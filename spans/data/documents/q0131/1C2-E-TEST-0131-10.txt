Choosing the Best Summer Camp            for Your Child
There are over 8,000 residential summer camps in the            United States and Canada. Picking the best camp from so many may seem            like a huge task. Follow the “top ten” list below and you            will find the best camp for your child. It may not be the same camp            that I would choose for my son or that your neighbor would choose for            their daughter, but it will be the best camp for your child.
10. Family Decision- First of all, include your child            in the decision. Picking a camp and sending your child away without            involving them in the decision is the best way to send them to the worst            camp in America. Start the process early. Exceptional camps may fill            some sessions as early as September (yes, almost a year before the summer            camp season). Many families will begin the camp search a full year before            they are planning for their child to attend.
9. Camp Philosophy- Camps can be for fun or for reforming            juvenile delinquents, for furthering a camper’s religious education            or for interacting with children of many faiths, for learning a sport            or to de-emphasize competition. Ask camps for their mission statement            and then look at their literature and camp video to see how the mission            of the camp is woven into the overall camp philosophy.
8. Program- What sort of experience are you looking            for? There are high adventure camps, traditional camps with a range            of activities, skateboarding camps, football camps, computer camps,            and the list goes on. The length of the camp session can make a big            difference in the effectiveness of a camp program. In general, longer            sessions mean more skill development. After you have thought about philosophy            and program, you are ready to start making your “long list” of camps. Some helpful resources are CampPage.com, Kidscamps.com, or            acacamps.com for a starting point to make your initial list of possibilities.
7. Cost- Many wonderful camps pay their staff well,            use the best program equipment, have a great camper-to-staff ratio,            and constantly work on improving their facility. Those camps will also,            by necessity, charge a higher tuition than camps that pay low salaries            and have aging program equipment. Some low-cost camps are still great            camps because they are supported by an organization that supplements            camper fees or because of the nature of their program offerings. Some            camps offer discounts for financially strapped families. Grandparents            often send their grandchildren to an outstanding camp that would normally            be beyond the means of their family.
6. Location- How close to home is the camp? If it            is too close to home, part of the camp experience may be lost. Too far            from home & travel costs can become an issue. Other considerations            with location include the temperature during the summer, and activities            suitable to the geographic region.
5. Size- The size of a camp can mean the size of the            facility or how many campers are in the facility. If the camp is huge,            lets say 500 or 750 campers, it can seem smaller if there are meaningful            ways to segment the group. It is important to ensure that campers in            these smaller segments are still getting the full camp experience.
4. Staff- The composition of the staff is, for most            parents, the most important consideration in choosing a great camp.            How long have the directors been at the helm and what are their priorities when selecting staff. Do they conduct background checks? What percentage            of the staff is foreign? What is the staff-to-camper ratio? What is            the age and experience of the staff? There is no “right” answer to these questions, but the answers you receive might spark a            deeper conversation about a camp’s staffing philosophy.
3. Standards- How is the camp program evaluated and            improved? There are numerous organizations that grant accreditation            to camps- the ACA, AEE, CCA, GSA, BCCA, and the list goes on. The ACA,            American Camp Association, is by far the largest accrediting organization            for camps. Find out what organizations accredit the camps on your list            and ask about the accreditation. Many excellent camps are not accredited            but should be prepared to tell you how their program is evaluated and            improved in an ongoing fashion.
2. References- Will the camp give you references in            your area to call? Most camps are happy to provide a list of families            that have agreed to be a reference. Once you have narrowed the choices            down, call a few families and ask them why they chose the camp and what            they feel are the top attributes of the camp. That is the person to            ask about the quality of the camp food, the staff, and the camp “feel”.
1. Facility- Visit the camp, if possible. Most camps            will be happy to give you a camp tour that fits your schedule. There            is no better way to find out about a camp than by going in a cabin,            seeing the dining facility and to converse with the camp staff as you            walk around; even better, schedule your tour during the summer to see            the camp in action. Meeting the directors and asking them questions            in person is the next best alternative if you cannot visit the camp            facility in person. If you cannot visit in person, see if a camp representative            will be visiting your area. Many camps will schedule visits to the geographic            areas they serve. A phone call to the camp may be the only practical            way to speak to someone in the camp administration. Regardless of whether            it is in person or over the phone, ask a camp representative what she            feels are the special qualities of her camp. Don’t just go through            a list of questions- talk about your child and engage the camp representative            in conversation about the meaning of a camp experience.
After going through the top ten list, you should be able to have the            8,000 choices narrowed down to the “Best Camp in America” for your child. You will then be able to drop her off on opening day            with confidence about the experience she is going to have while at camp.
