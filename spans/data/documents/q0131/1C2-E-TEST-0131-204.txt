Summer places in Alaska
The most likely starting points for summer visits to Alaska                      are Anchorage,Seward, Juneau or Fairbanks. Major air carriers                      fly in to Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks. Cruise ships make                      stops in Juneau and in Seward.
Many places in Alaska are accessible only by air or water.                      The state capital, Juneau, is one of those. There's been talk in the past of                      running a highway into British Columbia to connect Juneau                      to the North American road system but, in the meantime, the                      choices come down to airline, cruise ship or the Alaska State                      Ferry. As of 2007, Alaska had just under 15,000 miles of roads.
Anchorage and Fairbanks can be reached by road, but it's a long drive                      from the Lower 48 states or from the urban centers of Canada.                      The smaller communities of Seward , Homer , Talkeetna ,                      Valdez, Skagway and Haines are on the road system, as is the                      entrance to Denali National Park .
Visitors arriving in Anchorage or Fairbanks will find it                      most convenient to rent a car or motorhome for their Alaskan                      vacation. Road conditions, in general, are good. The highway                      between Anchorage and Seward has been improved in recent years,                      with a number of three-lane passing areas, and it is one of                      the most spectacular drives in North America. The 126-mile                      trip can be easily made in three hours, though frequent stops                      to admire the views may make it take longer. The first 40                      miles of the trip between Anchorage and Denali National Park                      is on a four-lane highway, with the remainder on a good, two-lane                      highway.
The Aleutian Islands, western, northern and much of Southeast                      Alaska are off the road system. Homer, in Southcentral Alaska,                      is as far west as it is possible to travel on the North American                      road system. Among the places that can not be reached by road                      are the Gold Rush mining town of Nome, which is better known                      today as the terminus of the "Last Great Race," the Iditarod ; Barrow on the North                      Slope; and the Southeast Alaskan communities of Ketchikan                      and Sitka.
