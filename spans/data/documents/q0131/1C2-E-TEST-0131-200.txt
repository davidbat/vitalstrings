Dorothy P. Flint Nassau County 4-H Camp
Riverhead, NY

Operated by the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County, .this popular camp is located on 140 acres of woodland, farmland and beachfront adjacent to the Long Island Sound. This co-educational, sleep-away camp for kids entering grades 4 – 10 receives great praise from parents and kids alike for offering a wide variety of fun, outdoor activities including canoeing and kayaking. This year they are also providing a “First Time Camper Weekend” to help new campers (and their parents!) adjust to the overnight separation.
