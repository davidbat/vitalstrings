Overnight Summer Camps for Kids and Teens
One of the great decision-making challenges parents face is: which          is the best camp for their child. With over 7000 overnight summer camps          in the United States, choice in summer camps is astounding.
If you're looking to send your child to one of many overnight summer          camps, otherwise referred to as sleepaway camp or residential, there          are many choices available. Today's camps are basically designed to offer          kids and teens a fun summer experience, where friendships blossom and          self esteem grows. Overnight camps:
Can run from 1 week to 10 week sessions; from June to August
Include campers aged 6 to 16 (some wilderness camps up to 18 years)
Be coed, all girls, all boys or brother and sister camps
Types of overnight summer camps:
Traditional Style
With many traditional overnight camps, campers are exposed to a lot of          sports and activities such as swimming, horse back riding, rock climbing          and sports like baseball, archery, basketball and tennis. These camps          offer kids and teen campers a well rounded experience, broadening their          interests and often relying on a more laid back approach than an intensive          specialty camp. One of the nice things about this style camp (speaking          from experience) is going back again the following summer to meet up with          favorite; counselors, staff and good friends.
Specialized Camps
Here you will find several types of themed camps that focus on a particular          activity, sport, or educational interest. Often categorized as sports camps , adventure camps , academic and arts camps;          your child can benefit from the rewards of either learning something new          or gaining greater skill in an area of interest. Popular choices include: horseback riding camp , music          camp , football camp and adventure          camp .
Looking for an overnight camp?
After January rolls in, many camps across the United States approach          busy times which can go through spring. For camp directors, the process          of "marketing their camp" to interested parents and kids is          one that includes passing along important information about their particular          sleepaway camp. This information may include a DVD of the camp, brochures          and a face to face meeting with the director.
Some parents like to take a tour of the camp before sending. However,          unless you visit the camp during the summer, you will not be able to get          a true picture of the camp experience.
