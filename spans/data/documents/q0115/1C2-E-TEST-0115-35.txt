Saenger  Theatre
As a regional  entertainment and cultural center, Texarkana once had a number of opera houses and theaters, including this facility built  by the Saenger Amusement Co. of New Orleans. A parade and speeches by local dignitaries  marked the opening day festivities on Nov. 18, 1924. Emil Weil designed the Classical  Revival structure to accommodate stage productions, musical programs and motion  pictures. The elaborate interior features ornamental plasterwork.
