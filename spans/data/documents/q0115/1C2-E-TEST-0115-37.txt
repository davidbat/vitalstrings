This is the closest theater to me, but that doesn't mean I have to like it...but I do.  Cinemark Texarkana is a great theater with a range of movies showing.  They have 12 screens, which will always have something you want to see.  The only complaint is that sometimes they don't have enough employees at the concessions, but this isn't an ongoing issue.  If you are traveling through or live in the area give it a try and enjoy a show with your family.
