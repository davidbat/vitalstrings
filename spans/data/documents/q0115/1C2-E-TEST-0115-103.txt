Ashley Grounds                                    Mary Claire O'Banion
Ann Catherine Lux
I have been proud to play opposite each of these young ladies.
Mary Claire played "Clara" in the "Nutcracker" to my "Drosselmeyer" in 2000,  Ann Catherine was my "Clara" in 2001
and in 2002 Ashley was "Swanilda" to my "Dr. Coppelius".
