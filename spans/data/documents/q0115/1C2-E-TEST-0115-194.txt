Welcome to the Lindsay Railroad    Museum in Texarkana!
The Lindsay Railroad Museum has photographic and    art displays that cover Texarkana’s 138-year history.  Texarkana was    founded by the Texas & Pacific Railroad and the Cairo & Fulton Railroad    in the winter of 1873-74.  In time, Texarkana became the regional hub of    nine railroad systems including the Texas & Pacific, Kansas City    Southern, and Missouri Pacific. 
The museum also includes first-person    stories about working for the railroads and memorabilia such as    uniforms, patches, badges and flags.  We have a theater in which to    watch films about railroads and a “hands-on” section for children to    ring the bells, toot the horns, and experience the thrill of train    travel.
Come and enjoy the glory days of    Texarkana’s railroads!
