The Sullivan Performing Arts Center is a 38,000 sf facility on the campus of Texas High School that houses the 1,00-seat John Thomas Theatre and hosts performances not only from the school's arts programs, but also from community orchestral and theatre groups. Supporting spaces include a choir room, green room, a 1,800-sf drama lab, and two drama classrooms. Makeup and costume storage rooms double as an expanded dressing area for larger performances.
Ultimately, this project was design-build with Acoustic Dimensions providing full design services for theatre consulting and acoustics, architectural accommodation and infrastructure design of the performance systems and equipment lists and RFP's for the audio, video, lighting and staging systems.  The design required a link between the new theater and the main classroom building in order to integrate the two buildings.
