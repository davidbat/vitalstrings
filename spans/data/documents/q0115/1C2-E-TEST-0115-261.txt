Star Trek: The Next Generation 25th Anniversary Screenings
On Monday July 23rd at 7:00 PM (local), theaters across the USA will be showing two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation in HD. The two episodes are Ep. 106 “Where No One Has Gone Before” and Ep. 114 “Datalore,” both of which are part of the TNG Blu-ray set which comes out the next day (July 24th).
The event will also include exclusive looks at the massive restoration of season one, never-before-seen interviews with the original cast members and behind-the-scenes looks at the artists who created the original FX elements and photography during the making of the show. Audiences will also be privy to an unseen sneak-peak of “Measure of a Man.”
