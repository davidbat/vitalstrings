Movie cinema theatres are available for a fun afternoon outing with the family, a date, or just an enjoyable day out. Theatres usually have several different rooms where they show their feature movie selection. These are known as multiplexes; though smaller cinemas may only have one or two screens, and have select motion pictures that they choose to screen. If you are interested in finding out more about local cinemas, try researching them online. You can find out a great deal about the history, structure and audio capabilities that must be considered when building one of these structures.   For instance, when you start looking around, you should be able to locate theatres that have both 3-D screens and regular ones to show their movies on. You can also find out which ones near you offer double features, discounted tickets on matinees, and snacks and drinks. Many movie theatres also have interesting histories, which you can also uproot when you being your research. They can feature unique artwork, an elaborate lobby, and even an auditorium.  As you begin to research more in-depth, you can find out more than just the price of admission. You will find out how big the screens are, or how the actual movie is played on the movie screen. In most theatres, the film runs through a projector, where the audience can then watch it play. The first motion picture theatre was built in 1898, with other ones soon to follow. As flicks became more popular, you can find that more and more places where built to show the films.   So, the next time you visit the movies, grab a seat, and enjoy your popcorn, watch the trailers, you will know a little bit more about the history of the theatre.
