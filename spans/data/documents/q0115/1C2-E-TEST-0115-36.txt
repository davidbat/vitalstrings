About us :
The beautifully restored Perot Theatre has been a Texarkana landmark since 1924 when it opened as the Saenger Amusement Co.'s "Gateway to the West" theatre. Fully restored by the City of Texarkana, TX in 1979-80 the building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  Native son H. Ross Perot, through the Perot Foundation, contributed much of the restoration costs in memory of his parents, Mr. & Mrs. Gabriel Ross Perot.  In recognition of this contribution, the Texarkana, Texas City Council renamed the theatre
