Debit Card Policies
This location does accept bank debit cards with the MasterCard or Visa logo at the time of rental if you are at least 25 years of age. You will be subject to a credit check to determine and ensure credit worthiness before releasing the car to you.
At the time of pickup, a debit card cannot be used for the required hold if renting from the cool car selections.
Avis reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to seek a Debit Card authorization hold in excess of the estimated rental charges. We will place a hold on your account of $200 plus the estimated rental charges. THESE FUNDS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE. When the rental is over we will process the reversal but the bank may take time to post it back to the account.
If you fail to return the vehicle as agreed, Avis will obtain additional authorizations from your account to cover the rental charges.
Avis is not responsible for any returned checks or over-drafts based on this policy.
Positive identification in addition to your driver's license may be required.
In the United States, Debit, Cash or Check cards can be used at the end for payment of rental charges. For acceptable credit identification and payment methods in countries outside of the United States, please consult the Renter's Guide and search for the specific location.
Note: Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location. One of the above mentioned cards must be presented. Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are accepted at time of return only.
