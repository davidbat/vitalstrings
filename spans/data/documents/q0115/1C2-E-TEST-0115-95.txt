About IMAX Theaters
From Wikipedia
IMAX (short for Image Maximum) is a film format created by Canada's IMAX Corporation that has the capacity to display images of far greater size and resolution than conventional film display systems. A standard IMAX screen is 22m wide and 16.1m high (72.6ft x 52.8ft), but can be larger. Currently, IMAX is the most widely-used system for large-format, special-venue film presentations. As of March 2007, there were 280 IMAX theatres in 38 countries (60 percent of these are located in the United States and Canada). Half of these are commercial theatres and half are in educational venues. The biggest "IMAX Dome" is in the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. A variation of IMAX, IMAX Dome (originally called OMNIMAX), is designed for projection on tilted dome screens. Films can also be projected in 3D with IMAX 3D.
