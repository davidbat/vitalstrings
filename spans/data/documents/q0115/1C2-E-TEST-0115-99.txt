Description
The Music City Texas Theater is a project of Linden - Music City Texas, Inc., an autonomous nonprofit 501 (c) (3) organization conceived by the Linden Economic Development Corporation in an effort to promote tourism in Linden, Cass County and the surrounding area.  The facility itself is a result of the artful renovation of the Linden American Legion Auditorium built in 1948-50 which is now owned by the City of Linden and leased for ten (10) years to MCT, Inc. The renovation has been accomplished mainly by the volunteer work of the MCT Board of Directors and local citizens, with the necessary funds made available by donations from the Linden Lions Club, the Linden EDC, private individuals and a loan to MCT from the EDC revolving loan fund.   Celebrating its Grand Opening in May of 2003, the theater is now and will continue presenting an array of quality entertainment, ranging from nationally known artists to regional and local entertainers from all genres of music. The theater is also being made available for rental to other organizations that present entertainment as well as for civic and private functions. Plans for the theater's activities also include the presentation of "Community Theater" and educational workshops in the fields of music and the arts.  Donations from private Patron Donors, Sustaining Patron Donor memberships and revenues from the shows that are being presented are currently supporting the theater. A portion of the proceeds in excess of operating expenses will be allocated to community improvement projects.
