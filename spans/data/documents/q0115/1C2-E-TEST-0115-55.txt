Daily Horoscope for June 24
Gemini
Some people are very persuasive and stubborn today, determined to get their own way come what may. Your best bet is to let them get on with it all by themselves, and to leave them alone until they've come to their senses again. Try not to get drawn into a battle of wills, because it will be emotionally exhausting and you won't get anywhere.
