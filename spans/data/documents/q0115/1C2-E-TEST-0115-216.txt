About Texarkana
The city of Texarkana is located on the border of         Arkansas and Texas, and is, if we are politically         correct, two towns with the same name. The only         thing that marks the boundary between the 2 states         and the 2 towns is the State Line Avenue.
Â 
The only U.S. post office situated in two states can         be located at 500 State Line, where Photographer's         Island is a popular tourist spot for taking photos         of people standing in two states at the same time.         Another distinctive attraction is the Ace of Clubs         House, built in the shape of a playing card "club." If you are into culture, you must know that         Texarkana is home to the Perot Theater, the         Texarkana Regional Arts Center, the Discovery Place         Children's Museum and the Texarkana Museum of         Regional History.
Other places of interest in Texarkana include         Millwood State Park, Old Washington Historic State         Park, and the Clinton Center at Hope (the childhood         home of former President Bill Clinton).
If you are on a shopping mood, be sure to stop by         the Central Mall, the Trinity Square, the Summerhill         Square, Richmond Ranch shopping centers and the Oak         Creek Amish Furniture Store or enjoy an exquisite         dinner at one of the restaurants located in the         area.
Just minutes away from one of Texarkana Hotels are         Texas A & M University and Texarkana College.
Texarkana hosts a multitude of events in the         summertime and beyond: the Gunslinger baseball         games, the Jump June festival, the Jam Festival, the         Quadrangle Festival and many golf tournaments.
