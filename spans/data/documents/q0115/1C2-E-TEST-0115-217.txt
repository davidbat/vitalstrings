Texarkana Aircraft Maintenance
The Cities of Texarkana are located on the state line of Texas and Arkansas . Texarkana Regional Airport is located on the Arkansas side just minutes away from the down town area, local industries, and tourist spots, with convenient access to Interstate 30, Loop 245, four U.S. Highways and rail service. The airport is open 24-hours daily and is served by American Eagle Airlines. Texarkana Arkansas and Texas are indeed twice as nice!
