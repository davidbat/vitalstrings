The Perot Theatre was built in 1924 by the Saenger Amusement Company, but was purchased a few years later, in 1931, by the Paramount chain. As admissions dried up in the 1970’s, the theater became a second-run house, eventually closed in 1977.
Reopening after a $2.5 million restoration in 1979-80, the Perot Theatre was granted state and national landmark status and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Former Presidential candidate and Reform Party founder Ross Perot dedicated a statue of his brother, who died at the age of 3, in the Perot Theatre.
This statue, of a small boy waving, has been placed on the theater’s second floor.
