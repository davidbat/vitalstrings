SECONDS COUNT IN AN EMERGENCY!
The Cities of Texarkana, Bowie County, and Miller County have instituted the CodeRED Emergency Notification System - an ultra high-speed telephone communication service for emergency notifications. This system allows us to telephone all or targeted areas of the city or county in case of an emergency situation that requires immediate action (such as a boil-water notice, missing child or evacuation notices). The system is capable of dialing 60,000 phone numbers per hour. It then delivers our recorded message to a live person or an answering machine, making three attempts to connect to any number.
THIS SYSTEM WILL ONLY BE USED FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES
