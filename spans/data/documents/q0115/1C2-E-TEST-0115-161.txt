Historic  Perot Theatre 219 Main Street, (903) 792-4992
Marvel at the Perot Theatre located in downtown Texarkana. The theatre is a  jewel in the region, bringing the best of Broadway, classical music, ballet,  jazz, modern dance and more to Texarkana. First opened in 1924 as the Saenger  Theatre, Emil Weilâ€™s Italian Renaissance design is an architectural marvel.  Through the generosity of native son H. Ross Perot, his sister Bette Perot, and  area residents, the beautiful old theatre was saved and restored into one of the  nationâ€™s major performing arts centers. Throughout the year, the Perot Theatre  Series brings national and international productions to the region.
The photo of the Orchestra and Balcony Boxes shows the intricacy of the plaster  and design features that adorn this beautiful theatre. The theatre is on the  National Register of Historic Places.
