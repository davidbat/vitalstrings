It is my pleasure to welcome you to another year of glorious music with TSO. As we embark on our sixth season, we invite you to Discover Texarkana’s Symphonic Gem and experience timeless music right here in our great community.
Music is precious.  It is everlasting.  Just like a rare stone, it can be enjoyed for its outward beauty and its inner intricacies.  This season, I invite you to fall in love with symphonic music all over again, and to follow me in appreciating every aspect of these enduring masterworks.
Musically Yours,
