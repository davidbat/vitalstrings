Overview
Legend has it that this uniquely designed, Italianate-Victorian style was built by local lumberman and Confederate Veteran Captain James H. Draughon using his winnings from a poker game, won by the ace of clubs.  All of the rooms in the house represent a specific period in history.  This home is available for special events.
