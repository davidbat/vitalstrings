The fact that Texarkana was an important railroad junction caused the city to grow rapidly as railroad traffic grew in the area.The growth of the city in the late 1920s that paralleled the growth of the railroad brought about the need for a new municipal building. The City of Texarkana, Arkansas, decided to build a municipal building that would be a multipurpose building to serve four separate functions for its citizens â€“ city hall, fire station, auditorium, and jail.The architectural firm of Witt, Seibert, and Halsey of Texarkana was hired to design the structure, and they used the unusual combination of the Collegiate Gothic and Art Deco styles for the building. Built over a three year period by the Stewart McGehee Construction Company beginning in 1927, the first section opened in June 1928, as the municipal auditorium. The jail, city hall and fire station were opened at later dates, with completion in 1930. At that time this building was built in 1927-1930, there was no theater, concert stage, or audience space for 1,000 people in the city. While Texarkana has always been a twin city in both Texas and Arkansas, the MunicipalBuilding served the entire community population in the twin cities for performing arts and a gathering place for civic functions. With its city hall, jail and fire station functions, it was uniquely designed to be multipurpose for the Arkansas-side residents.
