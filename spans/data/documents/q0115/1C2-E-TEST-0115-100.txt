Add To My Trip
There's no other place like the town that dubs itself "Twice as Nice." Resting partially in Arkansas and otherwise in Texas, Texarkana has a post office and a bi-state justice center that serve two cities, two counties, and two states. Downtown features also include the Scott Joplin mural, honoring the town son whose storied career includes the writing of theme music for The Sting and other musical material that earned a Pulitzer Prize. Texarkana has more than 824 economical, 751 moderate, 346 first-class, and 9 deluxe accommodations.
Perot Theatre
This 1,600-seat theater, opened in 1924, starred as one of the premier theaters in a four-state area for two decades. Eventually it fell into disrepair and was all but abandoned. Enter Texarkana native H. Ross Perot, who with other townspeople donated $2 million in 1977 to restore the Italian Renaissance structure. Now the theater serves as a venue for concerts, plays, and musicals.
Texarkana Historical Museum
Built in 1879, the building housing this museum is one of the oldest in Texarkana. Displays include Caddo Indian artifacts, farm tools, and replicas of a parlor and a kitchen from 1900.
Here are a few quick day trips that will satisfy even the most adventurous spirit.
