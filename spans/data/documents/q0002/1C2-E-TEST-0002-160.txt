Marvin Gaye - Let's Get It On (1973)
I'm sure you all are familiar with the title track. A sensual masterpiece that gave every special evening an extra little something if you know what I mean. The rest of the album is fantastic as well with Gaye boasting one of the most soothing voices you will ever hear.
