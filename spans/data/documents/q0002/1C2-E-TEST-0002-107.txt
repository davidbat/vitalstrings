J.Crew Red Knit Cap x Marvin Gaye
Influence... Sometimes it's incredibly hard to put a finger on it. Sometimes it's the 800 lb. gorilla... As a kid I wore a red knit cap that's primary function was for hunting in the cold weather. It even had a mask that I would tuck inside the hat so you couldn't see it. Now I've never been hunting in my life but I thought the cap was so fresh... I would wear it indoors with a white v-neck t-shirt and never cover my ears. Needless to say this piece was all style for me. Thinking back I thought I was so original...
But the true innovator was Marvin Gaye. As a youth I must of looked at his album cover for Let's Get It On a million times. Its iconic imagery had a lasting impression on me I didn't fully realize till now. Initially this season when h(y)r collective featured this style from the likes of Head Porter Plus , Our Legacy , and Happy People I immediately thought The Life Aquatic ... But the true pioneer must be celebrated.
With that said J.Crew has released a version in the perfect reddish orange color made of 90% wool and 10% cashmere for that softness. Unfortunately, it hasn't made its way onto their site just yet. But it's worth a trip to the Liquor Store  with your girl because the price is right...
