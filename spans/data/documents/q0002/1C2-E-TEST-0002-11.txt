Great Question:
Yes, Marvin's work did have an influence on Sly and most of the other "Front Men" of African American Heritage.  Marvin was looked at in many ways as the "Frank Sinatra" of soul music.  He had the looks, voice and writing abilities that made him the envy of many.  He was also a fantastic drum and percussion player as well.  Not many people know it, but some of the early hits at motown by groups like the Temptations featured him playing on the drums.
If you listen to Sly's early 70's material, you can feel the influence of Marvin as the What's Going On album really changed music across the board in so many ways.  Other than the Curtis Mayfield led "Impressions" not too many black artists were allowed to deal with those kinds of political issues.  Marvin truly was a trail blazer in that sense and you see a string of all time classics coming one after the other once that album was released.
