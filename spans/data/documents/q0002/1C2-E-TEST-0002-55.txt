His work in the early- and mid-1970s included the albums, '' What's Going On  ,   Let's Get It On  , and   I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)|I Want You  , which helped influence the  quiet storm ,  urban adult contemporary , and  slow jam  genres.

was born on April 2, 1939 at  Freedman's Hospital  in  Washington, D.C. . His father,  Marvin Gay, Sr. , was a  Minister (Christianity)|minister  at the House of God (the House of God headquarters is located in  Lexington, Kentucky ), a  Hebrew   Pentecostal  sect which advocated strict conduct and taught and believed in both the  Old Testament|Old  and  New Testament|New  Testament. His mother,  Alberta Gay  (née Cooper), was a  domestic worker|domestic  and  schoolteacher . As a child, Gaye was raised in the  Benning Terrace  projects in southeast D.C.

By the time his eldest son was four, Marvin Sr. was bringing Gaye with him to sing for church congregations. Gaye's early home life was marked by violence as his father would often strike him for any shortcoming. Gaye and his three siblings were  Bed wetting|bed-wetters  as children.

Gaye would later compare his father's dominance over the family as of one of " tyrant|tyrannic  control" and said he was convinced that he would eventually "become a child suicide statistic" had it not been for his mother's love and encouragement.
By age fourteen, Gaye's parents moved to the  Deanwood, Washington, D.C.|Deanwood  neighborhood of northeast D.C. The following year, Gaye's father quit the  Minister (Christianity)|ministry  after he was passed for promotion as the Chief Apostle (head overseer) of the House of God Inc. Gaye's father never kept a job and developed  alcoholism , which made Gaye's home life more difficult.
Learning how to play piano, organ and drums at a young age, Marvin soon discovered  rhythm and blues|R& B  and a subgenre known as  doo-wop . Entering  Cardozo Senior High School|Cardozo High School , he joined several groups in the D.C. area including the Dippers with his best friend, Johnny Stewart, brother of R& B singer  Billy Stewart . He then joined the D.C. Tones, whose members included Reese Palmer, who was another close friend, and Sondra Lattisaw, mother of R& B singer Stacy Lattisaw .
Gaye's relationship with his father led him to run away from home and join the  United States Air Force  in the hope of becoming an  aviator . However, discovering his growing hatred for authority, he began defying orders and skipped practices. Faking  mental illness , he was discharged.
His sergeant stated that Gaye refused to follow orders.

Returning home, Gaye and Reese Palmer formed the doo-wop quintet, the Marquees.
Career
Early career (1958–1962)
Main|The Moonglows
In 1958, the Marquees were discovered singing at a D.C. club by  Bo Diddley , who signed them to  Okeh Records , where they recorded "Wyatt Earp," with "Hey Little Schoolgirl" as its  A-side and B-side|B-side . The song was only modestly successful and later in the year, Diddley introduced the Marquees to friend  Harvey Fuqua , who was looking for a group to replace members of his original group,  The Moonglows , who had broken up due to tensions within the group. Fuqua took them under his wing and changed their name to "Harvey & The Moonglows", signing them to  Chess Records  in 1959. There, the group would record several songs including "Twelve Months of the Year" and "Mama Loochie" and would sing background for Diddley,  Chuck Berry  and  Etta James .
In 1960, Fuqua suddenly disbanded the group and relocated from Chicago to Detroit, where he had found work as a songwriter and producer for  Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwen Gordy 's  Anna Records . Fuqua brought Marvin with him and had him signed to Anna as a staff session musician. He would also earn pay stocking records in the label's building. After Harvey and Gwen formed the Harvey and Tri-Phi record labels, Marvin worked behind the scenes as a drummer on those labels, playing drums on the  The Spinners (American R& B group)|Spinners ' debut Tri-Phi single, " That's What Girls Are Made For ". Marvin invited himself to an annual Christmas party at  Motown Records|Motown  CEO  Berry Gordy 's house and impressed Gordy with his performances. After Berry Gordy sought interest in signing Marvin to Motown, Fuqua sold 50% of his interest in the singer.

Influenced by the crossover pop successes of  Nat King Cole  and  Ray Charles , Marvin aspired to perform jazz songs and standards rather than the typical R& B recorded for the fledgling label. In May 1961, Marvin issued his first single, " Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide ", which didn't chart. Prior to its release, Marvin added an "e" to his last surname, assuming it would make him look "more professional". In his biography of Marvin,   Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye  , author  David Ritz  noted the change was personal, citing reasons for the change to be from gossip over the original name's meaning and to distance himself from his domineering father.
cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/hg2g/A10508384|publisher=BBC |title=The Stars of Motown|accessdate=December 23, 2010
That June, Motown's subsidiary, Tamla Records, issued Marvin's debut album,   The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye  . The record, like his first single, failed to chart. Marvin supported himself by playing with Motown's road band on drums, supporting artists such as  The Miracles  and blues artist  Jimmy Reed .
After Motown started setting up an artist development course, Marvin required little training but was still told to attend the school, which he refused, something he said he regretted later.
The only clear advice he took was to keep his eyes open while he performed because, according to Maxine Powell, "it looked like he was sleeping when he was performing."
Marvin's first solo success came as a composer of  The Marvelettes ' " Beechwood 4-5789 ". Earlier, Marvin played drums on the group's debut hit, " Please Mr. Postman " and its later hit, " Playboy (The Marvelettes song)|Playboy ". He continued session work as a drummer after establishing himself in the label, contributing drums to his composition of Martha and the Vandellas ' " Dancing in the Street " as well as  Stevie Wonder|Little Stevie Wonder 's " Fingertips (song)|Fingertips ". Later in 1962, he scored his first hit with his fourth single, " Stubborn Kind of Fellow ", which reached No. 8 R& B and reached the top 50 of the pop chart, peaking at No. 46. His next single, " Hitch Hike (song)|Hitch Hike ", reached the top 40 of the pop charts. Both songs were featured in Marvin's second album,   That Stubborn Kinda Fellow  , released in December 1962.
Early success (1963–1966)
Starting in late 1962, Marvin was a mid-headliner of the  Motortown Revue , a series of concert performances that took place in the  chitlin' circuit . Despite the early intensity of his hit singles, Gaye feared live performing, choosing to sit on a stool and sing rather than dance. Marvin's next hit came with " Pride and Joy (Marvin Gaye song)|Pride and Joy ", which sold nearly a million copies and peaked at No. 10 at the Hot 100. Other hits followed including " Can I Get a Witness ", " You Are a Wonderful One ", " Try It Baby " and " Baby Don't You Do It ", all of which helped to make him Motown's best-selling male artist surpassing  Marv Johnson .
In 1964, Motown released Marvin's first duet album with singer  Mary Wells  on the album,   Together (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells album)|Together  . The album became Marvin's first to chart, peaking at No. 42 and featured the hits, " Once Upon a Time (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells song)|Once Upon a Time " and " What's the Matter with You Baby ". Marvin released a string of million-selling singles in 1965 including " How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) ", " I'll Be Doggone " and " Ain't That Peculiar ". His profile was further raised by appearances on   American Bandstand  ,   Shindig!  ,   Hollywood A Go-Go   and   The T.A.M.I. Show  . His recordings by then influenced the UK  mod (subculture)|mod scene  and groups who performed as part of the scene, including  The Who  performed songs of Marvin's at clubs. The production of "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" surprised American producer  Phil Spector  who nearly had a car accident after first hearing the song.
Despite his reputation as a ladies man in R& B music, Marvin was not satisfied, aspiring to perform jazz music and pop standards despite the failure of his first album. Motown allowed him to record jazz material for the album, '' When I'm Alone I Cry   while he recorded pop standards for   Hello Broadway   and paid tribute to Nat King Cole on the album,   A Tribute to the Great Nat "King" Cole ''. In 1966, he even performed at the  Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana  and had planned to issue a live album from the sessions. Despite his best efforts, Gaye's jazz inspired albums failed to chart and the live album was shelved for unknown reasons. Marvin soon retired the jazz standards from his live act after studying his audience's expressions when he performed them. His 1966 album,   Moods of Marvin Gaye  , featured the musician performing in a variety of genres. That year, he and  Kim Weston  released the album,   Take Two (Marvin Gaye & Kim Weston album)|Take Two   and the song, " It Takes Two (song)|It Takes Two ". The song became a hit reaching the top twenty in both the US and UK. Weston soon left and she was replaced by veteran singer Tammi Terrell to be his new duet partner.
Tammi Terrell and  I Heard It Through the Grapevine  (1967–1969)
Main|Tammi Terrell|I Heard It Through the GrapevineTerrell and Gaye's first major hit was the  Ashford & Simpson|Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson  composition, " Ain't No Mountain High Enough ". The duo quickly followed up with the top five hit ballad, " Your Precious Love ". Despite rumors of a romantic relationship – Gaye was married to Anna Gordy and Terrell was dating  The Temptations|Temptations  lead vocalist David Ruffin – both singers denied such a relationship with Gaye saying later that they had a brother-and-sister relationship, a statement reiterated by Ashford & Simpson. Other hit singles the duo scored within an eighteen-month period included " If I Could Build My Whole World Around You ", " Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing " and " You're All I Need to Get By ". Other hits such as " You Ain't Livin' till You're Lovin' " and " The Onion Song " found success in Europe. The duo's recording of " If This World Were Mine ", the b-side of "If I Could Build My Whole World Around You", found modest success on the charts, the first sole Gaye composition to do so. The song later found major R& B success when Luther Vandross covered it with  Cheryl Lynn  over a decade later.
The duo was also a success together onstage, Terrell's easy-going nature with the audience contrasting from Gaye's laid-back approach. However, that success was short-lived. On October 14, 1967, while performing at Virginia's  Hampden-Sydney College , Terrell collapsed in Marvin's arms. She had been complaining of headaches in the weeks leading up to the concert, but had insisted she was all right. However, after she was rushed to Southside Community Hospital, doctors found that Terrell had a malignant brain tumor.

The cancer ended her career as a live performer though she continued to record under supervision and often with guidance and assistance. Terrell ceased recordings in 1969 due to her continued issues with her illness and Motown struggled with recording a planned third Gaye/Terrell album. Though he initially refused to go along with Motown's plan, he only reluctantly agreed after Motown assured him recordings would go to pay for Terrell's surgeries as she continued to have unsuccessful operations to remove the tumor. In September 1969, the third Gaye and Terrell duet album,   Easy (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell album)|Easy   was released, with many of the songs said to have been subbed by  Valerie Simpson , while solo songs recorded years earlier by Terrell, had overdubbed vocals by Gaye.
Listen|filename=1968-marvin-gaye-grapevine.ogg|title="I Heard It through the Grapevine"|description="I Heard It through the Grapevine" was recorded by Gaye in April 1967, several months before Gladys Knight and the Pips  recorded it. The song features an horror-based  Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer  piano solo, percussion and horns. Gaye's recording of it paved the way for what later became " psychedelic soul ".
In October 1968, Motown issued a year-old version of the  Norman Whitfield - Barrett Strong  composition, " I Heard It Through the Grapevine ". Despite Gordy's fears it wouldn't succeed, the song became an international hit, becoming Marvin's first number-one hit in both the US and UK charts. Despite its success, Gaye was quoted saying he felt he "didn't deserve" its success. Following its success, Gaye continued to work with Whitfield and Strong throughout 1969 releasing the albums,   M.P.G.   and '' That's the Way Love Is (album)|That's The Way Love Is '' and had hits with " Too Busy Thinking About My Baby ", " That's the Way Love Is " and, in the UK, a version of " Abraham, Martin & John ". In 1969 and 1970, he proved to be as successful as a producer when he produced  The Originals ' hits " Baby I'm for Real " and " The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells ".
''What's Going On  (1970–1972)
Main|What's Going OnTammi Terrell succumbed to complications of brain cancer on March 16, 1970. Gaye was the only Motown artist to attend her funeral and spoke at her eulogy. Gaye insisted afterwards that he wouldn't record with another female performer, fearing something bad may happen with them. Fearing his own mortality, Gaye also refused live performing and began suffering bouts of  stage fright . Acquaintances later claimed the musician never recovered from her death. Gaye sought a try out to join the  Detroit Lions  football team, something that had been an inspiration of his for a couple of years.

While the Lions allowed him to try out, the team decided not to enlist him in fears of injuring him.

Gaye befriended two of the Lions teammates at the time,  Mel Farr  and  Lem Barney . On June 10, 1970, Marvin returned to Motown's  Hitsville U.S.A.  studios to record his new composition, " What's Going On (song)|What's Going On ", which came about after inspiration came from Gaye's brother Frankie's accounts of the  Vietnam War and co-writer  Renaldo "Obie" Benson  of the  Four Tops ' anger at witnessing  police brutality  in San Francisco. Upon hearing the song, Berry Gordy feared a backlash against Gaye's fan base and his ladies' man reputation and shelved the record for a year. Refusing to record anything that was of Motown's or Gordy's version of him, he refused to return to the studio, only doing so to test out other songs he had composed with no desire to release them at the time. Eventually "What's Going On" was released on January 17, 1971 and quickly shot to number-one on the R& B chart, staying there for five weeks.

Eventually selling more than two million copies, an album was requested, and Gaye again defied Gordy by producing an album featuring lengthy singles that talked of other issues such as poverty, taxes,  drug abuse  and pollution. Released on May 21, 1971, the '' What's Going On '' album instantly became a million-seller and successfully crossing over to fans of  album-oriented rock|AOR  stations while maintaining his R& B fan base. Because of its lyrical content and its mixture of  funk ,  jazz music|jazz ,  Classical music|classical  and  Latin music  arrangements which departed from the then renowned " Motown Sound ", it became one of Motown's first autonomous works, without help of Motown's staff producers. Based upon its themes and a segue flow into each of the songs sans the title track, the  concept album  became the new template for  soul music .
The album spawned two more top ten hits, " Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) " and " Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) ". All three songs would sell over a million copies and all had lengthy stays at number-one on the R& B chart. It was later hailed as "the most important and passionate record to come out of  soul music , delivered by one of its finest voices".
John Bush. ''What's Going On  remains one of the few examples in modern music where critical acclaim and immediate commercial success occurred simultaneously.  What's Going On  was the first in a series of Motown albums in which albums overtook singles in commercial importance as well as cultural significance.Allmusic|class=album|id=r8079/review|pure_url=yes review of  What's Going On , by Marvin Gaye, allmusic.com (accessed June 10, 2005).
The success of the title track influenced Stevie Wonder to release an album with similar themes,   Where I'm Coming From '', in April that year. Following the release of the album and its subsequent success, Wonder rejected a renewing offer with Motown unless he was allowed creative control on his recordings, which was granted a year later. Another Motown act inspired by Gaye's success,  The Jackson 5 , tried unsuccessfully to allow Motown to release their own compositions on an album but was rebuffed leaving the group to leave four years after the release of ''What's Going On .
Gaye's success was nationally recognized: Billboard magazine awarded him the  Trendsetter of the Year  award, while he won several  NAACP Image Awards  including Favorite Male Singer.   Rolling Stone   named it Album of the Year, and was nominated for a couple of Grammy Awards though inexplicably wasn't nominated for  Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year . In 1972, Gaye reluctantly stepped out of his stage retirement to perform selected concerts, including one at his hometown of Washington, D.C. performing at the famed  Kennedy Center , a recording of the performance was issued on a deluxe edition re-release of the ''What's Going On'' album. Gaye later performed for  Jesse Jackson 's  Rainbow/PUSH|PUSH  organization and also for a  Chicago -based benefit concert titled Save the Children aimed at removing the plight of urban violence in Chicago's  inner city . The latter performance was issued as part of a concert film released in early 1973, also titled  Save the Children . Following its success, Gaye signed a new contract with Motown Records for a then record-setting $1& nbsp;million, then the most lucrative deal by a black recording artist.
In late 1972, Gaye produced the score for the   Trouble Man   film and later produced the  Trouble Man (album)|soundtrack of the same name . The title track was the only full vocal work of the album and was released as a single in the fall of 1972 eventually reaching number seven on the pop chart in the spring of 1973.
''Let's Get It On  and continued success in music (1973–1977)
Main|Let's Get It On|I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)Listen|filename=Let's Get It On sample.ogg|title="Let's Get It On"|description="Let's Get It On" was written by Gaye and producer  Ed Townsend , originally as a  gospel  song, and later as a  protest  song before eventually turning into a  funk -oriented love anthem. It became Gaye's second number-one hit in 1973.
In 1971, Marvin left Detroit, relocating to Los Angeles. Following the move, he recorded much of  Trouble Man  in Motown's Hitsville West studios. In March 1973, deciding to switch from social issues to sexual topics, Gaye recorded what later became one of his signature anthems, " Let's Get It On (song)|Let's Get It On ". The song was released that June and became Gaye's second number-one hit in the US. Its parent album, also titled '' Let's Get It On  , consisted of material Gaye had initially recorded during the sessions of  What's Going On  and was released that August. It was hailed as "a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy."
Jason Ankeny, Allmusic|class=album|id=r8081|pure_url=yes review of   Let's Get It On'', by Marvin Gaye, allmusic.com (accessed June 10, 2005).
Other singles from the album included " Come Get to This ", which recalled Gaye's early Motown soul sound of the previous decade, while the suggestive " You Sure Love to Ball " reached modest success but was kept from being promoted by Motown due to its sexually explicit nature.
Motown soon demanded a tour. On January 4, 1974, Gaye performed at the  Oakland Coliseum  in  Oakland, California|Oakland , California. The performance was later recorded for Gaye's second live album,   Marvin Gaye Live!   The album sold over a million copies and featured a show-stopping rendition of " Distant Lover ", which later inspired a single release where it became a top 40 hit in 1974. While Marvin's new Tamla contract gave him creative control, he reluctantly agreed to work on his final duet recordings with Diana Ross . The   Diana & Marvin   album was released in the fall of 1973 and became an international success. Meanwhile success of Gaye's concert tour caused Motown to add more dates into 1975. A renewed contract with Motown in 1975 allowed the musician to build his own  Marvin's Room (recording studio)|custom-made recording studio .
In 1976, Gaye released his next album,   I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)|I Want You  . The title track became a top 20 hit while a 12-inch version of the song and " After the Dance " became a hit on disco charts. In the summer of 1976, Gaye embarked on his first European tour in years. A performance culled from the  London Palladium  in London resulted in the release of   Live at the London Palladium   in 1977. The album included the studio track, " Got to Give It Up|Got to Give It Up, Pt. 1 ", which became Gaye's third and final number-one US hit and helped the album sell over two million copies, becoming one of the top ten best-selling albums in the United States.
Here, My Dear ,  In Our Lifetime  and his final days at Motown (1978–1981)
Main|Here, My Dear|In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)In late 1978, Marvin released his so-called "divorce" album,   Here, My Dear  , inspired by the fallout of his marriage to Anna Gordy. The album included the top 40 R& B single, " A Funky Space Reincarnation ", but became Gaye's first album to not sell over a million copies, initially flopping on the charts both commercially and critically. The album had been released after he had agreed to remit a portion of the album's sales to Gordy to pay for child support of their son, Marvin III.
Marvin toured throughout 1979 in the United States, Europe and Japan and released another minor R& B hit, " Ego Tripping Out ", one of the first in which he detailed his drug abuse. Relocating to Hawaii after a fallout of his second marriage to Janis Hunter,  substance dependence|drug addiction  and issues with the  Internal Revenue Service|IRS , Gaye tried working on his next album,  Love Man . After a 1980 European tour, Marvin moved to London and switched the direction of  Love Man  with questions of a possible  Armageddon  and addressing his own personal problems retitling the album as  In Our Lifetime?  . In January 1981, Tamla released the   In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)|In Our Lifetime   album. When he found of its release, a perturbed Gaye accused the label of editing and  remix ing the album without his consent, putting out an unfinished song ("Far Cry"), altering the album art he requested, and removing the question mark from the title, muting its irony.

Main|Midnight Love|Sexual HealingListen|filename=Sexual_Healing.ogg|title="Sexual Healing"|description="Sexual Healing" was written by Gaye alongside Odell Brown and  David Ritz . Ritz said Gaye advised him to write a poem after telling the singer he needed "sexual healing" while living in Europe. The song became an international hit after its release in 1982.
Following his move to  Ostend , Belgium in early 1981, Gaye embarked on a mini-tour of England, ending this tour with two performances in Ostend. A documentary leading up to the Belgium performances,  Transit Ostend , would later be released to just Belgian fans and would later be issued on VHS in bootleg copies following the musician's death. His attorney until his death, Curtis Shaw, said Gaye's Ostend period was "the best thing that ever happened to Marvin". Following this tour, he and a couple of his musicians,  Gordon Banks  and  Odell Brown , began working on material together. After Marvin signed with CBS' Columbia subsidiary, he, Banks and Brown worked on what became the   Midnight Love   album starting in May 1982. Gaye later recruited his past collaborator Harvey Fuqua to work on the album as an advisor of the album's production, later adding background vocals to Gaye's signature hit, " Sexual Healing ".
"Sexual Healing" was written by Gaye and Odell Brown, with David Ritz later getting credit for the song's title. The song, released in September of that year, became an immediate success, reaching No. 1 on the R& B charts, staying there for a record ten weeks. The song crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at No. 3 in early 1983, and became a number-one hit in Canada and New Zealand while reaching the top five in the UK. The video to the song was shot at the Casino-Kursaal in Ostend.

cquote|I don't make records for pleasure. I did when I was a younger artist, but I don't today. I record so that I can feed people what they need, what they feel. Hopefully, I record so that I can help someone overcome a bad time. NME   – December 1982
