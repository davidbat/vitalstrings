Marvin Gaye Tribute Concert @ Minglewood Hall | 7:00 PM
Here is the breakdown of the Tribute Show- It’s a live show themed around the life and influence of Marvin Gaye that has featured performances by Tim Terry, Men-nefer (Tamara Jones & Tonya Dyson), Will Graves, Stephanie Bolton, New Genesis (formerly Nujynisis), Larry Springfield and several other Memphis-bred artists in the past. It’s the 6th time this show will be performed in Memphis and this year's theme is "The Genres"…putting emphasis on the multi-faceted influence Marvin has had on ALL genres of music.  A hint of “Marvin” can be heard & felt in the works of Luther Vandross (R&B), Robert Palmer & Annie Lenox (POP), Kirk Whalum (Jazz).  Marvin, himself, can be heard in Hip Hop where- thanks to modern technology- Jay-Z & Eric Sermon have exposed the younger generation to the creative genius of Marvin Gaye by sampling his voice and/or music in their songs. more >>>
