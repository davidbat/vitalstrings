This Anthology of Marvin Gaye is a great retrospective of a brilliant career.  The two disks are broken up in a way we hear the two distinct eras of his career.  Disk one contains all his work from the 1960's including the amazing "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" (his first number one hit) and other hits including "Stubborn Kind Of Fellow", "Pride & Joy", "Hitch Hike" and "Can I Get A Witness", his duets with Kim Weston and the late Tammi Terrill including "It Takes Two", "Your Precious Love" and "If I Could Build My Whole World Around You" and some lesser known gems like "Little Darlin'".  During his time at Motown in the 60's, he was a typical Motown artist, recording the songs that were given to him and had no real creative control.  In the 1970's he rebelled against this system and took control over his music with tremendous results.  Disk two covers the 70's songs including the number songs "Let's Get It On" and "Got To Give It Up (Part 1)" and other classics like "What's Going On", "Inner City Blues", "Trouble Man" & "I Want You".
