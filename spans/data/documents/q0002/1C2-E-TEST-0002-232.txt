Old School R&B Showdown: Marvin Gaye vs. Teddy Pendergrass -- Who Is The Ultimate Soul Man?
I'm a huge fan of old school R&B music, particularly anything by Marvin Gaye and Teddy Pendergrass. Although I'm young myself, I always had what people have described as having an "old soul." Growing up, that was all I was raised on: The Temptations, The O'Jays, The Intruders, Billy Paul, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, etc. REAL MUSIC, not like the stuff that these kids try to sample today from real old school artists, slap a few lyrics on it, and pass it off as "art." Teddy and Marvin were by far my favorite, though. As I've gotten older, I've done more research about the two of these legends. It amazes me how similar they are, both being Aries, but also how different they are.
Which leads me to my question...who do you think is better...?
The Ladies Man, Marvin Gaye?
Or the Teddy Bear, Teddy Pendergrass?
Why?
Please only REAL answers from people who TRULY know what REAL MUSIC is ABOUT, please! I've always wanted to get people's opinion on this. I think it'll be interesting with what you all come up with! Thanks for reading!
