The title track on What's Going On is a profound outcry against some of the most immediate political troubles of the day.  Popular sentiment against the Vietnam War was at an all-time high.  The protest culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s had deeply influenced Gaye and many of the people around him, especially because of Motown's inevitable connections with the black power movement .  And some of Gaye's biggest heroes, namely Sam Cooke , had sung powerful songs of protest in the not-so-distant past.  The political climate was perfect for a meeting of pop soul music with soulful social commentary .
