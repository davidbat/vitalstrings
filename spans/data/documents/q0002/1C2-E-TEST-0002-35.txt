I don't think you can really compare these men to each other because they each excelled at different areas of music.
In my opinion just based on pure vocal talent/singing ability Marvin Gaye was the best but each were vocally highly influential on music.
But..
If we talk about pure musical talent/musical prowess(songwriting,musical vision/talent,producing..etc) then Stevie Wonder is the man hands down.
From Music Of My Mind to Talking Book to Innervisions to Fulfillingness' First Finale the man kept raising the bar in music and then he put out his greatest album Songs In The Key Of Life.
Stevie was(mostly) a self contained musical genius while Marvin had some help from people like Leon Ware and Michael's greatest success was helped(in part) by Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton.
But...
If we are talking about pure star power/pure entertainment ability then Michael Jackson is the man here(and it ain't even close).
There's no way Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye could have done what Michael Jackson did during his performance of Billie Jean at the Motown 25 Special.
Funkadelic sung about One Nation Under A Groove but Michael Jackson had the entire WORLD under one groove.
Michael Jackson was quite simply the greatest entertainer who ever lived and the most famous human being who ever lived.
You could right now show a picture of Michael Jackson to someone in the the World who has never met a Black person and who can't speak any English but they would know who he was.
