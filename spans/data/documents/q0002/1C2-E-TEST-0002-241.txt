On May 17, Motown /UMe will release a 40th anniversary version of Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On.”
The Super Deluxe Edition includes two CDs and one vinyl album, 14 unreleased tracks, rarities, as well as an oversized booklet with two essays and rare photos from the original cover shoot.
Disc one contains the original mix of the title song (which was rejected during a Motown meeting), plus the album’s three mono singles releases.
On disc two, there are some mostly instrumental tracks that came from jam sessions with Ray Parker Jr. and others. Also included are the nonalbum single “You’re the Man” along with two rare alternate takes of that song.
