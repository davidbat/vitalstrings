perfect combonation
the way the 2 of them sound together is amazing. no male or female duet past or present can match their sound. they had to be in love to make beautiful music like that.

What more could you ask for...
This is a beautiful album--it has outstandingly beautiful and timeless voices, lovely songs, and top notch production.  Tammi & Marvin's voices meshes together like honey in tea...so sweet and so warm...blending both voices into each other, but still having a separate entity all their own.  This album show be required listening...For even more Marvin & Tammi, check out the Complete Duets (it's even more beautiful!).
