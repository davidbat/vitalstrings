Just because Oddisee is dropping People Hear What They See on June 12 doesn’t mean dude hasn’t stayed busy working on other projects. In fact, he’s already readied another one that we’ll be hearing next Tuesday, May 15(!!). It’s a free remix EP called Odd Renditions that’ll feature his own takes on joints like Marvin Gaye’s “Ain’t That Peculiar”. In addition to changing up the instrumentation on the tracks, Oddisee’s spitting on them, too. Yeah, safe to say we’re ridiculously excited for this. Watch the video for “Ain’t That Peculiar” below.
