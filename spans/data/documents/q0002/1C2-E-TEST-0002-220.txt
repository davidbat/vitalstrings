Wikipedia Founder Protests Extradition of “Pirating” UK Student
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is helping Richard O'Dwyer,  the UK-based ex-administrator of the video linking website TVShack, to prevent him from being extradited to the US for alleged copyright infringements. According to Wales, the case is an example of the ever-growing influence of the copyright lobby over the Internet. "Richard O'Dwyer is the human face of the battle between the content industry and the interests of the general public," Wales states.
