Gaye wrote this in Ostend, a resort town on the coast of Belgium. He went there in 1981 to relax and recover from his drug problems. He stayed for 18 months before returning to the US.
A writer named David Ritz gave Gaye the idea for this. Gaye had a large collection of pornography, to the point that many people felt he was addicted to porn. When he noticed the large collection of pornography, Ritz told Gaye he needed some "Sexual Healing," and Marvin had him write some words which became the lyrics to the song. Gaye had invited Ritz to Ostend to help write his biography.
Ritz was not given a writing credit for this, but was thanked in the liner notes. This broke his friendship with Gaye, as Ritz sued for a songwriter credit. After Gaye died, he won the case and got the credit.
Gaye had a lot of success writing very sexual songs and built a reputation as a ladies' man, but he was the son of a preacher and struggled with his religious values. This conflict tormented him for years and played a part in his death in 1984.
When Gaye left Belgium and toured to support this album, he started using drugs again and became mentally unstable. He moved in with his parents, and was shot and killed by his father after an argument on the day before his 45th birthday. He father claimed he shot in self-defense.
Gaye's keyboard player, Odell Brown, came up with the music. Gaye had been trying for a while to put lyrics to it.
This was the first single Gaye released after leaving Motown Records. He spent 20 tumultuous years with the label, which included disputes over royalties and marriage to Berry Gordy's daughter, Anna. He recorded this album for CBS Records.
This won a Grammy in 1982 for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male. The instrumental version also won for Best R&B Instrumental.
DJ Max-A-Million did a remix of this in 1995 that became very popular in dance clubs.
