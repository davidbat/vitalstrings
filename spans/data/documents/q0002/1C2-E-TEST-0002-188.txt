Marvin Winans
Alone But Not Alone
When naming the top five most influential entities within the history of Gospel music, one doesn't have to think hard before The Winans are mentioned.  The brotherly quartet blazed new trails within the industry with a sound and message that was fresh, exciting, and long lasting.
After a quarter century in the industry, the influence of this group prepares to hit a new generation as the long awaited debut solo project from front man Pastor Marvin L. Winans hits the store shelves, on the PureSprings Gospel label.  The talented vocalist, songwriter, and pastor releases a 12-track magnum opus that is poised to make a lasting impact.
Winans' bonafide recipe for success is a slew of original pieces cleverly mixed with profound lyrics, a dash of incredible vocalists, all mixed by a master chef renowned producer Tommy Sims, whose production quality perfectly brings Winans' voice and songs to life.
A throwback to the days of Marvin Gaye and The Doobie Brothers, this effort puts great focus on raw emotion and life's experience funneled through the hope that only Christ gives.
From the opening note of the album's title cut, Winans takes listeners on perhaps the most musically mature journey of the decade.

Insider Interview
Musical authenticity and lyrical transparency are the dominant themes of this effort.  Winans bears his soul on "Just Don't Wanna Know" and "I'm Over It Now", both of which exude extreme plausibility birthed from personal experience.
Equally personal is the up-tempo "I Still Believe", showing that people can be both healed and restored from emotional hurts, no matter the depth of those pains.
Winans taps into unique places for his collaborations on this effort.  The tenor introduces 16-year old vocal sensation DeShondra Rideout on "I Shall Never".  The talented Kim Burrell joins the Detroit-based pastor on the standout jazzy ballad "Try".
Twin brother Carvin Winans appears on the deliciously infectious "My Story".  The surprise guest appearance comes from the late Ronald Winans, whose incredible appearance on "Joy" is literally breathtaking and will leave you speechless.
Truth be told, this album will take multiple listens to digest.  It's been a long time since such musical and lyrical depths have been presented from one artist on one album.  True music purists will appreciate the opulent presentation of this body of work and will ultimately walk away inspired, encouraged, and motivated.
For the Gospel community, and in fact for the music community in general, Alone But Not Alone is a musical masterpiece that will be a topic of conversation for years to come.
