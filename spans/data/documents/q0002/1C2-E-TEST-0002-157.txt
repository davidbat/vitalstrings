There's something undeniably sweet about a bunch of couples all singing and dancing to songs about the joys of matrimonial lovemaking. So it was during R&B singer Raphael Saadiq's performance in the Lincoln Superlounge, where he brought out "It's Our Anniversary," a hit from his days in the Oakland-based R&B group Tony! Toni! Tone! in the early 1990s.
"I've only made plans /to hold your little hand. /It's our anniversary," he sang, the lyrics' pure sentiment harking back to the "sugar pie, honey bun" days of Motown soul.
The connection to 1960s rhythm and blues ran deep in Saadiq's set. A prelude to the show, played against a dark stage, was a live recording of Marvin Gaye singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," both a nod to the Independence Day weekend and to the legendary singer, clearly a strong influence on Saadiq. He came out dressed like early '60s Gaye in a skinny black tie, button-down white shirt and snappy, slim-fitting mustard suit. Two backup singers, one male and one female, wore similar black suits and carried out coordinated doo-wop-style moves.
After a brief upbeat intro, he went right into a trio of Tony! Toni! Tone! hits, including "(Lay Your Head On My) Pillow" and "It's Our Anniversary." One couple next to me enjoyed the throwback slow jams so much, they both belted out the first verse of "Just Me and You" during the song's instrumental intro.
"Saadiq is a bad dude," the man said, as the singer took over from the audience participation.
After getting the slow sweetheart songs out of the way, Saadiq upped the energy and went into a trio of upbeat jams, keeping the capacity crowd dancing. Outside the Superlounge, at least a hundred latecomers were kept behind a barricade, waiting to be let in at brief intervals by security.
Such is the power of the charming Saadiq's soul prowess -- and of his R&B fantasy of a world where all men and women fall in love, marry, stay faithful and hold hands every anniversary.
