Marvin Gaye
The most perfect suite of music recorded in my lifetime.
The newly remastered version on this three CD and one LP box-set sounds great – with added oomph to the bass and shimmer to the high end – but how do you better perfection? Extras include original mixes, some rather funk-by-numbers instrumentals and the first vinyl version of Motown's "Detroit Mix", scrapped in favour of Gaye's own version. Note: you can buy 12 copies of the ordinary CD for the price of this.
