Sam Cooke > Marvin Gaye
Shani on January 12th, 2010
Based on a, um, civil discussion I had on Twitter last night, I know a lot of people are under the misapprehension that the reverse is true. But I just want to let you all know that my official policy is the following:
Marvin Gaye is cool and all, but Sam Cooke was the best male vocalist of all time. ALL TIME.
And I’ve got about a dozen more before bringing up “A Change Is Gonna Come.”
Carry on.
