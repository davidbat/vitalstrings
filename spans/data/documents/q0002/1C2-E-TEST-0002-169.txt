Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley, Janelle Mon√°e, Grace Potter, Stevie Wonder, and Jay Leno bandleader Ricky Minor will come together this weekend in Los Angeles to honor the 40th anniversary of Marvin Gaye's benchmark album What's Going On. It's the final installment of the ongoing Global Soul , which pays tribute to soul music from around the world. Bradley, Jones, and Potter previewed what's to come with a rousing version of Gaye's title track on Leno last night. Watch it here.
The group wisely don't work too many changes on Gaye's original, and the trio is able to match Gaye's unmistakable, raucous singing style with their impressive pipes. Hot bonus: the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles, who recreate the lush symphonic accompaniment of the original 1971 version.
Bradley's got another hot cover at the moment. His take on Nirvana's "Stay Away" has been one of the most talked-about cuts on SPIN's tribute to Nevermind. Grab it here .
