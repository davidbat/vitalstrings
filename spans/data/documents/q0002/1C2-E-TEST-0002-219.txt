Darnell White Featuring Chuckii Booker - Mr. Marvin - 2010
This is one hell of a track, chunky as you like, edgy and totally in the bag of Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On".  The heavy, real percussion totally slots into that album's vibe and Flautist Darnell White sounds absolutely amazing on this song.  At present it's download only and available on the likes of iTunes.  Like it or loath it downloading is here to stay, and although fully embracing this, I hope that this will come in a hardcopy, perhaps on a full CD release.  It's a great track on many levels, the Marvin-esc influence and rasping flute aside.  the single boasts vocals from none other than the ultra-talented, unique and instantly recognisable Chuckii Booker.  I have long been a fan of this gentleman with his work in Tease in the late 1980s, his work as a solo artists and with the likes of C.J. Anthony and Kool & The Gang.
Chuckii Book's vocals are instantly recognisable and he doesn't try to ape Marvin Gaye at all, that is not his style.  The vocal arrangement is second to none and in concert with the echoing, knocking groove and passionate, skydiving flute work, Chuckii adds some real soul to this very tasty morsel.  Jazzy, classic and soulful with THAT signature Chuckii Booker edge, this track is a must have and I hope that it paves the way for a full album from this talented Flautist and more vocal / production contributions from Mr. Booker himself who I personally feel is long overdue a new release in his own right.  Ten out of ten for this song, guys, and a song that Mr. Marvin would himself be proud of.
