Mentioned by name in Joseph Lawrence 's "Timeless".
Spandau Ballet songwriter Gary Kemp is a fan of Gaye's and mentioned him in the band's massive 1983 hit "True".
Marillion singer Steve Hogarth counts Gaye as one of his favorite vocalists and in 1998 the band covered his classic song "Abraham, Martin & John" for their live album "Unplugged at the Walls".
Discovered by Harvey Fuqua of The Moonglows . Fuqua took Gaye into the group in 1959 and about a year later brought him to Motown.
The addition of the "e" to his name was also emulating one of his favorite singers, Sam Cooke , who did the same thing with his last name. Coincidentally, both performers were shot and killed at young ages.
His 1973 hit "Let's Get It On" was originally written as a political song.
He was so devastated by the death of singer Tammi Terrell in 1970 that he didn't record any new material or appear on stage for three years.
The song "I Want You" was said to be an ode to his second wife Janis Hunter. According to legend, he wrote and recorded the song in two hours after first setting eyes on her, when she was accompanying her mother (a huge fan) to the studio to watch him work. They married two months later.
The song "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holla)" ends with a prelude to the song "What's Goin' On." This version of the latter-mentioned song is slightly different from the now popular version, in that Gaye begins it with: "Father, Father" and the new version begins with "Mother, Mother". This was due to his burning hatred for his father and eternal love for his mother.
