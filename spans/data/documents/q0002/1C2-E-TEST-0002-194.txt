D’Angelo is currently gearing up for his comeback album, ‘James River,’ and the R&B singer explained the difficult journey he’s experienced throughout his career. The ‘Brown Sugar’ singer also explained that he was partly motivated to pursue music after he experienced a series of dreams featuring one of his chief influences.
D’Angelo explained that his early efforts to clean-up failed and he wasn’t convinced he had a problem until J Dilla passed away in 2006 and he realized his own mortality. “I felt like I was going to be next. I ain’t bullshitting. I was scared then. I was so fucked-up, I couldn’t go,” D’Angelo told GQ .
D’Angelo explained that part of what prompted his first break from music was the amount of focus that was paid to his physical appearance. “One time I got mad when a female threw money at me onstage, and that made me feel fucked-up, and I threw the money back at her. I was like, ‘I’m not a stripper,’” said D’Angelo.
According to D’Angelo, he began having recurring dreams about Marvin Gaye just after the Motown legend was shot by his own father in 1984, and the ‘Voodoo’ creator explained that the dreams continued until he signed his first deal. “I was following him as a grown man. He was a bit heavier, and he had the beard. He was naked, and all I could see was his back and that cap he used to wear all the time. And he got into this whirlpool Jacuzzi with his wife and his daughter and his little son, and that’s when he turns around and looks at me. And he goes, ‘I know you’re wondering why you keep dreaming about me.’ And I woke up,” D’Angelo said.
