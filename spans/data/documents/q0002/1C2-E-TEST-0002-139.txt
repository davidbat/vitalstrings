Frankie Gaye fails self, Marvin

I am ambivalent about reading bad books.  An excellent argument can be made that once you realize a book is an embarrassing display of incompetence, you should put it  down.  Why waste your  time?  But, some of us habitually try to finish what we start.  And, sometimes, one can learn something worthwhile from the inept.  That is why I've finished reading three books I don't like this week.  Today's review is of My Brother, Marvin Gaye, by Frankie Gaye, the reknown singer's pathetic younger brother.  I am interested in Gaye because I believe his music chronicles the culture of both the black American sub-culture  and American culture in general.  (The two are inextricably bound.)  So, the more I learn about Gaye, the more I learn about the times he lived in and his continuing influence on our culture.  Unfortunately, his brother's book is pretty much useless for that purpose.
Frankie Gaye, who died before the book was published, has three objectives:
•To cover up the pathology rampant in the Gaye family, especially his father's abusive nature and sexual confusion.
•To partake of his brother's adulation.
•To promote himself.
The first is most important.  On April 1, 1984, Marvin Gay, Sr., shot and killed his son, the famous vocalist, songwriter, and producer.  The killing was the culmination of a life time of abuse.  Gay, a fundamentalist preacher who rarely worked, had ruled his home with an iron fist for years.  Though all family members were mentally and physically abused by him, Marvin, Jr., was the main target of his wrath.  The son fled the father's whippings while in his teens.  A few years later, he reinvented himself as the gentle singer of duets with gorgeous female vocalists that help  put Motown on the cultural map.
