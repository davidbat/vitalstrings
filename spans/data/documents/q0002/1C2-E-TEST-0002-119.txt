Marvin Gaye, the Motown recording artist whose smooth voice captured Americans in the 80s, would have celebrated his 73rd birthday today, had he been alive.
Gaye died in Los Angeles on April 1, 1984, one day before his 45th birthday, after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest. The singer's father was arrested for the shooting, and he later pleaded no contest.
In his decade-long career, Gaye won several Grammy and American Music awards. He also won several NAACP Image Awards. At the height of his fame, Gaye released "Let's Get It On," and "Sexual Healing." He also sang a widely popular duet "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" with Tammi Terrell.
Even after his death, Gaye's music continues to influence today's record artists. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Gaye as number six on its "Greatest Singers of All Time" list and number 18 on the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" list.
