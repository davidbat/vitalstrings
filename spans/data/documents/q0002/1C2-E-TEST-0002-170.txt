The rip has been done using EAC to extract .wav files, and dBPowerAmp to convert  them into FLAC.  Some noise or deterioration can be hard on the Original Mixes and some bonus  materials.  It's not a fault from the rip process.  It's also present on the  master tapes (as indicated on inner notes).  The CDs are presented as ONE SINGLE LONG AUDIO FILE for each CD. There's also a  .cue file which marks the track points. If you need to extract a single song  from this, you must download the whole album, and use a tool like Medieval Cue  Splitter (I work on Windows, so I don't know any specific software for Mac or  Linux users, if you do, tell me so I can add that info on future releases).  Attention: Single .cue/FLAC files. That's simply my personal choice for  releasing it, don't argue about it, thanks. IF you don't like it, you've been  clearly told, so look somewehere else and don't come crying. It's free, ok? Take  it as it comes.   Perhaps there seems to be "too much" information.  I've come to find that those  three sources come to complement each other quite well.  Allmusic provides  critical reviews, Wikipedia insights on the story of each matter/song, and  Songfacts, often offers trivia usually unknown for most public.  Hence the long  text.  I hope you enjoy this particular release, especially the difference in the mixes  on second half of CD1..  A masterpiece.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- General Info on the album (Wikipedia)  What's Going On is a studio album by soul musician Marvin Gaye, released May 21,  1971 on the Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the  album took place in June of 1970 and Marchâ€“May of 1971 at Hitsville U.S.A.,  Golden World and United Sound Studios in Detroit, Michigan and at The Sound  Factory in West Hollywood, California. The first Marvin Gaye album for it to be  credited as produced solely by the artist himself, What's Going On is a unified  album consisting of nine songs, most of which lead into the next. It has also  been categorized as a song cycle, since the album ends on a reprise to the  album's opening theme. The album is told from the point of view of a Vietnam War  veteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing nothing  but injustice, suffering and hatred.  What's Going On was the first album on which Motown Records' main studio band,  the group of session musicians The Funk Brothers, received an official credit.  Featuring introspective lyrics about drug abuse, poverty and the Vietnam War,  the album was also the first to reflect the beginning of a new trend in soul  music. What's Going On was both an immediate commercial and critical success and  has endured as a classic of early-1970s soul. In worldwide critics/artists and  public surveys, it has been voted as one of the landmark recordings in pop music  history and is considered to be one of the greatest albums ever made. In 2003,  the album was ranked number 6 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500  greatest albums of all time.  In late March of 1970, Marvin Gaye had fallen into a deep depression following  the death of his singing partner and fellow Motown artist Tammi Terrell, who  died of a brain tumor earlier that month. Gaye refused to record or perform,  going as far as to attempt an athletic career in football with the Detroit Lions  of the NFL. After an unsuccessful tryout for the team, Gaye came in contact with  musician Al Cleveland and the Four Tops' Renaldo "Obie" Benson, who were working  on a politically conscious song called "What's Going On". Gaye assisted  Cleveland and Benson in completing the composition, and planned to produce the  song as a recording for the Motown act The Originals. However, Cleveland and  "Obie" Benson persuaded Gaye to record the song himself. In June of 1970, Gaye  recorded "What's Going On" and his own composition, "God Is Love", which further  expanded Gaye's inclusion of his spirituality in his music.  Recording such material was a different direction for Gaye, who had previously  performed and recorded radio-formatted and contemporary songs that were more  representative of the Gordy-produced Motown Sound rather than politically or  socially-conscious music. When Gaye delivered the songs as the sides for his  next 45 RPM single, Motown Records CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. objected to the material  and refused to release the recordings. After already permitting another fellow  Motown artist to record and release material that hinted social and political  themes â€“ Stevie Wonder who released his 1970 single "Heaven Help Us All" and his  1971 artistic breakthrough Where I'm Coming From released earlier that year â€“  Gordy considered "What's Going On" far too political to be released on radio and  also too unfamiliar for the popular music and sound of that time to be  commercially successful. Gaye, however, stood his ground and lobbied his case to  label executives and Gordy, as he wanted to be able to express himself  creatively, and not by Gordy's or Motown's version of music on his records. In  an interview for Rolling Stone magazine, Marvin Gaye discused what had shaped  his view on more socially concsious themes in music and the conception of his  eleventh studio album:      In 1969 or 1970, I began to re-evaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my  music to say... I was very much affected by letters my brother was sending me  from Vietnam, as well as the social situation here at home. I realized that I  had to put my own fantasies behind me if I wanted to write songs that would  reach the souls of people. I wanted them to take a look at what was happening in  the world.     â€”Marvin Gaye  Gordy eventually gave in, certain that the record would flop. "What's Going On"  became Motown's fastest selling single at that point, going to the number-one  spot on the R&B charts for five weeks and number-two for three weeks on the Pop  listings, with "Joy to the World" by Three Dog Night retaining the top spot.  Recording  After this success, Berry Gordy requested an entire accompanying album. Gaye  began recording the tracks that would eventually comprise his best-known work,  the What's Going On album, handling all of his own production and some of his  own songwriting. The entire album was originally mixed in Detroit, with Marvin  Gaye out of town and not present. This mix, dubbed "The Detroit Mix", was  scrapped and redone. These mixes were later released on the 2001 two-disc deluxe  edition of What's Going On, along with the original mono 45 mixes of the  singles. Also included was a recording of one of Gaye's first live performances  from The Kennedy Center Auditorium, Washington DC, 01-06-1972, after three years  away from the stage following Tammi Terrell's illness and death.  The content of What's Going On was that of a politically charged and deeply  personal Motown album, and was notable for including elements of jazz and  classical music instrumentation and arrangements. The record was among the first  soul albums to place heavy emphasis on political and social concerns such as  environmentalism, political corruption, drug abuse, and the Vietnam War, in  which Gaye's brother, Frankie Gaye, had served in for three years of service for  the U.S. Army. However, after hearing a preliminary mix of the record, Berry  Gordy was not offended by Gaye's embrace of countercultural politics, but was  bothered by the album's design, which had each song leading to the next. This  flow of sound was not conventional and suited for radio airplay, which seemed as  Gordy's main focus; the commercial aspect. The album's stylistic manor of using  a song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and lead What's Going On to become known as  the first soul music concept albums.  Reception  Initial  The critical and commercial success of the album was immediate and significant.  What's Going On remained on the Billboard Pop Album Charts for over a year and  sold over two million copies until the end of 1972, making it Marvin Gaye's  best-selling album to that date until he released Let's Get It On in 1973. In  addition, What's Going On received the highest ratings from several leading  American publications, including Time, Rolling Stone (who named it "Album of the  Year"), The New York Times, and Billboard, who gave it the Billboard Trend  setter Award of 1971. Upon release, Rolling Stone magazine music critic Vince  Aletti praised What's Going On for its thematic approach towards social and  political concerns, while also mentioning the surprise of Motown releasing such  an album. In a review of the album and Stevie Wonder's Where I'm Coming From,  Aletti wrote:      Ambitious, personal albums may be a glut on the market elsewhere, but at  Motown they're something new... the album as a whole takes precedence, absorbing  its own flaws. There are very few performers who could carry a project like this  off. I've always admired Marvin Gaye, but I didn't expect that he would be one  of them. Guess I seriously underestimated him. It won't happen again.     â€”Vince Aletti  Later on, many artists from different musical genres covered songs from the  album, most notably live recordings by Aretha Franklin ("Wholy Holy" on Amazing  Grace) and Donny Hathaway ("What's Going On" on Donny Hathaway Live), as well as  Robert Palmer's medley of "Mercy Mercy Me/I Want You", among others. "Mercy  Mercy Me" was featured as the b-side to The Strokes' single "You Only Live  Once".  Awards and accolades  In 2004, the album's title track was ranked number 4 on Rolling Stone's list of  the 500 greatest songs of all time. A 1999 critics poll conducted by British  newspaper Guardian/Observer named it the "Greatest Album of the 20th Century".  In 1997, What's Going On was named the 17th greatest album of all time in a  Music of the Millennium poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and  Classic FM. In 1998 Q magazine readers placed it at number 97, while in 2001 the  TV network VH1 placed it at number 4. In 2003, it was one of 50 recordings  chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National  Recording Registry. What's Going On was ranked #6 on Rolling Stone magazine's  2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, one of three Gaye albums to be  included, preceded by 1973's Let's Get It On (#165) and 1978's Here My Dear  (#462). The album is Gaye's highest ranking entry on the list, as well as  several other publications' lists.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Review by John Bush (allmusic)  What's Going On is not only Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, it's the most important  and passionate record to come out of soul music, delivered by one of its finest  voices, a man finally free to speak his mind and so move from R&B sex symbol to  true recording artist. With What's Going On, Gaye meditated on what had happened  to the American dream of the past -- as it related to urban decay, environmental  woes, military turbulence, police brutality, unemployment, and poverty. These  feelings had been bubbling up between 1967 and 1970, during which he felt  increasingly caged by Motown's behind-the-times hit machine and restrained from  expressing himself seriously through his music. Finally, late in 1970, Gaye  decided to record a song that the Four Tops' Obie Benson had brought him,  "What's Going On." When Berry Gordy decided not to issue the single, deeming it  uncommercial, Gaye refused to record any more material until he relented.  Confirmed by its tremendous commercial success in January 1971, he recorded the  rest of the album over ten days in March, and Motown released it in late May.  Besides cementing Marvin Gaye as one of the most important artists in pop music,  What's Going On was far and away the best full-length to issue from the  singles-dominated Motown factory, and arguably the best soul album of all time.  Conceived as a statement from the viewpoint of a Vietnam veteran (Gaye's brother  Frankie had returned from a three-year hitch in 1967), What's Going On isn't  just the question of a baffled soldier returning home to a strange place, but a  promise that listeners would be informed by what they heard (that missing  question mark in the title certainly wasn't a typo). Instead of releasing  listeners from their troubles, as so many of his singles had in the past, Gaye  used the album to reflect on the climate of the early '70s, rife with civil  unrest, drug abuse, abandoned children, and the spectre of riots in the near  past. Alternately depressed and hopeful, angry and jubilant, Gaye saved the most  sublime, deeply inspired performances of his career for "Mercy Mercy Me (The  Ecology)," "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)," and "Save the Children."  The songs and performances, however, furnished only half of a revolution; little  could've been accomplished with the Motown sound of previous Marvin Gaye hits  like "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" and "Hitch Hike" or even "I Heard It Through the  Grapevine." What's Going On, as he conceived and produced it, was like no other  record heard before it: languid, dark, and jazzy, a series of relaxed grooves  with a heavy bottom, filled by thick basslines along with bongos, conga, and  other percussion. Fortunately, this aesthetic fit in perfectly with the style of  longtime Motown session men like bassist James Jamerson and guitarist Joe  Messina. When the Funk Brothers were, for once, allowed the opportunity to work  in relaxed, open proceedings, they produced the best work of their careers (and  indeed, they recognized its importance before any of the Motown executives).  Jamerson's playing on "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)" functions as the  low-end foundation but also its melodic hook, while an improvisatory jam by Eli  Fountain on alto sax furnished the album's opening flourish. (Much credit goes  to Gaye himself for seizing on these often tossed-off lines as precious; indeed,  he spent more time down in the Snakepit than he did in the control room.) Just  as he'd hoped it would be, What's Going On was Marvin Gaye's masterwork, the  most perfect expression of an artist's hope, anger, and concern ever recorded.   On the Deluxe Edition  If it's easy to be a little cynical about Universal/Motown's 2001 Deluxe Edition  reissue of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, it's only because Motown endlessly  reissued the album during the CD era, trumpeting each as the definitive issue  (rather ironic for an album Berry Gordy didn't even want to release at the  time). Still, Universal's Deluxe Edition series is proving to be a phenomenal  collectors-oriented line, filled with lavish, detailed packaging and  unpredictable turns, and What's Going On is no exception to the rule. To begin  with, the remastering of the original album is excellent, the best yet, although  that still isn't enough to make this worth buying for the hardcore fans who have  purchased the album again and again over the years. That's what the other disc  and a half of bonus material is for. First, there's the "original Detroit mix"  of the album prepared while Gaye was out of town, filming a movie. A little  bolder and sparer than the released record, with the strings noticeably  relegated to the background, it's interesting, not revelatory, though its  stripped-back feel is refreshing after hearing the album countless times. A  rhythm-and-strings mix of "What's Going On" is tacked onto the end of the first  disc, before the second disc begins with a new, previously unreleased live album  that finds Gaye running through the album (minus "Mercy Mercy Me [The Ecology]")  and performing a medley of '60s hits. It was his first performance in four  years, and while unnecessary, it is fascinating and certainly worth the time of  hardcore fans, as are the original single versions of "What's Going On," "God Is  Love," and "Sad Tomorrows," plus the previously unreleased "Head Title" (aka  "Distant Lover"). This is certainly a package for fans, but it's also the ideal  fan package -- beautifully made and filled with rarities that are necessary for  fans, making them feel fine about buying this record again. Especially since  this is so well done, it's hard to imagine Universal/Motown bettering it.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME TRACKS OVERVIEWED  WHAT'S GOING ON  (on Wikipedia)  It became a crossover hit single that reached #2 on the pop charts and #1 on the  R&B charts. A meditation on the troubles and problems of the world, the song  proved a timely and relatable release, and it marked Gaye's departure from the  pop stylings of 1960s-era Motown towards more personal material. The song topped  a Metro Times list of the 100 Greatest Detroit Songs Of All Time[1], and in  2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it the fourth greatest song of all time.  Designed with a somber jazz-inspired tone, "What's Going On" addressed the  political and social troubles of the world and black-on-black crime in a  soulful, introspective way, contrasting to the more dramatic socially conscious  records made by Sly & the Family Stone and The Temptations over the previous  three years. The song originated from an idea by Four Tops member Renaldo "Obie"  Benson, who, witnessing stressful conditions while on tour in Europe, began  writing a song to express his feelings. Once back in the United States, Benson  and Motown songwriter Al Cleveland prepared an initial rough version of the  song, and invited Marvin Gaye as a third collaborator on the song. Gaye,  depressed from the death of singing partner Tammi Terrell and strongly  considering a retirement from performing, planned to produce "What's Going On"  as a single for The Originals, but Benson and Cleveland convinced Gaye to record  it himself.  On the finished track, as Gaye musically ponders on the state of the world and  the Vietnam war, a party can be heard going on in the background, from which  Gaye's voice is purposely detached. The partygoers are portrayed by Detroit  Lions players Mel Farr and Lem Barney, whose acquaintances Gaye had made during  his failed 1970 tryout with the team.  The song is notable for its heavy use of major seventh and minor seventh chords,  a fairly uncommon occurrence in popular music of that era. Also, notably for  this record, Marvin Gaye sings both lead and background vocals himself. The  process had been used for many years to give parts of a recording extra strength  (Motown themselves had used it on such tracks as The Supremes' "You Keep Me  Hangin' On"), but Gaye took it a step further and sung each of his vocal passes  in various harmony parts, creating an ethereal sound that became one of his  trademarks.  The song was completed in 1970 before the rest of the album was finished. Motown  chief Berry Gordy deemed the record "uncommercial" and initially tried to block  its release as a single. He later relented after Gaye threatened to cease  recording permanently. "What's Going On" proved to be a substantial commercial  hit, paving the way for his forthcoming seminal album release of the same title.  "What's Going On" was one of the major hits of 1971 as well as Motown's fast  selling single at that point, reaching #2 for three weeks on the Billboard Hot  100 and #1 for five weeks on the Billboard R&B charts. The single would  eventually sell over 2.5 million copies, becoming Gaye's biggest US Pop hit  since "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" charted in late 1968. The single  version (available on the deluxe version of What's Going On, the album) differs  noticeably from the album version; in particular, there is stronger percussion  in the background as well as louder background vocals and noise. Some of Gaye's  vocals have also been re-recorded to sound slightly punchier. There is also a  false "fade out" that is only on the single version.  (Allmusic's Review)  "What's Going On" was a new kind of protest song, a sugar-coated pill which  surveyed the troubled landscape of an America torn apart by war, poverty, and  prejudice, but reported its findings not with anger and recriminations, but with  compassion and tenderness. The song was inspired as much by the bigger picture  of Vietnam and the civil rights movement as by events in Marvin Gaye's  tumultuous personal life -- specifically, the return of his brother, Frankie,  from combat; the death of his duet partner, Tammi Terrell; and his  disintegrating marriage to wife Anna. ( "What's Going On"'s title, on the other  hand, originated with Detroit Lions star Mel Farr, who along with teammate Lem  Barney also contributed backing vocals.) It's first and foremost a song about  family, both literally and figuratively: the plaintive cries of "father, father"  reflect not only the troubled relationship between Gaye and his biological  father, but also the singer's ongoing struggles with God, while the appeals to  "brother, brother" speak as much to Gaye's own sibling as to the brotherhood of  all humankind. "What's Going On"'s scope is vast -- the lyrics also touch on  hot-button subjects spanning from anti-war protests to the generation gap to  police violence -- but its message is simple: "Only love can conquer hate." Gaye  doesn't just pose the question "what's going on?," he answers it, relating his  truths with a spiritual power rooted in gospel while tempering the song's bitter  realities with gorgeously layered vocals, jazz-inspired rhythms, and luminously  soulful saxophone breaks. Indeed, in contrast to the more biting, hardline  polemics of contemporaries like James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, and Sly & the  Family Stone, "What's Going On" is remarkable for its serenity and warmth --  even detailing their litany of injustices Gaye's vocals remain implacably calm,  radiating a Zen-like wisdom and peacefulness. In a major break from Motown  tradition, Gaye produced the record himself, and while the label certainly  hadn't shied away from making social and political statements in the past,  nothing was remotely so explicit and direct as this. Label owner Berry Gordy Jr.  reportedly hated "What's Going On" and its accompanying LP, probably because it  frightened him -- not only did the record threaten to alienate the white  audiences the company coveted, but it broke free of the famed Motown  assembly-line production process, liberating artists once and for all. "What's  Going On" might not be the biggest hit Motown scored -- the song reached number  two in 1971 -- but it might be the most transcendent.  (Some Songfacts)  This was written by Motown songwriter Al Cleveland and Four Tops member Renaldo  "Obie" Benson. Gaye added lyrics and worked on the arrangement. The 3 were  golfing partners. Gaye wanted The Originals to record the song, but Benson and  Cleveland prevailed upon Gaye to do it himself.  Until this song, Gaye rarely participated in the songwriting process. For this  album, he took control of the production so he could make a statement as an  artist. Motown hated the idea, but Gaye was an established star and had enough  power to pull it off.  Gaye was inspired by the stories his brother Frankie told him when he came back  from the Vietnam war.  This was one of the first Motown songs to make a powerful political statement.  Stevie Wonder and The Temptations were also recording more serious and  challenging material, which was a radical departure from the Motown hits of the  '60s. The song had a tremendous impact because listeners weren't used to hearing  social commentary from Gaye. As Jackson Browne said in a 2008 interview with  Rolling Stone: "No one was expecting an anti-war song from him. But it was a  moment in time when people were willing to hear it from anybody, if it was  heartfelt. And who better than the person who has talked to you about love and  desire?"  Gaye was a talented football player, and while he never played in the NFL, he  was good friends with Mel Farr and Lem Barney, who played for the Detroit Lions.  "What's Going On" was an expression they used to greet each other, and Gaye used  it as the title. Farr and Barney sang backup on the track.  Gaye was deeply affected by the death of his partner, Tammi Terrell, a year  earlier. This led him to take charge of his career and infuse messages in his  songs.  The album takes on many issues, including the environment ("Mercy Mercy Me"),  and poverty ("Inner City Blues"). It was the first album Gaye released that sold  a lot of copies. Until then, like most Motown artists, he had lots of hit  singles but album sales were secondary.  Gaye used an orchestra on this. Motown hated the elaborate production, but were  thrilled when it became a hit.  Gaye wrote this when he could no longer could take refuge in his love songs. His  marriage was in shambles (although the divorce wouldn't be final until 1977),  Tammi Terrell (his partner in song and romance) collapsed into his arms during a  concert and died in 1970, drug use was pervading the inner city culture and  Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy were all gunned down. (thanks,  Brad Wind - Miami, FL)  Shortly before the terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, a group of artists  including Bono, Michael Stipe, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera recorded  this to benefit AIDS research in Africa. After the terrorism, they decided to  give half the proceeds to victims of the attacks and the other half to AIDS  charities. The song was scheduled for release on World AIDS Day, December 1, but  was pushed up to September 21 due to the tragedy.  The new version was released as a CD single containing different mixes of the  song. The first one released as a single was the rock remixed by Fred Durst.  Scott Weiland, Perry Farrell, and Bono were on the track. Other remixes include  and R&B Mix by Jermaine Dupri, an Electronic Mix by Moby, and a Contemporary Mix  by Bono.  After the terrorist attacks on the US, MTV aired a version of this featuring  footage of the recording session mixed with images from the attacks.  The videos for the mixes were directed by Jake Scott, who worked on "Everybody  Hurts" by R.E.M. He had the artists wear blindfolds to demonstrate how some  people are blind to issues like racism and religion.    WHAT'S HAPPENING BROTHER (On wikipedia)  The song started off the song cycle that began with a man returning home from  fighting in the Vietnam War only to discover that his world is abstractly  different from what it used to be before he left for duty. In Marvin's case, the  song was dedicated to his younger brother, Frankie, who was returning back from  a three-year duty at Vietnam, in essence, Marvin later told interviews that  Frankie's experience in Vietnam inspired him to collaborate on the songs for the  What's Going On project. Throughout this song, Marvin mentions in his brother's  third person about the nightclub, about whether or not his baseball team would  "win the pennant" and wonders how his friend has been which brings upon the  question, "what's happening brother?" Musically the song follows the same path  as "What's Going On" and features The Andantes as background vocalists.    FLYIN' HIGH (IN THE FRIENDLY SKY) (On wikipedia)  The song continued in a song cycle that had begun with the previous track,  "What's Happening Brother" as quickly after the song ended with the lyric,  "Cause I'm slightly behind the time" creating a moody and ominous sound  punctuated by the singer's falsetto. Co-written with wife Anna Gordy and  confidant Elgie Stover, the song talked about drug addiction, the drug of choice  in the song is heroin as explained in the lyric, "I know I'm hooked my friend/to  the boy who makes slaves out of men".  Related to the song, numerous Vietnam vets struggled with heroin addiction.  Marvin later stated the song title was a ploy at an ad made by American Airlines  ironically with the slogan, "flying in the friendly skies". The song would be  sampled by several hip-hop musicians. Marvin sings both lead and background  vocals on this song.  The song was originally recorded under a slightly different mix a year before as  "Sad Tomorrows" which Gaye co-wrote by Fuller Gordy and Delores Wilkinson and  featured background vocals by The Originals, with whom had big hits under Gaye's  productions. Like the later version of the song, Marvin also sings totally in  falsetto. The song also ends faster than the later version and that version was  later put in remastered re-issues of What's Going On including the Deluxe  Edition issue.    SAVE THE CHILDREN  From Wikipedia:  While not issued as a single in the U.S., the song was issued as a single by the  Tamla-Motown label in the UK where it peaked at #41 on the Charts in December of  1971, whereas the other major US single releases initially failed to make a dent  on the other side of the Atlantic. The song was a continuation of the message  "What's Going On" delivered, about love, this time, for the children. Marvin  later joked on the liner notes of the album "not let (this song) influence  anyone". Marvin recorded both a spoken word recitation of the song and a vocal  version mixing the two vocals together featuring Marvin's soft-spoken vocals on  one side and his expressive tenor on the other. The song would later be covered  by Diana Ross in a medley featuring the jazz song, "Brown Baby", on her 1973  album, Touch Me in the Morning. Marvin sung this song briefly while touring  Europe in 1976 including the song as part of his What's Going On medley.  From Allmusic:  One of the most impressive stylistic elements of What's Going On is the way that  Marvin Gaye overdubbed his own voice several times to add an extra emotional  dimension to the material. The shining example of this technique on What's Going  On is "Save The Children," a heartrending ballad that found Gaye utilizing  dueling vocal overdubs to get his message across. The lyrics avoid any kind of  fictional scenario to address the listener directly, asking them "Who's willing  to save a world/That is destined to die?" before launching into a passionate  declaration that we should "live life for the children.". The emotional flow of  these lyrics is complex but the melody is up to the task of matching it,  starting in minor key-styled ballad mode but gradually build in intensity until  it reaches an emotion-rich peak that gives the finale a glorious gospel feel.  Gaye's recording gives the song the epic sweep it needs thanks to a stylish  David Van De Pitte arrangement that starts with a wordless choir backed by low  strings then adds layers of insistent percussion and soulful horns until it  climaxes with a flurry of jazzy drum fills and saxophone riffs. When it seems to  have reached its peak, it stops on a dime and reverts back to a sad midtempo  mode that closes out the track before it flows into the intro of "Mercy Mercy Me  (The Ecology)." It's a strikingly arranged sound but Gaye's vocal are what truly  allow it to take flight: he starts off speaking the lyrics, then adds a pained  vocal overdub that counteracts the mellow spoken part with gospel-tinged fire.  As the impassion quality of the lyrics hit their peak, the two voices reach a  level of emotion guaranteed to affect even the most hard-hearted listener. "Save  The Children" was never released a single but its combination of passion and  vocal artistry made it a highlight at Gaye's live shows and a favorite with his  fans. More importantly, it's use of overdubbed vocals paved the way for future  Marvin Gaye vocal workouts like "I Want You" and "Sexual Healing."    GOD IS LOVE (Wikipedia)  The song was a return of sorts to Gaye's religious background dedicating this  song to God and his father, Marvin Pentz Gay, Sr. The song was originally  recorded as the b-side to "What's Going On" shortly after that song was  recorded. The original 45" version of "What's Going On" included a slower,  string-laden version of this song as its b-side. The song was later retooled in  a more joyous, faster version brought on after the success of "What's Going On"  as a hit song. It also ended in a much faster and abrupt tone leading into the  album's next single, "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)". The original version has  since been re-issued on several greatest-hits sets and re-issues of the album.    MERCY MERCY ME (THE ECOLOGY)  (from Wikipedia)  Following the breakthrough of the title track's success, this song, written  solely by Gaye, became one of his most poignant anthems of sorrow at the world  dealing with the environment. Led by Gaye playing piano, strings conducted by  Paul Riser, multi-tracking vocals from Gaye and additional background vocals by  The Andantes, the instrumentals provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax  solo by Wild Bill Moore, the song rose to #4 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart  and #1 for two weeks on the R&B singles charts on August 14 through to August  27, 1971. As the single became his second million seller from What's Going On  the album crashed on the soul album charts in the top five, and began charging  up the pop rankings. "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" soon became one of Gaye's  most famous songs in his extensive catalogue. In 2002 it was his third single  recording to win a "Grammy Hall of Fame" Award. Like "Inner City Blues", Bob  Babbitt, not James Jamerson, plays the bass line.  (from allmusic)  1971 brought in a new era at Motown records; its star attraction Marvin Gaye  controversially broke with the label's proven hitmaking system of recording  material written for him by others and wrote, produced, and performed his own  album, the master stroke What's Going On. With this landmark recording, Gaye  became a soul music auteur and opened the doors for others like Stevie Wonder to  take similar chances. The album is a time-capsule piece addressing many of the  era's hot-button issues: the war in Vietnam, the environment, racism, and so on.  Far from being didactic, the album as a whole is one solid conceptual groove,  albeit a moody one, allowing one to think while dancing. And the approach to the  issues at hand -- as evidenced on the environmentally concerned "Mercy Mercy Me  (The Ecology)" -- is subtle, timeless, and never sermonizing: "Oh mercy mercy  me/Oh, things ain't what they used to be no, no/Where did all the blue sky  go?/Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east." Gaye's  approach on the "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)," and most of the album, is one of  desperate concern. Though he once characterized the album as "me against the  man," the tone rarely approaches anger; rather, his attitude is mostly one of  disgusted disappointment. The instrumentation of the song continues to ride the  conga-drum Latin percussive groove that runs through much of the album. The  production suggests a less-intrusive, updated Phil Spector or Brian Wilson  ethic. There are well-placed horns, piano, voices, synthesizers, even ear-candy  flourishes like glockenspiel to represent the high end of what could have easily  been a swampy, reverby mix; "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" just jells so well  that it is easy to forget that there is so much going on in the track. Lyrics  and controversy notwithstanding, "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" was a success  commercially, hitting number one and finishing number 41 on the 1971 pop chart.  While it sports a catchy pop melody and a passionate vocal performance, "Mercy  Mercy Me (The Ecology)" has a non-traditional song structure: After four stacked  verses, all beginning with the refrain "mercy mercy me," the song goes into a  vocal improvisation over a verse, followed by a bridge of swelling string  orchestration and a jazzy saxophone solo, all building into an outro that  meanders into an almost dissonant, eerie minor-key crescendo that just sits  there like a question mark at the end of the song. There is nothing approaching  a pop-song chorus, and there is no repetition, save for the refrain opening the  verses. The myriad cover versions of "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" are mostly  crossover jazz versions like Grover Washington Jr.'s. Robert Palmer did a solid  interpretation of the song in a medley with "I Want You" in 1990 on his Don't  Explain LP.     RIGHT ON (from Wikipedia)  The song, which talked about the differences between the rich and poor, good and  evil and other divisions, was built in a different musical texture than previous  singles bringing in a Latin soul percussive style including maracas and a flute  and fluent jazz-styled piano playing from Gaye. The song changed into abstract  melodies and harmonies from Marvin with the first half in a settled mood, the  second half a little more hasty as Marvin's lyrical content went from social to  political and the third which was a more modest close in which Marvin preached  how "love can conquer hate anytime" and telling someone close to him to come "to  live where love is King" before ending in the song's first half musical  production. The song then climaxes with Marvin segueing into "Wholy Holy". The  title was also referenced in "What's Going On" so prominently and was so  heralded that Marvin formed a production company titled Right On Productions  soon afterwards.    WHOLY HOLY (from Wikipedia)  Staying with the subject of love bringing Jesus into the theme, the song  lyrically followed the same path of the Benson/Cleveland/Gaye compositions  "What's Going On" and "Save the Children" while musically was a much more solemn  production than the previous tune and featured Gaye on lead and background  vocals. The song would be later covered by soul-gospel greats Aretha Franklin,  who sung the song on her Amazing Grace live album and Mavis Staples, who  famously covered it during an episode of The Cosby Show.    INNER CITY BLUES (WANNA MAKE ME HOLLER) (from Wikipedia)  Written by Gaye and James Nyx, the song depicted the ghettos of inner-city  America as it discussed how the bleak situation would lead to someone wanting to  holler and throw ones hands up. The song was recorded in a mellow funk style  with Gaye playing piano. Several of the Funk Brothers also contributed,  including Eddie "Bongo" Brown, and bassist Bob Babbitt.  The song helped Gaye make history by being one of the few artists to have three  or more Top 10 songs off Billboard's Pop Singles chart peaking at #9 and one of  the first to have three consecutive #1 hits on Billboard's R&B Singles chart  where it stayed for two weeks. Although not certified by the RIAA at that time,  all three releases from the What's Going On album gained Gold status by selling  over a million copies in the United States.  The final minute of the song (and of the album) is a reprise to the theme of  "What's Going On", the album's first song.  (from Allmusic)  It wouldn't tell the following year that Curtis Mayfield's classic Superfly  soundtrack would be released, yet Marvin Gaye's "Inner City Blues (Makes Me  Wanna Holler)" has some of the rich imagery that would make that album so  poignant and influence hip-hop/ rap artists decades later. It's a credit to  Gaye's amazing talent that he could still, after years of having international  hits, relate to the travails of inner-city life. Though he sang in a smooth  tenor, Gaye's pain and anger shines through. A single from his gold masterpiece  What's Going On, "Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)" went to number one  R&B for two weeks and number nine pop in late 1971.   (and finally, from Songfacts)  Marvin Gaye recorded a string of hit love songs in the '60s which were usually  written by Motown songwriters. In the early '70s, he took control of his career  and began writing and performing songs with a more socially-conscious message.  Gaye grew up in Washington, DC before moving to Detroit in 1960. This song deals  with the poverty and hopelessness people living in the ghettos of urban America  often felt. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)  Gaye gave James Nyx a songwriting credit on this as well as "What's Going On."  Nyx was a longtime friend of Gaye who helped him organize and arrange his songs.  This was used in the soundtrack of the 2007 film Zodiac.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Marvin Gaye (Wikipedia)  Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr., better known by his stage name Marvin Gaye (April 2, 1939  â€“ April 1, 1984) was an American singer-songwriter, drummer, pianist and  instrumentalist. Starting as a member of the doo-wop group The Moonglows in the  late fifties, he ventured into a solo career after the group disbanded in 1960  signing with the Tamla subsidiary of Motown Records. After a year as a session  drummer, Gaye ranked as the label's top-selling solo artist during the sixties.  Due to solo hits including "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)", "Ain't That  Peculiar", "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and his duet singles with singers  such as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell, he was crowned "The Prince of Motown" and  "The Prince of Soul".  Notable for fighting the hit-making but restrictive Motown process in which  performers and songwriters and producers were kept separate, Gaye proved with  albums like his 1971 What's Going On and his 1973 Let's Get It On that he was  able to produce music without relying on the system, inspiring fellow Motown  artists such as Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson to do the same.  His mid-1970s work including the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped  influence the quiet storm, urban adult contemporary and slow jam genres. After a  self-imposed European exile in the late seventies, Gaye returned on the 1982  Grammy-winning hit, "Sexual Healing" and the Midnight Love album before his  death at the hands of his father on April 1, 1984. He was posthumously inducted  to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.  Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was born at 12 p.m. on April 2, 1939 at Freedman's  Hospital in Washington, D.C.. His father, Marvin Gay Sr. of Kentucky, was a  minister at a Seventh-day Adventist Church sect called the House of God. It  advocated strict conduct and mixed teachings of Orthodox Judaism and  Pentecostalism. His mother, Alberta Cooper Gay, of North Carolina, was a  domestic mother.  The eldest son of Gay Sr.'s children, Marvin has a half brother, Michael Cooper  (b. 1935). Marvin's other siblings included eldest sister Jeanne (b. 1937),  Frankie (1941-2001) and Zeola "Sweetsie" (b. 1945). The Gays raised their  children at the southwest section of D.C. at the Simple City projects and, after  Marvin turned 14, lived in the segregated section of Washington, D.C.'s Deanwood  neighborhood in the northeastern section of the city.  As a teen, he caddied at Norbeck Country Club in Olney, Maryland. As a child in  his father's church, Gaye sang and played instruments in the choir. During high  school, he listened to doo-wop and joined the DC Tones as a drummer. After  dropping out of 11th grade at Cardozo High School, Gaye joined the United States  Air Force in hopes of flying jets. After faking mental illness, he was  discharged. His sergeant stated that Gaye refused to follow orders.  After returning to D.C., Gaye reformed the D.C. Tones as The Marquees and Bo  Diddley signed them to the New York Okeh Records, where they recorded "Wyatt  Earp", with "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" as its B-side. It flopped.  Diddley introduced the group to Harvey Fuqua, of the R&B/doo-wop group The  Moonglows. Fuqua recruited them to be The New Moonglows in 1959 and signed them  to Chess Records. Gaye and his group sung background on records by Chuck Berry  and Etta James and had a modest hit with "The Twelve Commandments of Love".  "Mama Loochie" (1959) was Gaye's first lead single.  After the Moonglows disbanded in 1960, Fuqua brought Gaye to Detroit and he was  signed to the local Anna Records label, founded by Gwen Gordy. After Motown  Records' Berry Gordy absorbed Anna, Gaye was moved to Motown's Tamla subsidiary.  Gaye found that Fuqua had sold 50% percent of his stake in Gaye to the label  Gaye worked as a session drummer for The Miracles, The Contours, Martha and the  Vandellas, The Marvelettes and others, notably on The Marvelettes' 1961 hit,  "Please Mr. Postman" and Little Stevie Wonder's live version of 1963 hit,  "Fingertips Pt. 2". Both singles reached number one of the pop singles chart.  After recording at Motown, Gaye changed his name from Marvin Gay to Marvin Gaye,  adding the 'e' to separate himself from his father, to stop gossip about his  sexuality, and to imitate his idol, Sam Cooke, who also added an 'e' to his  name. Gaye and Berry clashed over music to record. Through help from Gaye's  girlfriend, Gordy's sister Anna, Berry allowed him to record a standard album. Early success  Motown started Artist Development to look after artists. Gaye rebelled against  receiving the same tuition as his Motown peers, though he'd later regret that  decision. Eventually he stopped "grooming school" though he took its director  Maxine Powell's advice to not perform with his eyes closed as if "to appear that  he wasn't asleep".  In June 1961, Gaye issued his first solo recording, The Soulful Moods of Marvin  Gaye, the second album by Motown. The record featured Broadway standards and  jazz-rendered show tunes, and also yielded the R&B ballad single, "Let Your  Conscience Be Your Guide". The record failed. Gaye released two more failed  singles, a cover of The Chordettes' "Sandman" and "Soldier's Plea" in 1962. Gaye  would find his first success as a co-songwriter on the Marvelettes' 1962 hit,  "Beechwood 4-5789".  Gaye scored his first hit single "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" in September. The  song, co-written by Gaye, was an autobiographical pun on his nonchalant, moody  behavior. Produced by William "Mickey" Stevenson and featuring Martha and the  Vandellas (then known as "The Vels"), the recording became a hit on the Hot R&B Songs chart. Martha and the Vandellas would also sing background on Gaye's  subsequent 1962 album, That Stubborn Kinda Fellow.  The single would be followed by his first Top 40 singles "Hitch Hike", "Pride  and Joy" and "Can I Get a Witness", which charted for Gaye in 1963. The success  continued with the 1964 singles "You Are a Wonderful One" (which featured  background by The Supremes), "Try It Baby" (which featured backgrounds from The  Temptations), "Baby Don't You Do It" and "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)",  which became his signature song.  Gaye contributed to writing Martha and the Vandellas' 1964 "Dancing in the  Street". His work with Smokey Robinson on the 1966 album, Moods of Marvin Gaye,  spawned consecutive top ten singles in "I'll Be Doggone" and "Ain't That  Peculiar", both of which became the singer's first Billboard charted number-one  hits of his career peaking at the top spot on the R&B singles chart. Gaye became  a favorite on the teen shows American Bandstand, Shindig!, Hullaballoo and The  T.A.M.I. Show. He also became one of the few Motown artists to perform at the  Copacabana. A live album from the Copacabana performances, however, wouldn't be  issued in nearly 40 years.  Tammi Terrell  A number of Gaye's hits for Motown were with female artists such as Kim Weston  and Mary Wells; the first Gaye/Wells album, 1964's Together, was Gaye's first  charting album. However, it was Gaye's work with Tammi Terrell that became the  most memorable. Terrell and Gaye had a good rapport and their first album,  1967's United, birthed the hits "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" (covered by  Diana Ross and former Doobie Brothers singer Michael McDonald) and "Your  Precious Love".  Real-life couple Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson provided the writing and  production for the Gaye/Terrell records. While Gaye and Terrell were not lovers  â€” though rumors persist â€” they portrayed lovers on record. Gaye claimed that for  the songs he was in love with her. On October 14, 1967, Terrell collapsed into  Gaye's arms while they were performing at the Hampton Institute (now Hampton  University) homecoming in Hampton, Virginia (in Virginia's Tidewater region, not  at Hampden-Sydney College, in mid-state Virginia). She was diagnosed with a  brain tumor and her health continued to deteriorate.  Motown decided to carry on with Gaye/Terrell recordings, issuing the You're All  I Need album in 1968, which featured "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" and  "You're All I Need to Get By". By the final album, Easy in 1969, Terrell's  vocals were mostly by Valerie Simpson. Two tracks on Easy were archived Terrell  solo songs with Gaye's vocals overdubbed.  Terrell's illness put Gaye in a depression; he refused to acknowledge the  success of his song "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" (sample (helpÂ·info)),  previously recorded in 1967 by Gladys Knight & The Pips, his first #1 hit and  the biggest selling single in Motown history to that point, with four million  copies sold. His work with producer Norman Whitfield, who produced "Grapevine",  resulted in similar success with the singles "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby"  and "That's the Way Love Is". Meanwhile, Gaye's marriage was crumbling and he  was bored with his music. Wanting creative control, he sought to produce singles  for Motown session band The Originals, whose Gaye-produced hits, "Baby I'm For  Real" and "The Bells", brought success.  After the release of What's Going On, Motown renegotiated a contract with Gaye  that allowed him creative control. The deal was worth $1 million, making Gaye  the highest-earning black artist. He moved from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972  after being offered a chance to write the score to a blaxploitation film.  Writing, arranging and producing the movie Trouble Man, Gaye issued the  soundtrack and title song in 1972. The soundtrack and single became hits, the  single peaking at the top ten in early 1973.  Gaye decided to switch from social to sensual with Let's Get It On in 1973. The  album was a departure for its sensual appeal. Yielded by the title track (sample  (helpÂ·info)) and tracks such as "Come Get to This", "You Sure Love to Ball", and  "Distant Lover", Let's Get It On became Gaye's biggest selling album during his  lifetime, surpassing What's Going On. Also, with the title track, Gaye broke his  own record at Motown by surpassing the sales of "I Heard It Through the  Grapevine". The album would be hailed "a record unparalleled in its sheer  sensuality and carnal energy."  Gaye began working on his final duet album, this time with Diana Ross for the  Diana & Marvin project, an album of duets that began recording in 1972, while  Ross was pregnant with her second child. Gaye refused to sing if he couldn't  smoke in the studio, so the album was recorded by overdubbing Ross and Gaye at  separate sessions. Released in fall 1973, the album yielded the US Top 20 hit  singles "You're a Special Part of Me and "My Mistake (Was to Love You)" as well  as the UK versions of The Stylistics's "You Are Everything" at #5 and "Stop,  Look, Listen (To Your Heart)" at #25, respectively.  In 1976, Gaye released the I Want You LP, which yielded the title track as the  number-one R&B single, and the modest charter, "After the Dance." Album tracks  such as "Since I Had You" and "Soon I'll Be Loving You Again" geared Gaye  towards more funky material.  "Got to Give It Up" and his final days at Motown  In 1977, Gaye released the funk single, "Got to Give It Up", which went to  number-one on the pop, R&B and dance singles charts and helped his Live at the  London Palladium album sell two million copies, becoming one of the top ten  best-selling albums of the year. The following year, after divorcing his wife,  Anna, he agreed to remit a portion of his salary and sales of his upcoming album  as alimony. The result was 1978's Here, My Dear, which addressed the sour points  of his marriage and almost led to Anna filing a lawsuit for invasion of privacy.  That album tanked and Gaye struggled. By 1979, besieged by tax problems and drug  addictions, Gaye filed for bankruptcy and moved to Hawaii, where he lived in a  bread van.  In 1980, he signed with British promoter Jeffrey Kruger to do concerts overseas  with the promised highlight of a Royal Command Performance at London's Drury  Lane in front of Princess Margaret. Gaye failed to make the stage; by the time  he showed up, everyone had left. While in London, he worked on In Our Lifetime?  When Motown issued the album in 1981, Gaye accused Motown of editing and  remixing the album without his consent, releasing an unfinished song ("Far  Cry"), altering the album art he requested and removing the question mark from  the title - muting its irony. A special edition of the album was released in  early 2007.  Comeback and sudden death  After being offered a chance to clear things up in Ostend, Belgium, he moved  there in early 1981. Still upset over Motown's decision to release In Our  Lifetime, he negotiated a release from the label and signed with Columbia  Records in 1982, releasing the Midnight Love album late that year. The album  included "Sexual Healing" (sample (helpÂ·info)), which was Gaye's last hit.  The single reached number one on Billboard's R&B chart, where it stayed for ten  weeks, later crossing to number three on Billboard's Hot 100. The single sold  two million copies in the U.S. earning a platinum certification. The song also  gave Gaye his first two Grammy Awards (Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, Best R&B Instrumental) in February 1983. It was nominated for Best R&B Song but lost to  George Benson.  The following year, he was nominated for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance again,  this time for the Midnight Love album. In February 1983, Gaye performed "The  Star-Spangled Banner" at the NBA All-Star Game, held at The Forum in Inglewood,  California, accompanied by a drum machine. In March 1983, he gave his final  performance in front of his old mentor and label for Motown 25, performing  "What's Going On". He then embarked on a U.S. tour to support his album. The  tour, ending in August 1983, was plagued by health problems and Gaye's bouts  with depression, and fear over an attempt on his life.  When the tour ended, he isolated himself by moving into his parents' house. He  threatened to commit suicide several times after bitter arguments with his  father. On April 1, 1984, one day before his 45th birthday, Gaye's father shot  him after an argument that started after his parents squabbled over misplaced  business documents. Gaye attempted to intervene, and was killed by his father  using a gun he had given him four months before. Marvin Sr. was sentenced to six  years of probation after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Charges of  first-degree murder were dropped after doctors discovered Marvin Sr. had a brain  tumor. Spending his final years in a retirement home, he died of pneumonia in  1998.  Gaye was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He was inducted  to Hollywood's Rock Walk in 1989 and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of  Fame in 1990.  Personal life: marriages and family Gaye and second wife Janis  Gaye married twice. His first marriage was to Berry Gordy, Jr.'s sister, Anna  Gordy, who was 17 years his senior. The marriage imploded after Marvin was  courting the teenage daughter of Slim Gaillard, Janis Hunter, in 1973. Anna  filed for divorce in 1975, the divorce was finalized in March 1977. Gaye's  erotic and disco-tinged studio album I Want You was based on his relationship  with Hunter. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin  Gaye, author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship  between I Want You and the relationship Gaye had with Hunter, which influenced  his music:      I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the  woman he deeply loved and would marry shortly, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession  with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that  are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessy  passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths,  and played off each other's weaknesses.     â€”Michael Eric Dyson  In October 1977, he married Janis, who was 17 years old when they met. However,  the marriage dissolved within a year. After attempts at reconciliation, Janis  filed for divorce in 1979. The divorce was finalized in February 1981. During  this time, Marvin began dating a model from Holland named Eugenie Vis. In 1982  Gaye became involved with Lady Edith Foxwell, former wife of the British movie  director Ivan Foxwell, and spent time with her at Sherston, her Wiltshire  estate. Foxwell ran the fashionable Embassy Club and was referred to in the  media as "the queen of London cafe society." The story of their affair was told  by Stan Hey in the April 2004 issue of GQ. The report quoted writer/composer  Bernard J. Taylor as saying he was told by Foxwell that she and Gaye had  discussed marriage.  Gaye had three children. Marvin Pentz Gaye, III (b. 1965) was adopted by Marvin  and his first wife Anna. The singer disclosed the information in the David Ritz  best-seller, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, saying he was afraid of  being criticized for not producing a child. Later, Gaye had two children with  Janis Hunter, Nona Marvisa, nicknamed "Pie" by her dad (born September 4, 1974)  and Frankie "Bubby" Christan Gaye (born November 16, 1975). Gaye introduced his  daughter to a national audience during a show in 1975. Nona would do the same  eight years later when her father was given a tribute by Soul Train. Nona has  gone on to find success as a singer and actress. Gaye's eldest son was a music  producer. Frankie is said to have taken work as an artist. Gaye also has two  grandchildren: Marvin Pentz Gaye IV (b. 1995) was born on the anniversary of his  grandfather's death and Nolan Pentz Gaye (b. 1997).  Legacy, tributes and award recognitions  In 1983, the British group Spandau Ballet recorded the single "True" as a  tribute to Gaye and the Motown sound he helped establish. The day after Gaye  died, Duran Duran dedicated their live performance of Save a Prayer on Arena. A  year after his death, The Commodores made reference to Gaye's death in their  1985 song "Nightshift", as did the Violent Femmes in their 1988 song "See My  Ships". Diana Ross paid tribute with her Top 10 single "Missing You" (1985), as  did Teena Marie, a former Motown artist, with her album track "My Dear Mr.  Gaye". The soul band Maze featuring Frankie Beverly recorded "Silky Soul" (1989)  in honor of their mentor. He was also mentioned in the choral verse of George  Michael's "John and Elvis Are Dead", on his album, Patience.  In 1992, the Israeli artist Izhar Ashdot dedicated his song "Eesh Hashokolad" to  Gaye.  In 1995, Madonna, Stevie Wonder, Speech of the group Arrested Development and  Gaye's daughter Nona, paid tribute to Gaye with the tribute album, Inner City  Blues: The Music of Marvin Gaye, which included a documentary of the same name  that aired on MTV. In 1999, R&B artists D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Brian McKnight  and Will Downing paid their respects in a tribute album, Marvin Is 60. In  October 2001, a cover of "What's Going On", produced by Jermaine Dupri, was  issued as a benefit single, credited to "Artists Against AIDS Worldwide". The  single, a reaction to the tragedy of the September 11, 2001 attacks as well as  to AIDS, featured Christina Aguilera, Mary J. Blige, Bono, Mariah Carey,  Destiny's Child, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, Monica, Nelly Furtado, Alicia Keys,  Aaron Lewis of the rock group StainD, Nas, Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, P. Diddy,  ?uestlove of The Roots, Britney Spears, and Gwen Stefani. The cover featured  Nona Gaye, who sang one of the song's lines, "Father, father/we don't need to  escalate".  In 1987, Gaye was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with his first wife  Anna Gordy and son Marvin III accepting for him. He was given his star on the  Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990. In 1996, he was awarded the Grammy Award for  Lifetime Achievement Award and was honored in song by admirers Annie Lennox and  Seal. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him #18 on their list of the 100 Greatest  Artists of All Time.
