Love In Vain - "Let It Bleed", "Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!", & "Stripped"
Comment: Prior to the Box Set releases unauthorized recordings were the only way to get the alternate "back-up" takes of Johnson's recordings. This is also the means the Stones used to hear songs they recorded and played in 1969 prior to release of the second Columbia LP recording of "new sides".
Love In Vain was recorded by the Stones in sessions that took place between March 24-27, 1969 at Olympic Studios, in England. The song was released on December 5, 1969 on the "Let It Bleed" album and played live prior to the studio record release during the 1969 US Tour. It is a brilliant adaptation of a song written and performed by the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. The Stones release of the song preceeds the Columbia release of additonal Johnson sides that came out on the LP "King Of The Delta Blues Singers Vol. II". Johnson originally recorded the song at The Blue Bonnet Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, in 1936. There are two takes of the Johnson song in existance.
