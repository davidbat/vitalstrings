This Motown concert program features photos of Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvelettes, Gladys Knight and  Bobby Taylor and Vancouvers.Motown was a record company founded by Berry Gordy, Jr. and incorporated as Motown Record Corporation in Detroit, Michigan, USA, on April 14, 1960. The name, a portmanteau  of motor and town, is also a nickname for Detroit. Now headquartered in New York City, Motown is a subsidiary  of Universal Motown Republic Group, itself a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, and now operates as Universal Motown. Motown Records was also the name of Gordy's second record label; the first, Tamla Records, began on January 12, 1959.Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music, as it was the first record label owned by an African American to primarily feature African-American artists who achieved crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its soul-based subsidiaries were the most successful proponents of what came to be known as The Motown Sound, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence.Motown has owned or distributed releases from more than 45 subsidiaries in varying genres, although it is most famous for its releases in the music genres of rhythm and blues, soul, hip hop, and pop. Motown Records left Detroit for Los Angeles in 1972, and remained an independent company until June 28, 1988, when Gordy sold the company to MCA and Boston Ventures (which took over full ownership of Motown in 1991), then to PolyGram in 1994.According to Ian Macfadyen, a collector of The Temptations-Otis Williams usually signed on David Ruffin's behalf. The concert program has been autographed on the inside by their photos by The Temptations-David Ruffin,Paul Williams,Melvin Franklin,Eddie Kendricks and Otis Williams....Marvin Gaye,Stevie (Wonder),Gladys Knight,The Marveletes-Gladys Horton, Jean McClain and Wanda Rogers and Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers and The Four Tops-Levi Stubbs,Renaldo Obie Benson,Abdul Duke Fakir and Lawrence Payton..........BOTH CONCERT PROGRAM AND AUTOGRAPHS ARE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION.............
