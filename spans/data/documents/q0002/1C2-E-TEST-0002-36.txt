So tragic and strange.  Can you think of even ONE other noteworthy person killed by his/her father?  Uncles, brothers, sons, yes.  But fathers?  I cannot think of one.

Marvin Gaye’s music, and what he would have created, is still missed. Gaye’s “What’s Going On” was a departure from his love songs of the past. Inspired by his brother’s experiences in Vietnam, Gaye’s masterpiece was almost not released by Motown head Berry Gordy, who didn’t believe it was commercial. On my Rockaeology blog at http://bit.ly/fIqvPt is the story of the innovative studio techniques, like dual lead vocal tracks, that helped make “What’s Going On” revolutionary.

I can't believe that everyone is preoccupied with michael jackson thinking that by doing so they know real music. Sorry real music started a very long time before MJ and it was propagated by the likes of marvin gaye, nat king cole and countless others. Oh and what about the underdogs like bill withers. They are absolutely classic and if people can cry over MJ then they should look back at the other fallen heroes of music and they really will have something to cry over then. RIP marvin
