Happy Birthday Marvin Gaye!
By KMJQ
Via TheUrbanDaily.com - The beginning of April marks a happy and sad time simultaneously for fans of  Marvin Gaye . In 1984, Marvin was gunned down by his own father the day before his 45th birthday. 28 years years later, music listeners are still paying homage to the soul man. His influence can be heard in the voices of contemporary R&B artists like  Usher  and  Robin Thicke .
In effort to remember the good times we had as Marvin ‘s music played in the background, enjoy The Urban Daily’s playlist of Marvin Gaye’s biggest hits with a few songs from his friends thrown into the mix.
