As his musical career progressed, Ronnie continued his passion for painting and drawing, his subjects ranging from band members and musicians he admired, knew and sometimes played with, to family and close friends and, of course, the self-portrait. It is on natural to find him with a pencil as with a guitar, drawing portraits of contemporaries and finding inspiration from his musical i influences. In America in the early 1980’s Ronnie produced his first prints – three woodcuts and a series of monotypes. At that time he was not yet an experienced printmaker so it was with great enthusiasm that he seized upon it. The opportunity in 1987 to send several months working in a professional printmaking studio in England. Since then he has devoted to a considerable amount of time to printmaking and has produced a number of images using various techniques –etching, drypoint, screenprint and digital.
