Under the Influence (November 25, 2003) 3 James Christopher Monger As a leader of the mod revival with the Jam, the Sophisti-Pop movement with the Style Council, and rabid fan of all things soul and R&B, it's no wonder that Paul Weller's entry in the Under the Influence series is as eclectic and deep as his myriad influences. The 16 tracks chosen by Weller sound as slaved over as any music fan with a Friday night, a six-pack, no friends, and an insatiable urge to achieve the perfect mix. As would be expected, Weller spends a great deal of time in the '60s and '70s, championing songs by everyone from the Kinks ("Big Black Smoke" and Marvin Gaye ("Pretty Little Baby") to obscurities like the Casuals ("Jesamine") and the Winstons ("Color Him Father"), but he weaves in jazz greats like Mingus ("Passions of a Man " and Coltrane ("Ole"), reggae giants like the Wailers ("Small Axe") and Big Youth ("Hit the Road Jack"), and modern soul (D'Angelo) and hip-hop (Funkdoobiest) with equal vigor, further cementing his reputation as a forward-thinking, always surprising artist who consistently moves with the times instead of against them.
