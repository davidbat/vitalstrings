There was a music that existed in the bottom of slave ships. It existed for centuries before it was ever given a name.
It was a music based on and influenced by feeling. This music could be felt through melodies, harmonies, and heartfelt lyrics.
This music is known as soul music . The American singer Marvin Gaye was hailed as the "Prince of Soul."
Born on April 2, 1939 in Washington, D. C., Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. later added an E to his last name because he thought it made it look more professional. As the son of a Pentecostal pastor, his first musical influences were found in the church.
He was swept up as a teenager by the nationwide sensation known as doo wop. He joined a doo wop group by the name of The Moonglows and was later signed to Motown Records as a solo artist and an accomplished drummer.
It was during the 60's and 70's at Motown that Marvin enjoyed a plethora of Pop and R&B hit singles and albums. He dominated the charts and the concert stage with his angelic counter-tenor voice and sizzling stage presence as a sex symbol on the international music scene.

Hits like Pride and Joy, What's Going On?, Let's Get It On, and countless duets with Tammi Terrell made Gaye a household name. His biggest hit was 1968's I Heard It Through The Grapevine which held the #1 spot on both the Pop and R&B charts for seven consecutive weeks each.
Besides commercial success, Marvin Gaye reached a priceless success within the African-American community. He was a voice of the times and a prophet for the downtrodden and oppressed black poor. He was not only a soulful crooner, but a glimpse of the American dream.
