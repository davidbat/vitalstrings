About Marvin Gaye
Soul genius Marvin Gaye achieved what few popular music artists ever have-perfectly embodying the tempestuous social and political forces at play in America in the 60's and 70's and distilling them into a visceral collection of pure R&B jams. Though he battled his own demons-drug and alcohol addictions-for most of his life, Gaye sought solace in the recording studio, channeling his influence into his classic songs. Gaye was signed to Motown Records, executive Berry Gordy's infamous hit factory and, like fellow soul genius Stevie Wonder , he had to fight for every inch of creative control he needed to produce his visionary albums. Gaye's 1971 masterpiece What's Going On? begged the nation to answer the question-with the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement both tearing the country apart, it remains a vital document from the country's transitional period. The album was entirely produced by Gaye and it also addresses the drug use and poverty afflicting African American communities. The album is almost conceptual, telling a story from the point of view of a recently returned Vietnam veteran disillusioned with what he sees once he comes home. 1973's Let's Get It On was a more traditional soul record, but a cut above standard. Gaye recorded it as a tribute to his own doo-wop roots, and the collection of bedroom ballads has since gone on to influence everyone from Barry White to Prince . Gaye's hit singles included "Sexual Healing," "Got to Give It Up" and the title track. However, Marvin Gaye's heavy drug use while touring made him severely paranoid and he insisted on isolating himself in his parent's house-tragically, he was shot to death by his father after a family argument over bills.
