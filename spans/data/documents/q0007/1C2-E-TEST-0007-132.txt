Grammy-winning diva Whitney Houston​ is returning to the big screen in a remake of the film Sparkle. Houston joins Jordin Sparks who was recently confirmed to star in the remake of the 1976 movie musical Sparkle, which is loosely based on the story of The Supremes. Jordin Sparks, will play the lead role of Sparkle. (Cute!)
For those of you too young to remember, the story of Sparkle revolves around three sisters who become a hugely successful trio in the 50s and 60s. Whitney, who hasn’t appeared in a film since The Preacher’s Wife in 1996 (and in the 1997 TV movie Cinderella), would play Sparkle’s mother. Comedian/actor Mike Epps is also attached to play Satin, a comedian who marries one of Sparkle’s sisters and gets her hooked on drugs.
