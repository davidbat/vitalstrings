From Vivica Fox (years ago), to Lark Voorhies, Brandy... and now Meagan Good is another actress said to be interested in playing (or in the running to play) Whitney Houston in a film based on the late singer's life.
But Meagan says she got reasonably close because she and Houston were in talks (before the singer's death) about Good starring in a Whitney biopic.
"We were fairly in the beginning stages... We were supposed to meet today actually," Good told EOnline last night in Hollywood.
Interesting. I can't immediately picture Meagan Good as Whitney Houston; but Whitney clearly saw something that I don't.
Good added, "My feeling is because she has the film Sparkle coming out and she's brilliant in it and she looks beautiful and healthy, my feeling was that's how we should end the movie—as a new beginning for her," in reference to how the film would end, given Houston's recent death.
Good also said she wouldn't sing in the film he flick, stating, "I don't think we've ever had a singer in history that I remember that could sing like her... Plus, when people see someone's life story they want to hear that person's voice because they connect with it, in their spirit and their soul. So you would have to use her voice."
She speaks almost as if the project is/was a done deal, and is indeed going to happen.
But this is all news to me.
