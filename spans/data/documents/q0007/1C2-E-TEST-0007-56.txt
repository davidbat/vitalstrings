Though it's been a long ride, with ups and downs, "The Queen of the Night" is back on the big screen.
Whitney Houston is starring alongside Jordin Sparks and Mike Epps in "Sparkle," the remake of the 70s music-themed drama.
Originally, "Sparkle" was based on the story of The Supremes, which tells the story of three sisters' rise to the top from their humble beginnings at a Harlem church choir.
"American Idol" winner, Sparks, plays the lead in the film, with Houston as her discouraging mother. This is the first feature film that Houston has starred in since 1996's "The Preacher's Wife."
Here she sits down with ET to talk about her role, her reentry to film and her relationship with Sparks. Good to have you back, Whitney!
