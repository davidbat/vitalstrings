Whitney Houston sat down for a rare interview, and while we're glad Whit is working again, she comes off as a bit strange.
Houston's face appears puffy, and her words don't quite make sense. She also monopolizes the interview, barely letting co-star Jordin Sparks get a word in.
The diva is back on the big screen for Sparkle, a remake of the 1970s, music-themed drama. Sparks plays the lead, with Houston playing her mother.
This marks Whitney's first movie since 1996's The Preacher's Wife.
Watch a clip from The Preacher's Wife above.
Do you think Whitney looks different?
