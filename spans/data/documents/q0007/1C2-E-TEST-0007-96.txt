Whitney Houston's Dead Body Being Wheeled Out of Hotel on Stretcher
By Truthquake.com Staff
Whitney Hoston’s death is making her worth more dead than alive for many businesses – including the movie industry.
Netflix was streaming her movie The Bodyguard and several other movies she made until this week when they were removed in order to allegedly boost DVD and video sales of the dead singer’s film catalog.
Google Plus Week host Dan McDermott noticed that The Bodyguard had been pulled from Netflix streaming soon after Houston’s death Feb. 11 when he went on the website and saw a number of angry comments by customers.
He called Netflx, and their representative said: “Okay Dan, I just went and talked to my main supervisor as to why the movie had been pulled, and the reason it was pulled was the production company pulled the streaming rights from us because all the publicity after Whitney Houston’s passing there was an opportunity to make really a very large amount of money on the DVD sales of her movies.

“So they’re going to pull all the streaming titles we have of Whitney Houston so they can make more money off the DVD sales of her movies.”
Reportedly, before Houston’s death, Arista Records and Sony Music signed her to a 6-album, $100 million contract, which now seems as if they knew she would likely die from drugs and wanted to have an “insurance policy” on her.
