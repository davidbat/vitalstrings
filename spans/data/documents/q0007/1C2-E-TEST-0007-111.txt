Los Angeles - Whitney Houston is to return to the big screen for the first time in 15 years.
The 47-year-old singer-and-actress - who has recently re-entered a rehabilitation centre for drug and alcohol treatment - will be reuniting with her former Waiting To Exhale castmates to create a sequel to the 1995 hit movie, in which she played unlucky-in-love television producer Savannah Jackson.
Angela Bassett - who portrayed Bernadine Harris in the film - explained director Forest Whitaker is in the process of altering author-and-screenwriter Terry McMillan's follow-up to the movie.
The Bodyguard
Speaking on TV show The Talk, she said: "It's preliminary, but it's going to happen, Waiting to Exhale 2. McMillan wrote Getting to Happy and she's written the screenplay ... Loretta Devine, Lela Rochon, Whitney, Forest. Forest is working on the script now."
Meanwhile, it was recently revealed 1992 hit movie The Bodyguard - which starred Whitney and Kevin Costner and took $411 million at the worldwide box office - is to be remade by Warner Bros.
While Whitney - who hasn't appeared in a film since The Preacher's Wife in 1996 - won't be appearing in the remake, producers are keen to get a young female singer with global appeal and give her the platform that The Bodyguard provided Whitney.
Beyonce Knowles and Rihanna are two names which have been linked to the project.
