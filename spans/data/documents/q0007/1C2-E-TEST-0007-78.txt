Whitney Houston may be gone, but her final screen performance still remains to be seen: She recently wrapped Sparkle, a musical drama, opposite American Idol winner Jordin Sparks.
The film is about a family of musicians impacted by drugs.
“I’m in total shock,” producer Howard Rosenman tells EW.com. “I just saw the rough cut last night. She is unbelievably brilliant in it. I am beside myself. I am absolutely devastated. She was one of the most talented entertainers who ever lived.”
Sparkle, which is a remake of the 1976 Irene Cara film, is scheduled for release in August.
