Houston was also one of five executive producers on the     movie, having acquired remake rights in close to 12 years ago.     Her original plan was to have Aaliyah star as Sparkle, until     the singer died in a plane crash in August 2001.
 
"Sparkle" is  the fictional story of three singing     sisters in 1950s Harlem. One of the singers spirals in to drug     addiction that leads to her death.
 
Sparks is the film's star, Sparkle Williams;  Houston     plays the sisters' mother.  Cee Lo Green is also in the     film.

In her film career - "Sparkle" would have been her fourth     appearance on the big screen -- Houston stayed close to home     with her roles, portraying a pop star in 1992's "The     Bodyguard," a TV producer in 1995's  "Waiting to Exhale"     and a choir mistress in 1996's "The Preacher's Wife."
 
On Saturday, Sony Pictures released a statement that read     "Like all those who knew and loved her, we are shocked and     saddened and the world has lost an incomparable talent. Right     now our thoughts are with her daughter, her family and her     friends."
