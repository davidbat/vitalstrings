Angela Bassett: 'Full Cast Returning For Waiting To Exhale Sequel'
Actress Angela Bassett has confirmed rumours she's reuniting with Whitney Houston for a sequel to 1995 film Waiting To Exhale.
The hit romantic movie, about the love lives of four female friends in Phoenix, Arizona, was a big screen adaptation of Terry MCMillan's 1992 book of the same name, and Bassett reveals the follow-up, based on the author's 2005 novel Getting to Happy, is in the works.
And the star claims the full original cast, including Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon, are all on board for the upcoming project - which will see Forest Whitaker returning as director.
Speaking on U.S. chat show The Talk on Thursday (05May11), she says, "It's preliminary but it's going to happen, Waiting to Exhale 2.
"She (MCMillan) wrote Getting to Happy and she's written the screenplay... Loretta, Lela, Whitney, Forest. Forest is working on the script now."
Waiting to Exhale was a critical and commercial success when it was released, boasting a global box office haul of $81.45 million (£50.9 million). It was also branded a "social phenomenon" by the Los Angeles Times for having an all-African American cast.

Report: Whitney Houston Checks Into Rehab
According to fresh reports, Whitney Houston has checked herself into a rehabilitation clinic.
Full story after the jump…
Via TMZ:
Whitney Houston has checked herself in to an out-patient rehabilitation program … but it’s not for drugs or alcohol … TMZ has learned.
A source directly connected with Whitney tells us … Houston enrolled in the program around 10 days ago. The program allows Houston to go out in public … as long as she has a monitor.
Just last weekend, Houston was enjoying herself at a Prince concert in L.A. … with her daughter right by her side.
Our source is not saying why Houston is seeking treatment … but insists it’s not drug or alcohol related.
We’re told, “She’s cleansing herself to get ready for a new movie.”
You already know media outlets are cooking up ways to spin this. In any case, for Whitney’s sake, let’s hope this is indeed “cleansing for a movie role”.
Re: Whitney Houston: New Era Part 1
Post by bigb0882 on May 9, 2011, 12:04pm
Cleansing for a movie role?  Please don't tell me anyone believes that.  Maybe she hasn't relapsed but has been really close lately so she is taking steps to make sure that doesn't happen.  That may be why she has a monitor with her any time she is out of the rehab and in public.

Whitney's Rep: Drugs and Booze ARE The Problem

A rep for Whitney Houston says the singer is receiving treatment in an out-patient rehab program for drugs and alcohol as part of a "long-standing " recovery process.
TMZ broke the story ... Houston voluntarily enrolled in the program around 10 days ago.
Houston has admitted her problems with substance abuse in the past ... but TMZ has learned the demons have resurfaced.
A music industry source who was with Whitney two weeks ago tells us, "She was plastered and she was a mess."

No, I don't believe it's to cleanse for a new movie. Why would you need to be in a rehab program to 'cleanse'??? She could go to a day spa for that, and eat vegetables and drink water all day.
Whatever the reason is, I can only say it's a good thing she's taking a step in the right direction to better herself and/or keep herself better.

Whitney Houston Voluntarily Enters Rehab
FIRST PUBLISHED: May 9, 2011 12:43 PM EDT
NEW YORK, N.Y. -- Whitney Houston is back in rehab.
A representative for the singer confirmed Monday that Houston is undergoing treatment.
Kristen Foster says Houston is in an out-patient program for drug and alcohol treatment. She says it is a voluntary measure and part of Houston’s “long-standing” recovery process.
The 47-year-old has battled drug abuse in the past. She released a comeback album in 2009, but her 2010 tour was troubled: Houston canceled some dates due to illness and received negative reviews from fans who were disappointed inthe quality of her voice and performance.

It's obviously not a regular rehab facility since she was out in public at a Prince concert on Thursday. Outpatient facilities and rehab facilities are two different things.

It's all odd because when her daughter was photographed snorting cocaine there was all these reports of Whitney begging her to go to rehab and stay away from those people, then all of a sudden Bobbi Kris ended up in LA and she tweeted that she was meditating, bike riding, kayacking, all these things that sounded like she was in a facility. Maybe a counselor suggested Whitney join her daughter too?

I don't think it's odd at all. Whitney obviously doesn't want her daughter going down the same path but just because she wants that for her daughter doesn't mean it's any easier for Whitney herself to stay away from drugs. Plus I am sure like any drug addict there has been a lot of denial as to the extent of the addiction.

Agreed. I never believed it neither. Just like she looked high at that Prince concert singing and dancing with her daughter. The first thought that ran through my mind was that she was high.

I believe she was clean for a while at least. She was too heavy to be all coked out. But she never said everything was hunky dory, she specifically said during the Oprah interview that she was clean then, but she only takes it one day at a time. And she never denied getting urges for it.

I'm talking more about the way the general public and the media responds when a celebrity is supposedly "clean". There have been rumors that Whitney has been doing drugs for over 20 years. It's going to be something she always struggles with and not something that just goes from being a problem to not a problem. There's already this reaction of shock and disappointment that she's back in rehab, but I don't really think it's a surprise. That's not to criticize Whitney. That's just the reality of the problem.

I hope so.  Did I read somewhere that she's the last of the original Waiting to Exhale cast members not yet signed on for the sequel?  f**k that could've been a dream even.

Look on page 11. Angela Bassett confirmed last week that Whitney signed on, her publicist also mentions that she needs to 'cleanse' for the new movie.

TMZ is reporting that Prince's people have banned Whitney from attending his concerts!!
Whitney Houston has lost her Prince privileges ... because sources tell TMZ the Purple One's people became so fed up with her erratic behavior and constant ticket demands ... that she is no longer allowed at his shows.
According to our Prince sources, Whitney attended several Prince concerts in the last few weeks and appeared to be "intoxicated" at each show -- though our sources never saw Whitney drink alcohol or take drugs.
We're told Whitney was constantly badgering Prince's staff to let her up on the stage ... but Team Prince shot her down every time because P's people "didn't want her to embarrass herself."
Our sources say Whitney's erratic behavior, coupled with repeated and excessive ticket demands became too much for Prince -- and his team ultimately banned Houston from his concerts.
