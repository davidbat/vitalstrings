'Cheers' star can be found in all 13 Pixar films
2009: Whitney releases her album , "I Look To You," which entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1. She heads out on tour to promote the album.
2010: Whitney cancels multiple tour dates due to an upper respiratory infection and amidst horrible reviews. Her camp issues a statement that she "is in great health" after stopping smack in the middle of "I Will Always Love You" to take a sip of water.
May 2011: Whit checks back into rehab .
Now, if the third time's the charm in Whit's case, then she may have a strategy going for her, but based on this history, we're worried the gal may pull a LiLo, or worse, a Charlie Sheen, on set.
We're rooting for ya, Whit, but you desperately need to handle your issues with substance abuse before you can get your head clearly back in the game.
Either that, or maybe good ol' Charlie can loan you some tiger blood. Best of luck on comeback numero tres.
