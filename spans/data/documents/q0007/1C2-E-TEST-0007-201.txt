Posted: February 13, 2012
Tributes for the late Whitney Houston have continued to pour in after the legendary singer was found dead in a Beverly Hills hotel room on the night before the 54th Grammy Awards.
Bobby Brown , Houston’s former husband, said in a statement Sunday:
“I am deeply saddened at the passing of my ex-wife, Whitney Houston. At this time, we ask for privacy, especially for my daughter, Bobbi Kristina. I appreciate all of the condolences that have been directed towards my family and I at this most difficult time.”
Meanwhile, Whitney’s mother, gospel singing sensation Cissy Houston, issued the following statement:
“We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Whitney. This is an unimaginable tragedy and we will miss her terribly. We appreciate the outpouring of love and support from her fans and friends.”
In an interview with Steve North, now of the Daily Beast, more than 20 years ago, Cissy recollected a moment when Whitney – in her youth – said: “‘Mommy, I’m going to be a star. I’m going to take care of you, and you’re never going to have to work again!’”
“I’m actually amazed sometimes,” Cissy said in the interview about Whitney, “She just goes, she soars. And hearing her sometimes just gives me chills.”
Cissy Houston, 78, is said to have spoken with her daughter Whitney Houston just 30 minutes prior to her death on Saturday. According to TMZ, the pair talked about attending the Clive Davis pre-Grammy party. Cissy Houston is reported to be “hysterical” over her daughter’s premature death.
