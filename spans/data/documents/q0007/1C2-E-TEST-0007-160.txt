Whitney Houston’s 18-year-old daughter looked somber as she got out of her car and headed into her mom’s wake in Newark, N. J. Feb. 17
This is the first photo of Bobbi Kristina Brown arriving at her mom Whitney Houston ‘s private wake in Newark, N.J. earlier today.
Wearing jeans, a black top and sunglasses, the 18-year-old daughter appeared serious, but under control as she carried her purse into the private ceremony. Following her mom’s death Feb. 12, Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized for an emotional breakdown .
Although she’s doing better now and staying with her grandmother, sources tell us the teen is still emotionally unstable. Her mom’s invite-only funeral will take place Feb. 18 at 12 p.m. at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, N.J.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Bobbi Kristina and her family during this difficult time.
