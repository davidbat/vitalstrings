National Enquirer posts Whitney Houston open casket photo on front page
The National Enquirer will never be mistaken for Reader’s Digest, but this week they took the extraordinary step of running a photo of what they say is Whitney Houston in her open casket prior to her funeral on Saturday.
Not that it’s all that shocking, when you think about it, as the shot is reminiscent of the Enquirer front page featuring Elvis Presley’s open casket photo after The King died in 1977.
Did The Enquirer go too far, is this par for the course with today’s tabloid journalism, or both?
