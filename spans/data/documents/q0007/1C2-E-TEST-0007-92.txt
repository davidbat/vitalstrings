Whitney Houston is dead, confirmed her family, the police, and the Associated press. Houston died age 48, following years of on-off substance abuse issues, although the cause of death is yet to be determined.
Houston was found in the bathtub of room 434 of the Beverly Hilton Hotel by a member of her entourage who called security, who in turn called 911. Police arrived within minutes, and fire were on the scene for an unrelated incident. Paramedics arrived and attempted to revive the singer, only to find her unresponsive. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. PST Saturday February 11, 2012.
Police sources tell TMZ.com there’s no foul play. However, they were more vague in their statement to People.com: “I can confirm that Whitney Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. We received a call at 3:43 p.m. from hotel security and Beverly Hills Fire and police responded minutes later,” Beverly Hills Police Lieutenant Mark Rosen told People.com. “It’s unclear who notified hotel staff because she has quite an entourage here at the hotel. We attempted to resuscitate her, to no avail… We don’t know yet [whether there was any evidence of drugs or foul play], her death is under investigation.”
Houston was seen last weekend in a car with on-off boyfriend Ray J  (who, despite rumours he found the singer’s body, was not with her at the time of her death).
Houston was also at the Kelly Price & Friends Unplugged: For The Love Of R&B pre-GRAMMY Party at Tru Hollywood, Thursday where she looked out of it. Houston was on stage for what became her final performance of Yes, Jesus Loves Me of which you can watch video below.
Houston died hours before she was scheduled to sing at Clive Davis’ annual pre-Grammy party (which went on as planned, at the hotel Houston was found dead, although Davis was not attendance… opting instead to grieve at home with family). Her mother, Cissy Houston , spoke to the singer 30-minutes before death and says she seemed fine. Cousin Dionne Warwick spoke to the 48-year-old hours before the Davis party, to confirm seating, and again, nothing seemed amiss.
The late singer “partied hard” at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, according to staff. TMZ reports: “We’re told Whitney and her friends were in the bar for a time and the group was drinking and very loud. Our sources say even though the hotel is busy with all the Grammy festivities, Whitney and her group stood out because they were so boisterous. Again, it’s too early to know what caused her death.”
