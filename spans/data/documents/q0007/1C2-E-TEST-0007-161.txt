More on this film
Sparkle is a remake of the Detroit-set 1976 film of the same name, a personal favourite of Houston's. She plays the mother of three sisters in a 1960s Motown-era girl group who are seen dealing with the fallout of fame and drugs in a story which was inspired by the Supremes. American Idol winner Jordin Sparks (who plays the title character), Cee Lo Green, Mike Epps and Derek Luke also take starring roles.
In the trailer Houston is seen warning her daughters to learn from her character's own ill-fated brush with stardom. She appears in several scenes and even performs a solo number, the gospel song His Eye on the Sparrow. The singer reportedly recorded several tracks for the soundtrack and also acted as executive producer. Sparkle was widely seen as her comeback project following several years away from the big screen. She had completed all her scenes by the time of her death on 11 February.
The original Sparkle was inspirational in the creation of the musical that would eventually debut on Broadway in 1981 as Dreamgirls, later adapted into a 2006 film of the same name which won Jennifer Hudson an Oscar for her turn as Effie White. Houston's godmother, Aretha Franklin, recorded many of the songs for the Sparkle soundtrack.
Houston was reportedly one of Hollywood's highest paid female actors in the mid-1990s, earning $10m a movie following the huge financial success of her turn opposite Kevin Costner in the 1992 film The Bodyguard . At the time of her death she had not appeared on the big screen since 1996's The Preacher's Wife.
Houston died in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel hours before she was due to attend a pre-Grammy awards party. A coroner ruled last month that she drowned in the hotel bathtub. However, officials said that heart disease and chronic cocaine use were contributing factors to the singer's death. Her death had earlier been ruled as accidental.
â€¢ Sparkle is due for US release on August 17 and arrives in the UK on October 5.
