A music industry source has claimed that Whitney Houston owed her record label millions of dollars when she died.
It is claimed that Whitney, who passed away in February, had not earned back her advance on a six album, $100 milion deal with Sony which she signed in 2001.
“It’s really an advance against sales,” industry blogger Wayne Russo tells The Daily. “They loaned her the money, and her records didn’t sell.”
Whitney only released two albums with Sony after signing the huge deal, 2002’s Just Whitney 2009’s I Look To You both of which failed to sell in the volumes Whitney had traditionally shifted.

“She owes Sony at least $20 million,” Rosso says. “She’s going to have to sell 5 million more records before her family sees a dime.” Adding: “Since her father died, she didn’t have a manager. There was no one thinking of other revenue streams. She left millions on the table.”
This loss of money has led many fans to worry that the market will be flooded with posthumous musical releases under Whitney's name.
Meanwhile, the owner of the funeral home, where a picture of Houston's dead body was taken and published by the National Enquirer, has claimed to know who the mystery photographer could be.
