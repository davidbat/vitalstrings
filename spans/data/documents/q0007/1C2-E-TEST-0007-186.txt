LOS ANGELES — Producers of Whitney Houston’s final movie are hustling to get it in theaters sooner than originally scheduled.
“Sparkle,” a remake of the 1976 cult film, had been slated for an Aug. 17 release. But TMZ yesterday reported that Sony Pictures’ postproduction crews are working round-the-clock to finish it in time for an earlier release.
One reason is fear that Houston’s final performance will leak online before it hits theaters, sources told TMZ. To that end, the studio has ordered extra security around the facility where the film is being edited, the sources said.
The film, co-starring “American Idol” winner Jordin Sparks, follows three sisters who form a singing group but must deal with the fallout from fame and drugs.
Houston (pictured), who was a huge fan of the original, played the girls’ mom and served as executive producer.
“Sparkle” will be her first time on the big screen since “The Preacher’s Wife” in 1996.
Houston died Feb. 11 in an LA hotel at age 48 after reportedly mixing Xanax, Valium and alcohol. No official cause of death has been released.
