Houston We Have A Problem: Whitney To Star In SPARKLE?
Courtney Howard September 12, 2011 17
First we were treated to the super successful DREAMGIRLS adaptation and now Hollywood is eager to make another Supreme hit out of the story of an all girl singing group.  The Hollywood Reporter states that Whitney Houston, making her first return to movies since 1996’s THE PREACHER’S WIFE, is in negotiations to star in SPARKLE, Sony Pictures remake of the 1976 music-themed drama. AMERICAN IDOL winner Jordin Sparks and actor Mike Epps also are set to star.
The news comes as a bit of a surprise as the last most of us heard from Houston was that she had once again relapsed into drugs and alcohol.  The singer also suffered a failed attempt at re-starting her singing career when folks walked out of her concerts.  Is this woman strong enough to come back into the Hollywood spotlight now? Is she even insurable?
Mara Brock Akil, who created and executive produces BET’s hit comedy THE GAME, wrote the script while husband Salim Akil (THE GAME, GIRLFRIENDS), is directing.
The original SPARKLE was inspired by the story of the Supremes, and centered on the three Williams sisters, who begin singing in their church choir in Harlem in the late 1950s and become a successful girl group. Their sudden rise unravels their personal lives.
Sparks will play the title character, the talented member of the group while Houston will play her not-so encouraging mother. Epps will be Satin, a stand-up comedian who marries one of the sisters and gets her hooked on drugs.
Irene Cara (FAME) played Sparkle in the original while Mary Alice (Oracle in the MATRIX series of films) portrayed Effie. Phillip Michael Thomas (Tubbs from MIAMI VICE TV Series) starred as Stix. Take a look at the trailer below for a cheese-tastic flashback:
