Ms Houston and Bobbi Christina when you loose someone you love you must let go of what could have been and hold on to your memories of Whitney especially those memories of hers in your heart. God will allow you to grive as long as you need to and dont ever let anyone tell you when it’s time.  God will heal your hearts. God Bless

Typical…leave it to a nigger to gain this much fame and fortune, and piss it all away in such a short time span with crack cocaine…..what an ungrateful nigger. May you rest in piss, and burn in hell.
The only good nigger, is a dead nigger. Niggers lost the only worth they have ever had in the history of all mankind when slavery was abolished. Now they are truly, completely, utterly worthless. Niggers are the cancer of this planet.

a filthy nigger swine black whore. she was the one who caused nigger women to act like  black trash pigs. thank god this nigger died early. she was musically insignificant and promoted because she was black. she had no skill and wanted to be a model but no one wanted to look at niggers then nor now.

I’ve been a fan since the very beginning of her career.  Her talent was unique and God-given, and we will never see another quite like Whitney again.  She is now the lead singer in heaven’s choir of angels, delighting God and all the souls who reside in heaven.  We are all very privileged to have lived on this Earth at the same time as you, being witnesses to your incredible talent!  RIP, dear Whitney.  Perhaps I’ll meet you in heaven one day.

the shocking death of whitney makes me wonder if the illuminati had anything to do with this, which im guessing it did. I dont know if she made it to Heaven, i sure do hope she did, dont know if she was apart of the whole illuminati. If she was, i hope she got out jus in time before she left this cruel world. Try rest in peace Whitney. We will always love you

so sad I guess she just finally  was so tired out of it all that sometimes we can not take it anymore so she decided to just leave the world and just sleep in a restfull peace with no worrys and problems to deal with anymore she was such a good singer and pretty its like her song to all her fans and loved ones I will always love you and that is what she left everyone with she has found her peace at last – rest in peace with god up above like a dove who shall sleep with the angles forever and now – she will be sadly missed
