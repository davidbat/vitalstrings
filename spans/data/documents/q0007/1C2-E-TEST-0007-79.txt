The top pop diva of the '80s and '90s, Houston later became plagued by career-hampering problems. After working as a model in her teens, this sexy hit-maker burst onto the music scene in 1985 with her eponymous debut album, which spawned a slew of No. 1 songs. In 1992, Houston made her seemingly inevitable film debut in the romantic thriller The Bodyguard and married volatile R&B singer Bobby Brown. Although she continued to make movies and albums for the rest of the decade, stories about her unstable personal life filled the tabloids, including multiple stints in drug rehab, shocking weight loss and rumors of spousal abuse. In 2005 Houston and her hubby opened up their lives to even more scrutiny when they launched their own reality show, Being Bobby Brown. The next year, the tempestuous couple separated after 14 years of marriage.
