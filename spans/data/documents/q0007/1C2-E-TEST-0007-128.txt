A sequel to Whitney Houston 's 1995 hit Waiting to Exhale may be in the works, despite the singer's death.
Based on a Terry McMillan novel, the movie starred Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine as four girlfriends dealing with bad relationships.
Before her death, Houston had completed her first film since the 1996 holiday comedy The Preacher's Wife. The movie, called Sparkle , is a remake of a 1976 film about a girl group, and also stars Jordin Sparks.
There was talk of Houston continuing her transition back to film with a Waiting to Exhale sequel, but in the event of her drug-related death, all possible plans were halted.
However, in a recent interview with Good Day LA , co-star Loretta Devine said that development may continue without Houston, adding: "Now the focus would be a tribute to her, which would be wonderful. We don't know if they're going to try to introduce a new character or pull her character out all together.
"So it's a lot of rewrites that they'll have to go through, so I don't know if it's going to happen as soon as we thought it would happen."
There has been talk of a remake of another Houston movie, the highly successful thriller The Bodyguard. Singer Rihanna has ruled out a role in the film, though she has expressed interest in playing Houston in a possible biopic.
