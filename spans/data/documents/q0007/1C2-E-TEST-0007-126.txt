Here is the official poster for the forthcoming movie “Sparkle” which stars the late Whitney Houston, Idol winner Jordin Sparks and Derek Luke.
The glamorous poster features a shadowy photo of Sparks in a glittery red dress holding a mic with the pics of the other actors lined up below.
The musical will follow three teenage sisters as they rise to fame while fighting with their demons such as sex, drugs and alcohol.
Houston is said to have given two remarkable performances in the movie on a duet called “Celebrate” written by R. Kelly and on the gospel classic “His Eye is on the Sparrow.”
“Sparkle”will open in theaters in August of 2012.
