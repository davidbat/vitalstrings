This is the Whitney we like to see!
This is the first look at Mz. Houston's new movie Sparkle with co-star Jordin Sparks .
And gurlfriend is looking good!
Jordin described her experience with working with her idol:
"She was so cool and very motherly toward me.  If I ever looked like I needed something, here she came saying 'Are you okay?'
I sang her songs into a hairbrush when I was little.  Now she's acting as my mom and scolding me. It was a dream come true."
The movie is a remake of the 1976 film about a group of singing sisters.
Whitney herself expressed her excitement on working on the period piece:
"Part of the fun of making this movie is definitely the costumes and the hairstyles. The movie is set in 1963, and we had a great wardrobe, hair and makeup person and I loved wearing the outfits."
And they suit her well.  We're so glad she's looking healthy and is doing what she does best.  So, so, SO hoping we get to hear her sing in the film.
Wow, we can't believe it's been 15 years since we last saw one of our favorite divas on the big screen.  It's about time she makes her comeback!
