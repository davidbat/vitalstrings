:::Synopsis
The adaptation of Terry McMillan's best-selling novel, about four middle-class, African-American friends, and their continuing efforts to find Mr. Right. The story begins with Bernadine, whose husband John calmly announces that he's leaving her -- for a white woman. Furthermore, the wealthy John has been manipulating his finances, and leaves Bernadine virtually broke. But Bernie gets her revenge, in a rather 'fiery' fashion. Then there's Savannah, who re-ignites a relationship with her ex-boyfriend, who's married with children. Meanwhile, dim-bulb Robin dates hordes of Mr. Wrongs before going back to Russell, who's also married. Will either come to her senses? Finally, portly, single mom Gloria gave up on finding a man years ago, concentrating instead on raising her son. Ironically, it is she who finds love, with her new neighbor. For these women, finding a man is secondary to one thing: their close love and affection for one another. And it is this bond that helps them get through the pain and heartache of their lives.
