Special Section: Whitney Houston, Death of a pop diva
Not only does Houston appear in the film, but she also served as an executive producer and recorded several songs for the soundtrack. "Sparkle" was poised to mark Houston's acting comeback.
After Houston's death, Sony released a statement, explaining: "Like all those who knew and loved her, we are shocked and saddened and the world has lost an incomparable talent. Right now our thoughts are with her daughter, her family and her friends."
Houston was no stranger to the big screen. She famously starred in the 1992 hit, "The Bodyguard," with Kevin Costner and most recently appeared in the 1996 movie, "The Preacher's Wife."
Houston died Saturday night at the age of 48.
