The anticipated 'Sparkle' remake featuring Whitney Houston and Jordin Sparks has been pushed back.
According to Sony, 'Sparkle' will arrive in theaters August 17 instead of a previously announced August 10 date.
Based on a family consisting of three sisters, Sparkle documents the girl group's sudden rise to the top.
Sparkle also marks the return of Whitney Houston to the big screen following The Preacher's Wife, Waiting To Exhale, and The Bodyguard.
Tika Sumpter and Carmen Ejogo also star in Sparkle.
