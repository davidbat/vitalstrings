Though Whitney Houston’s daughter was in the news yesterday, today’s it’s all about the real Queen Of The Night — Houston is in negotiations to star in the remake of the 1976 movie musical Sparkle, which is loosely based on the story of The Supremes. If cast, she would join Jordin Sparks, who is attached to play the lead role of Sparkle. (Sparks as Sparkle? Too cute.)
The story of Sparkle revolves around three sisters who become a hugely successful trio in the 50s and 60s. Whitney, who hasn’t appeared in a film since The Preacher’s Wife in 1996 (and in the 1997 TV movie Cinderella), would play Sparkle’s mother, according to an exclusive report in The Hollywood Reporter . Comedian/actor Mike Epps is also attached to play Satin, a comedian who marries one of Sparkle’s sisters.
We know what you’re thinking — we’ve already seen this, and it’s called Dreamgirls. Though the original Broadway production of Dreamgirls premiered in 1981, five years after Sparkle, it’s true the two musicals share many similarities: both revolve around a female trio based on The Supremes, and follow their rise to fame all the way to their undoing. Plus, both Sparkle and Dreamgirls have a character named Effie, and now with their film adaptations, they’ll both star an American Idol alum making their film debut.
