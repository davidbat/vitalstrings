Whitney Houston's 'Adopted' Son Confirms Bobbi Kristina Romance
Takes to Twitter
Tweet
Whitney Houston's 'adopted' son has reportedly confirmed that he is in a relationship with Bobbi Kristina.
It was reported last week that Whitney's 19-year-old daughter was embroiled in a romance with Nick Gordon, who, despite not being blood related, was raised by Whitney, who tragically passed away last month.
Of their union, a source told HollywoodLife: "Bobbi and Nick were in the music section and then  all over the store. Bobbi was kissing him  on the mouth and holding hands. They were laughing and smiling and  seemed SO happy.”
Nick tweeted this picture of himself and Bobbi last week
Deciding to take to Twitter following the reports, Nick, who lived with Whitney since he was 12-years-old wrote: "Yea we got a little closer and what!!!"
Referring to Bobbi Kristina as "My Krissi", when telling his followers to follow her real account, the 22-year-old tweeted:
"Good morning everyone. Their lots of fake people pretending to be MY Krissi. The real one is @REALbkBrown. Fakes need to get un followed (sic)"
It is believed that Bobbi and Nick's romance may have started before Whitney passed away following the suggestive tweet Bobbi posted last November.
She wrote: "I love sleeping with big brudder (: only person that helps my insomnia B!! Hah (: #teamfamilia!”
