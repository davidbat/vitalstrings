Whitney Houston's final track, recorded just days before her death on Feb. 11, premiered Monday (May 21) on Ryan Seacrest's radio show . The song, "Celebrate," is a duet with Jordin Sparks from the pair's upcoming movie "Sparkle."
"'I celebrate YOU, you celebrate ME!' #Celebrate #Sparkle," Sparks tweets Monday , following her appearance on Seacrest's show.
Sparks performed "I Will Always Love You" as part of a tribute to Houston at Sunday's Billboard Music Awards before Houston's sister-in-law, Pat, and her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, took to the stage to accept Houston's Millenium Award from Billboard.
