Fox executives are moving forward with plans to make a sequel to the 1995 movie Waiting to Exhale despite the death of the film's star, Whitney Houston . "I don't think she would want it to" be dropped, Elizabeth Gabler, president of Fox 2000 Pictures, told Vulture yesterday . "It’s almost in her honor that we think to soldier on."
Fox picked up the film rights to Getting to Happy, the 2010 novel by Exhale author Terry McMillan, immediately upon its publication. As of yet, the movie is in the very early stages of production and doesn't have a finished script. Lori Lakin, a writer-producer for the VH1 show Single Ladies, has been working on a draft adapted from McMillan's book for the past year and a half.
Though Gabler entertained the thought of Exhale booster Oprah Winfrey inheriting the role from Houston, she was quick to point out they "literally have not talked about anybody for that part."
