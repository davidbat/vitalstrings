Whitney Houston will be returning to the big screen for the first time in years in the remake of the 1970′s classic movie “Sparkle.” Jordin Sparks and Tika Sumpter co-star beside Whitney who plays their mother.
Whitney’s previous movies include “The Preachers Wife” and “The Bodyguard.” She and Jordin sat down with “ET” where she says “I got a call from my partner Debra Martin and she said, ‘You’re not gonna believe this, but Sparkle‘s been picked up and they want to do a film.’
She was immediately down for the project!
Whitney and Jordin have a tender chemistry on camera. Whitney clearly adores Jordin. “She speaks for herself—the face, the smile, the innocence, the love for music, the love for singing.   Her personality just being Jordin and transferring that to Sparkle, it was not a hard transition” said Houston.
