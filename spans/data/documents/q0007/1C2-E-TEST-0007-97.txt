We’ve got the new trailer of Sparkle, the movie that the late Whitney Houston was hoping would reboot her career, right here on RadarOnline.com .
The film’s trailer premiered on Monday’s episode of Today. According to iMDb, its plot is about “three sisters [who] form a successful singing group, and must deal with the fallout of fame and drugs.”
Houston, who starred in 1992’s massively successful The Bodyguard , last appeared on the silver screen in 1996’s The Preacher's Wife.
Houston -- also an executive producer on the movie -- died February 11 , while the film was already in post-production.
The movie is a remake of the 1976 film, which starred Oscar-winning songwriter Irene Cara.
