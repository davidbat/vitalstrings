Acclaimed but troubled singer Whitney Houston passed away on Saturday, February 11, 2012 at the age of 48. The cause of death is yet to be determined, although reports have surfaced the Grammy-winning singer - who died at the Beverly Hilton Hotel just hours before Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party - may have drowned (she was found unresponsive in her hotel room's bathtub).
Months prior to her death, Houston had been involved in a comeback and had filmed a starring role in the TriStar Pictures musical, Sparkle.  The film was directed by Salim Akil and also features Jordin Sparks , Derek Luke , Mike Epps, Cee Lo Green, and Omari Hardwick , and was set to mark her return to acting following years off while she dealt with personal issues and her drug problem. In 1992, Houston starred in the dramatic musical, The Bodyguard , with Kevin Costner , followed by 1995's Waiting to Exhale and 1996's The Preacher's Wife, and was supposedly attached to star in the Waiting to Exhale sequel, Getting Happy, which is in development.
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter , Sparkle executive producer Howard Rosenman called Houston's performance in the film "brilliant." "I was just raving about [Whitney's] performance, she was so great in it. I'm just in shock," Rosenman told THR.
The official Sparkle synopsis:  "Musical prodigy, Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) struggles to become a star while overcoming issues that are tearing her family apart. From an affluent Detroit area and daughter to a single mother (Whitney Houston), she tries to balance a new romance with music manager, Stix (Derek Luke) while dealing with the unexpected challenges her new life will bring as she and her two sisters (Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter) strive to become a dynamic singing group during the Motown-era."
TriStar Pictures has set an August 17, 2012 release date for Sparkle.
