Whitney Houston’s last recording –  classic hymn “His Eye Is On The Sparrow” is released today ahead of the singer’s upcoming film, “Sparkle.”
“Sparkle,” a remake of the 1976 film of the same name, tells the story of three sisters who become Motown stars who have to deal with the pressures of fame. Houston plays Sparks’ mother.
The role was Houston’s comeback to the big screen after a 15-year hiatus from acting in movies like “The Bodyguard” and “The Preacher’s Wife”. It will be Sparks’ first leading movie role.
Check out the brand new single and let us know what you think!
