Sparkle Showtimes
The About face: Three sisters form a successful singing group and must deal with the fallout of fame and drugs.
The Wild side: Sparkle, in which Whitney Houston plays the mother of showbiz sisters, could have marked a big-screen comeback for the star who achieved overnight movie star success in 1992's The Bodyguard.
Sparkle was  completed filming last year, and is the late Whitney Houston's final film.
The Movie facts: Jordin Sparks stars as the lead character, Sparkle. (How weird is that... for a name so similar to the title of a movie?)
The movie is  a remake of the 1976 movie Sparkle, the showbiz saga of a trio of singers, which was loosely based on the career of The Supremes.
Whitney Houston's final recordings will be heard in the movie Sparkle.
Whitney Houston sings the gospel classic "Eyes on the Sparrow" and sings with Jordin Sparks on a new song, Celebrate, over the end credits.
