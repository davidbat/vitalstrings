Want to know what to watch at the theater? Celebuzz is breaking down the blockbusters in our Big Summer Movie Guide.
In this episode, we take a look at Whitney Houston in Sparkle. After her death in February, fans worried the movie may never be finished — but Whitney’s scenes had all been filmed at the time. The studio then moved up the release.
The movie also features new music from Whtiney, Jordin Sparks and Cee Lo Green !
Set in the 1960s, Sparkle looks at the Motown music wave that swept the nation. In the film, Jordin plays the title character who forms a band with her sisters, but their family bond is threatened by fame.

Whitney plays their over-protective mother who had big dreams of her own. We see an entirely different side of her than ever before as she’s transformed by the time-period costumes and makeup. She’s completely submerged herself in the role, looking nothing like the superstar the world remembers. It’s an amazing turn for the star, sadly marked by her untimely passing.
