This may be difficult to watch, but it will be nice to get one last opportunity to see Whitney on the big screen!
Last month, we got a first look at Whitney Houston in her upcoming movie Sparkle (above), and we were pleased to see that she was looking REALLY good. Sigh.
As we mentioned before, the movie is a remake of the 1976 film about a group of singing sisters.
Whitney had said the following about the movie at the time:
"Part of the fun of making this movie is definitely the costumes and the hairstyles. The movie is set in 1963, and we had a great wardrobe, hair and makeup person and I loved wearing the outfits."
We're so glad she had such a good time making the movie, and we're very happy to hear that Sony Pictures will be releasing Sparkle as planned on August 17th.
Here's what studio spokesman Steve Elzer had to say about it:
"Like all those who knew and loved her, we are shocked and saddened and the world has lost an incomparable talent. Right now our thoughts are with her daughter, her family and her friends."
And more from the movie's executive producer Howard Rosenman:
"This would have been a big, big comeback, she is so brilliant in it. I was just raving about her performance, she was so great in it. I'm just in shock."
We'll be sure to see this one as soon as it comes out . We have a feeling it will be a VERY crowded theaterâ€¦
