Dropbox Bans BitTorrent Startup Boxopus Over Piracy Concerns
Dropbox has banned the new BitTorrent startup Boxopus from accessing its API. The company fears that  BitTorrent's piracy stigma may rub off on the successful cloud storage service. The Boxopus team is disappointed by this anti-innovation move.  Thousands of dollars in developments costs  have gone down the drain for what they believe is an irrational fear imposed by a growing copyright lobby.
