There’s been a whole lot of talk about who would be great to portray Whitney Houston on film, but even one of the would be actresses suggested for the coveted role thinks it’s way too early to be talking about a Nippy biopic. Speaking with EBONY.com, actress Paula Patton says while she would love the challenge of playing Houston, she feels it’s a bit too soon to be mentioning her for the role.
EBONY: Your husband Robin Thicke mentioned that you should play Whitney Houston in a movie? How do you feel about that?
EBONY: He is so sweet to say that. Just thinking about that really shakes me up. Whitney is irreplaceable, and I would be honored to play her, but I think it is a bit early to talk about a movie right now. Her life was so incredible, and it would be a challenge to play that role, and I love a challenge. I have tremendous respect for Whitney, and her passing is still very saddening to me.
As for what she is working on:
PP: Right now, I am working on a new project called Disconnect, with Alex Skarsgard, and I also just signed on to do an independent movie called Broken, that I am also really excited about. It’s a romance between two people that are very broken and then come together to heal each other. Also that another thing that is really important to me is to produce my own films, not just for myself—but for other actresses. So I have two other movies that I am developing right now, and I am really excited about that for the future.  I will be producing these films, and although I respect directors, I do not feel that I am ready for that yet. I really just have so many ideas, and also coming from film school, I just love being a part of the creative process.
