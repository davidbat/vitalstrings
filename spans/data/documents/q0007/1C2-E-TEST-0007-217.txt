Megan's HOT. Too HOT to play Whitney. Plus, she can't sing and really is a D level actress. Houston was one of the greatest pop stars before the blow destroyed her. The story of her rise, fame, fortune, Bobby Brown, and then losing it all.
You know who could pull this off....J Hoilday. She's a good actress, we KNOW she can sing and she's got the body now. That's a better choice than a video hoochie (I luv her in thoise!).

Yes J. Holiday could pull it off, but I am looking for her to play A. Franklin. That is a good Challenge for her.
I still like 2010 Sunday Best Melinda or the sister who came in third place from NYC, Bklyn.
