For many years, I have admired you and followed the trend. I am so concerned about the state of things, I am praying for you to recover and bounce back with greater intensity. You are always on my mind. I believe in you. You may not know this, that you are my Miss World- the most beautiful lady and woman in the world. Your very best is about to be revealed. Your star will shine greater again. pls, draw closer to God and ask Him to help. As you are in pain, so am i. You are very dear to me. Shalom.
