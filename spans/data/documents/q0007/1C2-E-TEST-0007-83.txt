Tomorrow night at the Grammys, the only person on our minds will be Whitney Houston.
 
 
 
I cant believe this. Whitney was one of the most gifted talents on the planet. Jersey’s Princess!! My heart goes out to The Houston Fam!
 
 
 
I am so very sad to hear of Whitney Houston’s passing. She was one of our great artist that graced us all. May she rest in peace.
 
 
 
Wow. RIP Whitney Houston. Grew up on her. She contributed to the soundtrack of many of my 12-year old sleepover parties.
 
 
 
Just got out of mass & heard the tragic news about Whitney. Speechless.. Absolutely loved her… Just spoke with @RayJ about her yesterday!!
