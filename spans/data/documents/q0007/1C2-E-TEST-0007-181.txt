Should a Whitney Houston biopic ever come to pass, her daughter would like to be involved.
According to  TMZ.com , Bobbi Kristina wants to portray her mother in a movie in part because, she believes, no one knew the late singer better than she did.
Bobbi Kristina was reportedly cast in a recurring role for Tyler Perry's TBS sitcom "For Better or for Worse."
She'll likely have competition if a movie materializes. Rihanna has already voiced her desire to play Houston in a bio-pic.
