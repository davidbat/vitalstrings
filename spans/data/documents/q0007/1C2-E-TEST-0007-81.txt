One day away from the Grammy Awards, ABC News confirms that Whitney Houston , the one time mega-star of music and movies, has died at the age of 48.  Houston's own publicist, Kristen Foster, confirms her death but the details surrounding it are still a mystery.
For over 10 years, from the mid '80s to around 1997, Houston ruled the pop charts with hits like "I Wanna Dance with Somebody," "Greatest Love of All" and "I Will Always Love You," and the box office with films like The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale.
Since the late '90s however, Houston has been known for her tragic downward spiral at the hands of drugs, which ravaged both her voice and appearance and caused a decade's worth of erratic and off-putting behavior.  In her prime, Houston won two Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, 30 Billboard Music Awards, 22 American Music Awards during her record-breaking career.  She has sold 200 million albums worldwide.
