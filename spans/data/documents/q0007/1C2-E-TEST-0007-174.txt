She looks soooooooo healthy and FREE!! I am so happy for Whitney! I pray her voice comes back! That woman is TALENTED!
I am very disappointed that they would remake this film!!! How about writing their OWN classic. So many ideads YET they chose to be LAZY and remake other people’s CLASSIC work. I don’t like that and I will not watch it at all. And i don’t like the cast they selected 4 the roles anyways!!

LMAO @ “Michael Epps”!!! I love him, he putting on for our city (NAPTOWN, STAND UP!!) But everyone looks great, and I hope I can take him seriously as Satin because his character was so sinister, and Mike stay cracking jokes!!
