TriStar Pictures has released the first look of Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston in their forthcoming film ‘Sparkle.’ The movie’s mother-daughter duo are shown standing close together looking full of hope.
The photo appears to be shot in a dressing room scene with the two singers dressed in shimmering gowns. If we had to guess, Houston’s character is engaging Sparks in an intense conversation while standing in front of a mirror.
Although it’s said to have been inspired by the Supremes, the fictional film tells story of the Williams sisters, who become a successful girl group. However, the girls’ great success is also the cause of their downfall.
‘Sparkle’ is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name, and stars Sparks as the title character and Houston as her over-bearing mother, Effie. The role of Sparkle was originally given to Aaliyah before her untimely death.
However, Houston is more than impressed by Sparks’ performance. “I think she speaks for herself,” she says of the ‘ American Idol ‘ alum. “The face, the  smile, the innocence, the love for music, the love for singing —  transferring that into Sparkle it was not a hard transition because  Sparkle is willing to learn … as [Jordin] is now.”
‘Sparkle’ is set to hit theaters on Aug. 10, and will also star Mike Epps, Cee Lo Green , Omari Hardwick, Tika Sumpter, Derek Luke and Carmen Ejogo.
