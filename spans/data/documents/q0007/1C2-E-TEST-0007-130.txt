Hundreds of people lined up on Martin Luther King Boulevard this evening, gathering nearby the Whigham Funeral Home in Newark, New Jersey while those closest to Whitney Houston - including her daughter and mother, who exited a limo holding hands - held a wake for the late artist.
This private memorial precedes tomorrow's funeral Houston, which is scheduled for noon EST.
It will be held at New Hope Baptist Church and has been the subject of controversy all week, with Bobby Brown not cleared by his former in-laws to attend until the last moment ; and with Governor Chris Christine ordering flags to be flown at half-staff .
With Whitney's cousin, Dionne Warwick, and former co-star, Kevin Costner, scheduled to speak at the invitation-only funeral, the guest list also includes:
Forest Whitaker
