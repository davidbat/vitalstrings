Fox is planning to go forward with the "Waiting to Exhale" sequel, despite the unexpected death of Whitney Houston . "I don't think she would want it to," Elizabeth Gabler, president of Fox 2000 Pictures, said in an interview with Vulture. "It's almost in her honor that we think to soldier on."
A week after author Terry McMillan published "Getting to Happy" in early September of 2010, Fox bought the rights to the "Waiting to Exhale" sequel. Once the shock of Houston's death wears off, Gabler thinks conversations about a replacement will begin. She says that Oprah Winfrey , who has been promoting the film might have an interest. She says, "We literally have not talked about anybody for that part.  Forest, I know, is just ... grieving. He'd been the one who was speaking  with her, updating [Houston] on its progress."
Vulture also reports that Warner Bros. will receive a package today (Feb. 14) with the new script of a remake of Houston's big-screen hit, "The Bodyguard," which producer Dan Lin has changed by adding a U.S. Army special forces commando back from Iraq.
