Whitney Houston ’s final movie, Sparkle, originally positioned as a huge comeback role for the singer-actress before her shocking death on Saturday, is scheduled to be released as planned in August.
The film will include the final songs ever recorded by Houston, reports Billboard.
“Like all those who knew and loved her, we are shocked and saddened and the world has lost an incomparable talent,” read a statement from Sony Pictures, the studio behind the project.
