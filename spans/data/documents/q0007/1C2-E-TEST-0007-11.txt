Whitney Houston is planning to make her return to the big screen with Sparkle, a remake of a 1976 musical loosely based on the story of the Supremes. Houston, who has not starred in a Hollywood movie since 1996's The Preacher's Wife, is in talks to join a cast that already includes American Idol winner Jordin Sparks and comedian Mike Epps.

If Houston takes the part, she would play the skeptical and unsupportive mother of the three main characters, who pursue success in R&B after discovering a love of singing in a Harlem church choir. It's unclear whether or not Houston will sing in the movie.
