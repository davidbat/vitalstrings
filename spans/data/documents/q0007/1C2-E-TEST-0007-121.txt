My God!! What a thrill to hear the beautiful voice of my Diva Whitney!! I could not contain my tears!! The funny thing is that they are not tears of sadness. What I feel when I see and hear Whitney is a tight squeeze in my heart of longing without end. Whitney had no idea of ​​the size of the love we feel for her, but God wanted it that way because the love he has for her is far greater than ours. I'm sure when I'll cry a lot Sparkle watch the movies, but it will be tears of joy for having had the privilege of having lived a generation Whitney Houston. Whitney I love you, Angel of Love!!
