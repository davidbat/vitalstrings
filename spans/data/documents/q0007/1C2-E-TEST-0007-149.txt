Whitney Houston is set to return to the big screen with a role in the forthcoming remake of the 1976 music movie Sparkle.
The Salim Akil-helmed remake will star American Idol winner Jordin Sparks and Houston will have a supporting role in the film, which is based on the story of The Supremes, reports the Guardian .
Houston made her film debut in 1992’s The Bodyguard but her brief film career came to an end with 1996 movie The Preacher’s Wife. She hasn’t acted on the big screen in 15 years. Sparkle will see her as Sparks’ mother, who is wary of her daughter pursuing a career in the music industry after being spotted in a gospel choir in Harlem, New York.
