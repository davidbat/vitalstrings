This album is set for release in Spring 2007, and from the few samples that the DJ elite have been dropping in their sets of late it's set to be quite a project.
As well as all this, Commix tracks and remixes are also appearing on Subtitles, Horizons Music, Dispatch and others, and their DJ sets are becoming hugely in demand across the globe, as trips across Europe, North America and the UK hold testament.
