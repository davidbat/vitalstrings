MUMBAI:                      Argentina's Hernan Crespo and Italy's World Cup winning ex-captain                      Fabio Cannavaro were the biggest draw at the iconic players                      auction for the newly franchise-based soccer league, Premier                      League Soccer.
Crespo                      was snapped up by Barasat franchise for his base price of                      $840,000, while Cannavaro went to Siliguri franchise for $830,000,                      which is $50,000 more than his base price of $780,000.
French                      player Robert Pires was bought by the Howrah franchise for                      $800,000 on a base price of $715,000, while English player                      Robbie Fowler and Nigeria's Jay Jay Okocha were bought by                      Kolkata and Durgapur franchises for $530,000 and $550,000                      respectively.
While                      Fowler, who had a base price of $450,000, was subject to a                      bidding war between Kolkata and Durgapur, Okocha went to Durgapur                      for his base price.
Although                      the league was expected to feature six teams, the Haldia franchise,                      which is the sixth team, is yet to find an owner and the organisers                      are in the process of finding a new owner. But the organisers                      maintained that they were in talks with two parties who would                      be unveiled soon.
Altogether                      five iconic foreign players besides 10 overseas foreign players                      and five Asian players went under the hammer alongwith five                      coaches.
Among                      the five foreign players, Kolkata franchise bought Robert                      Egbeta (Nigeria) for $350,000, while Howrah took Jose Gabriel                      Rios (Bolivia) for $ 1,80,000. Santino Quaranta (USA) went                      to Siliguri franchise for $180,000, Jose Carlos Castillo (Guatemala)                      to Durgapur franchise for $80,000 and Chirstian Lara (Ecuador)                      to Barasat for $200,000.
The                      coaches for the five franchises are: Kolkata - Peter Reid                      for $200,000; Howrah - Fernando Couto for $240,000; Siliguri                      - Marco Etcheverry for $200,000; Durgapur - Samson Siasia                      for $210,000; and Barasat - Teitur Thordorson for $210,000.
The                      organisers have fixed a financial cap of $2.5 million on how much each franchise can spend every season, which means that                      franchises who have spent lavishly on iconic & overseas                      players and have exhausted half their financial purse will                      have to utilise their remaining purse smartly to complete                      their squads.
The                      bids for the Indian players will take place on 7 February.
