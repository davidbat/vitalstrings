(Poster perfect boys (AFP) )
A list of the suave, sexy and sensational football hunks who are going to set your hearts racing in a week's time.
Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)
This 25-year-old is the highest-paid football player in the world. His awesome looks make him immensely drool-worthy. But he is a man who likes change. After dumping socialite Kim Kardashian , there are rumours that he's getting close to Paris Hilton (the two are texting and meeting up occasionally). Rumours also suggested that she was a distraction for Ronaldo during Real Madrid's game with Malaga recently.
Fernando Torres (Spain)
He believes in commitment - be it to his game or to his partner. With his kind of charismatic personality, Fernando Torres could have had his share of romantic relationships, but he chose to be devoted to one woman - Olalla Dom√≠nguez Liste. After courting her for eight years, the two tied the knot last May. He is the father of 10-month-old Nora. Eat your heart out, girls.
Ricardo Kaka (Brazil)
Ricardo Kaka is married to Caroline Celico and the two have a son (Lucas Celico Leite). But that doesn't stop women from fancying him. Kaka is a true sportsman - a gentleman in an aggressive sport. He also knows how to use his aggression to the hilt - on the field.
Lionel Messi has taken over from where Diego Maradona left off, making critics compare him with the likes of the legendary soccer star. Cute looks coupled with great performance, he's a fave with most girls.
Cesc Fabregas (Spain)
Ladies love to call him sexy Cesc. With a perfectly chiselled physique complemented by a great smile, Cesc doesn't have to try too hard to woo the fairer sex. At 23, he is already a poster boy for his national team, which won Euro 2008. He is aiming for the World Cup now. Given his age, concerns have often been raised over the large number of games he has played for his club and country in the last few seasons. But then, who wants to see him MIA? Not us!
Fabio Cannavaro (Italy)
Among the many charming faces that Italy boasts, the one that is tops has to be captain Fabio Cannavaro. The star player, who led Italy to victory in 2006, is at it again. Whether he shaves his head or sports long locks, Fabio is easily the coolest guy around. A captain who holds the team together, a player whom opponents dread and a man of substance, he's got the ladies drooling alright.
Steven Gerrard (England)
Tall, handsome and a great player. That's a lethal combo. At 30, this could be Steven's last World Cup. Steven is also the world's best midfielder and is desperate for a win this year. He is also hoping that his fans in South Africa will take him closer to his dreams.
Raul Albiol (Spain)
His team is among the favourites to win the World Cup, and he's the team's hot property. Raul Albiol is only 24, but already a father of two. With his boy-next-door looks, Raul connects instantly with the crowd and can turn the cheers in his favour, no matter how strong the opponent is.
