The operation lasted a half hour and Cannavaro was calm and smiling afterward, the Italian football federation said.
Cannavaro tore ligaments in Italy's first training session at the European Championship on Monday.
The operation was performed at Pelikangasse private clinic in Vienna under the supervision of Italy team physician Andrea Ferretti, with assistance by another Italian doctor and Real Madrid's physician.
Cannavaro opted to have the surgery in Vienna so he can remain with Italy's squad at the tournament. After a few post-operation tests, he was expected to return to the team hotel Wednesday evening.
