Final push for Cannavaro
By Football Italia staff
Napoli captain Paolo Cannavaro is fighting to prove his fitness for Sunday’s Coppa Italia Final against Juventus.
The defender is struggling with a rib issue, but he has a chance of recovering in time for the Stadio Olimpico clash.
“I absolutely want to be there,” the stopper told Radio Marte. “The pain is slowly disappearing thanks to the work of the medical staff.
“We haven’t won a trophy for 25 years and we have all of the ingredients at our disposal to play a great game. I’m calm about it.”
Juventus will start the tie as favourites after winning the Scudetto thanks to an unbeaten League campaign.
They drew 3-3 with Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in the League, before comfortably disposing of them in Turin with a 3-0 scoreline.
“Juventus were the strongest team in the championship,” Cannavaro, brother of former Juve defender Fabio, added.
“However, anything can happen in a one-off game.
“I want to follow in the footsteps of Antonio Juliano, the last Neapolitan captain to lift a trophy in the air.”
