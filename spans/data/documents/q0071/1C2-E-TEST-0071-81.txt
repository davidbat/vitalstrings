Injectie Cannavaro schokt Italie
29 april 2005
ANP
ROME - Fabio Cannavaro heeft de Italiaanse voetbalwereld in              verlegenheid gebracht. De staatszender RAI vertoonde beelden waarop              is te zien hoe de Italiaanse international op 11 mei 1999, aan de              vooravond van de finale van de UEFA Cup tegen Olympique Marseille,              een injectie van de clubarts van Parma krijgt.
Daarin zat het medicijn neoton , een herstelmiddel voor              hartpatiÃ«nten. Overigens stond het middel, dat tegenwoordig niet              meer in de handel is, niet op de dopinglijst. Cannavaro nam de              beelden zelf op. Toen hij deze week lucht van de uitzending kreeg,              probeerde hij die te verhinderen met de dreiging van gerechtelijke              stappen.
De tegenwoordige speler van Juventus liet zich in het programma              Punto a capo uiteindelijk verdedigen door zijn advocaat. Volgens de              speler is de bewuste tape bij hem weggenomen. Of de beelden gevolgen              hebben voor Cannavaro, is onduidelijk. Juventus, zijn huidige club,              heeft nog niet gereageerd.

Veron in Cannavaro video
Reuters
April 29, 2005
Argentina and Inter Milan midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron said he appeared        in the film in which his former Parma team mate Fabio Cannavaro is seen        using a drip on the eve of the 1999 UEFA Cup final.
"You can see me, I was in the room," Veron told an Argentine radio        station. "But you can't see that I did anything."
The film, shown on Italian state broadcaster RAI Due's current affairs        programme "Full Stop and From the Top", shows Cannavaro, then a Parma        player, relaxing in his hotel room the evening before the UEFA Cup final        against Olympique Marseille in Moscow which the Italian club won 3-0.
The Italian international, who now plays for Juventus, is shown inserting        a drip into his arm which his lawyer confirmed contained Neoton, a drug        used in cardiac surgery to protect the heart that is not on the World Anti        Doping Agency's list of banned substances.
Veron said Neoton use is common. "It's used when there are a lot of        matches in a short space of time and it helps you recover more quickly,"        he said.
"We had just played the final of the Italian Cup, I think it was two or        three days earlier, plus there was the journey to Russia. Some players        decided to make use of this, which is also something the doctor knows        about."
Veron, who is now on the books of English premier league side Chelsea but        has been on loan to Inter Milan all season, added: "All the teams use it.       "It is something that is used and has been used and to do so is firstly a        decision of the player and then the doctor."
He said the video did not make pleasant viewing.       "It doesn't look good because you see when the doctor pricks his arm and        it's not something which is nice to see. Also, the television puts on that        background music and a whole ambiance which has nothing to do with it."

Uefa Cup: Questions plague troubled Parma

International Herald Tribune
SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 2005
PARMA, Italy On Thursday night, as Parma continued its unlikely              march in the competition that has brought the club its greatest              glory, nasty and familiar questions were being raised over the team              that won the second of Parma's two UEFA Cups.
Parma, a previously undistinguished club, rose to join the cream of              European soccer in the 1990s. From 1992 to 1999, it won the UEFA Cup              twice, the Cup Winners Cup, now folded into the UEFA Cup, once and              the Italian Cup twice.
On Thursday night, immediately after Parma limped to a dreary 0-0              draw with visiting CSKA Moscow in the first leg of a UEFA Cup              semifinal, RAI, the state broadcaster, showed a program that              suggested that those years of milk and honey contained a nasty              artificial additive.
The seven fat years might have been artificially beefed as more than              just billions of Parmalat lire were being pumped into the team.
The program showed a home video, reportedly made by one of the              players. It was shot on the eve of the 1999 UEFA Cup final against              Marseille in a suite at the Marriott Hotel in Moscow that had been              turned into a treatment room. The faces of the players were              obscured, as in a police reality show, but not for the critical              sequence, involving a syringe and a well-muscled arm. After reports              about the program in Thursday morning's Italian newspapers, Fabio              Cannavaro, the captain of the Italian national team, had outed              himself as the man receiving the needle. In the show his face was              shown as he made two ecstatic, but almost certainly tongue-in-cheek,              groans, like a junkie welcoming a hit.
"Look what we're reduced to before the UEFA Cup final," Cannavaro is              heard saying. "I'm 25 years old and they're killing me." It might              reasonably be asked why any team doctor or professional athlete in              their right mind would allow themselves to be filmed injecting  drugs.
"It was a mockery and Cannavaro was even joking," Paolo Trofino,              Cannavaro's lawyer, said in the studio debate after the video was              shown.
The question still applies: Why would any sane team doctor or              professional athlete make a spoof video in which they pretend to              inject drugs? But the midnight motorbike adventures of two Greek              sprinters, and the bizarre attempts by Hungarian throwers and              weightlifters to beat doping tests with urine-filled rubber balls in the Athens Olympics last year, show one thing. Whatever it is that              drugs enhance, it isn't intelligence.
The video showed one of the Parma staff opening a package of Neoton,              a creatine phosphate used as a heart drug. This is where the              problems really begin, as those participating in the studio debate              were quick to point out.
Trofeo, covering his bets, said Cannavaro had been receiving a              "muscle reconstituent, a regenerator." He also pointed out that              Neoton is not banned.
Creatine is not a banned              substance. The World Anti-Doping Agency says there is no evidence              that it enhances athletic performance.
However, just because it isn't on the WADA list does not mean that              it is not harmful to athletes and thus illegal in Italy. That              argument is still running.
Others argued that there was no evidence that Neoton was in the              syringe. So was this a case of "Drugs, lies and videotape?"
The timing of the broadcast was doubly appropriate. First, and              obviously, it was immediately after Parma played and therefore at a              time when most of those people who still care about the fallen giant              would most likely be in front of their televisions. Second, it came              the day after the latest development in the investigation of              Juventus, the perennial Italian power, for administering a              pharmacopoeia of substances to its players in the 1990s.
Italian prosecutors, struck by the large number of early deaths              among Italian athletes, have been investigating drugs in Italian              sport. Unsurprisingly, the high-profile Giro d'Italia bicycle race              and high-profile Juventus became the focus of investigations. Last              November, after a six-year investigation, Raffaele Guariniello, a              Turin prosecutor, nailed Dr. Riccardo Agricola, who was found guilty              of "sporting fraud." An expert witness in the trial described              finding 281 different drugs at the team's training headquarters.
The Italian Olympic Committee asked the Court of Arbitration in              Sport if it could strip Juve of trophies it won between 1994 and              1998 for administering drugs that were not banned. On Wednesday, the              court ruled in Juve's favor. But because the list of substances in              the case includes banned substances, the club is not in the clear              yet.
One of those lobbying for Juve to be stripped of its titles is              Gianfranco Zola. The tiny genius stands to benefit. The club he              played for finished second to Juve in Serie A in 1995. The club?              Parma, of course.
Two years later, Parma finished second to Juve again, this time by              one point. Late that season, Parma dropped two points against Torino              in the Stadio Delle Alpi in Turin in a match that still fills Parma              fans with a sense of injustice.
Pierluigi Collina, the best-known Italian referee, disallowed what              would have been the only goal of the game. The would-be scorer was              Cannavaro. He has since won his Serie A title - as a Juventus  player.
The debate in the RAI studio, involving lawyers, professors of              pharmacology and distinguished journalists, developed into a rowdy              shouting match and offered far more passion and entertainment than              the game that had preceded it.
If there is a drug that has the opposite effect of steroids, it has              been administered to the UEFA Cup and to Parma. Both are only              emaciated shadows of what they were in 1999.
Parma lies 19th in the 20-team Serie A. With five matches to go, it              is in severe danger of finishing in the last three places and              slipping down to Serie B for the first time since 1990.
Even though it is only three games from winning the UEFA Cup, Parma              on Thursday fielded only two regular starters, one of whom, Giuseppe              Cardone, was replaced early in the second half.
"Serie A comes first for us," said Pietro Carmignani, the Parma              coach, adding that his few stars would also miss the trip to Moscow.
CSKA Moscow, which is in position to become the first Russian club              to win a European trophy, left its star striker, the Brazilian              Vagner Love, on the bench until the second half.
The game drew less than 8,000. The tiny CSKA contingent, huddled              together on the vast sweep of the southern "curve," could, as the              soccer song goes, have come in a taxi.
The fans who stayed away knew what they were doing. Two of Parma's              three previous home games in the competition this year have ended              0-0. The third was a 1-0 Parma victory.
"I think it is the first time I have seen a game with so few              chances," said Valery Gazzayev, the CSKA coach.
When Igor Akinfeyev of CSKA leapt to his left to parry a shot by              Fabio Vignaroli in the 83rd minute, it was the first, and last,              difficult save either goalie had to make all night.
Thursday's other semifinal game produced a relative feast of goals.              Sporting, which has the incentive of knowing that the final will be              in its Alvalade Stadium, beat visiting AZ Alkmaar, 2-1, in Lisbon.
Sporting dominated the game but fell behind in the 36th minute, when              Denny Landzaat gave the Dutch team the lead. Rodolph Douala scored              the leveling goal in the 37th minute and Mauricio Pinilla blasted              the winner 11 minutes from the end. The game drew 34,776 in a              stadium that holds 52,000.

Cannavaro will keep Italy captaincy

May 1, 2005
Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro will keep the Italy                          captaincy despite being embroiled in a drugs storm.
"It certainly wasn't nice to see a player attached to a                          drip, but Cannavaro has always given his heart and soul                          for the Nazionale and will remain as captain," explained                          Federation President Franco Carraro.
The Juventus defender was seen being injected with legal                          substance Neoton the night before Parma's 1999 UEFA Cup                          Final against Olympique Marseille, as a video made by                          the player was anonymously handed over to State                          television RAI.
"I can say that international sport needs clear rules on                          substances and what kind of behaviour is considered                          acceptable," continued Carraro.
"The fact that perfectly healthy athletes are taking                          medicine does make you think. We need new legislation to                          stop this from carrying on and a debate that will ensure                          there are not so many loopholes. The rules are one thing                          and an ethical stance is another."
