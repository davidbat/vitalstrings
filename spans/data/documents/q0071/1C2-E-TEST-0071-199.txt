This year the FIFA world player of the year award has been given to the World Cup Champion Italy’s Captain Fabio Cannavaro. Votes were casted for this category, in which most of the votes named Cannavaro giving him the win for FIFA Player of the Year Award. Earlier the Real Madrid central defender Cannavaro has been crowned as the European Footballer of the Year, in November. All the national team coaches and captains voted him. Cannavaro beat the three-time winner Zinedine Zidane and the reigning champion Ronaldinho to become the new FIFA Player of the Year. Brazil’s Marta won the women’s award ahead of Germany’s Renate Lingor and Kristine Lilly of the USA. Cannavaro said: It’s a great honour for me to be here, because it has been an incredible season. The competition is scary, so strong. It’s not usual for a defender to sit between Ronaldinho and Zidane. I can’t ask for anything else, with the World Cup and Golden Ball award – you can’t do any better than that. Cannavaro may look forward to the upcoming year for more challenges to face and to make his own destiny in the world of football. He should keep up the same momentum and confidence, which can be of more use further.
