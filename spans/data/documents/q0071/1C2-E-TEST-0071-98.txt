I would have married Fabio anyway, no matter what was his job or where. It doesn't matter that he is a world known footballer. I love him because of his essence as a human being.
Daniela Arenoso , on her love and marriage to Fabio Cannavaro [5]
Talking about Fabio's height is the same as talking about the fog in Milan.I have never felt that he is short when I play with him,because he can jump higher than anybody else. He is always good at heading. It doesn't make any sense talking about Cannavaro like that.
Alessandro Nesta , on Fabio Cannavaro's height [6]
Cannavaro has that unmistakable presence as a leader and in my impression, is exactly like that tough and cool-headed defense he shows on the pitch.
Iker Casillas , when asked to describe Cannavaro after joining Real Madrid [7]
I can't choose just one! Real Madrid only has great players. Raul, David Beckham , Ruud van Nistelrooy , Ronaldo... The one that impressed me the most after having actually played together is Cannavaro. He's sturdy and lithe and his attitude when he faces a match is exceptional too. I think he's the best center-back in the world.
