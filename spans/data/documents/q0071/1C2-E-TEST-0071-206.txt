I think Howard takes it and if not him than it's gotta be Bradley.  Dempsey/ donvovan will be too old and not for sure starters every game at that point. Hell who knows if boca will even still be capt. in 2014. I know we don't have options now but look where we were a year ago with outside backs and now we have two or  three options in Johnson, lichaj and chandler
