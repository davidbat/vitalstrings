Match Report
 
This was the last match for Hungarian   referee Sandor Puhl, who was retiring at 45 after a long career marked by both   distinction and controversy in which he presided over five other England   matches.  He earned his FIFA badge in 1988 and   refereed the 1994 World Cup final match between Italy and Brazil in Los   Angeles.  By then he had taken charge of two England matches, the   scoreless draw with France in Sweden at the 1992 European Championship and the   2-0 loss to Norway in Oslo in 1993 that virtually put an end to England's   hopes of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup finals.  After refereeing one   of the long string of England friendlies leading up to the 1996 European   Championship, the 3-1 win against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium in 1995, he handled two crucial Wembley matches, the 1996 European   Championship semi-final, when England drew 1-1 with Germany but went out on penalty kicks, and the   1-0 loss to Italy in early 1997, England's first defeat at home in a   World Cup qualifier.  But in December, 1997 UEFA suspended Puhl for the remainder of   the season because of his performance in a European   Champions' League match between Feyenoord and Manchester United.  UEFA   said he "failed to inflict the appropriate sanction" after Paul   Bosvelt felled United's Irish international defender Denis Irwin with a lunge   to the knee during the match in Rotterdam on November 5, 1997.  It   noted he had seen the incident but failed to take any action beyond giving a   free kick and did not even mention it in his match report.
