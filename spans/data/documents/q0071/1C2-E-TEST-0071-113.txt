Organizers obviously let the FIFA referees do their scouting for them.

some strange choices.  rooney uglier than ribery?  huh???  rooney ain't ugly.  cannavaro's defo nice on the eyes but I wouldn't put him in the #1 spot.  somewhere on the 1st list I'd put bocanegra and feilhaber.  And where the hell is Gourcuff???  Hello???  And the very gorgeous Gabriel Heinze???  Higuain??  Gignac??  Honestly!  People!

I think they are confusing beautiful with famous (or maybe high-profile). I bet they had a series of photos that people voted for… and whoever set up the poll doesn't actually watch football so has no idea about players like Gourcuff.
And Donovan and Cavani? Ugh indeed.

Im perplexed as to why Donovan and David James(!!!!!) even made this list! What about  Justo Villar? Iker Casillas? Simone Pepe is kinda hot in a Jason Stratham kinda way. And Roque Santa Cruz for petes sake! Gotta agree with Cannavaro though. The man is BEAUTIFUL

WTH?! What is Didier Drogba doing on the top 10 hotties list? Landon Donovan? Errr, no. Keisuke Honda and David James?! What about Justo Villar, Roque Santa Cruz, Casillas??!! And as far as the not-so-attractive list … not all of them deserve to be there either. Dont know who was voting …. clearly they got it all wrong.

Gourcuff, Gabriel Heinze, Iker Casillas, Frank Lampard, Bocengra, Diego Forlan should have been there..
NOT Drogba, Henry, DAVID JAMES (!!!!)
