FILE - In this Sunday, July 9, 2006 file photo, France's Zinedine Zidane, left, looks on after butting Italy's Marco Materazzi, on ground, in the chest as Italy's Fabio Cannavaro, right, reacts during extra time in the final of the soccer World Cup between Italy and France in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. — Four years after reaching the World Cup final, Italy's Azzurri and France's Les Bleus appear to have a bad case of the blues just days ahead of their opening matches.
