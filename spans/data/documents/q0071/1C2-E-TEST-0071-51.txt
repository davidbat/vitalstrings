Italy's World Cup-winning captain, Fabio Cannavaro, has admitted it's been a dream season, after he was named FIFA World Player of the Year on Monday during a ceremony in Zurich.
The 33-year-old Real Madrid defender beat off competition from Barcelona and Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho and retired former France skipper Zinedine Zidane in a vote cast by national team coaches and captains.
Captain Cannavaro, the first defender to win the trophy in its 16-year history, adds the honour to the prestigious European Footballer of the Year award he received from France's Football magazine last month.
