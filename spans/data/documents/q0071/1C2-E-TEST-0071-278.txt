United willing to pay £35 million for Cannavaro
Manchester United are prepared to pay Parma AC £35 million for Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro.
Parma beat off interest from AS Roma and SS Lazio throughout the summer for their star centre back but now United are willing to meet every cash demand made by the player and his club to pair the centre back with young England defender Wes Brown and French veteran Laurent Blanc.
The move for Cannavaro has been building for the past two years and United have constantly monitored the young Neopolitan's future with Parma.
United also want AS Roma coach Fabio Capello as their new manager and Capello was desperate for his club to sign Cannavaro in June.
Talks broke down after a £35 million move was agreed and the price suddenly raised which angered Roma president Franco Sensi.
Lazio then went into protracted attempts to lure Cannavaro to them without success.
The player saw his defensive partner Lilian Thuram leave Parma for Juventus in the summer and Juventus are also interested in Cannavaro. They would rival any bid from United but Parma are winning to hand all of their best defenders to Juve after the sale of Thuram and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wanted to sign Thuram for the English champions but the United board ruled the 29 year old player as too expensive but Cannavaro is the right age to command a British record transfer fee.
Ferguson wants to strengthen a defence which has been conceding large numbers of goals in the Premiership.
