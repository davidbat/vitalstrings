In stark contrast, Slovakia's mostly journeymen players, battled, ran and harried for every ball. They were far more concise in their passing and support play and, prompted by Marek Hamsik, who is with Napoli, played with a belief Italy lacked.
Robert Vittek took both his goals superbly, and Miroslav Stoch and Jan Durica more than matched the accomplished Gennaro Gattuso and Daniele De Rossi in their midfield duels.
To their credit, Italy did not go down without a fight, battling back from 2-0 and then 3-1 down to reduce the arrears and Fabio Quagliarella scored with a fabulous chip in injury time to keep Italy's lingering hopes alive.
The match brought to a close Lippi's second spell as Italy coach and also saw the end of the international careers of Cannavaro and Gennaro Gattuso after the trio said this would be their last tournament with the national side.
Lippi will be succeeded by Cesare Prandelli, who has left Fiorentina to toake over, but the new coach is unlikely to be able to mould a world-beating team in the foreseeable future.
On the evidence of the last week or so, Italy's young guns have yet to reach the level of the older generation.
Unless Prandelli unearths some major young talent for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign which starts later this year, Italy could well be struggling for some time to come.
