Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro—World's best player in 2006—is set to miss the European Championship this summer after suffering an ankle injury due to a collision with Giorgio Chiellini during the Italian team's preparations in Austria.
Italy Chances Suffer Blow
Italy will surely miss Cannavaro, the captain, the defensive line leader, and the international star. Cannavaro was to partner Marco Materazzi in the Italian defense. This injury will give Palermo defender Andrea Barzagli the chance of partnering Materazzi in the starting eleven.
Who will be Cannavaro's replacement?
With Cannavaro out of Roberto Donadoni's list, a player is set to replace the Real Madrid defender. The likes of Alessandro Gamberini and Daniele Bonera are thought to be favorites to replace Cannavaro.
 What if Nesta is recalled?
It would be beautiful to see Alessandro Nesta back for one last run in the Azzuri defense after hanging his international boots following Italy's World Cup in 2006.
However, it is highly unlikely that Donadoni would give Nesta the chance to return to the national squad while other faces who have helped in the qualification process and have been in-form hoping to get the call are left out.
Whatever Donadoni’s decision will be, Italy has suffered a huge blow that will weaken the team in its Euro bid, where they will particpate in the death group of the first round. Group C features Netherlands, France, Romania, and Italy.
