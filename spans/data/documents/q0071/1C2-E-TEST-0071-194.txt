New Delhi, Feb 23  (IANS) Former England and Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler Thursday raised doubts on the future of India’s much awaited Premier League Soccer (PLS), which was postponed Wednesday due to the unavailability of venues.
Fowler is one of the semi-retired world stars hired to play in the lucrative six-team league in West Bengal. The 35-year-old Fowler has been bought by one of the franchises for $530,000.
Former Argentina star Hernan Crespo, Italy’s World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Frenchman Robert Pires were among the players who were auctioned to play for the teams.
“Ah well.. India looks like its cancelled, boots are clean and looking for a new place to play,” wrote Fowler.
The PLS was scheduled to kick-off February 25 but was put off until March 24. But against earlier this week it was put off indefinitely apparently after the state government refused to release ground unless details of the tournament’s finances ere made clear by the organisers.
The tournament was being jointly promoted by Celebrity Management Group (CMG) and Indian Football Association (IFA), the ruling body of the sport in the state.
The All India Football Federation (AIFF), the apex body of the sport in the country, have also banned its national players from taking part in the league.
The tournament was scheduled to be held in Kolkata and district towns of Howrah, Durgapur, Siliguri, Barasat and Haldia.
