Al-Ahli have announced the signing of Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro who, I’m sure, has joined the cash-rich Dubai-based club for purely footballing reasons.
Cannavaro, a former World Player of the Year, looked set to be heading into the upcoming World Cup as a free-agent after failing to agree upon a new contract with Juventus.
The 36-year-old centre-back is believed to have turned down offers from a wide range of clubs, including West Ham and a host of Italian sides, to sign a two-year contract with the defending UAE league champions.
In an update on Al-Ahli’s official website, club chairman Abdullah Al Nabooda announced;
“We announce that we have signed 2006 FIFA World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro for two years.
This deal with a player like Cannavaro is one of the most important deals for us because he’s a player with great experience and talent, while he’s also a leader on the field as he led Italy to win the 2006 FIFA World Cup title.”
Cannavaro, who has announced he is to retire from international football after Italy’s involvement in South Africa, also issued a small statement on Al-Ahli’s website – revealing his love for Dubai was the main reason he chose to end his career in the UAE;
“I’m happy to sign for Al Ahli,” he said. “I always thought of moving to live in Dubai as I love it and I have achieved my dream by moving to Dubai and play for one of its big clubs like Al Ahli.”
