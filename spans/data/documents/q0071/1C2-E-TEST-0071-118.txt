Juventus Ultras Start Anti-Fabio Cannavaro Protests In Pinzolo
‘Canna’ should brace himself for a hostile reaction when he arrives in Pinzolo on Thursday
Juventus have gathered in Val Rendena this week to start pre-season training and the fans have traveled in flocks to watch Diego’s first steps in the Bianconeri’s world.
But La Stampa reports that the Ultras groups seem more interested in keeping up their anti-Fabio Cannavarocampaign, even though the Italy captain will only join the squad on Thursday.
“Real Madrid dumped you, Napoli repudiated you, only your greed brought you back here,” read one of several banners displayed during yesterday’s training session.
Cannavaro re-joined the Old Lady on a free transfer from Real Madrid last month, amid widespread protests from a large section of fans who called him a traitor when he left the club in the wake of the Calciopoli scandal in the summer of 2006.
The Viking group has also started circulating a t-shirt saying “Cannavaro mercenary” on the front and “No forgiveness for traitors” on the back.
“That’s a hit,” claimed a Viking representative. “We will abuse Cannavaro, no matter what. He should not have returned.
“And he is not even shrewd: he said he would have loved to join Napoli. We will protest against him in a civil way. Two matches won’t be enough to forget.”
