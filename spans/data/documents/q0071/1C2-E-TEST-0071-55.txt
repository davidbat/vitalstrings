[ edit ] Club career
Cannavaro made his professional debut for his hometown side S.S.C. Napoli during the 1998–99 season in Serie A , while he was 15 years old.
The following season he was signed by Parma , playing alongside his older brother Fabio Cannavaro in his first season at the club. In fact, Paolo's debut for Parma came when he replaced his brother as a substitute in Parma's 4–1 victory against Lecce .
Verona took the player on loan during the 2001–02 season, Cannavaro turned out 25 times for the club, scoring his first professional goal. The successive year he returned to Parma where he spent much of the time as a substitute for the following two seasons (2002–2003, 2003–2004). During the 2004–2005 season, Cannavaro became more active in the first team at Parma, making 24 appearances scoring 4 goals from defence.
As Napoli were promoted back into Serie B , and were building a squad with potential, Cannavaro was brought back to his first club, where he currently remains. [1]
