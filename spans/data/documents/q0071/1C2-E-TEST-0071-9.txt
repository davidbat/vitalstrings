Italy 's captain, Fabio Cannavaro, has failed a drug test. The Italian Olympic Committee's (Coni) anti-doping prosecutor, Ettore Torri, has opened an investigation although Cannavaro's club Juventus have said it was the result of cortisone being used to treat a bee sting.
Cannavaro, who helped Italy win the World Cup in Berlin three years ago, was already suspended for the country's World Cup qualifier with Ireland on Saturday. But he is expected to join the team for Wednesday's game against Cyprus.
Coni would not say when Cannavaro tested positive, but said Torri would hold a hearing with the defender and the physician involved in the case. Torri is likely to want to determine if Cannavaro had a certificate approving his use of the substance. The hearing with Cannavaro could take place tomorrow.
Cannavaro received a cortisone injection on 29 August to prevent an allergic reaction, the ANSA news agency reported, quoting the Italian football federation. That was shortly before Cannavaro joined Italy's team for World Cup qualifiers with Georgia and Bulgaria.
The federation said the national team's medical staff were also informed of the injection, and that a certificate had been sent to Coni.
Juventus said they followed all medical rules, adding that the treatment was "indispensable to avoid eventual complications, even lethal". The Serie A club added that they would be happy to discuss the case with Coni.
