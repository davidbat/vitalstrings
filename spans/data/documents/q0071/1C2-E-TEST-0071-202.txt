The Bianconeri are keen to tie the veteran defender to a new deal with his present contract set to expire in the summer.
But despite the club's intentions, Cannavaro is refusing to be rushed and the 36-year-old is not yet ready to discuss terms.
Cannavaro's representative Enrico Fedele has promised Juventus not to discuss the situation with rival clubs, after reports suggested that Palermo were looking to secure a move for the defender.
"We will meet the club at the end of April or at the beginning of May," Fedele told calciomercato.it.
"Juventus are the ones who must decide. We have an engagement with them and until that date we won't talk with others."
Asked if there was interest from rival clubs, Fedele added: "There aren't offers."
