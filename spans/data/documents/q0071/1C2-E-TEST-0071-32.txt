Fabio Cannavaro, born September 13, 1973, Naples, is an Italian football player, as of 2005 the captain of the Italian national team.
Although being not tall for a central defender (176 cm), Cannavaro is considered one of the best defenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. As for his career in the Italian championship, he played Napoli (1992-95), Parma (1995-2002), Inter Milan (2002-04) and Juventus (2004-current). In Juventus, he has re-joined his ex-Parma partners Lilian Thuram and Gianluigi Buffon. They formed one of the best defensive lines in Serie A and Cannavaro won his first scudetto with Juventus in 2005.
Cannavaro, alongside Alessandro Nesta, forms for Italian defence one of the best defences in the world. Cannavaro is especially noted for his reading of the game, an ability that often sees him make countless interceptions during games. It is this attribute that has compensated for his lack of height, making him one of the finest centre-backs to have come out of Italy.
As for Italy, Cannavaro has earned over 90 caps. He played for his country in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as Euro 2000 and Euro 2004.
