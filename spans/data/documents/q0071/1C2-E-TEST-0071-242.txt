Golden Ball winner will be announced after final game
The rival captains of World Cup finalists France and Italy are among 10 nominees for the Golden Ball, awarded to the best player in the tournament. But in a break from tradition, players will not find out who wins the award until the day after the title game Sunday night in Berlin. Voting by journalists covering the tournament will remain open until midnight. In 2002, voting closed at halftime of the final.
