(CNN) -- Former Dutch international Ronald De Boer says that the Netherlands are feeling confident as they prepare to take on Spain in the World Cup final.
De Boer, who made 67 appearances for his country and played at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, is the twin-brother of Holland's assistant coach Frank De Boer.
"I have just been speaking to my brother, they are feeling very confident and they should be," Ronald De Boer told CNN.
"We are so close again. They are focused and I'm looking forward to the match."
De Boer added that he was happy about the line-up for the final which takes place at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium Sunday night.
"I am pleased that two teams who always approach football attacking, scoring goals and entertaining the public are in the final," he said.
"I hope that other countries follow their example because football is entertainment. I think it's the best thing for football these two teams are in the final."
They are feeling very confident. We are so close again.
