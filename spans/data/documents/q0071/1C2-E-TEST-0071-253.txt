His performance on the pitch is undoubtedly impressive, but Cristiano Ronaldo can now add another accolade to his list of achievements.
The Portuguese striker has scored a goal with European women, who voted him the sexiest player of the current Euro 2008 tournament.
German website Spiegel Online reported that the 23-year-old Manchester United star topped the poll of 12,000 women, which was conducted on behalf of electronics company LG.
“Unfortunately for his legions of female fans [Ronaldo] is no longer available,” the Spiegel Online article continued.
“He’s dating Spanish model Nereida Gallardo.”
Other footballers to make the cut included France’s Thierry Henry and Germany’s captain Michael Ballack.
