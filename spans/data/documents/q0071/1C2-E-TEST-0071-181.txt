Fabio Cannavaro. Sought after wherever he goes, apparently. Here, he’s attracting a bit of interest from local kids in Phnom Penh on January 9th. Image: STR/AFP/Getty Images.
We’re not going to get wrapped in the complexities of the newly founded Premier League Soccer tournament in India for two reasons.
We don’t imagine you’ll be massively interested in a bunch of semi-retired footballers selling their services to the highest bidder so they can run round a pitch in India for seven weeks.
We know you and you’re as fickle as we are.
No bids. Are you crazy? Image: Getty Images/Zimbio.
So we’ll just give you the essentials: the tournament starts on February 25th , and at this morning’s auction of talent, ex-Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro received the highest bid, coming in at a stonking $830,000. He will be playing for the Siliguri franchise, while the next most popular player, Robert Pires, is worth approximately $800,000, according to highest bidders Howrah.
Robbie Fowler and Jay-Jay Okocha also featured and will be playing for Kolkata and Durgapur. Hernan Crespo, who was expected to attract the highest bids actually attracted no-one and ended up playing for Barasat. Which is inexplicable, considering what he can bring to a team (see above).
That’s about it for now, but don’t worry, We’ll keep an eye on things, just in case anyone takes their clothes off or gets into a fight.
You’re welcome.
