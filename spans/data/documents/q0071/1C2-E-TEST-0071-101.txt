After Italy’s game against New Zealand, captain Fabio Cannavaro stepped to the beat of our hearts. Yea, we just referenced Justin Bieber, but it’s the Usher remix so it’s all good.
If Canna’s stair steppin’ game was set to a soundtrack, what would it be?
A) “Walk This Way” – Aerosmith
B) “These Boots Are Made For Walking” – Nancy Sinatra
C) “Don’t Walk Away Boy” – Jade
D) “Walk Like A Man” – The Four Seasons
E) “Baby Got Back” – Sir Mix-a-lot
Difficult, eh? Not for us. We pick E . Forever and ever, we’ll go with E.
