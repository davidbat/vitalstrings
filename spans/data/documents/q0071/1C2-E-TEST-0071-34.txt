QPR are lining up a move for Italian World Cup winning captain Fabio Cannavaro.
Defender Cannavaro, 37, is available on a free after rejecting a coaching role at his Qatar club Al Ahli to continue his playing career.
Hoops owner Flavio Briatore would love to land the former Juventus star and fellow countryman.
Cannavaro admitted: “I have not yet decided when I will retire.”
Centre back Cannavaro is the most-capped player in Italy’s history and led the team to victory over France in the 2006 World Cup Final.
