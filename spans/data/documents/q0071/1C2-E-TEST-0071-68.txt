Cannavaro Tests Positive for Banned Substance
By JEFFREY MARCUS
Jasper Juinen/Associated Press Fabio Cannavaro was captain of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany.
Italy defender Fabio Cannavaro would have had to sit out Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Ireland anyway.  Cannavaro, a Juventus defender, had racked up enough yellow cards to earn a one-game suspension.  But now he faces a doping investigation after he tested positive for a banned substance.
Cannavaro tested positive after receiving cortisone for a bee sting , according to his club team, and an anti-doping prosecutor for the Italian Olympic Committee has opened an investigation into the matter. (Agence France-Press said the alleged assailant was a wasp, not a bee.)
“He requested an exemption on the grounds of having taken a medication in the case of an emergency, but his request was missing a document, and while awaiting a decision he was subjected to an anti-doping test, which returned a positive result,” reported  A.F.P.
According to the Italian news service ANSA, Cannavaro received a cortisone shot on Aug. 29 to prevent an allergic reaction before he joined the Italian national team for September matches against Georgia and Bulgaria.  The Associated Press said the Italian soccer federation had been informed of the treatment.
A hearing is set for Friday.
