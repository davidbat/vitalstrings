CBC SPORTS ONLINE'S WORLD CUP ALL-STAR TEAM
By John F. Molinaro
Last week, FIFA announced its 23-player World Cup all-star squad. On Monday,        Zinedine Zidane won the Golden Ball award as the tournament MVP.
Now it's our turn to hand out some honours. CBC Sports Online presents        its own World Cup all-star team and Golden Ball winner.
Feel free to dispute our choices.
FIRST TEAM
Goalkeeper
Gianluigi Buffon, Italy: What a tournament. The Italian made countless        game-saving stops, including a remarkable save off Zidane in extra time        of the final.
Defenders
Fabio Cannavaro, Italy: Unbelievable. Italy's captain was the lynchpin        of an Italian defence that only conceded two goals. Rarely caught out of        position, Cannavaro was the best player in the tournament.
Lilian Thuram, France: The veteran was outstanding for        France. He exhibited timely tackling skills and plenty of heart.
Philipp Lahm, Germany: The youngster was an attacking threat        down the left side and provided Germany with plenty of defensive stability.
Gianluca Zambrotta, Italy: An unheralded hero for Italy.        Zambrotta wrapped himself in glory with his solid defensive play and his        attacking prowess down the right wing.
Midfielders
Zinedine Zidane, France: Yes, the red card for the head-butt was        foolish, but that should not take away from the fact Zidane played his best        soccer in years in this tournament.
Michael Ballack, Germany: Ballack spearheaded the German        attack with his stylish and cultured play.
Andrea Pirlo, Italy: Pirlo escaped from the shadow of        Francesco Totti with his dangerous free kicks, exquisite passes and vision        on the field.
Patrick Vieira, France: Vieira was a bull for the French        with his physical play and athleticism in midfield. Solid defensively and        going forward in attack.
Forwards
Miroslav Klose, Germany: The German scored a tournament leading        five goals and tore opposing defences apart with his guile and scoring prowess.
Thierry Henry, France: He had a slow start to the tournament,        but the Frenchman scored some important goals for his country in the knockout        stages.
SECOND TEAM
Defenders: Roberto Ayala (Argentina), John Terry (England),        Ricardo Carvalho (Portugal), Carlos Puyol (Spain).
Midfielders: Luis Figo (Portugal), Maniche (Portugal),        Gennaro Gatuso (Italy), Maxi Rodriguez (Argentina)
Forwards: Fernando Torres (Spain), Lukas Podolski (Germany)
TOURNAMENT MVP
Fabio Cannavaro, Italy
