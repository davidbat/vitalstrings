(CNN) -- British fashion designer Neil Barrett will be paying close attention to what the Italian football team is wearing this Sunday when they play in the World Cup final -- he designed their uniforms.
Italy face France in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.
Barrett, who has lived in Italy since 1989, told CNN he believed he was the first fashion designer to have created a national football team's uniform.
"Of course the Italians would have to be first," he told CNN.
His brand is on each garment alongside sports label Puma, who Barrett has worked with to create the team uniform.
Barrett first began work on the uniform in 2002 -- which includes Italy's home and away outfits, as well as their training gear -- and created the team's kit for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal.
Seeing his designs in the Berlin stadium at the final will be a dream come true, Barrett said.
"I'm incredibly proud of the team. Designing their uniforms is a total coup for me. I wanted to make them look as great as possible, so I based the designs on a super hero's outfit."
The British designer said he was grateful that his native England had not faced Italy during the tournament because it wouldn't have been tough to chose which team to support.
He said the uniforms are made from high-tech fabrics, making them as aerodynamic as possible.
Barrett has met the entire Italian team and his favorite players are captain Fabio Cannavaro and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.
