Calling out "El Capitano" and holding aloft a banner that read "Benvenuto a Singapore Fabio" (Welcome to Singapore, Fabio), he stood dumbfounded as his supporters shook his hands and jostled to pose for photos with him.
Travelling as a football ambassador for Middle Eastern club Al-Ahli Dubai, the 39-year-old clearly didn't expect the noisy reception. Speaking only briefly, he said: "This is my first time in Singapore, I am very happy to be here."
The Italian defensive stalwart ended his career with Serie A giants Juventus in June last year. He signed a two-year contract with Al Ahli, but a troubling knee injury put an end to his career and he announced his retirement in July.
He is now a technical consultant and ambassador for the club and is in Singapore courtesy of Dentsu Sports Asia.
One of the fans, Mr Nigel Gan, said the group were avowed Serie A fans and wanted to show their appreciation to the player for helping Italy win the World Cup in 2006.
Said the 32-year-old security engineer: "Cannavaro is special and we wanted him to know that we still support him even though he is retired. He is a down-to-earth kind of guy and you saw how he was willing to please all of us." - TODAY
