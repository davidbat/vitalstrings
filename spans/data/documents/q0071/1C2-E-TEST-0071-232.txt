Iker Casillas
Next up is Spain captain and goalkeeper, Iker Casillas.
He was born May 20, 1981, in Móstoles, Madrid.  He started early with Real Madrid, joining their junior squad for the 90-91 season.  It wasn’t until 98-99 that he was called up to the senior squad.
During the 01-02 season, he lost his spot as starting goalie to backup César Sánchez, but managed to regain it when Sánchez was injured in the final game.
He won the La Liga title in 07-08, and won the Zamora trophy.
In 2008, he and captain Rául were awarded new contracts.  Casilla’s contract will keep him with Real until 2017, with an automatic extension if he plays 30 league games in his last season.  There is also a buy-out clause of £113 million.
He has stated that he has no intention of leaving his boyhood club.
Internationally, he debuted at the U-17 games at the 1007 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and was later made captain.  Two years later, he went on to win the FIFA World Youth Championship and the UEFA-CAF Meridian Cup.
He made his senior debut in a match against Sweden when he was 19.  He was an unused sub in Euro 2000.  For the World Cup 2002, he was on the roster as a back-up, but was moved ahead when starting goalie Santiago Cañizares had to withdraw due to injury.
He was the first choice goalie in 2006. When captain Rául was excluded from Euro 2008, Casillas was made captain.  He became the first goalie-captain to lift the world cup trophy as a winner when they won the 2008 UEFA European Championship.
