Fabio Cannavaro
Fabio Cannavaro -  Itâ€™s not so much a case of doping as a complete shambles. But with a happy ending. Fabio Cannavaro, the captain of the Italian football team, tested positive on 30 August after the AS Roma-Juventus game. But things were not as they seemed. There was an explanation for the result for Cannavaro was stung by a wasp two days before the fateful match. Almost like a film plot. Fearing an allergic reaction, the Italy defender consulted the head of the Juventus medical staff. However, the cortisone he was treated with is a prohibited substance. Hence the test result, the report and a possible fine for Juventus, the real cause of the mix-up.
