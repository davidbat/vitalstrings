taly's 2006 World Cup-winning captain, Fabio Cannavaro, took time out of his whistle-stop tour to Cambodia, to take a training session with the Phnom Penh Crown Academy youngsters at the club's RSN Stadium headquarters on Tuesday 10 January. The former Real Madrid, Juventus and Inter Milan defender and World Player of the Year passed on some useful tips to the Academy boys during a question and answer session after spending forty-five minutes with them on the playing pitch. Fabio was also introduced to the Crown first-team squad and head coach David Booth. The visit was arranged by Crown president Rithy Samnang, who also invited Fabio to meet the Cambodian U-21 national team at the Olympic Stadium during his four day tour. Recent results from the Crown teams, include a 4-1 practice match success against the National Defense Ministry team, with Khim Borey on target against his former club, as well as a 4-0 win for the Academy team against their arch rivals Preah Khan Reach in last weekend's Barclays Capital U-14 league encounter.
