Poor CR7! He just can’t escape the shadow of Leo Messi.
After being criticized for playing badly against Denmark on Wednesday, Cristiano Ronaldo has aimed a shocking attack on Lionel Messi . Seems like he’s had enough!
Ronaldo said, of the Barcelona forward, “You know where he was at this time [last year]? Do you know? He was being eliminated in the Copa America, in his own country. I think that’s worse, no?”
Wow thats a low blow, but can’t blame Ronnie! He’s constantly compared to Messi and I am pretty sure he’s annoyed!
Denmark fans taunted Ronaldo at the game by chanting Messi’s name whenever he was on the ball.
Cristiano’s comments have many accusing the star of being jealous of Messi’s superstar abilities, as the two are often compared to one another.
Who do you think is the better football star? Ronaldo or Messi?
