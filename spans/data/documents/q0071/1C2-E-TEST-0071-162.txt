Ghana legend Abedi Pele has attended the launch of the 7th Dubai International Sports Conference to be held on December 27 and 28 this year.
Organizers, the Dubai Sports Council, invited the three-time African Footballer of the Year as one of its special guests.
The annual event-held under the patronage of Shaikh Hamdan Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of DSC-has consistently brought in top-class footballers and officials to pass on their experience to the professional set-up in the UAE and the region.
One of the highlights of this year’s conference will be the visit of the Uefa president and former French footballer Michel Platini, who confirmed his presence at the Globe Soccer press conference last month.
The announcement was also attended by former England coach Fabio Capello, Italy’s World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and ex-chairman and owner of Torino FC and AS Lazio, Gianmarco Calleri.
