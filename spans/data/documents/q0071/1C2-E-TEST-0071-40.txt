Fabio Cannavaro is an Italian World Cup-winning footballer who plays for Juventus. He won the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 2006, making him the first and so far only defender to win the award, as well as the oldest recipient. With 132 caps he is the all time most capped player of the Italian national team.
Before moving to Real Madrid in Spain , Cannavaro played most of his club career in the Italian Serie A league. The clubs he played for includes his hometown side Napoli, Parma, with whom he achieved significant domestic cup and European success, Juventus, where he won two later revoked scudetto titles, and Internazionale.
Cannavaro was born in Naples to Gelsomina and Pasquale Cannavaro. His mother worked as a maid, while his father was a bank clerk; his father also played football for provincial side Giugliano.[2 As a youngster Cannavaro played for a team from Bagnoli before being quickly spotted by the scouts of Napoli, his childhood team. He is well known for his fierce defending and interception. During his career Cannavaro has earned world wide prominence, winning many personal accolades. For example he was the second ever defender to win FIFA World Player of the Year after the first ever winner of the award Lothar Matthäus, who was mostly playeed as a central defender or a sweeper, and only secondly and sparingly as a defensive midfielder. He was also selected in the FIFPro World XI squad twice, during 2005–06 and 2006–07.
Cannavaro's first taste of international success came over a decade ago under coach Cesare Maldini with Italy 's U-21 side, winning consecutive European Under-21 Football Championship titles in 1994 and 1996. In 1996, he participated in the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
He made his debut with the Italian national team on 22 January 1997, in a friendly game against Northern Ireland. He played for his country in the 1998, 2002, and 2006 World Cups, as well as Euro 2000 and Euro 2004.
Cannavaro's first international tournament came at 1998 FIFA World Cup under the mentorship of veteran defender Paolo Maldini, and the squad was coached by Maldini's father Cesare.
On 2 June 2008, Cannavaro was injured during Italy 's first training session for Euro 2008. Cannavaro sustained the knock following a tackle by fellow defender Giorgio Chiellini and was carried off the field on a stretcher. Italy doctor Paolo Zeppilli said: "We have to do tests but it does not look like a minor injury." Tests had shown that he tore ligaments in his left ankle. Right after the examinations, Italian journalists awaited Cannavaro, who told them: "I'm going home," with a melancholic smile on his face. After the day was over, Roberto Donadoni called up Fiorentina centre-back Alessandro Gamberini as his official replacement. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon captained the team in his place. Cannavaro added he will stay with the squad to offer support. This would have been Cannavaro's third Euro tournament.
Cannavaro has also put his plans to retire from the national team after Euro 2008 on hold and added that it has made him more determined to captain Italy through the 2010 World Cup.
In a 2009 Confederations Cup match against Brazil , Fabio Cannavaro equalled Paolo Maldini's record of being Italy 's most capped player. On August 12, 2009 in a friendly match against Switzerland, Fabio Cannavaro became Italy 's most capped player of all time. He won his 127th cap for his country beating Paolo Maldini's former record of 126.
Fabio is married to Daniela Cannavaro, and together they have 3 children, Christian, Martina, and Andrea.
His younger brother Paolo is also a defender who currently plays for Napoli. The two brothers were first spotted by an English scout when Fabio was only twelve. Michael Hutchinson (who was working for Newcastle United at the time) decided to personally train them as central defenders, having sixteen years of experience as a professional central defender himself. The two brothers played alongside each other at Parma from 2000 until 2002, when Fabio left for Inter. Although they are no longer playing together, Fabio has expressed interest in ending his career with Paolo in a Napoli shirt.
