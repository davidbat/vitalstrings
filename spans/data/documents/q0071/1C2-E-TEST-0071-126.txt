Broken World Cup trophy?
Hey look at this:
Days after winning the coveted trophy, Italian captain Fabio Cannavaro was pictured on the front page of an Italian newspaper staring at the World Cup trophy in dismay and holding up what looks like a piece from the trophy's base. Cannavaro admitted that he slept with the trophy the night Italy won the game against France and might have been affectionate with it. The winners of the World Cup can hold on to the trophy until the next tournament, although it remains the property of FIFA.
