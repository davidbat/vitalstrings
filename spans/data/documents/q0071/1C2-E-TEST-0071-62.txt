Cannavaro to be icon player in Premier League Soccer
Kolkata: Italy's World Cup winning captain Fabio Cannavaro will be one of the six icon players for the IPL-like Premier League Soccer that is scheduled to kick off in the state from February 25.
Besides the Italian defender, French World Cup winner Robert Pires, Argentina World Cup captain Juan Pablo Sorin, Argentine Olympic silver medalist Hernan Crespo, Nigerian stalwart Jay-Jay Okocha and English World Cupper Robbie Fowler will be the other icon players, organisers of the PLS, Celebrity Management Group, announced here on Friday.
The six franchises, which will be decided through a tender process in the next ten days, will have world class coaches in Peter Reid, John Barnes, Samson Saisia, Marco Etcheverry, Colin Todd, Teitur Thodarson and Milos Rus.
Arsenal legend and former Portsmouth manager Tony Adams and former Liverpool and Jamaica star John Barnes will also figure in the tournament, the organisers said.
In a rip-off from the hugely successful money-spinning Indian Premier League Twenty20, PLS initially will have six franchises - Kolkata, Howrah, Barasat, Durgapur, Midnapore and Siliguri - with one 'icon' player and the minimum base prices would be in the range of Rs. 70 lakh to Rs. 1 crore per year.
