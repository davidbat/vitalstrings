Bernd Schuster keen for Fabio Cannavaro to stay
Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster is keen to have his star Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro extend his contract with the Spanish champions.
Defensively Real Madrid have not been up to scratch. With that in mind Schuster will want to extend his contract renewed before it expires next summer.
Schuster explained that if his contract was not renewed by 1 January he would be free to talk to other clubs wishing to sign the star defender.
