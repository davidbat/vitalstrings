Former Juventus and Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro will lead the New York Cosmos against Manchester United for Paul Scholes' testimonial.
Cannavaro hung up the boots last month.
He will be joined by former United stars Gary Neville and Nicky Butt, as well as Sol Campbell , Brad Friedel, Robbie Keane, Brian McBride , Michel Salgado and Patrick Vieira - all current or former Premier League players who will suit up for the Cosmos as they take on the Red Devils next month. Those eight stars will be joined by eight New York Cosmos U-23 players, forming a team that will be the first US-based squad to play against United at Old Trafford..
The Cosmos will be coached by United legend Eric Cantona.
