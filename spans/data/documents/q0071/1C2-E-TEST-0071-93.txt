Italy's Fabio Cannavaro lifts the trophy after defeating France 5-3 in a shootout in the final of the soccer World Cup between Italy and France in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on July 9, 2006.
Just days after Italy won the 2006 World Cup with a thrilling penalty-kick shootout victory over France, newspapers were full of anxious reports about the treatment of the trophy. The players were on their way to a celebration with the Italian prime minister when photographers snapped a photo of team captain Fabio Cannavaro nervously holding a piece of the base, which had apparently broken up during excessive celebrations. The piece of green malachite, a semi-precious stone, was reportedly glued back in place in time for a joyous party at Rome's Circus Maximus.
