<br /><br /><br /><br />24 Key Attitudes For Success In YOUR Business<br /><br />What to take YOUR business to a whole new level? This article is designed for business owners who want to take their business to a whole new level and realize results beyond their wildest dreams. The first of a three part business tips series, it deals with the 24 key attitudes that are fundamental to the success of your business.<br /><br />The second article The 5 Biggest Small Business Mistakes and How to Fix Them deals with the next most important area Marketing. Without a solid foundation of who your target market is, what they want, how they want to deal with you, then you have no prospects, no customers and no basis for a company.<br /><br />Finally, the third article in the series The 5 Key Business Profit Factors deals with how to make massive amounts of profit.<br /><br />The Key to Business Success<br /><br />What is the most important factors of a businesss success?<br /><br /> A Unique Selling Proposition (USP)?<br /><br /> Having the lowest prices?<br /><br /> Great sales people?<br /><br /> The best location?<br /><br /> The best products?<br /><br /> Good customer service?<br /><br /> A strong local economy?<br /><br />While these are all factors, based on our experience working with all kinds of different businesses, the most important determinant is YOU the business owner. History is riddled with examples of successful businesses that have failed with a new owner and lackluster businesses that have flourished under new ownership.<br /><br />As a result, you are your most important business project. As such, you should be investing significantly in yourself. This includes reading books, examining your strengths and weaknesses, setting development goals for yourself, seeking outside advice, tracking your own personal development and getting a mentor to keep you on track. You probably spend plenty developing and maintaining your businesss physical assets. How much time and money do you spend on developing yourself?<br /><br />The great motivator and speaker E. James Rohn advises: Work harder on yourself than you do on your job. In my opinion, if you are serious about your business and what you want to get out of life, you simply must dedicate 5-10% of your time to self-development And, yes, you must set aside some money to pay for it. Rest assured, this money will likely give you the highest ROI (return on investment) possible. After all, you are the person that can increase your profits by 50% or more.<br /><br />There is no better time than now to make a commitment to yourself. Get out your calendar right now and block off 30-60 minutes every day for self development, for the next 12 months. Next, write down specifically what you are going to do with this time for the next two weeks. At the end of two weeks, you should be in a position to detail your development plan for the next month, then the next quarter.<br /><br />Another great quote, also from Jim Rohn: Never wish your job were easier, wish you were better. Think about it. If you are better, you will get better results. If you wish for it then you are more likely to find a way to make it happen. If, on the other hand, your job were to be easier, then everyone would want to do it and you would be back to square one.<br /><br />1. The Winning Attitude<br /><br />The journey towards extraordinary profits begins here. There is no greater factor responsible for success, or failure, than your own mental attitude! As a result, it is imperative that you begin by preparing your mind with the attitudes and perspectives that will set you free to achieve your business goals. I am not talking about psyching yourself with positive thoughts, although at times this can help. What I am talking about is adopting ways of thinking that will free your mind to find the solutions to your business challenges.<br /><br />How you think and what you believe to be true about how you do business is what brought you to where you are right now. Before you can find a better way of doing business, you must learn a new way of thinking about business.<br /><br />It is a simple truth that it does not matter if you think you can, or you think you cannot, either way you will be right!<br /><br />Stop blaming, denying or making excuses and start taking ownership, being responsible and winning.<br /><br />2. In Business There Are No Mistakes<br /><br />Did you know that Edison had tried over 500 times, unsuccessfully, to make a light bulb. One day he got asked you have failed 500 times, how can you go on? Edison quickly responded I have not failed once! I now know 500 ways not to make a light bulb. The only failure is the failure to Participate.<br /><br />If you want to be successful in business, you must be prepared to take calculated risks. Many things you try will not work the first, or second, time. You learned to walk by falling down. It is the same in business. You probably had parents or that gave you a safe environment in which to learn. In business, you can seek out a mentor to help give you a safer environment.<br /><br />3. What if Contrary Information was Interesting?<br /><br />Have you ever had an argument? You knew you were right and the other person was wrong. However, the argument was vigorous because the other person, who was also bright and articulate, was convinced they were right. So, there you had it, two people both right and both wrong at the same time. You argued but the other person would not relent. Several days later, you still were thinking about it when you realised that you were wrong after all.<br /><br />Brad Sugars, the remarkable entrepreneur has an approach which has enabled him to continually innovate. When Brad hears an opinion that is contrary to his he says, isn&#8217;t that interesting? This then opens his mind to the possibility that he will learn a new way.<br /><br />You see if there is an up, then there must be a down, and a left and a right If you have to prove yourself right, then you cut off all possibility that there may be a better way.<br /><br />If you truly want to change the success of your business, you must be willing to change the way you think and the way you behave. Isnt that interesting?<br /><br />4. I Know the 2 most dangerous impediments to Business Innovation<br /><br />Teenagers KNOW everything. Just ask them. Now that you are a little older you realise that it is probably not polite to say, I know out loud to everyone. So as an adult we listen politely, cross our arms, all the while in the back of our mind saying, I know.<br /><br />Try this exercise. Close both your fists tightly. Now try to button your jacket or make a phone call or compose an e-mail. Your mind is like those closed fists. There are very few things it can do well when it is closed.<br /><br />You need to forget the mindset that says I know. It is what you learn when you think you know everything that counts<br /><br />Open your mind up, it is not the major realizations that will make you a fortune, it is the fine distinctions that gives you the edge over the rest of the population. The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little bit extra.<br /><br />5. Business is Fun!<br /><br />You have decided to go into business for a number of reasons; more money, more control over your time, more free time. Unfortunately, if you are like many business owners, you let the business take control of you. It may even suck the life out of you but life should be fun. Since owning a business should give you more life, it only stands to reason that business should be fun! To have fun, I suggest you treat it like a game. First, learn the rules. Second, keep score. Finally, have fun<br /><br />6. Time is Your Most Valuable Asset<br /><br />If you spend every penny you have you can go out and earn more money. In this sense the amount of money we can have access-to is infinite. Unfortunately, we all have a finite amount of time on this earth. If we waste a minute, we have lost it forever.<br /><br />While this may seem intuitively obvious, amongst the business owners I meet, this one simple principle is the most important yet under appreciated principle of business. Let me describe one conversation that is representative of conversations I have had time and time again with different business owners. We will call the business owner Mark<br /><br />Peter: Tell me how your business is performing relative to your goals.<br /><br />Mark: Well we are doing OK but I know we can do better.<br /><br />Peter: If you know what to do, what is keeping you from doing it?<br /><br />Mark: I always get interrupted and I can never find the time to do the new things.<br /><br />Peter: Is your business profitable?<br /><br />Mark: Yes it is. But I know I could easily do better.<br /><br />Peter: How much would you like to make in the next twelve months?<br /><br />Mark: After all expenses 150,000.<br /><br />Peter: Do you believe that this is a realistic objective<br /><br />Mark: Absolutely.<br /><br />Peter: How many hours a week would you like to work?<br /><br />Mark: 50 hours per week and I would like to take 5 weeks vacation (including holidays).<br /><br />Peter: So Mark, that means you would like your business to earn about $64 for every hour that you work. (150,000/(50 hours x 47 weeks)).<br /><br />After an examination of Marks workweek, it was obvious that he was involved in a number of activities that were not worth 64 per hour. If Mark spends 35% of his time working on tasks that could be handled by a 15/hour employee he is either going to have to work a lot more hours than he wants to, or he is going to have to get his business earning more like 90 per hour for the balance of the time he works.<br /><br />Now, I am quick to advise owners to be careful with how they spend money. But Marks penny pinching was not in his best interest. Mark was trying to save paying more wages (about 17,000 per year). But, by trying to save money it was costing him considerably more. He was not having fun and he could have been implementing changes that would yield him more like 50,000 in additional profit (3 times what he thought he was saving).<br /><br />As an owner, the most important decision you make is what you spend your time doing. Owners that I meet who work too many hours and do not make as much as they want, often treat their time very causally. Typically, they do not plan their day and tend to be reactive. Often they do not even keep a calendar. Rarely can they tell you how they actually spent their time. Conversely, successful owners plan and track their days and their week as carefully as they spend their money.<br /><br />I recommend that you emulate the successful owners. Think about what will give you the best long term ROI [Return On Investment] for your time. Do not be distracted by saving a few short-term pounds if you have an opportunity to create something that will generate returns for you year after year.<br /><br />7. Questions are more important than answers <br /><br />One night at dinner, a young man asked his wife, Why do you cut the ends off the roast? Her reply, I am not sure. It is what my mother used to do.<br /><br />Some time went by before they visited her mother for dinner, and when they did, they had roast for dinner. So he asked, why do you cut the ends off the roast? Her reply, Im not sure, my mother always did it that way. So he made a phone call to his wifes grandmother and asked, why do you cut the ends off the roast? Her reply, well, Ive only got a small baking tray.<br /><br />So, often we do things, just because it is the way we have always done them, having absolutely no idea why it was done that way to start with. Ever notice how new people tend to question things? As an owner you should question why your business runs the way it does. The only way to perform substantially better than your competitors is to be substantially different from them. In business, following the crowd will almost certainly lead you to slaughter. Looking at it another way, have you ever seen a flock of eagles?<br /><br />To succeed in business, you often have to depart from conventional wisdom. For many people this will be difficult especially those who did well in school. After all, we were taught in school what we had to do to be successful quite often it involved conforming.<br /><br />In an increasingly competitive environment, you must distinguish yourself by more than just price. You do this by being different. Think about what makes you unique and then tell the world.<br /><br />8. Take a look in the Mirror<br /><br />Ever notice that when you are having a good sales week that the next week just seems to get better and you keep closing more accounts with little or no effort. Or maybe you have had a slow couple of weeks and all the prospects that you meet seem to have trouble deciding. You have to make multiple sales calls, answer question, after question, after question. The people you attract in your life are a mirror of where you are at.<br /><br />Most businesses are a clear reflection of its owner. Some owners want to control everything and wonder why none of their team ever takes any initiative. Some hate selling and love paperwork, so they have always got their numbers done, but never really sell much.<br /><br />When I look back at my life I can clearly see times when my successes lead to more successes. Success follows success. This brings me back again to the key to success in business you. Make sure you invest in you.<br /><br />9. Business is a Self-fulfilling Prophecy<br /><br />Remember the last time you bought a car. You chose something that you thought was distinctive. Then after you got it you started to notice that you were seeing the same car all over the place. Or, another example, try right now to NOT picture a purple cow in your mind. What happened. You are seeing a purple cow Your brain has an amazing power to create whatever you focus on. It is called your Reticular Activating System (RAS) and it is like your personal compass.<br /><br />Your RAS will find proof that the earth is flat if you want it to. In fact, it will find proof that November is a slow month if you want it to. In other words, attention determines direction. Just like the last time you said to yourself; Do not forget, do not forget, do not forget&#8230; And, what happened, you forgot. Change your wording to remember get rid of the negative do not.<br /><br />Another example, if you were to ask a person how their day has been, and they answered, Not bad. What is their benchmark on life? BAD, and today is not that. Your RAS is an amazing tool and it will find whatever you ask it to find, so you had better ask for very positive things. Remember to ask for the things you want, NOT to push away what you do not want.<br /><br />Every day your business meets your true expectations. In other words, if you believe you have to work hard to make money, then that will always be your reality. If you believe you can never get good people then that will be your reality. You generally make true that which you believe to be so. So, choose your beliefs carefully.<br /><br />10. Listen to the Taps on Your Shoulder<br /><br />Traveling down the road of life, it is easy to be distracted, get off track and lose sight of the big picture. You have heard the old saying, cant see the forest for the trees. However, every day you are getting little taps on the shoulder, an idea that you should change what you are doing, a suggestion from someone, a hint. These taps are just like the cats eyes in the center of the road and the small slits in the shoulder that serve as warnings. You feel little taps if you stray too far one way or the other. Either you learn to listen to the taps and adjust your course, or eventually you will run into the sign posts at the side of the road, or worse, oncoming traffic.<br /><br />In business, we get taps all the time. Unfortunately, they are a lot more subtle than the taps we get on the road. They are however, just as important for the health of your business. If you do not want your business to be run over by the proverbial hit by a bus, it is imperative that you become adept at listening to the taps.<br /><br />The most successful business people are very perceptive. They have perfected the craft of surrounding themselves with other people and then listening &#8211; really listening &#8211; to what they have to say.<br /><br />So, be sure to listen for the taps and look for the signs. Sticking your head in the sand never helped anyone.<br /><br />11. Build a Business do not Buy a Job<br /><br />From what I have found, people start their own business for one thing and one thing only: FREEDOM; whether that freedom comes from working for yourself, having more time to yourself, financial freedom, or just the freedom of knowing that you are in charge of your life.<br /><br />With a successful business, this freedom is truly liberating. Now your friends that have never had any interest in captaining their own ship (those who work for others) may argue that you are far from in charge when exposed to the volatility of owning a business. What they do not realize is that if you have 100 different customers and you lose half of your customers you still have 50 left. Your friends on the other hand have only one customer their boss. If they lose that customer then they are out on the street!<br /><br />Unfortunately, most business owners never achieve the freedom they seek. In fact, about 80 per cent of businesses started this year will be gone in 5 years time. Moreover, for those businesses that are still operating, most of their owners seem to work harder than any of their people and many seem to make less income than they could make elsewhere. Most end up having the business run them, instead of them running the business. In fact, they end up with the very thing they did not want, a JOB. And that job may even come with the worst boss they ever had themselves! In effect, they have taken great risks and expended vast energy and all they have done is bought employment.<br /><br />12. A business needs to be profitable and work without YOU!<br /><br />If you want to achieve that freedom that all business owners seek, then you should adopt this definition of a business:<br /><br />A business is &#8211; A commercial profitable enterprise that works without YOU!<br /><br />Why build a job for yourself when you can build an income stream that keeps on growing whether you are there or not. Remember the business exists solely to serve you the owner; not your customers, or your employees. Yes, customers and staff are important, but the reason you start a business has nothing to do with them. It is essential that you adopt this attitude.<br /><br />13. The only reason you would ever start a business is to sell it.<br /><br />If you want to achieve true success and freedom then you need to think of your business as your product. It is what you are building and it is where you are ultimately going to make your profit &#8211; selling the business. That is right; you start by thinking about how you can build your business so that lots of people will be competing with each other to buy your business.<br /><br />Very few people ever make a fortune running their business, but many people make a fortune selling businesses. Look at Bill Gates for instance. Yes, he has made a lot of money selling software, but he became the richest man in the world by selling his business &#8211; shares of Microsoft.<br /><br />Are you too involved in your business? Ask yourself: could I pick up the phone in the morning and tell whoever answered, you guys look after things, I am taking three months off.<br /><br />If you are like the vast majority of business owners out there, the answer is definitely NO.<br /><br />14. Working ON not IN the Business<br /><br />Ultimately, you have to get yourself out of the day to day of the business. Stop working 9 till 5, doing the work of your business. Else be like most small builders they spend all day using a hammer and nails, working IN their business.<br /><br />Imagine when you started your business that you built it in your mind, and then you put down that picture of what your business would be like when it was finished. If you are going to sell a product, you must know when it is finished. It is the same with a business. You have to finish a business at some stage and have it ready for sale.<br /><br />As an example, let us say you wanted to buy a new sofa. How much would you pay a furniture shop for a partially completed sofa? Likely, only a very small fraction of what a completed sofa would cost. In fact, if you are like most people you would not even be interested in paying anything. It is the same thing for a business.<br /><br />When people try to sell a business that is not finished, at most they are really only selling a JOB. As a result, these people only get a few people interested and they only ever get a fraction of the potential price.<br /><br />When you have the finished picture of what your business will look like, then you go to work creating the business. This way you are working ON the business, rather than just working IN the business. You should be designing your business to run whether you are there or not. If you do this then you have a choice, and choice gives you freedom. You can work in the business or you can spend your time more creatively. You can keep the business, or you can sell it. I like good choices like these.<br /><br />15. You work hard because your business doesnt<br /><br />Imagine a business where you did not have to work there &#8211; would the business WORK? I mean, would it function properly? Would all of the systems and the people integrate to get the result you wanted, the result the customer wanted? Of course it would.<br /><br />Almost every business owner I have ever met works so hard (too hard) for this exact reason. Their business does not work, they do. Everything about the business is in their head, and they are the only one who can do anything, so they are trapped.<br /><br />Most are like this because the owners do not trust anyone else to do the job. For some reason they believe that no one can do it as well as they can. This need to be in control prevents them from growing their business.<br /><br />Take the step, start to document how everything in your business gets done, put systems in place, teach other people and give them the responsibility to get the job done. (If you need more convincing, Read Michael Gerbers book &#8211; The E-Myth Revisited.<br /><br />16. Assign Tasks. Dont Delegate Just To Abdicate<br /><br />All great leaders are good at delegating so you must start off-loading tasks as soon as possible. Remember, time is your most precious commodity. Since delegation is so important, you must prepare properly for it. You must make sure that the person that will be doing the task knows what to do. The worst thing you can do is to abdicate a task to someone. By this, I mean telling them to do something when they do not have the skills or the training to handle the task. It is essential that you carefully explain what you want done, how you want it done and what you consider a successful outcome to be.<br /><br />This may come as a shock, or at least seem like overkill, but you must document how you want your processes and tasks to be completed. From my experience, most owners just give their staff a (quite often limited) set of verbal instructions. The owner then assumes that the employee knows what to do and the employee then assumes what he thinks the owner wants done. While well intentioned, this feeble attempt at delegation often does not produce the desired results. You see, it is a simple but important fact about human learning that only about 20% of people are auditory learners people that receive and easily comprehend verbal information. The rest of us are either visual or kinaesthetic learners. That is, we need to see (a picture, diagram or read) what to do, or we need to actually do something before we fully understand. (I have some simple, but effective tools that can help you successfully delegate.)<br /><br />After you have properly prepared, trained and given your team member the job to do, then let them do it. Do not jump in and save them or they will never learn how to get the job done. If you do, they will learn that you are the only one who can fix things. Guess what, they will be right. You have to let them fall off the bike to learn how to stay on.<br /><br />17. Work for Yourself and go the extra mile<br /><br />What if you do not own a business yet that is, you work for someone else? I suggest that you think like You Inc. Treat your boss like he is your customer. You want your customer to be thrilled with You Inc. You want him to continue to buy more and higher value services from You Inc. At a minimum, adopting this attitude will be great experience. Think of your job as market research (for your business) that someone else is paying you to do. But remember, what goes around comes around, so give it everything you have. Your boss may even spot a future business partner in you. Always go that little bit further than you are asked to, give a little extra and you will go far. If you are asked to stay until 5:00 PM, stay until 5.30 PM, just do a little more than were asked.<br /><br />18. The key to success is laziness<br /><br />Which would you prefer 1% of 100 peoples income or 100 % of your own income. I would prefer the former, not just because I am lazy, but also because with this attitude my income can be unlimited. On my own, I can only earn 100% of my own income. On the other hand, there is nothing stopping me from working with 101 people or 1000 people. (why stop there?)<br /><br />If you have ever thought that you will succeed if you just work a little harder, put in some extra time, or just do more of what you are doing right now, then it is time you lifted your head and took a look around you. You probably know several hundred people who work hard. How many of them are really getting somewhere?<br /><br />The aim of the game is not to work harder; it is to create better results with less effort &#8211; finding ways of achieving more with less. In other words, to continually leverage your time, your efforts, your money and your knowledge.<br /><br />If you are paid an hourly wage, you will never earn more than the number of hours you work, but if you and your business are set up so that you are paid whether you work or not, then you have truly understood one of the key principles of success Leverage. Leverage is simply &#8211; the ability to do more with less. The aim of the game is to create an income stream that flows whether you work or not. Build assets that yield income.<br /><br />There are numerous ways to create Leverage. You can leverage yourself through people, systems &amp; processes, marketing and finance.<br /><br />19. Your Business is Like A Tree<br /><br />It is important to view your businesses as a living organism like a tree. Your business is either growing or it is dying. When does a tree stop growing when it is dying. The same is true for a business. You see the world does not stand still. New products, services and competitors are cropping up everyday. If your business does not evolve, then it will die.<br /><br />20. Change The Only Constant<br /><br />It is important to consider your business in the context of the wider business community and the world economy. Consider the Agrarian, Industrial, Information ages.<br /><br />In the Agrarian age (which lasted until early in the 20th century) 95 per cent of the population worked the land and the wealthiest people were the landowners.<br /><br />In the Industrial age (which lasted until about 1980) those that owned the factories created the most wealth.<br /><br />In the Information age those that owned the computers and software production, the telecommunications and have the information and corresponding managing tools created the great wealth.<br /><br />By considering just the length of time that these ages have lasted we can easily see that the pace of change continues to accelerate at an increasingly rapid rate. In the information age we are living through, it only takes about 18 months for the available information on the planet to double, where it took about 50 years a century ago.<br /><br />Some would argue that we have already left the Information age. With constant change, occurring at an increasingly rapid rate, it has never been more important for owners to:<br /><br />1. Work ON their business, rather than IN their business<br /><br />2. Work harder on themselves than their job<br /><br />3. Surround themselves with experts that can give them every competitive advantage<br /><br />21. How Do You Compete? <br /><br />With information moving so fast, people can copy, reproduce and have ready for sale any product or service in a matter of weeks. In todays economy, you cannot be cheaper than your competitors can for long. Therefore, the 21st key is that you have to know what information is important for your business success.<br /><br />The only way you can stay ahead of the market is to out-think, out-sell, out-market and out-maneuver your competitors. Your marketing, sales and customer service is crucial. You do not have to have the worlds best hamburger to sell billions of them.<br /><br />The next time you have a group of people in a room ask them who thinks McDonalds have the best hamburgers in the world? I will bet that not one person puts up their hand. Yet, who sells more hamburgers than anyone else does?<br /><br />Then ask the same group, who thinks they can build a better sales, marketing and distribution system for hamburgers than McDonalds. Once again, no one will put up his or her hand.<br /><br />22. Ask for more<br /><br />If you are going to build a great business, if you are going to make your fortune through business then you have got to ask for a whole lot more than you do right now.<br /><br />If you shoot for the stars, at least you will make it to the moon. If you do not ask, the answer is always NO. If you start to ask for more, and be grateful for it, you just might start receiving. Just remember, those who are grateful always receive more than those who just complain about life.<br /><br />Do not be afraid of someone saying NO. They are not rejecting you, it is just that your request may have come at a bad time or their goals are not quite aligned with yours. Do not take offence &#8230; every NO gets you closer to a YES.<br /><br />23. Abundance vs. Scarcity<br /><br />For most people getting more means that someone else has to go without. As intuitive as this may seem, nothing could be further from the truth! There is literally more than enough to go around.<br /><br />To succeed in business, you often have to depart from conventional wisdom. Because, as I mentioned earlier, the crowd is often wrong.<br /><br />Scarcity was first espoused by English Preacher Thomas Malthus, who concluded that England would run out of food as there were too many people for the available food production. Yet, even to this day we still produce more than enough food to feed the entire planet. Because we believe in scarcity; or more commonly known as supply and demand, much of it gets thrown away.<br /><br />In business, you have got to realize that there is always more than enough money to go around. When will you go out and get your share?<br /><br />Abundance is a mindset, a mindset that understands how technology has removed scarcity; how the old thoughts in economics are exactly that &#8211; old. (Read Paul Zane Pilzers book &#8211; Unlimited Wealth for more on this.)<br /><br />24. Work Smarter, not Harder<br /><br />Just to prove that thinking differently is so important, write down how much money you earned last year. Now add a zero to the end of it. You have just increased your income tenfold. To make that much money doing exactly what you are doing right now, how hard do you have to work?<br /><br />You have to stop working harder and start working smarter. Remember, people with jobs earn money while business owners and entrepreneurs make and create money.<br /><br />Some final words<br /><br />We have been discussing some key attitudinal concepts that will be fundamental to the success of your business. Yes, there are a lot of other important concepts about Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Operations, Employee Development, Finance, Cash Management and Administration. There is a lot that can be done to help you develop your business in all these areas.<br /><br />However, years of experience tell us that it is the fundamental attitude that you must embrace first. Your attitude is the essence of who you must BE as a business owner if you are to get what you truly want from your business.<br /><br />This experience is also consistent with the simple BE-DO-HAVE goal attainment philosophy. This philosophy says that in order to HAVE the things you want in life you must DO the right things. Before you can do those things, you must BE the person that is capable of doing the right things.<br /><br />A Complete Waste of Time!<br /><br />Now let me be brutally honest with you. Most of the people reading this article will gain absolutely no lasting benefit from having done so. It will have been a complete waste of time!<br /><br />Why would I say that? Do I not believe that what we have written has benefit? Absolutely it does. but then again, there are many great business books.

LONDON — Didier Drogba scored a hat trick to lead defending champion Chelsea to a 6-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday's opening day of the English Premier League season.
Florent Malouda put Chelsea ahead early before Drogba hit a free kick and a close-range finish to move into sixth place on Chelsea's list of career scoring leaders. Frank Lampard passed into the net before Drogba hit a deflected shot in at the near post and Malouda scored again in the last minute.
"It's a good start but there are difficult moments and they are coming," Drogba said.
But the big win gives Chelsea an early lift before last season's runner-up, Manchester United, kicks off against Newcastle on Monday. Arsenal is at Liverpool in Sunday's game.
Goalkeeper Joe Hart saved Manchester City as the big-spending Blues escaped with a 0-0 draw despite being dominated at Tottenham, while Blackpool returned to England's topflight for the first time since 1971 with a 4-0 win at Wigan.
Gary Taylor-Fletcher put the Tangerines ahead in the 16th and Marlon Harewood scored twice before halftime. Alex Baptiste then rounded off the scoring with 15 minutes left with a 30-yard shot.
Blackpool was temporarily atop the Premier League.
"I will take a photograph of the table and then retire," Blackpool manager Ian Holloway said.
Also Saturday, Aston Villa beat West Ham 3-0 with Brad Guzan in goal for the Villans, Blackburn beat Everton 1-0 with Tim Howard in goal of the Toffees and Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Stoke 2-1 with Marcus Hahnemann in goal for the winners. Sunderland lost Lee Cattermole to a 44th-minute red card but held on for a 2-2 draw with Birmingham, and Mark Hughes guided Fulham to a 0-0 draw at Bolton in his first game as manager. Clint Dempsey replaced Zoltan Gera in the 75th minute for the Cottagers.
Malouda tapped in against newly promoted West Brom in the sixth minute when goalkeeper Scott Carson dropped the ball. Drogba's 45th-minute free kick put him level with Jimmy Greaves in Chelsea's all-time scorers list and his close-range finish 10 minutes later put him ahead of the former England striker.
Lampard scored from about 12 yards and moved to 134 club goals when his shot from the edge of the area deflected off a defender. Drogba was substituted moments later and Malouda completed the rout in the last minute with a calm shot from Nicolas Anelka's pass over the defense.
Drogba scored 29 goals last season as Chelsea edged Manchester United for the title by a single point.
Of Chelsea's current squad, only Frank Lampard, in third place, has scored more goals than Drogba. The Ivory Coast striker is also the only non English player in Chelsea's top 10.
"I said last season I wanted to score goals and make history," Drogba said. "I don't want to stop here. I want to carry on and put my name higher."
Manchester City has spent more than $156 million on players since Tottenham edged it to fourth place and a Champions League qualifying berth last season. But none of its newcomers made an impact at White Hart Lane and young goalkeeper Joe Hart won the man-of-the-match award for a string of saves.
"The young kid had a great day today," Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said. "I thought it was a great performance from us. We were fantastic but we just couldn't get the two extra points.
"But if we play like this all season we will be right up there."
England midfielder James Milner is close to joining City but started for Villa against visiting West Ham and scored his team's third goal. Stewart Downing and Stiliyan Petrov put Villa 2-0 ahead before Milner's low shot from the edge of the area in the 66th.
Villa had American defender Eric Lichaj among its replacements but kept him on the bench to leave the Illinois native waiting for his Premier League debut.
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had predicted Everton could finish in the top four this season, but the Toffees lost to a 14th-minute goal by Nikola Kalinic at Blackburn.
Also Saturday, Sunderland lost Lee Cattermole to a 44th-minute red card but held on for a 2-2 draw with Birmingham, and Mark Hughes guided Fulham to a 0-0 draw at Bolton in his first game as manager.
American midfielder Stuart Holden hit the post in the 78th minute for Bolton, the closest either team came to a goal.
Arsenal is at Liverpool in Sunday's match.

Luis Fabiano tied it in the 63rd, striking Luca Cigarini's pass past goalkeeper Ruben Mino, substitute Frederic Kanoute converted Alvaro Negredo's pass in the 73rd and Kaunoute scored on a header 10 minutes later.
Barcelona didn't dress its eight Spanish national team players and didn't start Lionel Messi, who replaced Ibrahimovic in the 53rd.

In other games, it was: Brest 1, Auxerre 1; Lorient 1, Nice 2; Saint-Etienne 3, Sochaux 2; Arles-Avignon 0, Lens 1.

Spencer Hall runs through exactly 100 of the most random thoughts possible on college football's upcoming season. They may not all be factual, but they're certainly accurate, if you catch our drift.
100. Boise State's Kellen Moore has beautiful footwork. He will never take off his shoes on national television, because if he did you would see that he has no feet and four hands. It's not easy being a quarterback who can type with his feet, but he bears the burden well. 
99. The Thursday Night games on ESPN this year are more than the usual paltry hors d'oeuvres for the weekend: Auburn/Miss State, Miami at Pitt, Texas A&M at Oklahoma State, South Florida at West Virginia...okay, these are the usual hors d'oeuvres. We're all just very hungry for football, and anything sounds like fillet mignon at this point.  
98. Arkansas running back Ronnie Wingo has a spectacular name, and more spectacular when heard in an Arkansas accent. 
97. Oregon will travel to Knoxville, look horrible as it did against Boise State in Week 1 of 2009. Tennessee fans will grow giddy with excitement; Oregon fans will be crestfallen. 
96. At the end of the year you will look back as Oregon wins nine games, Tennessee's lack of depth crushes them down the stretch in the SEC, and giggle at assuming an early season nonconference game means anything. 
95. Les Miles will microwave popcorn in his office. The instructions will say two and a half minutes. Les Miles will rely on his gut to tell him when it's done. 
94. Les Miles is going to be eating some burnt popcorn, and will blame Jordan Jefferson while he does it. 
93. Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder will watch Alabama play Georgia State in the first year of their FCS football program's existence. On this night he will come within inches of dying of envy, but will be saved by his wife's quick thinking as she distracts him from the game with some beefy, delicious five-layer Taco Bell tacos. 
92. This actually would distract Snyder, who appears on Chip Brown's talk show in Austin and plugs the sponsor Taco Bell like he hasn't eaten in years. If you haven't heard it, seek it out: he is disturbingly enthusiastic about Taco Bell. 
91. Given Snyder's pallor and legendary late-night film sessions, this may be true, since he may be a vampire. 
90. The Nebraska farewell tour will be milder than expected, since the Big 12 North has all of the unit cohesion of the former Yugoslav Republic. 
89. One nasty thing, however: the Huskers aren't going to pick up a single towel in an away locker room all season, and they might take the cleaning supplies, because it's not like they're ever coming back. Don't lie. You'd do it, too. 
88. Jared Crick will make no one forget Ndamukong Suh on the defensive line for the Cornhuskers. 
87. This is much like saying being attacked by wolves does not obliterate the memory of being mauled by a bear. They're both bad things to be on the end of regardless of order. 
86. Craig James and Mike Patrick will be calling a game when Patrick will notice that Adam James is sitting in the booth. "Who's that?" "Oh, no one," says Craig James.  
85. The NCAA regrets to inform you that everyone on your football team is ineligible due to agent contact. Yes, your team. All of them. 
84. All of this comes from contact with one agent. He's really good. You might want his number. 
83. Georgia's Mark Richt will continue to heat up his scorching hot seat by winning 10 games on the year. In Georgia, "hot" means "comfortably cool," a confusion leading to many assuming the frigid city of Atlanta is in fact "hot." This could not be further from the truth! Show up for summer visits in heavy wool. You won't regret it. 
82. Ohio State coach Jim Tressel says you may see Ohio State throw the ball more this season.  
81. Ohio State threw the ball 13 times in a single game twice last year. 
80. Craig James and Mike Patrick will be calling a game. Patrick will open his mouth to call out the down and distance. Before he can speak, Adam James will say "first and 10" into his headset. A confused Patrick will look to Craig James. At the break, James will say, "I think you're underestimating my son's talents, Mike." 
79.  You will not send Iowa DE Adrian Clayborn a Christmas card. This will be the worst idea you ever have. 
78. Don't worry about sending him one late. He'll find you soon enough. 
77. West Virginia running back Noel Devine is a joy to watch, and is especially cute when between plays he flutters over to his feeder full of sugar water and refuels for his next carry. 
76. This has to be Lee Corso's last season on Gameday. 
75. A possible replacement for him? Bob Davie. 
74. Did you know I hated you and everyone in the world? If you just read No. 75, you'd know that now. 
73.  Frank Beamer will open up Bud Foster's lunchpail. Inside: a peanut butter sandwich, a thermos full of coffee, a cookie, and the same two losses Virginia Tech always piles up due to their perennially anemic offense. 
72. Kentucky will open the football season with both flagship schools captained by African-American coaches. 
71. Purdue coach Danny Hope is really looking forward to letting kicker Carson Wiggs attempt a 70-yard field goal in a game . 
70. Danny Hope and Lane Kiffin have something in common:  lunatic field goal attempts. 
69. This last sentence should have made Purdue fans vomit uncontrollably onto their computers. Hope your warranty covers that, because it doesn't. 
68. Jeremiah Masoli will taste many different grasses of the SEC this year, but his favorite will be the delicious fescue of Arkansas' Frank Broyles field. Herbaceous, smooth, and with just a hint of mint, it really is the perfect complement to diet of high impact hits and hopeless scrambles. His second favorite? LSU, if only for the hint of bourbon in every mouthful. 
67. None of this will be Masoli's fault, because at Oregon he had two things he will not have at Ole Miss: an offensive line and an offensive coaching staff. 
66. Christian Ponder is the nation's best quarterback who was also a character in an early Puritan religious tract. 
65. Irrational record prediction one: USC is on the first year of probation and a bowl ban, indicating a 95.8727% possibility they will go undefeated because teams on probation with a bowl ban love to go undefeated.  
64. Case Keenum will occupy the Colt Brennan Memorial Voting Slot for people who vote for postseason awards based exclusively on throwing for scads of TDs in a pass-mad offense. He plays at UCLA when Houston goes there on September 18th, a game which Houston could realistically win. 
63. Houston also lost to UTEP after beating Texas Tech last year, so just pick one bizarro game on the schedule and assume they lose it. You'll try to use sense, but that's your first mistake. At SMU? Sure, with a combined over so immense that has to be expressed in math you wouldn't understand. 
62. Landry Jones is not a new quarterback: please remember that he started after Sam Bradford's injury in the BYU game. 
61. Please also remember that were it not for one bulky Mormon and gravity, Oklahoma does way, way better than their 8-5 record last season, where Jones still managed to throw for 3,000 yards and 26 TDs. Plus:  MUSTACHE POWER . If he brings it back, no harm can come to him. 
60. Ole Miss offensive lineman Terrell Brown is 6' 11" and 395 pounds. 
59. Jeremiah Masoli's rushing numbers will be significantly limited by taking snaps in Brown's shadow, where lack of sunlight will give him a nasty case of rickets. 
58. Kirk Herbstreit will cross the Corso Rubicon this year, finally becoming more gloriously orange than his mentor. 
57. Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy will be fired in a green, environmentally friendly way in keeping with T. Boone Pickens' energy plan for the new millennium. I'm thinking tied to a windmill and ejected with the power of the wind (like a man).
56. If Colorado and Maryland played, would every spectator's watch run a few seconds slower after watching it? Does this have unique implications for the Special Theory of Relativity? And if so, do I have to watch it? Because I really, really don't want to watch it. 
55. On the other hand, if you want to experience Jamarcus Russell Drank-o-Vision without the cough syrup nausea, this would be the way to do it. 
54. THIS IS MY WAY OF SAYING THEY'RE AMAZINGLY SLOW GET IT HUH? 
53. Denard Robinson will win the starting job at Michigan. 
52. UConn will beat Michigan at home, starting a merry toboggan ride to hell for the Wolverines. 
51. Michigan will recover and win eight games despite fielding a secondary made up of stuntmen constantly on fire and allowing receivers to run unimpeded behind them.  
50. Notre Dame fans should just point and laugh at Michigan, since it will be easier than watching the first half of their season: a six game streak of Purdue, Michigan, Michigan State, Stanford, Boston College, and Pitt. Even their breather cupcake early isn't easy: Western Michigan. 
49. Die, "Zombie Nation." Die a thousand deaths. 
48. Ditto for you, "Thunderstruck." 
47. Dion Lewis will have a spectacular season derailed when, after his 52nd carry in week six his right leg flies off and leaves him hopping one-legged toward the endzone against Syracuse. 
46. Because this is Syracuse, Lewis will still stand a good chance of scoring. 
45. The Pac-10 will return to glorious pre-USC form. Winner will be decided by random die roll in the last week of November. 
44. Georgia has no reason to do anything but throw the ball 15 times a game and run the daylights out of Caleb King and Washaun Ealey , especially given their deep and experienced offensive line. 
43. They will do exactly the opposite of this, and will lose again to Florida in Jacksonville. 
42. Craig James smiles at his son, who now is the play-by-play announcer for ESPN on Saturday afternoon games. A lawsuit is pending. Mike Patrick stews at a bar with Mike Leach, who nods his head in sympathy. 
41. Kirk Cousins will become the most accomplished, polished, and savvy quarterback in a generation to blow at least two late leads for Michigan State this year. 
40. Georgia Tech will win the ACC again this year. Paul Johnson will celebrate by cut-blocking ACC Commissioner John Swofford on the award podium in front of a screaming crowd of hundreds just because he can. 
39. Tommy Tuberville will award Texas Tech's starting QB job to the same middle-aged man he's started at quarterback wherever he's been. In fact, he's just going to call him Ben Leard and see if anyone notices. 
38. BYU should just book their annual suites for the Las Vegas Bowl, aka "The Lavell Edwards Classic." 
37. Mississippi State's Chris Relf is 6' 4", 240, and sort of like a discount store Tim Tebow . Big Lots Tebow, though, not Target Tebow. That's Cam Newton, and don't you forget him or his tastefully designed styles. 
36. I would say that Columbus police should double up their security for the visit by the truculent Miami Hurricanes fanbase, but they can probably handle the 150 fans who will actually leave Miami and show up for a Hurricanes road game. 
35. In the spirit of 2010 current events, 10,000 Buckeye fans will take their talents to South Beach never to return. LEBRON JAMES JOKE QUOTA MET. (They will end up living in North Broward County.) 
34. Miami QB Jacory Harris will have a spectacular season provided he can overcome his inner Rex Grossman, since Harris does tend to have a "F--- it, I'm going deep" streak in him. 
33. Canes DE Allen Bailey has a name for massive Ole Miss tackle Terrell Perry, and it is "my average hang clean."
32. This last note brought to you by People Who Will Never Forget That Allen Bailey Is  The Only Current College Football Player Who Has Killed An Alligator With A Shovel. 
31. Arizona State LB Vontaze Burfict will lead the Pac-10 in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties this year. 
30. It will be more awesome than you will care to admit. 
29. Florida QB John Brantley will throw a beautiful ball, but his best friend will be Harvin-back Andre Debose, who is finally healthy enough to assume the role of defense-botching wideout/running back popping up all over the formation. 
28. South Carolina QB Stephen Garcia will be benched in no fewer than three games this season for other quarterbacks. 
27. Stephen Garcia will re-enter each game after Steve Spurrier realizes that, for the third year in a row, he has no one better .
26. All of this will be Larry David-level uncomfortable and funny. 
25. Joe Paterno will resign, citing age and the continuing negative influence of color television on youth as his reasons for leaving. 
24. 6' 7" Ryan Mallett , in an effort to improve Arkansas' sagging defense, plays middle linebacker on pass plays by waggling his arms in the middle of the field to knock down passes. 
23. This will prove to be Arkansas' best pass defense play all year. 
22. Joe Schad will report [story X].
21. Joe Schad will report [story Y].
20. Joe Schad will report that Joe Schad is reporting that [story X] is [story Y]. 
19. Joe Schad will vanish into a quantum singularity created by his own multiple personas reporting 15 conflicting stories simultaneously. 
18. Alabama versus Auburn will decide the winner of the SEC West. 
17. Texas will continue to rob announcers of the joy of saying "Fozzie Whittaker on the carry" by not starting the most splendidly named running back in the United States. 
16. Texas will still not, despite a rededication to the run game, have a run game. 
15. Missouri will, at the end of the season, show up at the Big Ten's winter meetings and just see if anyone notices. Then, things will get awwwwwkward. 
14. Houston Nutt will somehow win seven games. I have no idea how this will happen, but it will. Additionally, Ole Miss will somehow beat a top 10 team this year, and then lose to the unranked team they face the next week. This is the Right Reverend Nutt; he has powers, and you will respect them. 
13. Congratulations, Washington QB Jake Locker ! You're 2010's "West Coast player named by an East Coast guy in a sports argument to show he's not totally ignorant of West Coast football." They won't see a single game you play in, but they will know your name and won't hesitate to drop it in conversation. 
12. That should read like "I don't have an East Coast bias. I have Pac-10 friends. Lots of them, actually." /struggles to name anyone in the Pac-10 besides Jake Locker. 
11. Texas A&M will again be unexpectedly better than you might think. Once you notice this, however, they will go on an epic three game losing streak just to keep you guessing. 
10. Alabama RB Trent Richardson will have a more impressive year than Heisman winner Mark Ingram . 
9. Cal RB Shane Vereen will have a more impressive year than either of them, but since Jake Locker has assumed the role of "Pac-10 Token Player," you may not vote for him for any major awards, East Coast. 
8. Florida RB Jeff Demps will injure himself tripping over the sound barrier on a run at one point in the season. 
7. Georgia Tech running back Anthony Allen will amaze you with his flat-footed gait. He runs like a man whose feet are asleep and takes longer strides than Vince Young running hurdles, but it somehow works. Bonus points awarded for flying braids, which take a tenth of a second off all forty times. 
6. Georgia WR AJ Green will continue to have better production than Alabama WR Julio Jones despite having Joe Cox and redshirt freshman Aaron Murray throwing to him in successive seasons. Direct all hatemail to Your Mom's House, Alabama fans, since that's where I will be. 
5. Wisconsin RB John Clay will harm people and make you enjoy watching it.  
4. Also: Scott Tolzien is the most Wisconsin quarterback ever? Yes, Scott Tolzien is the most Wisconsin quarterback ever. You've been ousted from your throne, Jim Sorgi. 
3. UCLA safety Rahim Moore has an eating disorder. He only eats footballs, and can't stop. It's healthier than you think, since it will get him a generous NFL salary, and the nation's lead in interceptions for the second year running. 
2. Florida safety Ahmad Black will be right behind him in the totals. 
1. Vanderbilt coach Robbie Caldwell will find his early work as a turkey inseminator insightful, since being Vandy's coach in the SEC has a lot in common with turkey insemination. (Vanderbilt = the turkey.)

It's been a few weeks but the Full Court Press is back; every Blazers link you need is right here.  Whether you want to crush on Rudy Fernandez's "tight Spanish frame" or simply want to know who is interested in trading for him (or both), you're in the right place.
But first an announcement.  This weekend over at Liberty High School in Hillsboro is the  Nike Global Challenge . The schedule runs 2PM - 10PM from Friday through Sunday.   The list of US players  includes Tony Wroten, Perry Ellis and Austin Rivers.  The Global Challenge is a perennially slept-on tournament. You should join the NBA scouts and national recruiting writers and check out the action if you get a chance this weekend. 
And here's what you might have missed on Blazersedge recently...

Without further ado,  click through  for health updates on Greg Oden and Brandon Roy, two looks at Rich Cho, everything Rudy, a few alternate takes on the "drama" from last week, life advice (!) from KP2, video of an NBA star switching four lanes with the top down screaming out money ain't a thing, Charles Barkley shows his love for the Rose City and Michael Jordan, and a bunch more.

Brian T. Smith with brief  health updates on Greg Oden and Brandon Roy ...
Oden said he is "positive" he will be ready for training camp for the 2010-11 season. The Blazers center has recently been working out with Portland strength and conditioning coach Bobby Medina in Indiana. Oden said he has lost considerable weight while going through daily five-hour drills. He plans to lose more weight, but would not reveal his ideal total.
Roy said he is "back to normal" and feels better than he has in a long time. Roy has also worked with Medina, while adding a personal trainer, and has focused on his conditioning and overall strength. "I'm in the gym everyday and getting stronger," Roy said. "I'm extremely excited about this year. More of a workman-like approach. Really not a lot to talk about. Just trying to prepare hard and get ready for a big season."
Jason Quick with  an introduction to Rich Cho , including a nice recommendation from his former boss Rick Sund...
Sund said he never went into a negotiation with a player without Cho by his side, and he never did a trade without first consulting Cho. Because of that, Sund said he can offer first-hand knowledge that Cho is not a "yes-man." 
"And thank God he wasn't a yes man, because he saved me from making a few bad deals," Sund said. "He is his own man, and he's a strong personality. When we would get into meetings and he believed in something strongly, you knew it. I loved having him on my side, I can tell you that."     
Jonathan Abrams of the New York Times  on Rich Cho ...
Cho, who once worked as an engineer for Boeing, graduated from Pepperdine's law school. After immigrating to the United States from Burma with his family as a child, Cho developed a strong interest in sports. He recognized sooner than most that a law degree would be a useful tool for a sports executive. He served his internship with the Sonics while attending law school and soon after his graduation in 1997 was named Seattle's director of basketball affairs.
"He had a law degree and a diverse background, but he also has a pretty rich basketball background," Larry Miller, Portland's team president, said of Cho. "That was one of the things that was really appealing. He's got some pretty vast experience when it comes to working for a basketball organization. I've heard him referred to as the Swiss army knife of basketball."
Cho said, he will use an "eyes, ears, mind" approach.
So does anyone want Rudy Fernandez? Jason Quick  mentioned three teams  in his report: Chicago, New York and Boston.
Chicago might, according to Sam Smith, and is  offering Taj Gibson .
From what I've heard it's in Portland's hands now for what they want. I've heard the Bulls have a pretty good shot, but nothing matters until it's done. Let's not overstate Fernandez, who always has sounded better than he has performed. But he'd be an excellent addition, and as I wrote Monday the No. 1 guy I'd still pursue.    
Mike McGraw of DailyHerald.com  splashes some cold water ...
The Oregonian mentioned the Bulls as a potential destination for Portland shooting guard Rudy Fernandez. League insiders wonder if the Blazers are really serious about moving Fernandez. The Bulls' inquiries earlier this summer were rebuffed.
At this point, if Fernandez is unhappy with his limited role in Portland, the Bulls may not be his best option, considering they've already added Kyle Korver and Ronnie Brewer at two guard.
According to reports, the Blazers are willing to accommodate Fernandez'trade request and are looking for a first-round draft pick in return.
I've seen rumors of the Bulls offering Taj Gibson for Fernandez, but cannot imagine that happening. You don't trade a competent big man for an unproven guard.
So what about the Knicks? Alan Hahn of Newsday  writes ...
The Knicks are on the wish list of yet another NBA player who is seeking a trade, but just like with Chris Paul , the Knicks don't appear to have what it takes to make a deal for Rudy Fernandez .
The Trail Blazers shooting guard, who was an All-Rookie selection two seasons ago, has struggled in a reduced role behind all-star Brandon Roy . The Knicks have inquired a few times over the last year about acquiring Fernandez but have never been able to come up with a solution.
"They just don't have anything [Portland] would want," a person with knowledge of the situation told Newsday.
Keith Idec of NorthJersey.com  writes ...
The Knicks' quest for Portland's Rudy Fernandez, however, remains on hold through the weekend. Their inability to send the Blazers a first-round pick until 2014 is a likely sticking point.
Kelly Dwyer  on Rudy ...
Either way, with just one year and just under $1.25 million left on his contract (there's a quite affordable team option for $2.1 million to follow in 2011-12), Fernandez could be a steal. And even if he keeps playing the way he's played - slightly below average - he's a steal at ... $1.25 million!
So yes, team, give up that first-round pick. Give it up in an instant. This guy is either going to be a bust-out player for you, or well worth what a team like Chicago or Boston (with a selection in the low teens or probable 20s) would end up paying for a first-round guaranteed deal at that slot anyway. If you kept the pick and ended up drafting a guy of Rudy's 2010-11 caliber, you'd be ecstatic. Even with him playing at his lowest ebb, as we may have seen last season.
This is worth chasing down, NBA. Take advantage of a team that might not know what it has.
Brian T. Smith with  an intimate look at the Rudy Fernandez situation ...
A year ago, he was untouchable. Inspiring and immaculate.
There was the shot. The touch. The energy and excitement. The living definition of a thrilling, wide-eyed sharpshooter. Talent, youth and potential all wrapped up in a tight Spanish frame.
There was also the look. The look can never be counted out, and no one ever doubted that Portland Trail Blazers guard Rudy Fernandez had it. There was the hair. The endless 5 o'clock shadow. The way he appeared to effortlessly glide on the court and off it.
Was it YOUR fault that last week's "drama" wound up a disappointment.  Nathan Begley  writes ...
Quick is taking some heat for the buildup to a rather anti-climatic story, however, I would argue that the buildup was at least to some extent, fan driven. If Quick had something ultra-juicy, he'd likely have to break it quickly for fear of being scooped. The issue at hand is that Quick left a vacuum in his lead up and fans rushed to fill that vacuum with best case and worse case scenarios and quasi-plausible fears. What article is going to live up to that kind of drum-up? In the old days before the internet, people would have heard Quick announce that he had a story about some player drama, shoot the breeze about it around the water cooler, and then wait in anticipation until the story came out. Now, that announcement gets placed in a Petri dish where it can quickly mutate and grow until when the article itself comes out, the expectations are completely out of proportion.    
Here's Mike Barrett's take on the  situation ...
I also know that Blazer fans have come down pretty hard on The Oregonian's Jason Quick, who really lit a fire with this story earlier in the week by basically saying some big-time drama is on the way for the team in the next 24 to 48 hours, and evidently was referring to Rudy's situation. That got everyone's attention, and people were frustrated when nothing really came of it. I'll just say this- Jason is very well sourced around the NBA, has been at this a long time, and doesn't have a history of just tossing stuff against the wall to see if it sticks. That would be irresponsible and that's not what he does.
Quick obviously had a reason why he reported what he did, and had to have gotten some information that led him to believe this was coming to a head in a hurry. That's why it's interesting now to hear both sides say that nothing significant has changed in this case. I refuse to believe Jason simply made it up to draw attention to himself. That's not how he operates. I give him the benefit of the doubt, and it's true that where there's smoke there is usually fire. It just seems like this is perhaps a well-controlled burn, and not the out-of-control blaze everyone thinks it is. And isn't that usually the case when you're dealing with rumors?
As you probably know, agents are responsible for a lot of what gets leaked in stories like this. But, Rudy's agent, Andy Miller, is very reputable, and hasn't gone on the record confirming or denying anything. Whoever is being sourced, from Rudy's camp, sounds like they're agreeing that nothing has really changed from the initial reports.
David Aldridge wrote last week that Portland had the  21st best (9th worst) summer in the league ...
On the last day on the job, knowing it was his last day, Pritchard nonetheless did what he'd done for four seasons in Portland -- he got the Blazers more young talent. Most people had Babbitt as a Lottery pick; he went 16th. Williams will likely step in when the Blazers move Rudy Fernandez. Cho, from Oklahoma City, is well-regarded around the league. His first task is deciding whether to keep Andre Miller or to put a package together that could bring Tony Parker from San Antonio or Chris Paul from New Orleans. But if the Blazers can get Oden and Joel Pryzbilla healthy, allowing Marcus Camby to play more minutes at power forward, they should make a move in the West without a major roster upheaval.    
Craig Morgan of FoxSportsArizona quotes  Hedo Turkoglu on the Raptors organization .
"People have to realize something is wrong with that organization and nobody wants to go there any more," he said in a phone interview from Turkey, where he is captaining the Turkish national team at the World Championships. "It's not just the players who see this."
Kevin Pelton is  doling out life advice  with six tips for making a career in Sports Stats.
Even if you happen to be the most insightful basketball analyst in the world, if you can't communicate that information in a way teams can understand, your work will never help anyone. This means both being able to write reports and explain verbally to basketball lifers who may not be familiar with statistical analysis what the numbers mean.
This is part of the task for analytical writers as well, so it's nothing new for me, but even with this background I'm still searching for new ways to communicate my point all the time. Improving your ability to communicate is one of the benefits of blogging. There are two basic ways to improve - practice and learning from others. That's another benefit of reading as much as you possibly can.
Somehow KP2 forgot to include tip #7: "Co-opt a team blog with a rapid fan base, get a great nickname, start a podcast, throw your tie on the court after some bad officiating to gain respect, but wind up getting arrested."  
Paul Allen topped John Canzano's top 25  most influential people in Oregon Sports list ...
1. Paul Allen (2): Trail Blazers owner, 57, owns the state's only professional major league sports franchise and is operating with a sense of urgency as he battles non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. He fired/hired general managers, made changes in his coaching staff, and has his fingerprints on roster moves. Allen owns the state's top sports venue (Rose Garden Arena), and flexed muscle with a proposed entertainment-district development that effectively pushed Portland's Triple-A baseball club out of the Rose Quarter, and ultimately out of state.    
Other Blazers: Larry Miller (6), Greg Oden's Knee (8), Brandon Roy (10), Hubert Kolde (12), Nate McMillan (13), Rich Cho (15), Sarah Mensah (16) and Cheri Hanson (24).
