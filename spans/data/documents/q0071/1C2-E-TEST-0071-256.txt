Netherlands are one of the favorites to go through despite the fact that they are in the so-called group of death along with France, Italy and Romania. Netherlands coach Marco van Basten has put together a formidable squad that on any given day can challenge the best of them.
 
With Wesley Sneijder, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben in red-hot form, it is evident the Oranje will be giving vaunted teams a run for their money. However the Dutch might miss the talents of the wily Clarence Seedorf, who has elected to keep out of the squad.
 
Star players: Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Dirk Kuyt and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink
 
 
World Champions Italy were dealt an early blow to making it a double when talismanic captain Fabio Cannavaro was injured. The onus for coach Roberto Donadoni is to find a competent replacement for the Real Madrid man.
 
Marco Materazzi and Andrea Barzagli will have a tough task ahead of them. In Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso, Italy have a formidable midfield that can give any side a run for their money. Massimo Ambrosini, Mauro Camoranesi and Fabio Grosso will have crucial roles to play in the absence of Cannavaro.
 
Star Players: Alessandro Del Piero, Luca Toni and Gianluigi Buffon
