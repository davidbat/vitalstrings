The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™
The UT Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management has created a database to track publications in 24 leading business journals . The database contains titles and author affiliations of papers published in these journals since 1990. The information in the database is used to provide the top 100 business school rankings since 1990 based on the total contributions of faculty.
Additionally,  the database can also be searched by:
Any journal or combination of journals between the time period 1990 to date to get a ranking of schools
School name to see a list of publications by a school for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date
Author name to see a list of publications by an author for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date
Key phrase in article name to see a list of publications containing that phrase for any combination of journals and time period between 1990 to date
The Jindal School of Management  maintains and keeps  this web site current to provide timely data  on research productivity in leading research journals across major disciplines in business schools. The school has worked hard to ensure data integrity, but as with any project of this type where the affiliation data is not always clear, some errors may exist.  If you spot an error, please send us the corrections at Top 100 Admin .
