By Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa
University of Texas System Chancellor Francisco G. Cigarroa, M.D. , participated in a roundtable discussion at The White House about the transparency of college and university costs to students and their families. Cigarroa was one of ten leaders of colleges and universities invited to attend the event, which was hosted by Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Richard Cordray and Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Muñoz.
“I am honored to have had the opportunity to participate in a discussion about the importance of cost transparency with Vice President Biden, Education Secretary Duncan, senior White House officials and colleagues at other universities and colleges,” Cigarroa said. “Undergraduate student access and success is an integral part of my Framework for Advancing Excellence Across The University of Texas System, which the Board of Regents unanimously approved last August. Providing students and their families with clear and concise information regarding the cost to earn a college degree is a top priority for all our universities. The UT System already provides students with access to information regarding cost of attendance, financial aid options and net costs after grants and scholarships through a variety of communication mediums,” Cigarroa added.
