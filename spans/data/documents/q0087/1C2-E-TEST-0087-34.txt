OUR MISSION
OUR GOAL
The CyberSecurity and Emergency    Preparedness Institute (CSEPI) at The University of Texas at Dallas (UT    Dallas) is recognized nationally as service provider in emergency    preparedness, benchmarking, and cyber security to local, state, national    and international organizations.  The Institute has three Centers; Cyber Security Research    and Education Center , Global    Information Assurance Center and Emergency Preparedness    Center , each    of which addresses a separate set of issues in cyber crime, information    assurance, and emergency preparedness.  The Institute is one of    only a handful of entities of its kind in the United States. 
The UT Dallas CyberSecurity and    Emergency Preparedness Institute conducts leading edge research and    implements critically needed programs for Homeland Security in the areas    of network security, systems and language security, data and    applications security, intrusion detection, security theory and    protocols, security engineering, cross cutting themes, information    assurance, and emergency preparedness.  Through this research,    CSEPI has achieved global recognition in areas vital to national and    international security.
Our Goal is to enhance our international recognition as a Center of Excellence in    several of the major areas of research and system implementation related    to cyber security, information assurance, and emergency preparedness.  Partner with other universities, government agencies, and corporate    entities to complement this goal.
