One of the nice things about having a university in the neighborhood is that it sometimes offers an opportunity to pick some pretty smart brains. This is a subject area we can all use as much picked from smart brains as we can get.  From my e-box:
UT Dallas' School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences has scheduled a public forum for Tuesday to discuss the unprecedented wave of political protests breaking out in nations throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
The forum is being organized by Dr. Robert Lowry, program head for political science, and will take place Tuesday, from 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in the UT Dallas Conference Center.
Students, faculty and staff members are invited to attend the forum. The event is also open to members of the community who have an interest in the historic changes taking place this year in many nations in Asia and Africa.
The forum will begin with a series of speakers, who will each offer a brief presentation, providing insight into various topics related to the recent events.
·         Dr. Kacem Ayachi, a 2009 UT Dallas political science PhD graduate, will speak at the forum about the new era of mass politics in the Middle East. Ayachi is a native of Tunisia, one of the first nations affected by the political turmoil.
·         Dr. David Parry, assistant professor of emerging media and communications in the School of Arts and Humanities, will talk about the role of social media in the protests and the lessons that can be learned.
·         Lowry will discuss large-scale institutional change and significant research about conditions required for stable democracies.
After the speakers finish their brief talks, audience members will be invited to ask questions or offer comments. Organizers encourage participants to keep their comments brief and on-topic. They also request that attendees and participants behave respectfully toward individuals who may express differing opinions.
