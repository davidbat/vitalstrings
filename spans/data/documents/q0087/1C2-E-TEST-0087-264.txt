ISA
Indian Students Association
The Indian Students Association (ISA) is a non-profit socio-cultural association within the Student Organizations’ Forum at the University of Texas at Dallas. UTD is the home for hundreds of Indians. ISA represents each and every one of them and apart from striving to make everyone feel at home, miles away from home we also draw a flux of colorful Indian culture through our various programs. The purpose of the ISA is to provide an opportunity for all students of Indian origin to interact and share the joy of the culture and heritage of India, and to educate other students, by bringing awareness.
Our Composition
The Indian Students Association here at UTD represents the 1400 Indian students enrolled at our University. Every year we have more than 450 Indian students coming into our University, including Fall and Spring semesters, whom the organization guides and helps through basic amenities.
