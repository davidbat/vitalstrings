Mission
To be an effective communicator, one must accurately predict and plan for how messages will be received - even by someone who speaks the same language. In this way, all communication is an act of translation.
Since 1980, The Center for Translation Studies at The University of Texas at Dallas has received widespread national and international recognition for its pioneering role in enriching and promoting the study and practice of literary translation.
