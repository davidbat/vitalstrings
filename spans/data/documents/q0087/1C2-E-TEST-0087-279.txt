Von Howard Ebron received a B.S. in Chemistry in 1993 from the University of the Philippines Los Baños and later worked as a Chemist at San Miguel Packaging Products, Philippines. He then obtained a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2002.
Upon graduation Dr. Ebron became a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at the Department of Chemistry and the NanoTech Institute, University of Texas at Dallas and was involved in the synthesis, characterization and fabrication of conducting polymer electrodes as well as investigating various carbon nanotube fibers, papers, and composites as electrodes in solid-state supercapacitor devices.
He is currently a Research Scientist and Laboratory Manager and his research interests include fuel cell artificial muscles and energy-storage materials utilizing conducting polymer nanofibers and carbon nanotube composites.”
