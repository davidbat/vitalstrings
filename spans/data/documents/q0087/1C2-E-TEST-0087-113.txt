UT Dallas is an excellent university and, with recent Texas funding, will soon be a Tier 1 university. It's a safe and (with the exception of construction) clean school with modern architecture. There are many outstanding professors there who have to stay on their toes to keep up with the high achieving students.
If you're looking for a party school, UTD isn't for you, unless you consider a chess tournament or research opportunity to be a party :D. Most students at UTD are more serious about their studies. There isn't a big Greek scene either.
The student body is highly eclectic which, in my opinion, makes it one of the best schools in Texas. Students are a mix of many ages, races and interests.
Go Radio UTD!
