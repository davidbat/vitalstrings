-Even though it is a public university, it has the feel of a private one. Within a couple of classes, all of my teachers knew me by name and sometimes even knew a few things about me. In later semesters, they would recognize me and we would have friendly chats where they would ask me how I was progressing and if I needed any advisement.
-I believe that more guidance when it comes to advising is necessary. Sometimes uniformity in information of degree plans was lacking.
-I think that the size of the school is a big advantage. Although it is still somewhat unknown, the school has been growing in size every year as it garners more attention in status and rankings. I think of its initial obscurity it was a great place for students to seek friendships with the faculty and because of this there is more attention given to students and more nurturing from professors.
-I would like to see the Senior Capstone course (Strategic Management BA 4305) be more standardized across the sections. Some Professors focus on the Cap Sim program others on writing business cases. I heavy blend of the two was the model used at my last college and I believe the experience leads to better managers and leaders.
-Focusing on quantitative methodologies sets UTD apart from other business schools in this area. Secondly, the research and business cases from the graduate level are studied in the undergraduate courses giving a local and real world advantage I have not seen at my other colleges. Lastly, the undergraduate course offerings in my concentration (Operations Management) are amazing. I have had 3 courses giving my experience with SAP ECC, also coursework in Lean Six Sigma and Project Management will give me a competitive advantage during my entry and mid career.
-The business program should work even closer with local industries, and it should have more efficient marketing to their future growth in the local community.
-The faculty here at UTD have a commitment to their students' success and professional growth. The content they teach in their classes and experience they share with students provides valuable insight into the industry.
-I wish the classes were more interactive. Some professors have it right by getting the class involved in discussions but some classes use the old point at slides methods.
-Our business program is very diverse. Teachers come from all over the world and have real world experience in their fields. Our students are also diverse and any given classroom session has student representatives of at least 10 different countries. This helps break cultural barriers and facilitate cross-cultural understanding when we break into teams in group work.
-I would like to see more variety in extracurricular activities.
-Because I already work in a professional environment, what I have learned has enhanced my chances of promotion into a middle management role within my firm. UTD are very thorough in the curriculum. I am ready to be a manager. I plan to attend UTD for my MS Accounting next year.
-I think the amount of assigned homework should be increased. Some of my classes had little or no graded homework.
-Professors are able to work with students on an individual basis and get to know them.  The school emphasizes teamwork a lot. Many classes assign group projects. The business school is the biggest school on campus and so it has lots of amenities to make studying and lounging around more appealing.
-Lectures need to be geared towards preparing students to become more entrepreneurial and 'out of the box thinkers'. Some lessons and lectures are outdated in a global business arena.
