An Authentic Faith Community
We exist to stretch students into an intentional relationship with the Father and with one another.
“”Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your hear and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the great and first commandment.  And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets“ (Matthew 22:36-40)
Authentic Faith Community
What is it? We are a student-led, student-driven group and our intention is for members to teach, encourage, and strengthen one another (“as iron sharpens iron,” Psalm 27:17), while learning how to be a biblical body of believers (1 Corinthians 12).
We are an open community and welcome people traveling along different spiritual paths (regardless of whether you are questioning Christianity, raised in church, not raised in church, a Christian who does not have it all together). Here, students are encouraged to share their questions, thoughts, doubts, and life issues. Everyone has something to bring and something to take away. If you are looking for a specific kind of group, or wondering about specific groups, please ask.
