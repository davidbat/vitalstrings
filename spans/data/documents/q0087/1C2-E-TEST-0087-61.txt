The Business of IT Security
According to a research conducted by Symantec Corporation, 97 percent of cyber threats                     are behavior based, while only 3 percent target technology. What this tells us is                     that the majority of a business's efforts to protect their data should focus on                     people not technology. Now that is not to say that technology is not important.                     Rather, that hackers understand that good technology exists to protect corporate                     data and, if properly implemented, will severely inhibit the possibility of a successful                     cyber attack. Thus, cybercriminals are increasingly turning to behavioral-directed                     attacks.
