Giving to UT Dallas
What is the Loyalty Fund?
The UT Dallas Loyalty Fund is part of an ongoing effort dedicated to securing financial support from alumni, parents, students, and friends. With a strong base of donors who are committed to providing annual gifts to UT Dallas, the campus can maintain its current high level of excellence and growth. The Loyalty Fund campaign involves letters, emails and Comet Calls inviting alumni to update their contact information, donate to the university and learn more about what is happening on campus. The Loyalty Fund campaign offers three ways for alumni to participate: via mail, via phone or via the web. Alumni may update their contact information and donate to the university using any of these three methods.
