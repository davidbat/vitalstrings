1. No Recommendations or Medical Advice
HealthGrades is not a referral service and does not recommend or endorse any particular Healthcare Provider. Rather, HealthGrades is only an intermediary that provides selected information about Healthcare Providers. We do not offer advice regarding the quality or suitability of any particular Healthcare Provider for specific treatments or health conditions, and no information on this Site should be construed as health or medical advice. The Ratings and Healthcare Provider information consists of statements of opinion and not statements of fact or recommendations to utilize the services of any specific Healthcare Provider. You should obtain any additional information necessary to make an informed decision prior to utilizing any specific Healthcare Provider.
You assume all responsibility in connection with choosing any Healthcare Provider, whether or not you obtained information about such Healthcare Provider on or through this Site. HealthGrades and its licensors, suppliers and affiliates (collectively, the "Affiliates"), and the directors, officers, agents, and representatives of each, assume no (and hereby disclaims all) responsibility or liability of any kind, for any advice, treatment or other services rendered by any Healthcare Provider, or for any malpractice claims and other claims that may arise directly or indirectly from any such advice, treatment or other services.

The Site and Site Materials are protected by law, including but not limited to U.S. and international copyright law, trademark law, trade secret law, as well as other state, federal, and international laws, regulations and treaties (collectively, "IP Laws"). HealthGrades does not claim any rights in unaltered government data.
You agree not to engage in any activity that would constitute copyright infringement with respect to the Site Materials, including without limitation the Ratings, and/or the 1-3-5 star rating system and methodology. You acknowledge that HealthGrades selected, compiled, arranged and adjusted data and information regarding Healthcare Providers and the Ratings are original compilations (as defined by the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101) containing material wholly and exclusively original to HealthGrades.

Additionally, you may not use any metatags or any other "hidden text" utilizing the name "HealthGrades" without our prior written permission.

Any breach of the foregoing confidentiality obligation will cause HealthGrades irreparable harm for which there is no adequate legal remedy. In the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, HealthGrades will be entitled to obtain injunctive and all other appropriate relief from a court of competent authority, without being required to: (a) show any actual damage or irreparable harm; (b) prove the inadequacy of its legal remedies; or (c) post any bond or other security.
