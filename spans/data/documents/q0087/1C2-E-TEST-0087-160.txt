Data Communication and Data Management Laboratory
We are    a research group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of    Texas at Dallas , headed by professor Ding-Zhu Du . and Weili Wu . Our focus is the design and        analysis of algorithms for optimization problems that occur in wireless networking      environments and various database systems. We seek distributed, autonomous, robust and scalable algorithms        for real world applications, but are also concerned that these algorithms have        good theoretical merit.
