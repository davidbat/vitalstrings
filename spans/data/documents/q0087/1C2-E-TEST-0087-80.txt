 
 
The Center for Children and Families  offers weekly “Juega Conmigo” (Play with Me) sessions, which are designed to  directly foster the cognitive, language, physical, emotional, and social  development of infants and toddlers.
 
Our bilingual  Developmental Specialists facilitate play activities in Spanish with parents  and their infants and toddlers using toys, music, and movement. We also share  information about child development, how to promote growth through play  activities at home, and make appointments for free individual screenings of the  children’s development.
"Juega Conmigo" (Play with Me) sessions are currently offered on Thursdays from 10am-11:30am on a drop-in basis in the Bachman Lake Branch of the Dallas Public Library (located at  9480 Webb Chapel Rd). The program is open to the public and free of charge.
 
Beginning in April 2012, Juega Conmigo will be adding a second class on Thursdays and the schedule will be 10am-11:15 for the first class, then 11:45-1pm for the second class. Both classes will be at the Bachman Lake public library.
