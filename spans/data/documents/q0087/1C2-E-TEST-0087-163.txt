DALLAS—
How could you make something that’s right in front of you seem to disappear? Some University of Texas at Dallas scientists came up with an invisibility cloak much like what Harry Potter had in his bag of tricks.  OK, so, not quick like Harry Potter, but the closest in real life we have ever come.
Dr. Ray Baughman of the Nanotech Institute at UT Dallas and his research scientist Ali Aliev used millions of what are called carbon nanotubes, which are 1/10,000 as thick as your hair, to make it happen.  Carbon nanotubes are as light as air, pound for pound stronger than steel and can transmit heat in a hurry.  That's important, because the cloaking device worked much like a mirage.
“When you view a road on a hot summer day, you see in the distance, it looks like a puddle of water on the road.  Well, it is not a puddle of water on the road,” said Baughman.
By instantly creating heat with the nanotubes, the light around the cloak was deflected, and created a mirage much like when heat deflected the light near the hot road.
“You feel like you are looking through the object, but you are not really.  You're bending light so you see surrounding water,” Baughman told CW 33 News.
Baughman and Aliev weren't even working with the carbon nanotubes for the purpose of creating an invisibility cloak.  Originally, they wanted to see how they could work as speakers.
“They provide very attractive performance as transparent loudspeakers that can broadcast sound over a mile,” said Baughman.
But a scientist who wanted to take it a step further, created something that might one day make everyone wizards like Harry Potter.
“Ali Aliev has a very inventive mind, so when he sees things, he thinks of the implications,” said Baughman.
