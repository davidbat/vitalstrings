High School Grade Point Average
Success in Honors or Advanced Placement Course Work
Extracurricular and other leadership activities
National Merit status, National Achievement Scholarship Program recognition, and National Hispanic Honor Awards Program recognition
No specific achievement in any category of the AES award factors will guarantee a scholarship. The AES Program will examine each student's record in its entirety and additional considerations are made based on the rigor of the courses taken in high school.
The quality of our incoming freshman applicant pool also affects your chances of a scholarship. For the past few years, the quality of our entering class as measured by SAT scores and high school GPAs has increased significantly. This has made our scholarships increasingly competitive.
The following are the average SAT scores for students that have been offered an AES award thus far for fall 2012:
Achievement
Average SAT (Critical Reading + Math only): 1300
Distinction
Average SAT (Critical Reading + Math only): 1390
Honors
Average SAT (Critical Reading + Math only): 1490
All Academic Excellence Scholarship awards can be characterized in terms of the award amounts that students receive. However, more pertinent in assessing the value of an AES award is the amount of the average cost of attendance at UT Dallas that the award will cover. Our Financial Aid Office in conjunction with university cost standards provided by the US Government determines the average cost of attendance. The tuition and fee amount for the 2012-2013 academic year has not be set. The estimated cost of tuition and fees ($11,168), room and board ($8,364), and books and supplies ($1,200) for full-time undergraduate students during the 2011-2012 academic year at UT Dallas is $20,732.
Under the UT Dallas Guaranteed Tuition and Fee Policy, students enrolling at UT Dallas for the first time in fall 2011 will pay tuition and fees at the Fall 2012 rates through Summer 2015.
