CBEES researchers are looking for members of the UTD community to participate in experimental sessions. Email us at cbees@utdallas.edu or visit us in the lab in GR 2.402 to sign up to receive notifications about upcoming experiments. We will contact you when a space becomes available; you can then accept or decline the invitation.
Participants are paid based on the decisions they make, in cash or as credit on their Comet Card, at the end of the experimental session. Plus, your responses help us to understand how individuals make decisions in different settings.
