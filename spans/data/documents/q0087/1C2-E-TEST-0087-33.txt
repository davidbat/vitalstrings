"Ray Baughman creates artificial muscles"
Nature has been developing her technologies for many hundreds of  millions of years, said Ray Baughman. “By looking at the way in which  nature has solved problems like muscles, we can advance our own  technologies.” Baughman is director of the NanoTech Institute at the  University of Texas at Dallas.

"Mirage effect from thermally modulated transparent carbon nanotube sheets" published in IOP Science
The single-beam mirage effect, also known as photothermal deflection, is studied using a             free-standing, highly aligned carbon nanotube aerogel sheet as the heat source. The extremely             low thermal capacitance and high heat transfer ability of these transparent forest-drawn carbon             nanotube sheets enables high frequency modulation of sheet emperature over an enormous             temperature range, thereby providing a sharp, rapidly changing gradient of refractive index in           the surrounding liquid or gas.

Dr. Ray Baughman named one of "Dallas' Big Thinkers" by D Magazine
We gave the world the microchip and the margarita machine. Here are six cool scientists whose brains are making waves...Earlier this year, Ray Baughman told NPR that he has created a special “multifunctional” yarn. Imagine a shirt that doubles as a battery or a  soldier’s uniform that could cool him in the battlefield. (see more)
UT Dallas NanoExplorers Present Summer Research
A group of local high school students accepted a rare opportunity to participate in a summer of high-tech research at UT Dallas.
They          took part in the George A. Jeffrey NanoExplorers Program focusing on           nanotechnology research in such areas as biomedical research, armed            forces protection, solar energy and water purification. (see more )
