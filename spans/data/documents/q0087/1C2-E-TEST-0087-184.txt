What is NACLO?
NACLO stands for the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad. It is a contest for high-school (and younger) students to solve problems relating to linguistics and computational linguistics. No advanced knowledge of linguistics is required. Students may participate at their high school or at a nearby university site. University of Texas at Dallas will be a local site again in 2012. The open round of the contest will take place on February 2. Well-performing students will be invited to a second round to be held on March 13. The top students in the second round will have a chance to participate in the 10th International Linguistics Olympiad. More information about NACLO can be found at the official site .
