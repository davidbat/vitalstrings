This            research laboratory was established to investigate various aspects            of VLSI circuits and systems design.  Specifically we are interested            in design of energy efficient digital circuits and systems, circuits            for nano-CMOS and beyond, VLSI architectures and algorithms for            signal processing and communications, computer arithmetic and            reconfigurable architectures.  Current research activity include:
Digitally Intensive or Digitally Assisted Mixed-Signal                  Design:  This work                  involves developing digitally intensive techniques or using                  digital signal processing techniques to design mixed-signal                  circuits for nano-CMOS technologies. This investigation started                  with the development of high-speed all-digital RF frequency                  synthesizer operating in GHz range.  In this work digital                  techniques were used to tune the LC tank and create a novel                  phase-domain All-Digital Phase Locked Loop (ADPLL) around a                  digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and a time-to-digital                  converter (TDC).  Investigation is being carried out to develop                  digital techniques to calibrate, monitor and tune mixed-signal                  circuits to alleviate problems related to process, temperature                  and voltage variations.  Such techniques enable us to use                  standard digital CMOS processes and ASIC design flows for                  implementing these circuits. 
Circuits and Systems for Signal                Processing and Communications: This activity                involves developing VLSI algorithms, architectures and circuits                for digital signal processing, image processing and wireless                communications.  This research leverages our background in                energy efficient, digitally intensive mixed-signal design                techniques to develop circuits and systems for these                applications suitable for implementation in nano- CMOS                technologies.  Projects include, all-digital polar modulator using two-point frequency modulation of ADPLL, all-digital                cartesian modulator for wideband applications, reconfigurable                radio, IQ mismatch compensation, envelope tracking for power                efficient AM transmitters, various low power digital filters,                low power video decoding for mobile digital video platforms,                etc. 
Energy Efficient Digital Systems: This is                  an ongoing investigation in which techniques are being developed                  for lowering power dissipation in digital systems without                  drastically affecting performance.  With the growing popularity                  of battery powered portable applications like personal                  communication systems, mobile computing, etc., energy efficient,                  high performance circuits are gaining importance.  Investigation                  is being carried out for lowering dynamic as well as leakage                  power dissipation in custom and reconfigurable circuits and                  systems.
Reconfigurable Digital Systems: This                investigation involves design and development of reconfigurable hardware that is suitable for DSP and multimedia applications.  Rapid prototyping of wireless communication systems and sensor                network platform is also being investigated. Several building                blocks for power aware digital filters and communication                algorithms are being developed.
