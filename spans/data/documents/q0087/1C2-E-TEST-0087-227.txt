I have a question. I need a physical to find out about me health problems. I live in Arlington,Tx. Tarrant County. I do not have medical insurance. do I need to be a Dallas resident and do I need to pay out-of-pocket up front or will you bill me or fax my bill to mt trust who pays the majority of my bills?  My home phone is 817-274-2769 leave a message and I will return the call. My cell phone is 817-705-8951. Thank-you.  Wava Stephens
