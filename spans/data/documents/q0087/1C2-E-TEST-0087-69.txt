University of Texas at Dallas
Welcome
Welcome to the Center for Systems Biology at UTDallas! We are a group of enthusiastic researchers       focusing on the development of computational and experimental methods aimed at solving challenges       facing biologists from a systems perspective, with a particular interest in the large-scale and       high-throughput data generated by -omics technologies, such as next-generation sequencing. These data       on the whole provides us unprecedented opportunities to understand and unravel the complicated biological       systems at different levels. Our research goal in this emerging field is to understand nature of life as       a complex system and its molecular mechanisms, which will form the foundation leading to the successful       diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.
