Welcome New College Rep, AdmRep26, from UT Dallas
Please join me in welcoming our newest College Rep, AdmRep26, from the University of Texas at Dallas!
As a reminder, our College Reps are individuals that we have taken reasonable steps to verify as being from the school they represent. (If you find a CC member claiming to be an admissions person at a college and that member isn't flagged as a College Rep, please let us know so that we can verify his/her status.)
As an matter of courtesy to our College Reps (who have real-world jobs and are incredibly busy during the admissions season!), please don't post pleas for help naming the individual (e.g., "AdmRep26- Need Answer ASAP!!!" is what NOT to do - ask your question in a new thread with a clear and specific title, and you'll get input from CC members and, perhaps, from the resident College Rep if he/she has something to contribute.)
Say hello if you like, but please don't ask questions in this thread - start a new one with a relevant title.
