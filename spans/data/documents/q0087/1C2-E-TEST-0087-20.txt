Emerging Media and Communication (EMAC) is a degree program in The School of Arts and Humanities at The University of Texas at Dallas which focuses on the uses, impact, and implications of digital networked technology on media and culture in the twenty-first century.
The Emerging Media and Communication degree prepares the “communicators of the twenty-first century.” These new communicators will combine technological expertise with effective communication skills across a wide range of media, developing “new media literacy” in response to the digital revolution that has radically changed all aspects of human communication. EMAC prepares students not only for existing technologically sophisticated delivery systems but also prepares them to be future developers, entrepreneurs and content providers of emerging media.
While most conventional degree programs in media emphasize established message content strategies and delivery systems, EMAC integrates this traditional approach with the creation, applications and implications of emerging media. The program mixes classes which focus on the theory and history of media with ones focused on practical application where students become versed in a wide range of technical skills.
EMAC is housed in the Arts and Technology building, and is closely associated with the ATEC program .
