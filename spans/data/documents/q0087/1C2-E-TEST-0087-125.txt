About Us
The Integrated System Design Laboratory (ISDL) at the University of Texas at Dallas is involved in developing core technologies for high-performance and low-power integrated systems. The applications range from power management ICs, high-speed high-resolution wire and wireless communication circuits and systems, sensor nodes and networks, to biomedical instruments.
By uniquely  combining power electronics and integrated circuits, and by having a  good understanding of both the underlying process technology and the  higher levels of system architectures, controls, and operations, we are  committed to providing innovative solutions to high-performance  integrated system designs beyond the semiconductor roadmap.
