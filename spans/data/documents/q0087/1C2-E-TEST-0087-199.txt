 
Sustainable Energy Expert to Join UT Dallas
The newest mechanical engineering professor at UT Dallas is an expert in monitoring and control systems that boost the energy efficiency of buildings and vehicles and maximize the energy captured from wind and sunlight.
“My primary research interest is in energy efficiency and renewable energy systems, with an emphasis on dynamic modeling, control, optimization and condition monitoring,” said Dr. Yaoyu Li. “I believe these technologies can have a great impact on the efficiency and reliability of conventional, renewable and alternative energy systems.”
Currently an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee , he will join UT Dallas next fall.
“The focus of Yaoyu Li’s teaching and research aligns well with our sustainable energy strategic imperative,” said Dr. Mario Rotea , head of mechanical engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at UT Dallas. “His technical background, which is at the intersection of thermal and fluid sciences and dynamical systems and controls, is ideal for advancing the state of the art in sustainable energy systems.”
Li earned his PhD in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 2004. He has received research funding from Johnson Controls, Honda, Eaton, Toyota, the U.S. Department of Energy, We Energies and Rockwell Automation, and he has taught classes on wind energy, mechatronics and control systems.
With the addition of Li, the two-year-old mechanical engineering department will strengthen its research and educational programs in energy systems.
