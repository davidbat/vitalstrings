Undergraduate Advising at UT Dallas
The University of Texas at Dallas values our students.  We are committed to the success of each and every one.  Professional academic advising is an important tool to help our students reach their goals. Advisors guide students through an impressive offering of degree plans.  Advisors are familiar with the specific departmental emphases and faculty research interests.  Advisors help students access and interface with faculty and instructors.  Advisors assist students on issues including class suitability, degree requirements, university policies and procedures, study skills, time management, campus involvement and limited personal issues.  Students will learn about required and elective options.  Advisors apply credit by examination and transfer credits and assist students in ensuring their degree and graduation requirements are met.
Students have access to advisors at any time but should do so at least once each semester.
UT Dallas Professional Academic Advising is an outstanding resource to help our students achieve their goals.
