Vibhav Gogate
I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Texas, Dallas . I'm also a member of the Human Language Technology Research Institute . My research interests are in machine learning, automated reasoning and artificial intelligence with a focus on graphical models and their logic-based extensions such as Markov logic.
Before coming to UTD, I was a Post Doctoral Researcher with Pedro Domingos at University of Washington. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student  at University of California, Irvine (UCI). My thesis advisor was Rina Dechter .
