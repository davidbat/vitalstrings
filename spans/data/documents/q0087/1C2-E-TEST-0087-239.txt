AES Program
Terry Scholars Mentoring Program
In an effort to assist incoming freshman Terry Scholars with acclimating to the University and the Terry Scholars Program, a mentorship program was implemented fall 2008. The ultimate goal of the program is to quickly build unity among the freshman scholars and their mentors and to enable them to successfully represent the University and the surrounding community while meeting rigorous academic standards.  Each Scholar is assigned an upper-level Terry Scholar based on their shared interests, activities, future goals and academic program.  Each freshman scholar and their mentor attend a three day mentor/mentee retreat at the beginning of the fall semester and participate in experiential and team building activities.  Ongoing activities with mentors and their mentees continue throughout the year.
