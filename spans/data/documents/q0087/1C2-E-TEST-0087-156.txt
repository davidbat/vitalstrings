Research interests: The electrical characterization of different high-k dielectric materials on compound semiconductors (e.g., GaAs, InGaAs and GaN) focusing on the interface properties (i.e., interface states and the energy level of these states) between these high-k and compound semiconductor interfaces. Also interested in modeling the behavior of these high-k materials on compound semiconductors and trying to understand the effects of indium mole fraction in InGaAs.
