Welcome to the DMSP SSIES data distribution webpage at the Center for Space Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas.  We hope the data we provide  here will be of help to you in your research.  We know that you want to get  the data as quickly as possible, but if you have never used this dataset  before, please take a few minutes to go over our background material (at  least the Quick Introduction to the DMSP SSIES data ) before you start using the data.  Trust us, this will save you a lot of  pain and grief later on.  If you have any questions that are not covered  on these pages, please write to us. ( Email Dr. Marc Hairston)
