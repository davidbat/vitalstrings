UTD Description
World-renowned research, high nationwide rankings, top-performing students, rich academics and tuition exemption for eligible low-income students are just a few outstanding features of University of Texas at Dallas.
Located 18 miles outside of downtown Dallas, University of Texas offers over 140 academic programs at the bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels.
50 research centers and institutes make their home at UT Dallas and conduct world-renowned research in such disciplines as Space Science, Bioengineering, Cybersecurity and Nanotechnology.
While it is known as a research institution, UT Dallas’ MBA and Engineering programs have received top rankings by numerous academic, scientific and business-related publications.
Given all this, it’s no wonder that high-performing students from all over Texas and from various other states and even countries flock to UT Dallas. Designated as having a “more selective” admissions policy by U.S. News, UT Dallas generally admits students whose SAT scores are above 1200.
UT also excels in its extracurricular offerings. UT Dallas is home to a Division III athletics program and number of intercollegiate teams. They also have more than 160 student organizations, including a nationally-recognized debate team.
But even with all that prestige, UT Dallas students do not need to feel overwhelmed. The school is large enough to be dynamic, but small enough to still allow for personal, one-on-one interaction among students and between students and faculty. Career, academic and personal counseling are all accessible student resources.
In addition to offering standard financial aid packages to eligible students consisting of loans, grants, work-study and fellowships, UT Dallas has the “tuition promise” plan. Through this program, students from low-income families are assured a full grant to cover the cost of tuition. To learn more about eligibility requirements, contact UT Dallas today!
