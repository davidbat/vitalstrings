Requesting VA Certification at UTD
The Certifying Official acts as a liaison between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veteran student.  This involves assisting with a variety of processing and information needs such as documentation requirements, correspondence, and the certification and receipt of benefits. To contact your Veteran's Affairs Certifying Official, see the Specific Aid Program Contacts table in Contact Us .
How you go about requesting certification at UTD depends on your individual situation, please select which item pertains to you:
I am a student who has never                      used my VA educational benefits before.
I am a transfer student who                      has used my VA educational benefits at another school.
I am a continuing VA student at UTD who needs to be re-certified for the next term.
I am a Hazlewood                      student at UTD that is an eligible dependent of a former Texas                      member of the U.S. Armed Forces
Requesting a Parent Institution Letter
The Parent Institution Letter (PIL) is required if a student is planning to enroll at The University of Texas at Dallas upon completion of 24 credit hours, or less, at their current school; and/or enrolling in courses not covered by the degree plan at their current institution.  Furthermore, all courses appearing on the letter must be necessary for fulfillment of specific degree plan requirements here at UTD.
Students must do two things in order to have a PIL processed for them:
The student must apply to UTD, supplying copies                                                  of all academic transcripts
The student must request a PIL Letter from the                                  Financial Aid Office.
A PIL letter will not be sent until transcripts                                  have been evaluated by the Admissions Office.
It is to                                                                  the student’s advantage to follow the degree                                                                  plan at their current institution as long a possible                    to provide them with the most flexibility.
