The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program provides what generally are known as Stafford Loans. Under the Direct Loan Program, the funds come directly from the government.
There are two types of Federal Direct Stafford Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. You must demonstrate financial need, according to the FAFSA, to qualify for the subsidized loan. In this case the government will pay the interest on the loan while the student is in school. Financial need is not a requirement for the unsubsidized loan. This loan accrues interest while the student is in school; a student may choose to pay the accruing interest while in school. Repayment for both begins 6 months after graduation or when the student ceases attending school at least half-time. The interest rate for subsidized Direct Stafford Loans disbursed between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013 is fixed at 6.8 percent.  Loans disbursed in previous years have different rates, depending on when they were disbursed. The interest rate for unsubsidized Stafford Loans is fixed at 6.8 percent.  To accept a Direct Stafford Loan you must follow the steps on our Direct Lending (DL) website.
