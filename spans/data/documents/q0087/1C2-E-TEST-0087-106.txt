I usually don't write to a company after I have received my merchandise, but I just             wanted to let you know that I received my sweatshirts for my husband and I love             them.-- MaryAnn
Once again, thank you for all your help. I really appreciate the time that you took             to help me produce a special gift for someone we really value. You were wonderful             to work with.-- Deb
I am so happy that we finally got a site like this. I just got on tonight and I             am already excited about this. I am so happy about this I can’t wait to buy this             stuff. I have never seen this stuff anywhere!!-- Emily
I just received my new Sweatshirt minutes ago. I tried it on and "I LOVE IT". This             was a gift from my Daughter to me that I order through your Company. I just want             to say THANK YOU for doing a GREAT Job.-- Michael
I would just like to commend you on the very quick turnaround time on the two orders             I have placed with you and how GREAT all of the products turned out. The work is             very high quality and we'll continue to keep ordering!-- Patricia
Let me say that it is quite refreshing to do business with a company that actually             has a high standard of quality and customer service expectations. Let me say that             I am more than pleased and that you can be assured that when other parents and alumni             ask about my jersey I will be telling them about my experience with your company             and hope that they see fit to do business with you also.-- Barry
