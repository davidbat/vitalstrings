Graduate Studies
The graduate programs in computer science offer intensive preparation in design, programming, theory and applications. Training is provided for both academically oriented students and students with professional goals in the many business, industrial and governmental occupations requiring advanced knowledge of computer theory and technology.
Courses and research are offered in a variety of subfields of computer science, including operating systems, computer architecture, computer graphics, pattern recognition, automata theory, combinatorics, artificial intelligence, database design, computer networks, programming languages, software systems, analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, parallel processing, VLSI, computational geometry and design automation.
A comprehensive program of evening courses is offered, providing both part-time and full-time students with a convenient means to either earn a masterâ€™s degree or to select individual courses of interest.
The university maintains a large network of computer facilities , including PCs, Sun work stations and specialized computers for research within the program. All major computers on campus are linked by an Ethernet network.
In addition to computer science faculty , many other individuals at the university are involved in computer-related work in the physical and social sciences and in various areas of business and management. Computer science students with an interest in these important application areas thus have ample opportunity to consult and work with talented faculty from a wide range of disciplines.
