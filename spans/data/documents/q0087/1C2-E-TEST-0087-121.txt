* CS    6324 Information Security *    (3 semester hours) This course provides a comprehensive study of    security vulnerabilities in information systems and the basic techniques    for developing secure applications and practicing safe computing. Topics    include common attacking techniques such as buffer overflow, Trojan,    virus, etc; UNIX, Windows and Java security; conventional encryption;    hashing functions and data integrity; public-key encryption (RSA,    Elliptic-Curve); digital signatures; watermarking for multimedia;    security standards and applications; building secure software and    systems; management and analysis of security; and legal and ethical    issues in computer security.
* CS    6377 Introduction to Cryptography *(3 semester hours) This    course covers the basic aspects of modern cryptography, including block    ciphers, pseudorandom functions, symmetric encryption, hash functions,    message authentication, number-theoretic primitives, public-key    encryption, digital signatures and zero knowledge proofs.
* CS    6379 Data and Application Security * (3 semester hours) The    course will teach principles, technologies, tools and trends for data    and applications security. Topics to be covered include:    Confidentiality, Privacy and Trust Management; Secure Databases; Secure    Distributed Systems; Secure Multimedia and Object Systems; Secure Data    Warehouses; Data Mining for Security Applications; Assured Information    Sharing; Secure Knowledge Management; Secure Collaboration; Secure    Digital Libraries; Trustworthy Semantic Web; Biometrics; Digital    Forensics; Secure E-Commerce; Secure Sensor Information Management and    Secure Social Networks. Students will take one system or application and    develop a secure version of that system or application for the    programming project.
* CS    6387 Network Security * (3 semester hours) This course covers    theoretical and practical aspects of network security. The topics    include use of cryptography for building secure communication protocols    and authentication systems; security handshake pitfalls, Kerberos and    PKI, security of TCP/IP protocols including IPsec, BGP security, VPNs,    IDSes, firewalls, and anonymous routing; security of TCP/IP    applications; wireless LAN security; denial-of-service defense. Students    are required to do a programming project building a distributed    application with certain secure communication features and required to    participate in several network security lab exercises and cyber war    games.
* CS    6v81 Biometrics * (3 semester hours) The students will first    learn various biometrics technologies including face biometrics,    fingerprint biometrics, iris biometrics, retina biometrics, and hand    biometrics. Next the students will learn techniques for securing    biometrics systems./ Finally the students will examine the various    standards efforts on biometrics including the work of the Biometrics    Consortiums and Liberty Alliance. Students will develop a biometric    system for their programming project.
* CS    7301 Language Based Security * (3 semester hours) This course    applies cutting-edge techniques from programming language theory and    compiler construction to the development and verification of secure    software systems. Topics include language-based information flow    security, software fault isolation, in-lined reference monitoring, typed    assembly languages, certifying compilers, proof-carrying code, and    automated binary obfuscation. Coursework involves reading and    implementing recent research in the field.
* CS      7301 Advanced Cryptography for Data Security * (3 semester    hours) This course discusses recent advances in cryptography for data    security applications. The topics include identity based encryption,    homomorphic encryption and its applications to data security. Additional    topics include range queries on encrypted data, secure multi-part    computation, and rational secure multi-computation.
* CS      7301 Data Privacy *(3 semester hours) This course discusses    the basic aspects of data privacy and existing privacy-preserving    technologies. In addition, it discusses legal, social and economic    aspects of data privacy. Other topics include privacy legislations,    anonymization techniques, cryptographic techniques for data privacy,    access control, privacy-preserving data mining, and privacy issues in    healthcare.**
* CS    7301 Building Trustworthy Semantic Webs * (3 semester hours)    This course will provide an overview of semantic web technologies    including XML, RDF, OWL and SWRL and will then describe security issues    for semantic web technologies. In particular, secure publication of XML    documents, securing ontologies and RDF documents will be examined.    Policy management with semantic web technologies will be discussed.    Finally applications such as secure web services, assured information,    secure knowledge management and secure social networking that utilize    semantic web technologies will be examined. Students will implement one    such application for their programming project.
