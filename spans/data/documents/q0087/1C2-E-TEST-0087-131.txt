All freshmen who enroll in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science will automatically be considered for an Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science (ECS) Freshman Scholarship.This award is typically $1,000 per long semester with the opportunity to renew for up to eight total semesters. To be eligible for renewal, award recipients must maintain a 3.0 GPA, continue to be ECS majors, and make good progress toward graduation in four years. These awards are made possible by funding from the Excellence in Education Scholarship Endowment, the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science Endowed Scholarship, and the Williams Communications Solutions Scholarship Endowment. Merit is the main criterion for selecting recipients, but the guidelines specified by funding sources may give preference to or restrict awards to specific groups (e.g., U.S. citizens/permanent residents). Other support will also be considered.
