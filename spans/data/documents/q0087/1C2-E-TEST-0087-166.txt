i have the sat score to do cap at UTD and if i applied regular i know i wouldv'e gotten a big scholarship, but since im applying for cap you think i wont get any scholarships anymore?
the first person i talked to said they still have scholarships that they award on a monthly basis.
what if i apply regular right now(their deadline is not over) and then get a scholarship and could i put that together with my CAP program... or is that just plain stupid and would not make a difference than if i just let them review my cap application.
is there some CAP number i could call?
thank you guys for your help so far. even though its not about UT austin questions specifically..
