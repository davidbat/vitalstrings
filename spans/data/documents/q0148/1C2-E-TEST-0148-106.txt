Preparation
Quinoa can be cooked like millet; it absorbs twice its volume in liquid. Use it in place of rice in cooked dishes, or serve it as a side dish, in salads or as a stuffing. Alternatively, try it as a substitute for porridge, served hot with cream, dried fruit and brown sugar.
Other considerations
Quinoa is extremely rich in complete protein, so is an excellent addition to vegetarian and vegan diets.
