Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) is a seed grain of the Chenepodium      family.  It is considered a complete protein because it contains      all eight essential amino acids.
Quinoa is light and tasty, easy to digest, and blends well with      other ingredients.  It is perfect for people who are intolerant      of wheat and gluten.
