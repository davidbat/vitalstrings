It’s been a while since I’ve shared a recipe from my Quinoa +5 series, so I decided to share a new favorite with you today. It is easy to make but honestly surprised me at just how “gourmet” it tasted.  Everyone in our family loved it.  Even those weirdos who claim that they don’t like asparagus.
Oh, wait.  That’s me.
My husband loves asparagus but for some reason it has always been a vegetable that I’ve stayed away from.  I think that perhaps I’m still traumatized by some limp asparagus (from a can or jar?) that I had at a friends house when I was growing up.  Suffice it to say that my first asparagus experience left something to be desired.
I typically buy asparagus once a year and always with good intentions of preparing my husbands favorite vegetable in a way that will dazzle him.
 
But the story has been the same for, oh, about 13 years.
The asparagus rots in the back of the produce drawer where it stays until my husband isn’t looking and I throw it out.
I’m not one to waste food but there is something about asparagus that has always intimated me. I have no clue why, especially when it is quite possibly the easiest vegetable to cook and only takes a couple of minutes.
Well, enough about my weird culinary phobias.  I hope you enjoy this easy side dish as much as we did.
What about you – what intimidates you in the kitchen? Do you shy away from cooking foods that are easy to prepare just because you didn’t grow up eating them?
