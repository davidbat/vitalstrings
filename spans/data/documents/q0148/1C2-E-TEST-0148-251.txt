BBQ Chicken Quinoa Salad
Loaded salads are totally my jam. They make life colorful and delicious and it’s a great way to use whatever is left in my fridge. Yesterday I whipped up this BBQ Chicken Quinoa Salad for my boyfriend and myself because I had some leftover quinoa I needed to ditch before I hit the road for NYC. The result was one flavorful, protein rich salad that will sure be happening again very soon. Layers of quinoa, grilled corn, black beans, shredded BBQ chicken, diced avocado, BBQ sauce and a little cheese gave this salad about 324 dimensions and each bite was packed with flavor.
It’s kind of like a BBQ chicken pizza but subbed with quinoa which makes it healthier and guilt free! Hands down this is one of my new favorite salads that you absolutely have to try! Any quinoa skeptics out there will most likely change their mind after a few bites of this. (But feel free to sub in couscous or rice if you feel inclined)
