Quinoa  
About Quinoa
Since ancient time quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has constituted an important part of the food of the Andean population. Quinoa has a high nutritional value, a high tolerance to drought, frost, saline soils and other abiotic and biotic factors. Quinoa is used similar to cereals, but unlike these crops it contains a balanced set of essential amino acids and is gluten free.
The main interest for growing quinoa is in organic farming. Work on quinoa is on-going in several countries in Europe, South America, Africa and in India. The general perception is that quinoa should be considered as a potential crop in a range of climates holding a promise in organic farming. Quinoa has been selected as a possible new protein crop for organic feed in Denmark. Trials in Denmark have demonstrated seed yields of 1.5-2 t ha-1 with 12-16% protein content and 6-8% fat. Seed yields, however, have varied considerably among years and locations, because the establishment of the crop, weed control, harvest, and post-harvest techniques have not yet been optimized. 
The production of quinoa is linked to food security, and has a great potential for increased production in other parts of the world for consumption and supplying an increasing international market. Quinoa has been selected as one of the crops to secure food in the 21st century by FAO.
