Quinoa
Quinoa (pronouned KEEN-wah) is a fluffy nutty-flavored grain native to South America.
While quinoa looks, feels, and tastes like a grain, and is often referred to as a grain, technically it is a seed.
Also, unlike other grains which are low in the amino acid lysine, quionoa is high in lysine.  It is considered to be a "complete protein" because of its very balanced amino acid profile.  This makes quinoa a particularly good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans.
Quionoa is also a great source of manganese, magnesium, and iron.
Preparation:
Quinoa has a bitter exterior coating of saponins that should be removed for optimum flavor.  Most boxed quinoa already had this bitter coating removed, so chances are you won't have to worry about this.
However, if you buy quinoa that hasn't been washed ahead of time, make sure to soak the quinoa in water or rinse it with a fine strainer.
To cook quinoa, take one part quinoa, and two parts water (or vegetable broth), and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, then cover and cook until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is soft.  This typically takes 15 to 20 minutes.  You can also add chopped vegetables to the pot if desired.
Once cooked, use quinoa as you would rice.
