Wash quinoa well and soak it for an hour, then heat ghee and toast quinoa for a few minutes, then pressure cook it with 1 & 1/2 times water for each cup i.e., 1 : 1 & 1/2. In the mean time, heat oil, add rye and let it splutter. Now add onions and sauté until translucent. Add potatoes, carrot and let it cook. Cover with a lid if needed. When the vegetables are almost done, add bell pepper, corn , haldi, chili powder salt, lime juice, mix well. Cool the quinoa a little bit after cooking then mix it with the vegetables. Garnish with lots of dhania before serving. Tastes heavenly and packed with protein, fiber and many more essential nutrients.
