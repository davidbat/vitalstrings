If you're like me, you're always looking for something new to make for dinner that is tasty and healthy, you should give quinoa pasta a try.
It's made with a blend of quinoa and corn flours, so it's wheat and gluten free , making this pasta much easier on your tummy.  Each serving contains 2.5g of fiber and 5g of protein, which is about the same in regular semolina pasta.  However, if you're watching your carbs, quinoa pasta has a little less.
You can get linguine spaghetti, elbows, spirals, or my favorite shape, garden pagodas.  These are great for kids because they are colored red and green with dried red bell pepper and spinach (but they taste the same).
Quinoa pasta is quick and easy to cook.  Just boil some water and throw the dried pasta in.  It doesn't take as long to cook as regular semolina pasta, so just watch it because if you overcook it, it gets really soggy and squishy, like when you leave cereal in milk too long.
Fit's Tips: Add sautéed veggies like mushrooms, red peppers, and zucchini and your favorite tomato sauce and you're good to go.  Buy it at your local health food store or online for $2.59.
