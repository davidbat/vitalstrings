1 cup dry quinoa, red or white (if starting with cooked quinoa, use 2 cups)
2 cups water, optional
4 tablespoons oil (I use peanut oil)
1/2 onion, chopped
4 medium cloves garlic, minced or crushed
3 to 4 tablespoons dillweed, dry or fresh
salt and pepper, to taste
What you do: 
1. If using dry quinoa: combine quinoa with water in small pot (I used stainless steel) and bring to a boil. Let cook until the water has all been absorbed, or the kernels are tender (if there's still water, drain through a strainer).
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 4 more minutes. Add dillweed.
3. Add cooked quinoa to pan and stir everything thoroughly. Add salt and pepper. Serve.
Could be combined with any other main ingredients, or eaten as a poor man's meal because quinoa's got a pretty good amount of protein per serving.
