Superfood: Quinoa
Often referred to as the supergrain, quinoa (KEEN-wah) is high in fiber and high-quality protein. In fact, it contains more                                  protein than any other grain while also packing in iron and potassium. One half cup of quinoa has 14 grams of protein and                                  6 grams of fiber. This superfood is classified as a whole grain and is naturally gluten-free. Quinoa is a tiny grain that                                  cooks up like rice and has a mild, nutty flavor and a light, fluffy texture similar to couscous. You can find it next to other                                  grains in health-food stores and your supermarket.
When you make a risotto with quinoa instead of the traditional Arborio rice, you get 1 times more fiber. And for a side dish,                                  this recipe, Quinoa and Onion Risotto with Créme Fraîche and Hazelnuts , quite high in fiber. The nutty grain is flavored with sautéed onions and crunchy, heart-healthy hazelnuts, making it a worthy partner for lean pork or roasted poultry.
