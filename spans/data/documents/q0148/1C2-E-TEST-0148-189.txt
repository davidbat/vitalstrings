Quinoa has always been one of my favorite grains. I love the subtle crunch that it has when cooked and that it is so high in protein. It’s been slowly rising to stardom recently. It’s a grain-like crop grown for its edible seeds. It’s considered a “pseudocereal,” whatever that means—not a true cereal, not a grain, since it’s not a grass. It’s related to species like beets, spinach and tumbleweeds. It is 6,000 years old and is native to the Andean region of South America. The main reason its star is on the rise here is because of its incredible nutritional value, but I like it because it takes on so many other flavors as a salad. So when I saw this Quinoa Salad with Chickpeas, Kalamata Olives & Mint recipe by the fabulous Dara of Cookin Canuck , I knew I wanted to give it a try.
 
 
 
Here is what you will need: quinoa, white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, olive oil, tomato, Kalamata olives, garbanzo beans, honey, lemon and fresh mint.
I just love fresh mint in the summer.
 
 
Get the quinoa cooking in water while you prep the rest of the ingredients.
Once it is fluffy, let it cool. You can even be very smart about it like Dara was and lay it out on a sheet to help it cool quickly and evenly.
