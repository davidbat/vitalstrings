I missed this last night, good thing I can maybe make it today! I have all that I need and anything with quinoa=anything in my belly!
49 Rachel @ The Avid Appetite April 5, 2011 at 8:50 am
Yessss, I love quinoa salads! It is best with feta. Sometimes I’ll cook it in vegetable broth, add lemon juice, basil and feta crumbles…so fantastic! It’s also great with some diced, roasted beets tossed in!

Perfect colorful, and delicious spring dish!!

Love Love Love Quinoa Salads. This looks yummy. I sometimes purchase premade quinoa salads but I think I will def try making this.
52 Jesse April 5, 2011 at 9:17 am
i just posted a very similar orzo pasta salad with a mediterrean influence.
i’ll have to try quinoa next time:)
53 Katie @ www.princessofpavement.com April 5, 2011 at 9:29 am
I pronounced quinoa the same way! That is, until my ironchickie friend who’s all about the “keeenwah” informed me otherwise
54 Natalia - a side of simple April 5, 2011 at 9:46 am
Quinoa has been my life saver since I found out I was allergic to gluten. It’s easily become my favorite replacement to regular pasta! Now…where’s the sand and sun and sangria?
55 Cynthia (It All Changes) April 5, 2011 at 9:48 am
My lunches for the next week are solved.  I love the spring combo of flavors.  Thanks for a fresh look on quinoa and the inspiration to try red quinoa finally.

This looks lovely! Great recipe.
62 Melissa @ Journey to Marvelous April 5, 2011 at 10:27 am
I love quinoa…and I’m always telling people the right way to pronounce it! haha!
63 Kat @ Big Apple Little Kitchen April 5, 2011 at 10:29 am
That’s so funny! I just made the same salad a week ago…it is filling and delicious!
64 Lucy @ The Sweet Touch April 5, 2011 at 10:33 am
It quinoa kinda chewy?  How would you describe it?  It looks interesting!
65 Amanda April 5, 2011 at 10:38 am
Considering I love all of these ingredients, I will definitely be giving this salad a try. Yum!

66 meryl April 5, 2011 at 11:07 am
ummm.  i had no idea that quinoa wasn’t pronounced the way it was spelled until i read your blog post.  whoops.
67 French Heart April 5, 2011 at 11:11 am
Thanks for the pronunciation key. So chagrinning to ask which aisle that rice that starts with a ‘Q’ is on.
Making this. Looks and sounds like something from a sunny exotic locale. Thanks!
68 Heather @ Get Healthy with Heather April 5, 2011 at 11:13 am
Red quinoa is so pretty!  This looks like the perfect summer time salad. Those tomatoes look super fresh.
69 amy walters, aDESIGNdock April 5, 2011 at 11:30 am
Jenna!!! I have been searching for an easy Quinoa recipe for months. After a year of thinking about buying some, I finally did. But then all I could find were confusing recipes with ingredients I don’t own (some which I’ve never even heard of)! Like Adam, I don’t care for olives. Can you suggest anything that I could replace them with? Also, I have the “oatmeal” coloured Quinoa. Will that work just as well as the red?

70 Averie (LoveVeggiesAndYoga) April 5, 2011 at 11:50 am
Simple, perfect, delicious.   When it gets warmer out these are the types of foods that I love.
Anything with cherry tomatoes, too, is an instant hit with me
love those little things!
71 Candace (inFITation) April 5, 2011 at 11:50 am
I used to say qui-no-ah- too. Which reminds me of another mispronunciation flub of mine.
In my very first grad school class I responded to a question the professor had asked and pronounced “paradigm”, par-a-dig-m instead of par-a-dime. It was mortifying.
Glad to know I’m not alone in my mispronunciations!
72 Denise @ Creative Kitchen April 5, 2011 at 12:11 pm
Love quinoa! I have a really great quinoa tabouleh on my site that you would probably like, We also take it on a picnic/beach/boating etc. I even took it to disney this last trip. It’s definitely GREEK in nature when I throw my kalamata olives and feta cheese all over it.
You’ve inspired me to pick up french quinoa for the first time when I trek to Whole Foods today. You know I’m an hour south of Vero, right? Near @MylifeasaMrs
My hubby’s aunt & uncle & cousins live in Vero. His 26 yr old cousin grew up there….I always wondered if you guys knew each other or went to the same high school. You know Vero Beach..small town and all. I love it up there. Hubby & I get up there quite a bit. We love eating at Jack Baker’s Lobster shanty & Mr. Manatee’s with his aunt/uncle. Love the gorgeous oaks on their tree canopied lane.
Oops…sorry! Just didn’t know if I’d ever told you before where I’m from. Guess what else? You were one of my inspirations for starting my food blog, and I am getting ready to go to my FIRST food blogger conference!! I am SO excited!! This weekend in Orlando (Food Blog Forum) with Florida’s very own Steamy Kitchen. I can’t believe I’m getting some mama (kid-free) time. Yay!!

This sounds amazing!  I have red quinoa in my cabinet!  Do you have to rinse it well before cooking it?   The regular quinoa had a funny taste!  I will have to try this this weekend!
74 Meghan @ StruggleMuffins April 5, 2011 at 1:07 pm
There’s nothing like a light and tasty quinoa salad. I had one at a restaurant that had feta, spinach and dried cherries and it totally turned me on to quinoa. Yours looks delicious as well and I will most definitely be trying it!

Combining two of my great loves; quinoa and greek salad…YUM! This looks awesome and I cannot wait to give it a try!

76 Corina April 5, 2011 at 1:35 pm
This is my kind of salad.   I’d take it to work as a packed lunch.   I’ve never tried red quinoa though, but I’ve got the other type plus all the other ingredients in my cupboards and fridge so I’m definitely going to try it.
77 Emily @ Savory and Savage April 5, 2011 at 3:05 pm
I love the contrasting colors in that salad.
I love the texture and flavor of quinoa – but I haven’t tried the red quinoa but it looks great!

86 DessertForTwo April 5, 2011 at 10:26 pm
Oh yum! I can’t wait to try this! I bought quinoa a while ago and need to cook it up!
At least you weren’t pronouncing it’quinn-wah’
87 Jen April 6, 2011 at 12:27 pm
I did, in fact, have this for dinner — and leftovers for lunch!
Made some minor changes:  Used fat-free feta and no oil.  Doubled the black pepper, added a bit more lemon juice, added some diced green peppers, and used regular quinoa, not red.
Delicious!  My fiance and I both gobbled it up.
Thanks for the inspiration!

Great Recipe~ I love quinoa, full of protein and the red or black quinoa is packed with iron.
89 Rebecca @ How the Cookies Crumble April 7, 2011 at 4:10 pm
I love KEEEEEENWA! I also really had no clue how to say it until Trader Joe’s put the pronunciation on the side of the package! Thanks TJ’s for making me smarter!
90 Tammi Kibler @ How Do You Cook Quinoa? April 7, 2011 at 7:57 pm
I love quinoa salads, and I cannot imagine how anyone could let this salad sit in the refrigerator for more than a day or two. When I make a Mediterranean quinoa salad, it’s all I can think about until I have finished it.

Made it and loved it!!!! So simple fresh and flavorful.  It went perfect with the Balsamic chicken that I made to go with it.
My husband has a love hate relationship with quinoa..but after this side dish he is back on the love side.   Added some leftover spinach and red onion to the mix.  Yummy

95 Marisa April 22, 2011 at 4:53 am
This is delicious.  Brought it to a small family get together-people who didn’t know what quinoa was.  They were leary because they don’t like healthy food, but they ended up enjoying it.  My MIL kept asking me what it was.  However, my mom wouldn’t even try it.

96 Ellen April 23, 2011 at 9:29 am
This was super tasty and a good way to introduce quinoa to the boyfriend. I added a bit of shaved red onion. MMMMMMM I didn’t use quite as much of the cooked quinoa as the recipe called for, so i got to eat it for breakfast this morning with some cinnamon and maple syrup.

Made this salad today, and it was delicious! I used white quinoa because that’s what I had in the house. I put an avocado instead of the cucumber and some chopped fresh cilantro. Sooo good! Thank you for the recipe!

I’ve been eating this salad with rotini every day this week for lunch. SO GOOD.
102 Elaine Cooper August 17, 2011 at 12:45 pm
Quinoa is a seed to add as a staple to your pantry. It is so easy to prepare and can be added to almost any recipe in place of couscous, bulghur, or anything wheat. I’m making quinoa, chard,& goat cheese roll for dinner tonight!
103 Jamie May 22, 2012 at 11:39 pm
Looks great! Definitely making this tomorrow on my day off
