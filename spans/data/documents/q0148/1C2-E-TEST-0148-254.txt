1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1/2 cup toasted walnuts
In a small sauce pan, bring the milk, orange juice, and orange zest to a boil.  Stir in the vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and quinoa.  Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, dry toast your walnuts in a small skillet pan.  In a small bowl, mash your banana.  Stir in the maple syrup and set aside.
Remove quinoa from heat and stir in banana/maple syrup mixture.  Sprinkle with walnuts and serve.
Yes, this takes a little bit more time than standard oatmeal, but it’s totally worth it.  You can also make this the night before and heat it up in the morning if you have rushed mornings that don’t allow time for quinoa to cook.  Just cook the quinoa the night before, reheat and stir in the mashed banana and maple syrup in the morning.  For Meghan, I chop the walnuts to almost a crumb.  For an even younger baby, you can leave the walnuts out all together.
