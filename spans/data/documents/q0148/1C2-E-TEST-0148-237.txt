Tried this recipe for my first attempt at ever making or eating Quinoa. I used baby carrots in the recipe (thats what I had on hand) and I thought it was delicious. A good base recipe to add things too like green scallions or whatnot. It did take a longer time than stated to cook all of the broth out but this recipe made me fall in love with this healthy grain! Thanks for sharing it!

I used more carrots and more onions, so that I could count this as a starch and a veggie, and it was blah. It definitely needs something green (like in the picture) and needs something more for flavor. Not sure what, but will probably try again.

This needed something.  It was very bland.  It needs fresh herbs and more vegetables.

The correct pronunciation of Quinoa is keen-wah.
