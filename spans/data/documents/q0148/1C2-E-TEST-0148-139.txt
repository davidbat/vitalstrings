Always make extra quinoa.   Only good things can come of it.
Tomatoes are finally in season out here.  I’ve only been waiting all year long.  Dear summer, please don’t leave me!  
Tomatoes, quinoa, kale…
…mushrooms + egg?
Where am I going with this?  It kind of looks like veggie baked eggs , but it also looks something like my savory buckwheat bake .
Well, it’s neither.  It’s something completely new.
And I am pretty excited about it.  While I absolutely loved the veggie baked eggs, there was nothing I wanted more than a crusty piece of bread to dip in the drippy goodness.  However, that’s sort of not possible because of the whole no-gluten thing. 
Then I got to thinking.
…I wonder if mixing eggs + quinoa would hold together + make an egg bake?…
Kind of like a frittata…or a quiche without the crust.
I mixed the quinoa, eggs + veggies…
…baked it in my mini soup crock…
…and pulled it out of the oven in complete anticipation of a disaster.
I thought it would be stuck in the dish.
I didn’t think it would hold together.
I thought the quinoa might dry out.
But guess what?
It broke apart perfectly and tasted exactly as I hoped it would.
