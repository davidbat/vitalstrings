How to Cook Quinoa
Cultivated in the Andes for over 5,000 years, quinoa has been called the "mother grain" and "the gold of the Incas." Today, the popularity of quinoa (pronounced KEEN-wah) is growing steadily as people discover its pleasant nutty taste and superfood qualities. As a complete protein source also high in iron, magnesium, and fiber, quinoa is not only one of our healthiest pantry staples, but also one that's incredibly easy and quick to cook.
We've read that there are 1,800(!) varieties of quinoa, but just three main types are found in markets here: the most common white variety, as well as a red one and a black one. Here is our standard method for cooking any of these.
1. Measure and rinse quinoa. One cup of dried quinoa yields about 3 cups cooked. Measure out quinoa, place it in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse thoroughly with cool water, and drain. Rinsing removes quinoa's natural coating, called saponin, which can make it taste bitter or soapy. Although boxed quinoa is often pre-rinsed, it doesn't hurt to give the seeds an additional rinse at home. Some cookbooks suggest soaking the quinoa but, in our experience, this is unnecessary.
2. Place quinoa in a small saucepan with liquid. Quinoa may be cooked in water or vegetable or meat stock. We use a 2:1 ratio â€“ 2 cups liquid to 1 cup quinoa. Use a larger saucepan if you are cooking more than this basic amount.
3. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat. Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed. You should see tiny spirals (the germ) separating from and curling around the quinoa seeds (see image at right).
4. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve. Some people like to add olive oil, butter, salt, or pepper. Cooked quinoa can also be used as the basis for pilafs, salads, breakfast porridges, and more.
