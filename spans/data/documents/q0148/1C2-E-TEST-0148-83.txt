Quinoa ~ Botanical Name: Chenopodium quinoa
Quinoa                            (pronounced keen-wa or kee-noo-ah) is not a true cereal                            grain, but rather the botanical fruit of an herb plant.                            It is however treated as a grain in cooking. The grains                            are small yellow flattened spheres, approximately 1.5                            to 2 mm in diameter. When cooked, the germ coils into                            a small "tail" that lends a pleasant crunch.                            The leaves of the plant can also be eaten raw in salads                            or cooked like spinach.
One                            of the world's most perfect foods, it has been consumed                            for thousands of years in South America. Its small nutritious                            seeds resemble millet and is very versatile to a variety                            of cooking styles, inviting seasonings from mild to                            wild. Quinoa seeds are naturally coated with a bitter-tasting                            saponin that protects it from birds and insects, this                            is removed during processing.
Quinoa                            flour, ground from whole seeds, has a delicate nutty                            flavour. A gluten-free product, it is suitable for anyone                            afflicted by wheat allergies. Quinoa can be eaten as                            hot breakfast cereal; an infant cereal; a rice replacement;                            a nutritional thickener for soups, chilli and stew;                            in salads, casseroles and desserts; and more.
The                            plant is a broad-leafed, annual herb that grows wild                            and which has also been cultivated for thousands of                            years in the Andes. When mature, this tall plant is                            topped off with large plume-like seed heads that range                            in colour from vivid red, orange or yellow to black                            or white. Before being eaten, quinoa seeds must be processed                            to remove their bitter coating of saponin. After washing                            or dry polishing, the ready-to-cook seeds are white                            or beige in colour.
Quinoa's                            spinach-like leaves and its seeds are highly nutritious.                            The leaves, which unfortunately seldom reach the ‘modern’                            consumer, may be eaten raw in salads or cooked like                            spinach. They are high in Vitamin A. The seeds that                            ate now readily available are rich in protein, high                            in fibre, and particularly rich in the amino acid Lysine.
The                            ‘seeds’ are also good sources of calcium, phosphorus                            and vitamins B and E. There are several varieties of                            quinoa available in the shops, which range in colour                            from dark brown to near white. The latter varieties                            are most common and are considered superior. If storage                            beyond 3-4 weeks is required it should be stored in                            the refrigerator or even the freezer.
Once                            cooked, quinoa is delicious and extremely versatile;                            it may be used in the place of almost any other grain,                            including rice, to make everything from appetisers to                            desserts to pasta. You can even substitute it in your                            favourite recipe for rice pudding!
But                            where does this plant originate? It was one                            of the most sacred foods of the ancient Incas of South                            America, a plant so nourishing, delicious and vital,                            they called it chesiya mama; the ‘mother grain’. Each                            year the Incan emperor so it is said would, using a                            golden spade plant the first quinoa seeds of the season.                            At the solstice, priests bearing golden vessels filled                            with quinoa made offerings to Inti; the sun.
How                            come it is only just becoming available now? Why                            then unlike the other Inca "wonder foods" maize and potatoes, so little known outside of South                            America? This question has never really been answered,                            but one theory is that the Spaniards who carried maize                            and potatoes back to Europe in the sixteenth century                            may have tasted quinoa that had not been properly processed                            and would have been bitter to the palate and therefore                            failed to realise its potential.
Fortunately                            though, the skilful farmers of the Andes continued to                            cultivate it and, thus, presented this ancient "supergrain" for the modern world. Much of the credit for its introduction                            to the ‘modern world’ goes to the late Dave Cusack,                            a Colorado native. In 1984, Cusack and two partners                            began to import quinoa from South America.
