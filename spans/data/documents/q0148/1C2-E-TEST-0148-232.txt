Quinoa is an ancient food originally from the Andes region of South America, which is becoming more and more popular in the US because it's gluten free and has excellent nutritive content.
Though people tend to think of quinoa as a grain, it's actually a seed with grain-like properties (a "pseudo-cereal").
With exceptionally high protein levels (12%-18%), lots of vitamin E, and a wide variety of essential amino acids, it is an ideal choice for vegetarians, vegans, and those on restrictive diets. Quinoa is also high in fiber, iron, and magnesium and considered easy to digest.
Storage: Store organic quinoa in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place.
Shelf Life: Up to a year.
Quinoa is coated in saponins which help prevent it from being eaten by animals as they are extremely bitter. It is important to remove these from the surface of the grain prior to cooking by rinsing it thoroughly. We also recommend lightly toasting quinoa in the oven prior to cooking it for extra flavor.
Once cooked quinoa is an excellent substitute for couscous, rice, or bulgur. Simmer each cup of quinoa in two cups of water for 15 minutes. When ready the grain will pop, releasing its curly bran. Each cup of dry quinoa yields 2 cups cooked.
In addition to serving it as a hot side dish, try using quinoa in soups or blending it cooked but cooled with herbs, vegetables, and maybe some vinegar to make grain salads.  It's delicious paired with both meat and seafood.
