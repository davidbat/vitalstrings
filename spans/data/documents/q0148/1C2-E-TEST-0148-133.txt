After years of specific scientific study, we've determined that it's darn-near impossible to say "quinoa" (pronounced keen-wah) without a smile on your face.  Go ahead.  Try it.  You're smiling, aren't you?  Well, if you're smiling now (and we just know you are), just wait until you get a taste of Trader Joe's Organic Quinoa.  Smile city, friends!
Trader Joe's Organic Quinoa is an intriguing alternative to rice, couscous or pasta and is gluten free.  Often referred to as an "ancient grain," Quinoa has more than 5,000 years of history, and was so prized by the ancient Incas that it earned the designation "the mother grain." Why all the fuss?  Unlike most grains, quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids in a balanced protein.  It is often cited as one of the best protein sources in the vegetable kingdom.
Not sure what to do with your happy Quinoa?  Use it as you'd use rice.  It's that easy.  It can be eaten hot or cold, on its own or mixed with goodies like black beans and avocado.  You can amp up the flavor a bit by cooking it with Chicken Broth in place of water.  We're selling Organic Quinoa in a 16 ounce box for $3.99.  Still smiling, aren't you?  You'll find it in our grocery aisle.
