Quinoa Grains, Raw and Popped
Marian Blazes
Definition: Quinoa is a grain that has been cultivated in the Andean regions of Peru, Chile and Bolivia for thousands of years.  The small quinoa seeds have a higher protein content than most grains, and are rich in the amino acid lysine (lacking in wheat and rice).  Quinoa is usually simmered in water to soften and plump the grains, and then added to soups or salads. Quinoa is also popped and sold as cereal, and ground into flour.
Also Known As: quinua
