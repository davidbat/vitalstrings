I haven’t EVER bought beets cos I just don’t know what to do with them. This definitely helps! Although I will need to replace goats cheese with something that is commonly available. sigh.
42 Carey @ Positively Blonde June 17, 2011 at 7:07 am
This recipe looks great and so easy!  Definitely keeping this on the list for when I get home late from work and don’t have many items in the fridge!
43 Angela (Oh She Glows) June 17, 2011 at 7:19 am
That is such an interesting combo of ingredients and flavours! I’ll have to try this with some of Gena’s homemade vegan ‘goat cheese’ recipe. I bet it would be great!
44 Meghan @ StruggleMuffins June 17, 2011 at 7:19 am
I’ve totally never been a beet person but the picture just looks so damn yummy, I’m going to have to try it. Twist my arm, why don’tcha!
45 mary (what's cookin with mary) June 17, 2011 at 7:38 am
I am in love with all things quinoa… all things beet… and certainly all things goat cheese (have you tried goat feta?!)! Just posted a pasta salad (my brother’s recipe to be exact) with one of the three of those things
Come check it out!
Been really loving beets juiced also.  Note to self: don’t wear white when going to get a veggie juice with beets !

Beets + goat cheese = never a failure. And I love cooking quinoa in broth. This is my kind of lunch. Easy and delish.

Holy yum! I love beets, I love goat cheese, I love quinoa. Thank you for putting them all into one delicious, simple recipe. I might have to leave work right this minute and go make this!

Great quinoa recipe!

Mmm.. I love the combo of goat cheese and beets; they make a great salad at Whole Food’s that I often get with the combo.
I’ve never tried it with quinoa before, but that’s a great idea. I’m trying to play with quinoa a bit more in the kitchen. I went through a phase where I literally ate it ALL THE TIME, but I think it’s about time I bring it back!
Thanks for sharing.

goat cheese+quinoa.. looks amazing. I’m not sure how I feel about the beats though. I just can’t get into them no matter what recipe I try.
51 Urban Wife June 17, 2011 at 8:25 am
Beets aren’t exactly my choice veggie but I guess if there’s enough cheese to smother the taste, then I might go for it!
52 Jen of My Tiny Oven June 17, 2011 at 8:33 am
I love everything about this dish… I kinda want to marry this dish! You rock!

I love beets! But currently I’m obsessed with golden beets, they’re not as sweet and they’re flavor is much more subtle.

What cheese would substitute best for the goat cheese?  I’m obviously in the minority here, but I can’t stand the stuff.  It’s the only cheese I have an aversion to, and no matter how many times I try it, I can’t like it!
61 jenna June 17, 2011 at 10:32 am
feta?

My god, this sounds amazing. I just restocked on quinoa, and I cannot wait to make this recipe. Anything with goat cheese makes me abnormally happy!

I love beets and goat cheese together, but you added another one of my favorites quinoa! I can’t wait to try this!
64 Lauri (Redheadrecipes.com) June 17, 2011 at 10:57 am
MUST make quinoa again soon!! I LOVE quinoa pasta, but I honestly have only made a few dishes w/ ‘regular’ quinoa! This one looks yummy though!!
65 Kelli H (Made in Sonoma) June 17, 2011 at 11:19 am
Mmm…this would be perfect for me since I have a minor obsession with beets & goat cheese. I’ve made a salad like this before recently but with bulgar.

This might just need to be made ASAP…
70 Courtney June 17, 2011 at 12:48 pm
Looks yummy!
I don’t think I have seen this on your blog yet, but if you have an obsession with quinoa might you try some quinoa granola?  It’s pretty delicious; I keep some in my freezer and use it for topping yogurt, oats, and on pb&j!
71 Baking 'n' Books June 18, 2011 at 6:34 am
Oh I would love to see a granola with it! I love granola but buy the Nature’s Path all the time.
Also Jenna – I really like these recipes just for 1-2 servings. Mind doing more of those in the future? I know people like to do stuff for leftovers, but living alone and with little time sometimes I just like to prepare a dish and not clean up or store away stuff for later (plus, no freezer/fridge space!).
Thanks.
72 Rebecca @ How the Cookies Crumble June 17, 2011 at 12:57 pm
I was unsure about beets for a long time. There was something just weird and foreign and grandma like about them too me. But a couple of years ago my sister had a salad with beets and I tried it. And it was good!! And I’ve enjoyed beets (and beet greens!) ever since!! And trader joes precooked beets are pretty awesome!

73 Katie P June 17, 2011 at 1:32 pm
Mmmmmm… I am can’t wait to make this. Maybe I’ll add some pistachios for crunch and maybe a bit of citrus for some tang. YUM! Thanks for another stellar recipe!
74 Jennifer June 17, 2011 at 1:38 pm
I will totally make this.  I had to link to your recipe!  It looks delicious!

I live in Japan and I stopped by a health food store and asked for some quinoa (and I even pronounced it right!). The clerk looked at me quizzically and asked “Do you speak English?”
“Yes, and it’s still quinoa.”
I did find it in stock but the clerk had never heard of it. I tried to translate “ancient grain” but I think it perplexed her more. At least I found it and had a great quinoa veggie salad!

I’ve been meaning to try out quinoa forever now, I really have to get on it! I only recently discovered my love for beets in the last year after going to a chain in NYC called Junior’s. They always serves beets and pickles as a side/extra for whatever reason. Delicious, though. Can’t wait to try this recipe!
80 Kayla @ SproutyBuns June 17, 2011 at 3:44 pm
I am speechless. Two of my all-time favorite foods, quinoa and roasted beets, combined with my new found love, goat cheese … I think I shed a tear

Is this better than your beet risotto? Cause I made that a few weeks ago and I am still dreaming about it!
82 katie @KatieDid June 17, 2011 at 6:07 pm
nearly perfect meal in my eyes. Filling, light and fresh, tangy and sweet. I’m on a major goat cheese kick right now, I cannot seem to get enough of it on anything and everything.
83 Koko June 17, 2011 at 6:33 pm
This looks SO easy and delicious, I am definitely tying this for lunch next week.
84 Hillary [Nutrition Nut on the Run] June 17, 2011 at 6:42 pm
I just bought 2 x 4lb. bags of organic quinoa @ Costco today – yay, I’m addicted!
85 Justeen @ Blissful Baking June 17, 2011 at 7:37 pm
Mmm I love roasted beets! This sounds like my ideal lunch!
86 Joelle (On A Pink Typewriter) June 17, 2011 at 7:41 pm
You totally won me over with the mac and cheese comment, not that a meal of quinoa + goat cheese needs any incentive to be cooked in my kitchen. So good.

87 Hayley June 17, 2011 at 7:51 pm
I LOVE beets — nature’s candy! And I will eat goat cheese on anything. It’s the quinoa that’s throwing me off. I get a little grossed out by the little tails on them, and the whole rinsing thing is aggravating…they get all caught in my colander. What am I doing wrong?

I buy the Bobs Red Mill Organic brand which has already been rinsed and air dried! You can get it at your regular old grocery store!

I’ve become semi-obsessed with quinoa as well. It’s healthy and actually fills up my bottomless pit of a husband… what’s not to love!
In fact, I just posted a tasty quinoa side dish/appetizer/girl meal a few days ago: http://bit.ly/j8hIM2 . Thanks for another yummy way to try quinoa!

I honestly thought I hated beets but these pictures are so pretty and I’m trying to incorporate a wider variety of foods in my diet so I figured I’d give this a try. Plus I love quinoa and goat cheese, so it wouldn’t be a total loss. Turns out, I loved this dish!!! I added a little balsamic vinegar to the beets after they roasted and was very happy with the result. Thanks for expanding my horizons!

Last night I had beets for the very first time, and oh my head what a revelation. (‘They taste like earth!!’ but with lots more verbal exclamation points.) Just made your recipe for impromptu quasi-brunch (does it count as brunch if you had breakfast half an hour prior, but noon is less than ten minutes away?), and I think I want to eat this for the rest of my life.
I hope the beets can forgive me for having ignored them for so very long.
