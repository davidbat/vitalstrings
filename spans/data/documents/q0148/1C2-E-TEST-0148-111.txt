Quinoa is a good source of protein, has a nutty flavor and pleasing texture similar to rice. Quinoa is also full of vitamins and minerals - iron, magnesium, Vit E, potassium, amino acids - and fiber. Unlike wheat or rice, quinoa is a good source of lysine.
Quinoa is adaptable and gluten free. Because of its high protein and (good) fat content, quinoa is a satisfying meal with a few nuts or beans, and veggies added. It's a wonderful addition to soups and stews, transforming them into one dish meals.
Helpful Quinoa Tips:
Quinoa has high oil content, so it should be stored in the fridge to avoid becoming rancid
Quinoa is coated with saponin, which will give it a bitter taste unless you remove it by rinsing well.
Those cloudy or flaky bits in the rinse water are the saponin. Sometimes quinoa has had the saponin removed, which makes life easier, but it still should be rinsed well
If you have time, soak quinoa in cool water for 5 minutes before cooking, then drain and rinse in a colander
If you don't have time, give quinoa an extra rinse, under running water
