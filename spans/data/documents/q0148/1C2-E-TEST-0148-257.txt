1/2-1 Tablespoon fresh basil shopping list
How to make it
Heat a saucepan, throw your rinsed quinoa in and lightly toast it, moving it around constantly over medium heat. Once it is toasted, add the water, bring to a boil, cover with a tight fitting lid and reduce heat to low simmering the quinoa covered for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed.
Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine: olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, garlic, basil, and mint. Add in the tomatoes, cucumber, carrots and green onion (if you are using it). Mix in the cooled quinoa combining well, refrigerate at least one hour before serving, I usually leave it over night.
