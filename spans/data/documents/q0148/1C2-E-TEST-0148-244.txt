The Health Benefits of Quinoa
Brief History of Quinoa
Quinoa has been produced in South America since 3000 B.C., and although the Spanish conquistadors all but eliminated the existence of quinoa in an attempt to destroy the South American natives and their culture, quinoa is still an important seed crop for human consumption in the Andean region of South America.
Quinoa is able to grow in the severe cold and high altitude of the “altiplano” region of the Andes. Although quinoa is considered a grain, it’s technically the seed of a plant related to the beet, chard and spinach plants, and has been classified as a pseudo-cereal.
Quinoa can be substituted for almost any grain in any dish from soup to salad.   The major quinoa producing countries are Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, and although North American farmers are growing quinoa, they have been unable to match the quality of the quinoa grown in the Andean countries.
