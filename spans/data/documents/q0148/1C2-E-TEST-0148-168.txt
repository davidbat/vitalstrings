At Earthly Delights we are excited to bring you another exotic and highly nutritious, great tasting food, this time from South America. Quinoa (Pronounced KEEN-wah), is one of several ancient grains being rediscovered today by chefs around North America. Once known as “The Gold of the Incas” and the “Mother of all Grains” Quinoa, was the core protein of the Inca diet. In an effort to dominate the Indian culture the Conquistadors tried to eradicate the cultivation and consumption of Quinoa.
Quinoa is growing in popularity today because it delivers all of the nutritional benefits of animal protein without the fat and calories. The grain has a lovely nutty flavor that is richer in flavor than couscous and it cooks quickly in roughly 15 minutes.
Quinoa contains all 8 amino acids, the protein building blocks that our bodies can’t make but must get from our food. Quinoa has on average 13 % protein compared to rice at 9%. Quinoa is an excellent source of fiber, containing both soluble and non-soluble fiber. It is high in a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, like iron, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus. It is also gluten free.
Earthly Delights Quinoa is prewashed , so no further rinsing is required to remove the saponin. The coating makes the grain unappealing for birds eat while still on the plant. While our Quinoa is pre-washed you should still always place the product in a strainer prior to cooking and rinse thoroughly.
