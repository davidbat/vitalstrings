@Briony @ Freeze Your Way Fit , what would you recommend as the best way to freeze rice and quinoa?

Quinoa keeps appearing on our dinner table in place of rice, so the kids now know how to pronounce it and have learned not to groan.
I’m attempting to eat grain free for a while to heal a “leaky gut,” and quinoa, described as a supergrain, is actually classified as grain free in terms of its composition. The only thing is, it isn’t exactly “cheap,” especially in comparison to rice!

I’m going to try this recipe this week.  There is a lonely and neglected box of quinoa in my pantry. I bought it a couple months ago after reading about how healthy and high in protein it is….but its weird…and I don’t really know what to do with it.  Now I do!  Thanks!

Okay, I’ll get the giant Costco bag of quinoa out of my pantry and try again!

This recipe looks good.  I am going to add a cup of grated romano cheese after it is cooked though!

Were you curious about freezing quinoa? We have had success with freezing pilaf and simple quinoa.

This is almost the exact version I made last night! Then this morning I put the leftover quinoa in my scrambled eggs, with chives and topped with parmesan cheese…SO yummy!

I’ll try it today with my salad. I have a bag waiting for me.

I love it! I make it in so many ways. I like it for breakfast w/a little honey and cinnamon, I make it like Tabouli. In place of rice, cold on a salad. I love the fact that the protein level is high. It really seems to fill me up and hold me over until the next meal.

I just found this from your menu plan for the month.  so going to make this in the next two weeks.  Adding to my own menu plan!  I’ve only eaten it once, my sister made it while she was here last month and we all liked it but I didn’t really pay attention that well to what she did.  The best part is, there is still a half bag in the cupboard, so I don’t even have to buy anything to make it!  Yippee.

I made this a couple of months ago and froze some for future dinners. It was good. Thanks. This is a very big batch, so we had enough for two or three more dinners.
