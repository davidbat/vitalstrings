The information that you cannot eat seeds if you have diverticulosis is outdated.  Current up to date evidenced based medicine shows this to be an old fallacy that continues to live on.  Check out Mayo Clinic's website on this topic. There is no validity in it at all.

Quinoa is actually a seed although it is almost always cooked and used as a grain. Cooked quinoa has a consistency somewhat like brown rice and a mild, almost nutty flavor. So when prepared, it is not hard like other seeds such as poppy, rye or sesame seeds. We cook it and use it just like you'd cook and use rice. You could check with your doctor to see if quinoa could be allowed in your diet - just a thought....
