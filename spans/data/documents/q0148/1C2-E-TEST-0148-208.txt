1/2 medium white or yellow onion, small dice
2 medium jalapeños, seeded and finely chopped
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 chipotle in adobo sauce, finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup water
1 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
3/4 cup crumbled queso fresco
INSTRUCTIONS
Heat the oven to 350°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh strainer under running water.
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When it shimmers, add onion, jalapeños, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper and cook until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add chipotle and cilantro and stir to combine. Add rinsed quinoa and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and stir to coat. Add water and broth and bring to a boil.
Once boiling, transfer quinoa mixture to an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Spread evenly, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and transfer to the oven. Bake until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Remove the foil, stir, sprinkle quinoa with cheese, and return to the oven. Bake uncovered until all of the liquid has been absorbed, the quinoa is tender, and the cheese has softened, about 5 minutes more.

Baked Quinoa Adobado Recipe

this was very good.. i used two of the peppers out of the can instead of one. i didnt add any extra sauce out of the can. i used a little white cheddar because i was out of queso fresco.. the dish is so flavorful, it really didnt need much cheese.

I am absolutely crazy about this recipe. I usually modify it by replacing the cup of water with a few chopped tomatillos or a can of diced tomatoes. This tricks me into eating more vegetables, but also increases the cooking time because there's more liquid to cook off.
