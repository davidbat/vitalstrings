Storage Conditions
Temperature: Storing THRIVE at a high temperature can significantly increase the speed that calories and vitamins will degrade over time. In the correct storage container, low-moisture foods such as THRIVE can be stored at room temperature or cooler (75 degrees Fahrenheit or lower) and remain nutritious and edible for years. Our stated shelf life assumes that the product will be stored in optimal conditions.
Humidity: The effects of humidity on a closed can are caused by heat and very similar to the effects of high temperature (see above). High humidity can corrode the cans and in some cases even cause the cans to leak. Areas with high humidity can reduce the opened shelf life of the product. As humidity varies with location please use your own discretion to prevent possible sickness from eating spoiled food.
Damaged Container: Minor dents in the center of the can are usually just a cosmetic issue. However, a can that has been dented near or on a seam can have a compromised air-tight seal and allow oxygen to enter the can. If this is the case we recommend using the dented can within the specified opened shelf life, rather than closed.
The best way to maintain the highest quality of your THRIVE products is to take care of them. If you intend on storing your food for the sealed shelf life, store the cans in a place that is not open to elements such as water, light, and air. Take care of it. Don't expose it unnecessarily to the elements. Also, be sure to keep the temperature and humidity low and even. Under these proper storing situations your THRIVE will maintain its delicious taste, natural coloring, and proper nutrients.
