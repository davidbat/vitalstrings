Chicken fingers are always a hit for kids but grown-ups will love this version with the added nutrition that quinoa provides.   I tested these out on my “big kid” (my husband) as well as my friend Chad’s seven year old son, Luke.
Serves 4 kids or 2 hungry adults
Ingredients
2 pound chicken tenders or skinless boneless breasts, sliced into 3-inch long tenders
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 cups cooked red or white quinoa
1/2 cup whole wheat or seasoned breadcrumbs
2 egg whites
2 tablespoons olive oil
Directions
Spread out the quinoa on a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the quinoa. With your fingers tips, squeeze the quinoa and breadcrumbs together until the moisture of the quinoa is absorbed Place the egg whites in a shallow bowl.  Sprinkle the chicken with salt, garlic powder, pepper, and paprika.
Place the egg whites in a shallow bowl.  Dip the chicken in the egg and then into the quinoa mixture. Place onto a plate.  Warm the oil in a large skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the chicken and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook each side 4-5 minutes, turning once, until the crust begins to brown, and the chicken is not longer translucent.  Transfer fingers to a plate and serve immediately.
