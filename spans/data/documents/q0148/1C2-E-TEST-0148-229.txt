Quinoa, like Amaranth , is referred to as a grain because of its taste and cooking qualities that are similar to other grains. It is actually a seed though, and is a highly nutritious food.  Quinoa is a food high in protein, and is almost a complete and perfect balance of all 8 essential amino acids that humans need. It is exceptionally high in lysine. Quinoa (pronounce keen-wah) is 12 - 18% protein, and is gluten free. The seeds may be sprouted, or ground into flour, and are often sold made into products such as pasta, or as rolled flakes for breakfast cereal; nutritious gluten free alternatives to wheat or oat based products.
Cooking Quinoa
Quinoa needs to be rinsed before use, to remove a bitter taste the plant produces called saponin, as a protective coating.  Use 1 Cup quinoa to 1 3/4 cups water, Bring this to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave for 10 minutes before removing the lid.
Quinoa may be sprouted ; soak about 1/3 cup seeds in a jar for 2 -4 hours, then drain and rinse the seeds well twice a day for 2-4 days.
Quinoa may be toasted before cooking in the oven or in a dry frypan, giving it a lovely roasted flavour when cooked (proceed as above after toasting.)
Uncooked quinoa may be added to soups and stews as you would barley or rice.
