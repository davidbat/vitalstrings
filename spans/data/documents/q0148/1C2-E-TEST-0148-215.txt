Quinoa: the Newest, Oldest Super Food
Quinoa (pronounced Keen-wa) has recently been receiving a lot of attention and acclaim as one of the latest “superfoods”. But, in fact, quinoa has been a diet staple in South America for hundreds of years where it flourishes in the mountainous soil of the Andes.  The Incas even deemed the kernels sacred because when eaten regularly, they seemed to ensure long, full lives.
What is so special about this tiny fruit?
That’s right, although quinoa has a grain-like appearance and is often considered to be one of the “ancient grains”, its not a grain at all. It is the dried fruit of the Chenopodium herb family.
Regardless of its botanical category, quinoa is power-packed with nutrients. One cup of cooked quinoa provides five grams of fibre and eight grams of protien (more than a cup of whole milk). Quinoa protein even includes all the essential amino acids, the building blocks for protein, which classifies it as a “complete” protein – uncommon among plant-based foods. Quinoa is also gluten-free and low on the glycemic index. Its also a source for various vitamins and minerals including, vitamin B1, B2, B6, folate, xinc, iron, and magnesium.
With all these health benefits, why wouldn’t you want to include it in your diet more often? And that’s what this site is about — providing information and recipes for adding quinoa to your regular diet in easy and delicious ways!
