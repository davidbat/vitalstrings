"In fact, legend has it that the Incan armies frequently marched for days at a time eating a mixture of quinoa and fat known as "war balls," and at planting time tradition demanded that the Incan leader would plant the first quinoa seed using a gold shovel. Quinoa is a highly nutritious food and is considered a high-protein "grain." The protein quality and quantity in quinoa seed is often superior to those of more common cereal grains, and the nutritional quality of this crop has been compared to that of dried whole milk by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations."

"Preparing and Eating Quinoa You can use quinoa to make flour, soup, or breakfast cereal. Most quinoa sold in the United States has been sold as whole grain that is cooked separately as rice or in combination dishes such as pilaf. Noted natural-foods expert and author Rebecca Wood suggests cooking about 2 cups of stock or water per cup of quinoa, which should yield about 3 cups of cooked grain and take only about 15 minutes to prepare."

"Quinoa has a complete protein, high fiber, excellent mineral content, complex carbohydrates and a long shelf life to boot. It's • easy to prepare, easy to eat, and can be made into a number of delicious recipes. That's why the Incas considered quinoa to be a gift from the gods. I agree with this view on quinoa, which is why I make it a part of my daily diet. Health Improvements You Can Expect to Experience So far we've talked about what good nutrition really means -- how to get it and why the national food supply is not a good source for nutrition."

"Among the best are millet and quinoa. Five White Poisons Five white foods—sugar, salt, white flour, white rice, and pasteurized milk—are often referred to as the "five white poisons." This is because they contain little, if any, nutrition, and all produce acid in the body. They draw on the body's nutrient resources while being digested. None of these foods should be included in one's diet because they are health depleting. They are incomplete foods."

"Noted natural-foods expert and author Rebecca Wood suggests cooking about 2 cups of stock or water per cup of quinoa, which should yield about 3 cups of cooked grain and take only about 15 minutes to prepare. She reminds us that it is as versatile as rice (and, in my opinion, a good deal better for us) and can be substituted for rice in any recipe, or used as a side dish. Quinoa has a lower sodium content and is higher in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, copper, manganese, and zinc than wheat, barley, or corn."

"Cereal: This includes cereals made from grains, including wheat, barley, oats, rice, corn, quinoa, and any other grain that's old or new, whole or processed. In other words, all cereals! 2. Bread: This means white, wheat, oat, whole, multigrain, or otherwise. If it's bread, it counts. 3. Pasta: All pasta counts, regardless of composition—seminole wheat, wholegrain, flax, egg noodles, rice noodles, and spinach. 4. Meat/Fish: This includes beef, pork, poultry, game meat, organ meat, and seafood of any kind (including shellfish). I also include cottage cheese."

"Quinoa (Keen-wali) Why: quinoa, a grain, supplies a complete protein (providing all nine essential amino acids), and is a great source of complex carbs. The combo keeps blood sugar levels balanced, guarding against those highs and lows throughout the day. A favorite, this Superfood is delicious when eaten cold or hot and provides the brain with nutrients to maintain stability when feeling tense. Its high mineral concentrations of magnesium, manganese, copper, calcium and iron help maintain focus and relaxation."

"As long as you have frozen cooked beans and rice or quinoa (a wonderful grain from South America that is very easy and fast to cook) on hand, you can add any combination of fresh-cut vegetables and toss everything together. As you experiment, mix and match ingredients. Kids have favorites, so introduce different salads and see what works best for your family.

"Whole wheat, whole rye, bulgur wheat, whole oats, barley, buckwheat (kasha or buckwheat groats), whole corn, cornmeal, wild rice, brown rice, popcorn, and less well-known whole grains, such as couscous, kamut (a relative of durum wheat), quinoa, amaranth, millet, spelt, teff, triticale, grano, and faro. There is a marvelous variety of choices, both familiar and new. You can also eat cereals that do not contain added sugar and oil— old-fashioned oats, for instance (not the quick-cooking variety), shredded wheat, and brand names like Grape-Nuts."

"Try some of the less familiar but highly nourishing whole grains such as millet, buckwheat, teff, quinoa, amaranth, spelt, bulgur wheat, and barley. These are all available, often in bulk form, through natural food stores. You'll want to "go organic" with these foods, as well as others, whenever possible. An organization that has worked diligently to increase awareness about the dangers of pesticides (as well as the hazards of food irradiation and biotechnology) is Food and Water, Inc., at 1-800-EAT-SAFE. TIP Olive oil and/or coconut oil is suggested for use with cooking."

"There are also less well-known choices: kamut, quinoa, amaranth, millet, spelt, teff, triticale, grano, faro. But it is often difficult to figure out which grains are whole and which are not. Color is not a clue; whole oats are light in color, for instance, and refined flours can be darkened with molasses. Here, again, examine labels closely. Look for "100 percent whole." Products described as multigrain, cracked wheat, seven-grain, stone-ground, 100 percent wheat, enriched flour, or degerminated corn-meal are not whole grain."

"Amaranth, millet, buckwheat and quinoa are among the few grains that are alkaline forming upon digestion. Most people are more or less "gluten intolerant" and should not eat the following grains: wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt, triticale, kamut and farina. Severe gluten intolerance without a proper diet leads to celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis. Celiac disease is characterized by diarrhea, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome and/or other signs of indigestion. Milder forms of gluten insensitivity include allergies and asthma."

"Eliminate wheat, bul-gur, corn, oats, rye, quinoa, and tapioca. Fruits. Eliminate canned fruits, dried fruits that have been sweetened, jams, jellies, and ketchup. Nuts. Eliminate roasted nuts, peanuts in salted mixtures, and glazed nuts. Beverages. Eliminate cow's milk, goat's milk, soy milk, rice milk, canned coconut milk, tea, and soft drinks."

"Buy more organic whole foods and whole grains: brown rice, millet, kamut, barley, quinoa, whole wheat, soba (buckwheat), and spelt. • Organic fresh fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods naturally rich in nutrients. You should buy produce in season to reduce your risk of exposure to chemically treated produce. • Calcium-rich foods (leafy green vegetables, oranges, bread). • Fatty acids are essential for healthy membranes, hormones, and nerves. Load up on walnuts, pumpkin seeds, soybeans, linseed oil, rapeseed oil, and flax oil."
