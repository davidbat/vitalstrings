Edit Steps
1
Rinse the grains of quinoa in water. You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box. If you have the grain, it will need to be placed in a strainer or a cheesecloth and placed under ample running water for a few minutes. This is necessary to remove the saponins, which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed.
2
Cook the quinoa. Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain. Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ, in the same way as pasta.
3
Try an alternative cooking method. If you prefer, it is possible to fry the grains in a frying pan before cooking. This brings out their nutty flavor.
