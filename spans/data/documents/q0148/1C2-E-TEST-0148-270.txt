Are you a vegetarian or moving towards a plant-based lifestyle?
Do you want the world to be a better place for generations to come?
Are you an avid recycler?
Do you strive to live a life of purpose and meaning?
If you answered "yes", then you may be ready to invest with your values.
Like quinoa("keen-wa"), socially responsible investing has been around for a long time. We like to believe that going back to the basics is also experiencing a resurgence in popularity("spend less, save more", for example).  Much like the supergrain, we have had our own reawakening of sorts; we are taking our years of experience in the financial industry and combining this with our passion to change the world.
When you work with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, you are working with a professional who has pledged to put their clients' needs first (contrast this with a "financial advisor" who makes a living selling products and generating commissions).  As a fee-only practice, we provide advisory services on an hourly basis and do not sell any products or accept incentives in any form from any entity.  If you allow First Affirmative Financial Network the privilege of managing your investments, your fee will be based on the amount of assets under management, not to exceed 1%.
At Quinoa Financial Consulting, we take an enormous amount of pride in being able to provide objective financial planning services for those who value individual responsibility in mapping our their future. We strive to help you to do that which you want to do, for as long as you are able to do it by keeping you on the right track financially. We believe you can make money while making a difference, and we work exclusively with this mission in mind.

If appx. 3% of the United States is vegetarian(Vegetarian Times, 2008), and the average 401(k) balance is $71,500(Fidelity Investments®, 2011), then there is potentially over $640 billion that can be used to improve animal welfare practices using shareholder advocacy and our proxy voting power if we all work together.
