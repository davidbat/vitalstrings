Mushroom-Leek Quinoa Salad
December 10, 2010
Like so many things around here, this little salad was born from a mistake — a half-pound of button mushrooms cooked to that just-brown -around-the-edges-crispy-perfection that I thought would work in a savory tart, but didn’t. I’d already promised X mushroom something for dinner, and I didn’t want to waste them, either.
I wasn’t leaving the house again. Not even to the stinky Franprix down the street. It had snowed. Then it rained. It was still below freezing, and I was tired of leaving the apartment dry, and then coming home wet and cold. So whatever I made, it would be with what I had on hand.
I had leeks, already roasted, also in the fridge – some would be for the tart, I decided, and the rest, for this — a great, nutty side that’s super-protein packed with both red and regular-colored quinoa.
So we had our tart for dinner and I served up this salad, too — and got rave reviews from X, the mushroom fanatic. Now that I’ve easily put this salad together completely by accident, I think that I’ll make it a fall-winter regular.
I don’t know about y’all, but this happens to me all the time. I start out in one direction, something unexpected happens, and I take a different route altogether, and end up in a much more interesting place then I’d imagined.
Let the spirit of adventure – in the kitchen and otherwise – take us into the holiday season and into the new year.
And of culinary camaraderie, too — this is my offering for this Friday’s “Let’s Lunch” gang of food bloggers across the globe. Cheers, y’all!
Today’s assignment: a holiday side (but I think that I’m going to make this whenever the mood strikes).
