I thought Quinoa technically isn’t a grain but a vegetable.

Quinoa is originally a Quecha word, but pronounced as heard in Spanish.
I am looking for more ways to use it (in savoury dishes; I don’t eat sweets).

We love quinoa. Before adding the water to it, cook it in a few teaspoons of olive oil for a slight toasty taste. Use only 2 cups less 2 Tablespoons of water to 1 cup of quinoa. Then there is no excess water to drain off, no loss of minerals or other nutrients. Simmer on low for 20 minutes. Turn off heat and let rest for 10 minutes to absorb remaining water.
Cold quinoa makes a great base for tuna salad with olive oil and lemon or lime juice plus lots of veggies.

What about the need to rinse quinoa before cooking?   That always feels like a barrier to cooking it.   (Though it’s not really that difficult.)   None of these recipes reference that step…
Thanks!

Quinoa is not a cereal or grain, but it is a seed.
Cereals/grains are seeds that come from plants in the grass family, such as wheat, rice, corn, and oats.
Quinoa the seed of a “broadleaf” plant. Broadleaf plants are flowering plants (“angiosperms) such as roses, apple trees, broccoli, and peppers. So quinoa is a seed, but not a grain.
All plants are vegetable in nature, but whether they are classified as “vegetables” is a commercial designation, not a biological one. For example, tomatoes are fruits, but in grocery stores, they are usually grouped with foods derived from roots (onions, potatoes).
I have never had any quinoa I liked. I guess I’ll keep trying, but without much optimism.

I’m surprised noone is mentioning that quinoa is best when rinsed in a strainer prior to cooking. Quinoa has a naturally occurring powdery substance on it that acts to deter insects. This substance tends to be bitter. Rinsing it first makes this wonderful grain even better.

I made the mistake of not rinsing it once and the results were awful.  If rinsing is needed before cooking, would it be necessary to dry it out before grinding the flour (for muffin recipe)?

I made a big  batch of spiced quinoa which was really super but when I still had left overs 3 days later I decided to replace the bread or bread crumbs I would add to meatloaf with the spiced quinoa. Topped the meatloaf with sweet asian chili sauce and baked as usual.  It was superb!!!

Boost quinoa’s vitamin and amino acid content by soaking 24 hours till little rootlets start to form. Germination makes it cook even faster, just a flash of boiling water and you’re ready to go. Soooo much better for you b/c of the magic in the seed, wakes up the enzymes which convert the storage starch — empty calories — to everything the plant needs to grow.
