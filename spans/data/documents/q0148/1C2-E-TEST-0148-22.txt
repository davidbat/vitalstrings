What is quinoa?
While quinoa is usually considered to be a whole grain , it is actually a seed, but can be prepared like whole grains such as rice or barley . Try a quinoa pilaf salad recipe , or serve a vegetable stir-fry over cooked quinoa instead of rice.  Quinoa is my favorite whole grain for three reasons: First, it takes less time to cook than other whole grains â€“ just 10 to 15 minutes. Second, quinoa tastes great on its own, unlike other grains such as millet or teff. Add a bit of olive oil, sea salt and lemon juice and - yum! Finally, of all the whole grains, quinoa has the highest protein content, so it's perfect for vegetarians and vegans. Quinoa provides all 9 essential amino acids, making it a complete protein. Quinoa is a gluten-free and cholesterol-free whole grain, is kosher for Passover , and is almost always organic.
Culinary ethnologists will be interested to know that quinoa was a staple food for thousands of years in the Andes region of South America as one of just a few crops the ancient Incas cultivated at such high altitude.
