Instructions
1
Choose clean, organic quinoa and store it in a cool, dry place until you are ready for sprouting. Begin the sprouting process by soaking the quinoa in water for 12 hours in a cool, dark location. Remember that sprouting will triple the size of the grain, so only sprout as much as you can use in about 2 weeks.
2
Drain the water from soaked quinoa and rinse the grain thoroughly. Quinoa naturally contains saponin, which causes a soapy residue to rinse off of the grain. If you do not thoroughly rinse your, your sprouts will end with a bitter flavor.
3
Place drained and rinsed quinoa into a wide mouth glass jar and cover loosely with a piece of cloth. Place the grains in a cool semi-lit location and repeat the rinsing and draining procedure 2 or 3 times a day. Make sure that you keep sprouting quinoa out of direct sunlight and that you drain as much water as possible off of the grains before leaving to sprout. This will increase the speed of sprouting while decreasing the chances of mold growth.
4
Stop the sprouting process after two or three days, when then tails of the quinoa have grown to 1/2 or 1 inch in length. Rinse the quinoa a final time and then cover loosely and place in the refrigerator, as cold temperatures prevent further sprouting. Sprouts should be eaten within 2 weeks.
