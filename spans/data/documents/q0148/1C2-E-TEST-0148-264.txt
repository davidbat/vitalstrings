truth.  next time some carob chips may be a late addition.

This looks wonderful! I like a granola with plenty of dried fruit. I love it when a dried cranberry hits cold almond milk or yogurt and gets hard as a rock. I’m sure many people hate that, but to me it’s like a little piece of candy!
6 rebecca lustig February 23, 2011 at 6:21 am
I totally agree with you, I’m very particular about my granola. I wish I could blend various brands into one, bc there are things I like and dislike about each.
I’ve made quinoa cereal (highly recommend it), but never quinoa granola! Love it

my favorite comment that you wrote on my blog is this: you’re a loser. because it’s true.
anyway… i was talking to my mom about keen-wah and she said that apparently the people in bolivia (or someplace like that) whose staple food is keen-wah can hardly afford it anymore because the price has skyrocketed now that americans are eating so much keen-wah. just thought you may want to know. as a result, i will be eating more joe joe’s and less keen-wah.

I’m not a real granola fan, probably because I’ve never found a REALLY good one — or I’ve never made it.  But I am definitely going to try this!!
And as for the smell of coconut oil, I could not agree more.  My daughter roasts butternut squash seeds with it, and the smell in the house is AH-MAZING!!!

Yes, definitely drooling. You and I have pretty much the same requirements for granola (the clusters are #1 in my book) – so I can imagine that this recipe is golden. Must try.
22 Casey February 23, 2011 at 11:13 am
Why, yes indeed I am drooling.
Crunch is a must in granola. I also don’t like overtly sugary sweet granola. The flavors need to be a little more subtle.
Hence: homemade > store-bought
23 Jeremy Logsdon February 23, 2011 at 11:43 am
That looks amazing.  Definitely gonna make that, soon.  I just live handfuls of dried granola as a midafternoon snack.  That looks way healthier than anything I’ve ever bought.
24 my little celebration February 23, 2011 at 12:02 pm

I thought quinoa had to be rinsed of saponins and/or cooked before ingesting it. Are the saponins not poisonous?

26 elise February 23, 2011 at 1:33 pm
this quinoa was pre-rinsed.  otherwise yes you should rinse quinoa before cooking it – i dont think its lethal though – just advised

Unfortunately my budget doesn’t allow for the purchusing of coconut oil, is there anyway I could subtitute some other oil without decreasing the yum factor?

37 cait February 26, 2011 at 10:55 am
just made this — didnt have coconut oil so i used a mix of coconut butter and olive oil instead…..this caused the granola to not clump but turned out really loose, just like a cereal, which is actually okay by me! i’m eating it right now mixed in with some yogurt. the taste is really good! price wise it wasn’t that bad at all either…i only had the oats, coconut butter and olive oil, so i had to buy all the rest, but i just went to sunflower market and bought everything from the bulk bins, so total it was maybe $6, which i think is reasonable considering its making like 8 or 10 cups of granola/cereal! also, elise, i don’t think you mention at what point to add the dried fruit.  i actually added it at the same point i added the nuts, but i’m not sure this is right because some of the fruit burned in the oven….
Reply
38 elise February 26, 2011 at 10:57 am
i added the dried fruit with the nuts…since none of mine burned in the oven im wondering if the different heating point of the oil had anything to do with it?  next time maybe try canola oil if you dont have coconut oil.  otherwise, i definitely think coconut oil is worth the $$$$…either way im glad you like it
Reply
39 cait February 27, 2011 at 10:54 am
yeah i think you are right about the heating points….i have baked with olive oil before and noticed similar burning results so i should have figured it out….but the granola is so yum….just had a handful plain and the flavor and crunch are amazing! it also kept me full for like 4 hours yesterday….great recipe & thanks for sharing it!

Elise, I made this tonight and it is FABULOUS!  Seriously the best granola ever.

I want to devour the whole pan in one sitting, but I’m trying to restrain myself!

This granola is amazing! i just made it for a second time and made the following subs:
* Left out dried fruit
* Added 3 T. cocoa powder
* Reduced maple syrup to 1/4 c.
* Reduced coconut oil to 1/4 c.
* Added 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* Increased cinnamon to 1 T. total
It’s as yummy as the original, just a chocolate twist! In the original I reduced the syrup & oil and increased/added salt + cinnamon too. Also good!
Thanks Elise. Love your blog! I’m not vegan but trying to eat vegan more often to try to reduce my cholesterol without drugs. Your daily menus are a veggierific inspiration!

I made this over the weekend. I left out some of the nuts (because I’m cheap) and reduced the sugar and oil, and I thought it was fantastic! I used dried blueberries for the fruit. I absolutely adore the texture – perfect clumpage! The only problem I had is that I didn’t remove it from the parchment until after it cooled, and it stuck to the paper like crazy. Ugh. I think I will try this again with the addition of carob buttons. mmmm….blueberries and carob

Even if it turned out disgusting (which it most certainly did not) it would have been worth it just for the smell of coconuts hanging in the summer heat this afternoon.
Reply
78 Robyn July 13, 2011 at 9:57 pm
Oh, and also, was discussing this recipe earlier with my sister, and we were wondering if you could swing it if you soaked the quinoa/almonds etc in water first to sprout them? Seeds change chemically significantly when they are brought back to life, and are way healthier when soaked. I believe I heard in a botany class that almonds actually contain a chemical that is a precursor to cyanide on their skin as a digestion inhibitor. Anyways, what do you think? Would it be soggy?
Reply
79 Elise July 13, 2011 at 10:32 pm
i loooove the smell of coconut baking. anyways, to answer the soaking question, im curious too now.  it may work to soak them and then drain them really well once they started sprouting.  i don’t know if baking the quinoa afterwards would un-do any of the health benefits of sprouting though…
you’re right about the almonds though.  check out this post: http://www.hungryhungryhippie.com/raw-almond%C2%A0fluff/

86 Vegan Dan September 14, 2011 at 8:55 pm
I made your granola recipe the other day and loved it!
But one problem…
Is it possible that the Quinoa is not digestible without boiling it in water? Because the morning after I had the granola, I saw the quinoa in my stools as if it had not been digested at all…
is this something I should worry about? or did I not bake the qunioa right? Or maybe  my body can’t digest quinoa without boiling it. I have the same problem when I sprout quinoa too.
Any ideas?

87 Elise September 14, 2011 at 9:15 pm
interesting.  ive never experiences this, and i have the weirdest GI tract so im not sure what to tell you.  obviously, im not exactly an expert on this, but id say as long as you feel ok, its nothing to be alarmed over.  but if it is coming out the same way its going in, i dont see how any of the nutrients could be getting absorbed.  im assuming this doesnt happen when you cook it?
i wouldnt be a good and prudent nurse if i didnt advise you to follow up on this if you notice any other changes or digestive issues.

88 Vegan Dan September 15, 2011 at 12:25 am
It seems to be only the case with some sprouts such as quinoa, and I guess in this case, raw baked Qunioa. When I cook Quinoa (boiling it in water) things turn out fine. I think I have a strange GI tract too…Thanks for trying to help. I think I will continue to avoid sprouted Quinoa and baked Quinoa.

89 Lynda September 16, 2011 at 5:54 am
I frequently experiment with granola, and on my last try added quinoa, millet, and barley, which I cooked in boiling water before I added it to the oat-nut mix for baking. (I cooked it first because the last time I added millet raw–without the quinoa or barley–it came out like grit after the mix was baked.) This time there was a little more hard grit! Any thoughts on how to add these healthful grains without the grit factor?

90 Denise September 20, 2011 at 10:05 am
I love quinoa!  It is covered with a naturally occurring bitter tasting substance called saponins that must be washed off before you cook it.  I just tasted a bit of it raw and the after taste is unpleasant.  Did you rinse it first?
Reply
91 Elise September 20, 2011 at 10:49 am
hey denise.  most companies pre-rinse their quinoa now, but if it doesnt say so on the bag, yes, rinsing it first is a good idea.  the saponins can be overly bitter to some.

This was my first ever batch of granola and I absolutely love it! I was skeptical about the buckwheat at first, thinking I might reduce the quantity, but I forced myself to trust the recipe and your rave reviews. All I did was add a big splash of vanilla and it turned out amazingly.
This could definitely become part of my regular recipe rotation (along with hummus variations and homemade ice cream, mostly from David Lebovitz’s book).  Thanks a bunch, Elise!
