1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced very thin
1 cup fresh spinach
1 ounce feta cheese
Directions
Rinse the quinoa in a strainer. (Use a sifter if you don't have a strainer that's small enough.) In a small saucepan, add the quinoa and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover and reduce heat to simmer until water is absorbed, about 10-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and garlic. Cook the garlic in the oil until the edges of the garlic turns very light brown, being careful not to burn the garlic (reduce heat to low if necessary). When the quinoa is done cooking, add it to the skillet along with the spinach. Stir it together until the spinach wilts. Add the crumbled feta cheese and stir to combine. Makes 2 servings.
*Edit* I discovered why the calorie count was so high. The nutrition info in the database for the quinoa was completely different than what's listed on the box (for the same brand I used). So I changed the info on the quinoa, and now the nutrition info should be correct. Sorry about that!*
