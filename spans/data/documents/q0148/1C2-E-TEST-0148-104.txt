This recipe came about because I had just made vegetable enchiladas and had leftovers, plus quinoa from earlier in the week. Thankfully, this experiment yielded a hearty, delicious meal. Submitted by: SP_STEPF

Quinoa Pilaf
You can lighten this recipe up by using non-fat parm but I love it this way and it still is a reasonable calorie count.  The quinoa makes this pilaf extra nutritional.  One of my family's favorite sides.  Could also be a good main meal by adding cubed chicken breast or just leave vegetarian (use vegetable stock instead of chicken).  Sometimes I add a different variety of veggies like green beans.Submitted by: CLINARD
