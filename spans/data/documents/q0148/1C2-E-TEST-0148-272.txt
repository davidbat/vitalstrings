This looks SO good!  We just discovered quinoa last summer, and it’s a grain worth knowing.  I’ll give your recipe a try next week!

I LOVE quinoa, but have had a hard time finding different ways to cook with it.  This recipe looks great, I’m definitely bookmarking it to try soon.

First, thank you for stopping by my blog during ICLW!  I appreciate the time you spent checking it out!  =)
Second, this is the first I’m hearing of this quinoa stuff.  However, it seems like it tastes pretty good.  I don’t have children yet, but I do have a new husband that eats horribly (and I can’t say that I eat a fantastic diet).  I am trying to get us both onto a better dietary road, and I’m thinking that your chicken recipe may be a way to ease him in to something new.  I, on the other hand, eat (or will try to eat) just about anything.  I guess that’s partly my problem!  lol!
Keep the little ones healthy and Happy ICLW!!!  =)

One quick note: I am making this recipe tonight, and see oregano is an ingredient, but the recipe does not say when/where to add it.
