Organic Whole Grain Quinoa (Imported).
Directions
To Prepare: Rinse Quinoa. Place 2 cups water and 1 cup quinoa in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan and bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until all of the water is absorbed (about 15 minutes). You will know that the quinoa is done when all the grains have turned from white to transparent, and the spiral-like germ has separated. Makes 3 cups.
