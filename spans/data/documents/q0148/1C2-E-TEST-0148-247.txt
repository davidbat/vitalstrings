Prepping Quinoa
Written on June 27, 2011 by Caitlin in Prepping Series
Quinoa is my favorite ‘grain’ ever.  I say ‘grain’ because it’s not actually a grain at all – it’s a seed!
Other fun facts about quinoa:  it’s rich in amino acids, it’s a relative of spinach and Swiss chard, and 1/4 cup of uncooked quinoa contains loads of manganese, magnesium, and iron.
 
Quinoa is awesome because tastes delicious AND cooks in seven minutes.  Yes – SEVEN MINUTES.  Take that, brown rice.
Here’s how I prep quinoa!
 
Note:  Some quinoa has not been pre-rinsed; you might rinse it to remove a bitter coating that naturally occurs on the seed.   If necessary, pre-rinse your quinoa by filling a bowl with water and draining the quinoa several times.   I haven’t bought quinoa that hasn’t been pre-rinsed in a long time – even from the bulk bin! 
 
Step 1:  Bring a pot of water to boil.  It doesn’t matter how much water you use, as long as it covers all the quinoa.  Halfway full in a small pot is fine!
Step 2: Pour in the quinoa.  I usually eat 0.5 a cup (measured dry) when I eat it as part of an entrée.
Step 3:  Cook for seven minutes.  You’ll know it’s ready when the little tails come out!
Step 4: Use a pot top or a spatula to drain off the water.  Place the pot back on the stovetop and turn off the heat.  Give the quinoa a toss and let the remaining heat cook off the remaining liquid.
Step 5:  Munch!
I served my quinoa with some stir-fried broccoli, corn salsa, pistachios, and refried pinto beans.
With some hot tea and dark chocolate for dessert.
