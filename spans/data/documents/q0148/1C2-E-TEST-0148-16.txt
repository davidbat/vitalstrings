About the Brand
Bob Moore's secret to life may just be "work hard and keep it simple." Living this philosophy, Bob literally puts his nose to the grindstone every day. Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods is an Oregon-based company that utilizes simple, old-world technology to mill hundreds of all-natural whole grain products.
Bob's Red Mill is dedicated to the manufacturing of natural foods in the natural way. In their own words: "With all the sophisticated knowledge of recent times, no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flour quite as well as our flint-hard quartz millstones quarried in France and used by discriminating millers since early Roman times."
"Our well-dressed (sharpened) sets of millstones turn the highest quality wheat into a finer, better baking bread flour than all the hammer mills, steel roller mills, steel buhr mills, or pulverizers ever built! These slow turning millstones grind the bran, endosperm, and germ (containing its nutritious wheat germ oil) into flour in a cool natural way, creating a more assimilable food."
Bob's Red Mill stone grinds all common and most uncommon grains into flours and meals on its over 100-year-old mills. They mix them into an astounding array of unique cereals, pancake and waffle mixes, machine and hand-made bread mixes, quick bread mixes, gluten-free mixes, and specialty grain products.
