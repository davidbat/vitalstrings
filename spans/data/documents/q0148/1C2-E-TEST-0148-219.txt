Healthy Carrot Broccoli and Quinoa Recipe
I made this up on the fly with random ingredients in my fridge and liked it so much, it went into my regular rotation since it fits with everything I want in weeknight meal: quick, easy and scrumptious. I usually make quinoa in big batches and keep it in the fridge so I always have it available for a fast meal. Buy the smallest potatoes you can find, they’ll cook faster and need less prepping.
Did you know: Potatoes are divided into two categories: waxy and starchy. Yukon gold’s and red are waxy potatoes and are best served in dishes where you want the potato to hold it’s shape such as in a potato salad. Your average baking potato (think Idaho) is a starch potato and tends to break down when cooked, so they’re good for soups or mashing.
Ingredients:
2 cups baby potatoes, the smallest you can find
1 head fresh broccoli
