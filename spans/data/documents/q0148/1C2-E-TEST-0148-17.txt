G. Weed Control:
Weed control in quinoa fields is difficult since plants grow slowly during the first         two weeks after emergence. In commercial fields of southern Colorado, pigweed, kochia,         lambsquarters, and sunflower have been the most common weeds. Wild mustard and sunflower         can be a problem since it is not possible to separate them from quinoa seed. There are no registered herbicides for quinoa             at this time. Preemergence herbicide trials have been conducted in field         and greenhouse locations in Colorado. Several herbicides were used safely on quinoa,         but were variable in weed control.
Competition from weeds is greater when quinoa is planted later in the growing season.         Kochia and lambsquarters numbers can be reduced when field irrigation is followed         by cultivation before seeding. Pigweed emerges too late in the growing season to         depend on cultivation for weed control. Early planting may be the most effective         means to control pigweed since the quinoa will have a good start in growth before         the pigweed emerges.
H. Diseases:
Disease and pest problems may arise after a crop like quinoa is introduced to a         new production area. Viruses found on spinach or beets have been observed in quinoa         fields. Many of these viruses are transmitted by aphids or leafhoppers. Several         of the viruses tested produce symptoms, yet research needs to be conducted to determine         if any cause significant damage. Diseases such as damping off (Sclerotium rolfsii), downy mildew (Peronospora farinosa), stalk rot (Phoma exigua var. foveata),         leaf spot (Ascochyta hyalospora), grey mold (Botrytis cinerea), and         bacterial blight (Pseudomonas sp.) have also caused significant losses in         South America, North America, and Great Britain.
I. Insects and Other Pests:
A wide variety of insect pests can damage quinoa during seed germination up through         harvest and seed storage in production areas of South America. Insect pests observed         in North America include flea beetles and a wide variety of caterpillars (insect         larvae). Flea beetles and aphids caused damage in quinoa trials conducted in Minnesota         (Robinson, 1986). The sugarbeet root aphid (Pemphigus populivenae) has significantly         reduced yields in isolated research fields of Colorado. Since this crop requires         little water, the soil will crack and allow aphids access to the roots. There are         no pesticides cleared for use on quinoa. The best control method for this aphid         is to irrigate fields when winged forms appear in leaf-petiole galls of cottonwoods         and poplars (overwintering habit) in early summer. The "quinoa plant bug" (Melanotrichus sp.) and the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) have also reduced yields in         some research fields. Bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium         that controls certain insect larvae, can be used to control the defoliating caterpillars.         Entomologists at Colorado State University, do not consider insect problems to be         a yield-limiting factor for quinoa production at this time.
Seed in the panicle is subject to feeding losses by birds. Quinoa, like some other         grains, evolved a chemical defense against the feeding activity of insects and animals         with the production of bitter saponins in the pericarp. However, saponins are easily         washed out by rain and may not totally prevent feeding losses.
J. Harvesting:
Plants have a sorghum-like seed head at maturity. Harvest usually begins when the         seed can barely be dented with a fingernail and plants have dried, turned a pale         yellow or red color, and leaves have dropped. The seed should thresh easily by hand         at this time. Field dry down is usually acceptable and plants are harvested easily         with a combine. A sorghum header attachment is recommended for quinoa, although         platform headers can usually be used as well, without a large crop loss. Cylinder         speed and air flow of combines are usually greatly reduced. Smaller screens are         used than with cereal grains due to the small size and lighter weight of quinoa         seed. A fanning mill and gravity separator is usually necessary to remove trash         from the seed after combining. Grain must be dry before storage. Quinoa stover contains         little fiber and subsequently provides little crop residue.
Rain during harvest will cause problems since mature seed will germinate within         24 hours after exposure to moisture.
K. Drying and Storage:
The seed must remain dry during storage. Prior to using quinoa in food processing,         the saponins in the pericarp are removed by soaking them in water or by mechanical         methods, such as with a rice polisher or a machine similar to those used to remove         wheat bran.
VI. Yield Potential and Performance Results:
Most quinoa used in North America is imported from South America. Research on developing         quinoa as a crop for North American agriculture is being conducted in Colorado.         The first commercial crop was produced in Colorado in 1987. Average yields were         about 1,000 lb/acre, produced on fields that ranged from 10 to 80 acres in size.         The variety CO407 has given consistent yields of 1,200 lb/acre in Colorado field         trials, while other lines have yielded from 1,421 to 1,739 lb/acre (Table 5). Yields         that exceed 1,800 lb/acre in research trials are possible with adequate stands,         fertility, moisture, and weed control. This crop has the potential to be produced         on 6,000 acres in Colorado at elevations above 7,000 ft (Robinson, 1986). Quinoa         planted by Robinson in Minnesota grew about two feet tall but did not flower and         produce seed, as high summer temperatures probably caused the plants to become dormant.         Quinoa lines grown in 1991 at Rosemont also did not set seed (Putnam, D.H., pers.         com.).
Quinoa should be considered a future crop for most North American farmers. This         crop is not recommended for growers except on an experimental basis in Minnesota         or Wisconsin at this time, since there are no varieties that will produce well under         the environmental conditions in these areas. Hot summer temperatures, precipitation         greater than 10 to 15 in. per year, and wet conditions during seed maturation, prevent         growing the available varieties in the Upper Midwest. Areas located in southern         Colorado and northern New Mexico at an elevation of 7,000 ft, northward from central         California along the Pacific Coast, the eastern side of the Cascade Mountains in         northern Washington, and locations in the Canadian Prairie provinces (especially         Saskatchewan) at 2,000 to 3,000 ft, may be the best production areas in the future.
VII. Economics of Production and Markets:
The current market for quinoa in North America is limited. A widespread effort is         necessary to educate people in the United States about what quinoa is and how to         cook it before the market will expand a great deal. Five farms in Colorado started         to grow quinoa as a commercial crop in 1987 after a processing facility was provided         by the Pillsbury Company to remove saponins from the pericarp. The North American         Quinoa Producers Association was organized in 1988 and a small processing plant         was started for the crop produced in Colorado. Costs of production for Colorado         growers decreased from $1.00/lb in 1984 to $0.35/lb in 1987 as they became more         familiar with the crop and obtained higher yields (Johnson, 1990). Prices to producers         have currently (1991) ranged from $.80/lb to over $1.00 lb.
In the United States this crop has been available in health food stores and more         recently (1988), in grocery stores of the western United States for prices that         range from $2.50 to $3.40/lb. The high nutritional quality, good flavor, and many         uses in food products, give quinoa a good potential market. The market for quinoa         has continued to grow in North America since 1984, yet the acreage planted has declined         since 1985 due to crop losses from adverse environmental conditions such as insect,         disease, and weed problems. Prospective growers from areas with suitable environmental         conditions should contact a marketing group about contracts for quinoa seed before         raising the crop. The quinoa market in 1987 for the United States was approximately         500,000 lbs.
The food industry is ready to make quinoa products due to the current market and         its good growth potential. These companies have a disincentive to make quinoa products         until the cultural problems have been reduced and yields have improved so there         is a larger, more reliable supply available to processors. Future varieties will         have a white pericarp (low or no saponin content), grow well at lower elevations,         and have better yield, plant height and form, seed size, and resistance to pest,         disease, and other environmental factors. A low saponin content would avoid some         processing costs, a larger seed would reduce the proportion of fibrous pericarp         in the grain, and a white pericarp would give a colorless, versatile product for         the food processing industry. However, the elimination of saponins in future varieties         may also increase feeding losses by birds and other pests.
