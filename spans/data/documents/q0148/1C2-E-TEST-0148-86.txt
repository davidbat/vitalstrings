Quinoa Cooking Tips and Recipe Ideas
Cooking quinoa is similar to cooking rice, but slightly faster at 15 minutes. In order to achieve better taste, it is best to wash the quinoa before cooking to get rid of the saponin, which gives it a bitter flavor. To cook it, you need one part quinoa, and one and three quarters parts liquid, which can be water, broth, or both. It is optional to add a bit of butter or salt to give it a little flavor.

It is also optional to lightly toast the quinoa, as it is sometimes done to rice, before cooking. Read more
