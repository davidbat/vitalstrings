Quinoa was released as a limited edition of 1000 copies. It was sent out as a special gift to members of the now defunct official TD International Fan Club, [2] and the remaining copies of were sold during their German tour in 1997. The CD featured one single composition "Quinoa" of 28 minutes.
The album was re-issued in 1998 on their new label TDI. [3] It was sold in unlimited quantity, and contained two bonus tracks. One of these tracks, "Voxel Ux", was originally composed for a competition on the band's official 1996 homepage. The winner received a CDR with the track, of which there is only one copy. "Lhasa" was described as the first movement in TD's "Tibetan Cycle", with 6 other tracks within the cycle that remained unreleased until 2000, when they were released as the album The Seven Letters From Tibet . "Lhasa" was extended and became the track "The Blue Pearl". [4]
In March 2009, Quinoa was re-issued again on Membran Music Ltd with new cover art as part of the band's extensive digipack series. [5]
