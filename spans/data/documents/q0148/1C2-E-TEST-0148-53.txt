Make a peanut butter version...just substitute 3/4  cup peanut butter instead of dried fruit and add a little more milk to batter...extra protein punch!!  Also, can reduce salt and no vanilla, so cuts down on ingredients too!

I reduced the water and added a banana.  Made them for my baby and he LOVED them!

I've made this recipe  three times already.  Today I made it vegan style with a few other adjustments: 1 banana instead of an egg, soy milk instead of whole milk,  I added 2 tbs honey to liquid mixture, and 1/2 tsp each of cardamom, nutmeg and cinnamon to dry mixture.  Delicious!

To Viollettt (sp?)  I found quinoa at Trader Joe's.  Hope there is one near you!

These muffins are great, and extremely easy to make, in addition to being high-protein. There were lots of good suggestions for different things to add to change the flavor slightly, and someone even posted a link to a calculator that figures out the calorie count for recipes. Great recipe, great posts!

These came out great! But I'm partial to brown sugar anyway. I used currents instead of raisins too. This recipe is another great way to incorporate quinoa into our diet.

I made these recently with whole wheat flour and added cinnamon. These muffins were very tasty, but I believe I overworked the batter which made the muffins come out too chewy.  I'll try adding dried cherries, dark chocolate and walnuts into another attempt at this recipe and not overwork the batter.  They are very satisfying and they kept me satiated for longer than regular muffins do.

I would just bake them all and afterwards freeze them.  This is what I do at my home too.  I usually make batches and have 1 for breakfast. The night before I just pop it in the fridge and your ready to go.!

Is it possible to refrigerate the batter and bake a few at a time?  How long would the batter last if I did this?  Do I need to add any liquid before making subsequent batches?  (I 'm alone so eating 12 is hard!)

My 11/2 yr. old LOVES my modified version. 3/4c. quinoa, 1/4c. flax. No oil:replace with applesauce. Bc ap. sauce is used only 1/2c. dark sugar. and no need for white flour. 1c. whole wheat flour, 1/2c. wheat germ, and 1/2c. wheat bran. I bake for 35-40 min. Results are fab.  I get requests!  Please experiment.

These are very simple tasting but good anyway.  I added freshly ground nutmeg and think I could have added more.  Raisins are okay but might try something else next time. Fluffy with a crunchy top.

My first time using quinoa in baking--and it IS GREAT! These muffins have great texture, but next time I will add fresh grated nutmeg or other spice to make them even better!

These are great! Since raisins are not very popular in my house, I made a few changes to the recipe.  MY KIDS LOVED THEM!!!!  I have a ten year old and fourteen year old and they could not get enough of these.  Nor could my husband.   I changed the cooking liquid to a mix of 60% apple juice and 40%water and substituted dried apples for the rasins.  To keep tabs on portion size I make them in the mini muffin pans.

Each time I make these muffins I bring a few into the office with me, and they have been a big hit every time - even with my co-workers who usually walk in with a breakfast from McDonald's! They are miracle muffins - healthy, tasty, and easy!

Try Whole Foods or any other natural market in your area.  Also try the Natural/Organic section of your supermarket. Ask the manager -- you may not be the only one looking, so they may bring it in.  Health food stores are another possible source.  If all else fails, try online.  It's worth it -- quinoa's great!

My son and I made these for a cub scout snack and 8 out of 10 kids liked them....I noticed when I got home that I had forgot to add the baking powder. My daughter also liked them. I did sub. milk chocolate chips for the raisins.

I went out and bought some Quinoa for the first time just to try this recipe and I loved it.  Great way to add some fiber to the diet as well.  The texture as the recipe above is written, is moist and delicious.  Tastes a bit like a bran muffin, but with the lovely nuttier taste of the quinoa itself.  I look forward to trying some of the variations mentioned below plus a few of my own.

I tried them with plain kefir instead of the milk, and whole wheat flour.  Moist and delicious!  I add chopped walnuts, and dried apricots, and almonds for more nutrition.

My 4- year old grandson is on a gluten-free, milk-free diet so I've tried diasterous recipes found online using rice, millet, bean flour. Quinoa is gluten-free and I've had great results-texture is great! Substituting rice milk has worked also.

This may sound crazy for a healthy recipe, but I used chocolate chips instead of raisins (I'm trying to get a three-year-old to eat more fibre). The warm cooked quinoa melted the dark chips and results were subtle, but delicious. Overall, this is a great recipe and a great way to get a little kid to eat quinoa.

I made these muffins for the first time and they were EXCELLENT!  I used a mix of dried berries and raisins instead of only raisins and also made a batch without any fruit for my mother since she doesn't like dried fruits.

Very good. I used half all purpose flour, half whole wheat.

I love these muffins!  My aunt made them and used dates instead of raisins.  She cannot make them fast enough!  What a great introduction to quinoa.  I just bought some and am excited to start cooking with this wonderful grain.

Baking rarely fits all those criteria at once. But one can alter this recipe a bit to suit those requirements: You'd want to replace the white flour with whole wheat flour for starters, then skip the sugar and use Splenda or even agave nectar (also low glycemic) Quinoa has a lot of protein to begin with, but if you lose the raisins and instead use nuts, you'll get more protein and good fats to keep you full through to lunch. Oh yes, and 2 egg whites, no yolk. I'm going to try it this way,

I added a 1/4 cup of chopped, dried cranberries and a teaspoon of orange zest. It makes for a nice melange of flavours, I would probably cut back on the sugar for the next batch. The dried fruit gives a nice sweetness.

The Muffins are excellent, though fairly sweet. The muffins do stick to the muffin papers, but it is not that bad.

I would be iffy about that, but if you do, omit the baking powder bc it's already in your flour. And muffin papers would probably stick to the actual muffin when you try to peel them off because these have such little fat.   good luck!!

Yes I would also like complete nutrition information on this recipe including grams of fiber, sugar and protein.  With this amount of sugar, it would need a lot of protein and fiber to make up for it and make it an acceptable glycemic load for breakfast.

Can self rising flower be used.  Can muffin papers be used?
