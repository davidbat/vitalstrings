Quinoa, lost                      crop of the Incas, finds new life
High in the Andes                      mountain range of Ecuador grows a grain that may hold both                      the past and the future of the indigenous farmers in its seed.

September 3, 2003: Nestled high in the Chimborazo                    province, where the Andes stretch to their greatest altitude,                    is Los Angeles de Colta, a farming village of 59 families. The                    hamlet is home to an indigenous (pre-Incan Puruhua) community                    moving swiftly into the future by following their past.
The people of Los Angeles, like most of those in the region,                      farm the land of their ancestors. Unlike most of the farmers,                      they are also growing the crops of their ancestors and tending                      to them in the ancient ways. Quinoa is the crop and organic                      is the way.
Quinoa (pronounced keen-w√°), a seed grain, has been                      cultivated in the Andean region for over 7,000 years and was                      considered sacred by the Inca Empire. The crop was relegated                      to status of animal feed by Spanish colonists, perhaps because                      of its religious significance and, later, shouldered almost                      completely out of production by cereals such as barley and                      wheat and other crops such as potatoes and corn.
But farmers' fortunes were few growing these "new" crops. The Andean highlands' cold, dry plateaus are perfect                      for quinoa, but challenging for many of the non-native crops.                      And a glut of product in the national market bottomed out                      already low prices.
In response to the poor yield from non-native crops, US pesticide                      and fertilizer manufacturers have led an aggressive campaign                      in the region with the support of the government and governmental                      agencies. Pesticide and fertilizer use in Ecuador has increased                      dramatically over the years leading to depleted soil and a                      rise in associated health problems. In fact, DDT, supplied                      by a US company, is still being used on Ecuador's agricultural                      land.
The Angels of Colta
Not long ago, the crops of Los Angeles were no different                      than those of the rest of the Ecuadorian agricultural industry.                      The famers' yields were low, their return was almost nonexistent,                      and their children were suffering from malnutrition.
"After just one year, those 12                          farmers increased their incomes to roughly 50% more than                          that of other area farmers. This year, 4025 families in                          four provinces of Ecuador are planting over 2800 acres                          to produce over 400 metric tons of organic heirloom quinoa                          for exportation and they're thriving."
In 1998, 12 Los Angeles de Colta families (298 families across                      Ecuador) agreed to cultivate quinoa in the traditional organic                      way for a group called the Heirloom Quinoa Project. The Project                      is the cooperative effort of four international organizations:                      The People's Educational Radio of Ecuador (ERPE), a progressive                      radio station dedicated to education and social service; Germany's                      Bio Control System (BCS), a global organic certification organization;                      the Canadian Development Fund, a fund for Ecuadorian development                      based in Canada; and Chicago's Inca Organics, the distributor                      and marketer of the finished product.
The goals of the project are to provide adequate income for                      indigenous farmers, teach organic gardening and promote traditional                      nutritional food products for both exportation and local consumption.                      And the farmers of Los Angeles de Colta are some of the pioneers                      in this bold effort.
After just one year, those 12 farmers increased their incomes                      to roughly 50% more than that of other area farmers. The very                      next year, 36 families agreed to raise heirloom quinoa and                      by 2000, 51 families were participating in the project. This                      year, 4025 families in four provinces of Ecuador are planting                      over 2800 acres to produce over 400 metric tons of organic                      heirloom quinoa for exportation and they're thriving.
Jose Balla, a Chimboarazan farmer remembers, "Before,                      my father and his father had lost the knowledge of growing                      quinoa and planted just a little for personal use. Today,                      two-thirds of my farm (three hectare) is dedicated to producing                      the grain for export."
Finding the "lost crop of the Incas"
It all begins in August and September of each year with organization                      meetings held at various villages throughout the southern                      sierra region of Ecuador. The farmers that attend receive                      pricing information and organic training from IncaFood S.A.                      (the Ecadorian export arm of Inca Organics) and ERPE.
Weeding                                women: Weeding is the first cooperative                                task of the growing season. A work group of the                                village farming families, called a minga, is formed                                to tackle the big jobs. The quinoa in this picture                                is about 1-1/2 months old. The field is at about                                10,000 feet high in the Andes.
The beginning of the wet season in October and November marks                      the start of the growing season for the Los Angeles farmers.                      No chemical fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides are allowed,                      but the farmers do employ some familiar organic techniques                      to boost yield, fertilize and fight weeds.
Compost is used, but only after it has passed through the                      large worm farms they maintain and is reduced to "bono".                      This version of castings is then applied as a very effective                      fertilizer. Yield has increased with its use from approximately                      1000 kilos per hectare to 1400 kilos per hectare.
The farmers rotate their quinoa crop with the Andean Lupin                      bean. The Lupin, called ChoCho by the indigenous people, is                      from the same family as the Italian Lupini bean and is used                      to fix nitrogen the quinoa has depleted from the soil. The                      beans provide a secondary income-generating crop and are also                      harvested and sold or eaten locally as an excellent source                      of protein. Also grown, sold abroad and eaten locally is an                      Andean heirloom variety of black amaranth.
At over 9,000 feet, the village experiences temperatures                      low enough for seven to nine months out of the year to make                      cover crops unnecessary. Unfortunately, weeds don't mind the                      altitude. The families form community working groups, called                      mingas, to weed and harvest crops more efficiently. The mingas                      start weeding the fields about one month after the quinoa                      has sprouted.
Harvesting quinoa follows the same pattern as field preparation                      and weeding during the six to nine month growing season. Mingas                      are formed to manually separate the grain onto white canvas.                      The grain is then taken to a post-harvest facility for inspection                      and cleaning.
Rock and roll: Harvesting also requires a cooperative                                power of a minga, or working group. Here they are                                using a centuries-old harvesting technique, rolling                                the quinoa against a rock to knock the seeds onto                                a tarp laid out underneath.
Since all crops available for the international market are                      grown organically, they must also be certified for export                      as such. Technicians are recruited from within the villages                      and trained by BCS for organic certification and by ERPE for                      organic farming techniques. These technicians are then employed                      by ERPE to give technical aid to the farmers, certify their                      fields organic and inspect the quinoa before it goes onto                      the post harvest facility for cleaning and packaging.
The post harvest facility, located at 10,000 feet, also employs                      area villagers, adding more Ecuadorians, in addition to the                      farmers, who can enjoy a secure job in a country that has                      an unemployment rate of over 10%. The facility was built in                      1998 as another international cooperative effort. The Canadian                      Development Fund provided money for the creation of the building,                      Inca Organics funded additional warehouse space and quality                      control equipment and DED, a German development organization,                      designed and built specialized cleaning equipment.
Just                                the right size: A sorting machine separates                                the quinoa into small, medium and large sizes before                                washing.
Most quinoa is mechanically polished rather than washed which                      removes valuable nutrients in the process. Polished quinoa                      also retains a powdery residue that must be rinsed off before                      cooking. Heirloom Qunioa Project quinoa goes through a much                      more simplified and straight-forward washing rather than polishing                      to preserve the dietary fiber found in the germ layer. The                      washing is more labor intensive, providing more jobs for local                      families. And, no additional rinsing by the consumer is required.
The grain is divided into large, medium, and small sizes                      by vibrating screens and dumped into separate washing tanks.                      First, the quinoa is given a hot water wash to remove saponine,                      a naturally-occurring, soapy-tasting coating. Then cold water                      is pumped in, separating any foreign material from the grain.
The quinoa is centrifuged to remove most of the water from                      the washing process and moved by conveyor belt to a final                      drying bed. Hot air is blown through the grain to reduce the                      moisture content to less than 3%. Finally, the quinoa is re-inspected,                      packed and stored or loaded for shipment.
Growing more than just quinoa
A newfound spirit of cooperation and industry isn't the only                      change seen in the village of Los Angeles de Colta. This year,                      almost all the families are growing organic quinoa and the                      villages reflect their success.
New homes of cement block are replacing the traditional chozas                      (a windowless dwelling made of mud blocks with thatched roofs).                      The average farmers' income has increased by an astonishing                      50%--a rarity in Ecuador where dollarization of the economy                      and high inflation are causing economic crisis. Juan Perex,                      director of ERPE notes, "The typical farmers' income                      has steadily increased from $230 per year in 1996, just before                      the quinoa project started, to $450 per year today."
"Whatever quinoa's global destiny,                          this ancient seed has changed the way the world sees these                          Ecuadorian farmers and the way they see themselves."
Malnutrition is but a ghost in the Heirloom Quinoa villages.                      While two-thirds of the quinoa is exported, one-third is used                      by the villagers to improve their diets. The supergrain is                      high in protein, low in carbohydrates, easy to digest, and                      an excellent source of dietary fiber, phosphorus, iron, vitamins                      B6 and E, magnesium and zinc. The families are now relearning                      to prepare their traditional quinoa dishes and repair the                      damage done by fast food.
"When we started out in 1997, one could hardly find                      quinoa growing in the area. Now it's easily seen as you drive                      through the provinces," said Marjorie Leventry, Vice                      President of Inca Organics.
The premium quinoa produced by the Ecuadorian farmers in                      the Heirloom Quinoa Project is recognized by world-renowned                      chefs, such as Charlie Trotter, and international organizations,                      such as the Slow Food Movement, for its superior flavor and                      cleanliness. And the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation)                      considers quinoa "one of the crops destined to offer                      food security in the next century."
Whatever quinoa's global destiny, this ancient seed has changed                      the way the world sees these Ecuadorian farmers and the way                      they see themselves. The Heirloom Quinoa members discovered                      most projects initially underestimated the abilities of the                      farmers. They didn't need instructions on how to farm. What                      they needed were markets for their products. Markets that                      are fair trade and can sustain the production.
Ruben Vinoil, a farmer and village leader expressed it best, "The life of the soil is also our life. We use organic                      means to improve the life of the soil and it has certainly                      improved our life."
