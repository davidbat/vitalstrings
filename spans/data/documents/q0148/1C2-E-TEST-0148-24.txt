Quinoa contains the amino acid lysine which helps the body produce protein. It also helps the body process the protein in the quinoa and in other foods. The World Health Organization has rated the quality of protein in quinoa to be equivalent or superior to that found in milk products.

Lightning kills and injures more people than tornadoes and hurricanes combined...
Most are struck under blue skies... long before they even hear thunder or think the storm is dangerous or after they think it has passed by. The only way to be safe in a lightning storm is to take shelter in a safe building or vehicle and avoid certain activities that put you at risk. The only way to get to safe shelter... and avoid dangerous activities even if you're in a safe building... is to know the danger exists in the first place. And you need to know about it early enough to call the kids in from the backyard... tell your husband to stop cutting the grass and get inside... or to just give you time to get to safe shelter no matter what you're doing. If you enjoy outdoor spring and summer activities or have kids playing outdoor sports you really owe to yourself to find out how to keep you and your family safer.
