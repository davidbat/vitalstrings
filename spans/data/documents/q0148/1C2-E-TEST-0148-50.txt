About Quinoa
Quinoa is an annual herb that has been         cultivated for thousands of years in the west Andes Mountains of South America.         It was a staple food of the ancient Inca Indians and their Empire. Quinoa was         such an important food of the ancient Incas that they considered it the "Mother Grain."
Quinoa is a plant that is very hardy and         drought resistant. It bears clusters of seed on top of the plant that can range         in color from white, orange, red, purple, to black, depending on the variety.         The ancestral seed color of Quinoa is black and the other colors have been         obtained from mutations and breeding. The Quinoa seed, about the size of         millet, resembles the grain of some cereal grasses, but it is not a grass.
The seeds are coated with a saponin which has         a bitter taste. This bitterness is removed by washing in water or by a dry         polishing process. Before consumption of Quinoa the seeds should be rinsed to         remove any of the saponin dust that may remain on the seeds.
The seed of Quinoa is an excellent food, rich         in protein and high in fiber. The protein is well balanced and is particularly         rich in the amino acid lysine, which is difficult to obtain from other         vegetable sources. It is also high in calcium, phosphorous, vitamins B and E.
Quinoa is a very versatile food plant that         can be cooked many ways and tastes excellent. The green leaves can be used in         salads or cooked like spinach. The grain can be sprouted, like alfalfa; used as         a hot cereal; used in soups, casseroles and souffles; used in the place of         almost any other grain, including rice; ground into flour; and toasted. An         imaginative chef can find many more uses and ways to prepare Quinoa than those         given above. Dishes ranging from appetizers through desserts can be prepared         from Quinoa.
In 1982 Dave Cusack was one of the first to         introduce Quinoa to North America. With the help of Colorado State University,         Sierra Blanca Associates, and a few hard working individuals Quinoa is now         available to the public at most health food stores. Certified Organic Quinoa         that is grown in the high elevations of the San Luis Valley of Colorado, has a         rich delicate nutty taste that cooks quickly and easily.
Instructions: Before cooking, always rinse the grain well, either by using a strainer or by running fresh water over the Quinoa in a pot. Drain the excess water.
QUINOA (Basic Recipe)
2 cups water
1 cup Quinoa
Rinse Quinoa thoroughly, either by         using a strainer or by running fresh water over the Quinoa in a pot. Drain         excess water. Place Quinoa and water in a 1 ½ quart sauce pan and bring to a         boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until all of the water is absorbed         (about 15 minutes). You will know that the Quinoa is done when all the grains         have turned from white to transparent, and the spiral-like germ has separated.         Makes 3 cups.
