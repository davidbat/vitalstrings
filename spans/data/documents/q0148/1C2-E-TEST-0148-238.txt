Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa) is a species of goosefoot that originated in the Andean region of South America, where it has been an important food for 6,000 years. This wonder plant, along with corn and potatoes is a major food staple for the cultures developed in the Andes. The Incas considered Quinoa sacred, referring to it as “chisaya mama” or “mother of all grains”.
Quinoa is well suited as a flour or whole grain, both of which are a great source of protein and amino acids, as well as other vitamins and minerals.                                              Quinoa has a light, fluffy texture when cooked. This mild, slightly nutty tasting grain can be prepared as a side dish, such as rice, used in combination with other ingredients and served as a salad or main dish, or added to soups. Quinoa flour is                        used for making breads, biscuits, cookies, crepes, muffins, pancakes, tortillas, and even beer
