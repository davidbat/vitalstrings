Quinoa is a seed plant common to the Andes of South America. Because it is not a grass, quinoa is not technically a cereal grain. For nutritional purposes, however, quinoa is considered a “ whole grain ” and is a fantastic alternative to rice.
Quinoa is rich in dietary fiber, phosphorous, magnesium and iron. But what makes quinoa stand out nutritionally is its protein content. Unlike most grains, quinoa contains a high percentage of the amino acid lysine, making it a complete protein.
A complete protein is a food that contains all essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein.
If you are vegetarian, acquiring all the necessary amino acids from your diet is more difficult than if you eat meat occasionally, because plant proteins are usually deficient in one amino acid or another. For grains, the missing molecule is usually lysine. Quinoa’s high lysine content makes it a nutritional powerhouse for a grain, whether you are vegetarian or not.
Quinoa can be found at many grocery stores (e.g. Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s) and frequently comes in a box. At some stores (e.g. Whole Foods) it can also be found in bulk.
Quinoa is much faster to prepare than other whole grains. As the New York Times recommends , I like to prepare it the same way I make rice . But it needs to be monitored more carefully, since it cooks much quicker. 10 minutes boiling should be sufficient.
I have not been able to find the red quinoa shown in the article. Let me know if you find it!
