Quinoa salad
what is it?
Known as the "mother grain" of the Incan empire, quinoa (pronounced "keen-wah"), is a small, flat seed. It's a staple for millions in South America and is available in a gorgeous array of colors, from golden-tan to brick-red. It's an excellent source of protein (in fact, it has more protein than any other whole grain) and fiber, as well as iron, zinc, potassium, calcium, and vitamin E.
But how does it taste? It's a mild, slightly sweet grain with hints of corn, nuts, and grass. But what makes quinoa really interesting is its soft-but-crunchy texture. When cooked, the germ falls away and retains an ever-so-slight crunch, while the seed itself becomes tender and light.
In recent years, quinoa has also become a Passover staple for many observant Jews. Since it is not truly a grain, it is generally considered kosher for Passover , as long as it is processed in a facility that does not also process other forbidden grains.
don't have it?
Substitute bulgur wheat or couscous, though they don't have the same texture.
how to choose:
Look for quinoa in natural-foods stores or well-stocked supermarkets. It's a staple at stores with bulk bins.
how to prep:
First, rinse it well. This is an important step to rid the quinoa of its coating of saponin, a bitter, soapy-tasting natural substance that protects the plants from insects. Most quinoa is processed to remove much of the saponin, so submersion and a good swish in a bowl of cool water is all it takes to finish the process. If the water appears very cloudy, keep rinsing in fresh water until the cloudiness is almost gone.
Cook quinoa as you would rice: use a 2:1 liquid-to-grain ratio. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed. Quinoa cooks in about 10 to 15 minutes, making it the fastest cooking grain out there. Fluff the quinoa well with a fork before serving.
