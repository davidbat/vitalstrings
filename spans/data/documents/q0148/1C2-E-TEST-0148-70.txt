Chicken and Quinoa Salad
Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes ------------------------------ Found this from an old magazine Harrowsmith without permission.  1 c quinoa      1 tsp butter     8 sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed),diced 2 shallots, minced 1 clove garlic,minced 2c water pinch of cayenne pepper , 2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley , salt & freshly ground black pepper  Place quinoa in a fine-meshed sieve and rinse under warm running water for 1 min. Set aside.  Heat butter in a heavy, med. saucepan over med. heat. Add tomatoes, shallots and garlic and saute for 3-5 mins, or till shallots are softened. Add stock or water and bring to a boil. Stir quinoa and cayenne, return to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 30 mins, or until liquid is absorbed. Let sit for 5 mins, and fluff grains with a fork to separate. Stir in fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serves: 4  (This ancient Peruvian grain has a nutty, almost sweet flavour that really needs no accent but is excellent with tomatoes and shallots.)

Quinoa Recipe ------------- Newsgroups: rec.food.veg.cooking  Elliot Burch asked on 17 Jan 1996:  I have not been able to come up with good uses for this nice grain (which I have heard isn't a grain but a relative of spinach) in meals that don't already have a grain, in which I end up replacing them and being disappointed in the Quinoa. Does anyone have authentic recipes that do not use Quinoa for a replacement rice, couscous, or millet. I would greatly appreciate any. thanks  Stan Goodman posted on 17 Jan 1996:  It's a relative of New Zealand Spinach...which isn't spinach at all. Confused?  But you can use it just as you would use any grain porridge, depending on your culinary style.  Sara at uchicago.edu posted on 18 Jan 1996:  Try cooking it with new potatoes cut into match sticks, corn, and either fennel or cumin seed (I used cumin). I can't remember off the top of my head where this recipe came from, but I remember trying it and enjoying it. It was while eating this, in fact, that my roommate pointed out the resemblance of cooked quinoa to a bowl full of teeny, tiny condoms.  Sandy Meyerhoff of bcpl.lib.md posted on 19 Jan 1996:  I've been using quinoa for awhile now and love it. One tip, make sure you rinse it before cooking, it has a bitter coating and can taste weird if you just cook it. You can also toast it in a hot pan, no oil, for a few minutes to deepen the flavor a bit. I've mostly substituted it for other grains but here's one that's a variation I found in a Mediterranean cookbook: Steam any vegetable till done. Blend honey and mustard to taste and add veggies and sauce to cooked quinoa. Roasted peppers in tomato sauce also tastes nice.
Quinotto -------- Well, it turns out that, after several tries, we have found a classic italian dish, risotto, to be better or much better with whole grains. That is better than the original. Both of us being from Northern italy, we feel like we are qualified to judge. We also found - believe it or not - that the veg superfood, nutritional yeast, is sublime on risotto and variations thereof.  The reason why whole grains are better is that they take the cooking, take the flavor, but stay neatly separated and crunchy. Risotto should be made with poorest quality rice, which is poor in starch and does not make glue over the 40 mins. cooking.  The best for flavor are quinoa and brown rice, however the least time consuming are quinoa and millet. Hence the name quinotto. If you have some time at your hands, brownotto is really my favorite (brown rice). If you really have a long lonng time, try kamotto (kamut). Recipe follows.  1 cup/person of grains 2.5 cups/person vegetable stock some oil or margarine at your discretion 1 onion 1 tbsp./person nutritional yeast 1 glass of wine (optional) veg. of choice (list follows) parsley (optional) salt-pepper as needed  Wash grains. Optional: toast grains in a skillet until they start popping or browning. This gives a rich, nutty flavor to the dish. Toast after washing.  Mince onion. Put oil in heavy pot, saute' onion until golden. Add veg. of choice. Use low heat throughout.  Veg. of choice: the best is traditionally mushrooms, however, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, radicchio are fine choices. If you use asparagus, save half the tips for the last 3 mins, for the rest will melt away. Mushroom should be cut in 0.4X0.4X0.8 inches pieces. Same for the others.  Saute' veg till limp. Add grains, and keep turning, till all juices, oil have been absorbed. Start a pot nearby with the stock. Add a glass of wine if desired. Keep turning till absorbed. When liquid is low, add a ladle of by-now hot stock. Keep turning for 20 mins (quinoa), 30 mins (millet), 50 mins (brown rice), until cooked. The two important things are: always add hot stock, and only add it when all of the previous stuff has been absorbed. You will have to stir often or it will stick to the bottom. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast and minced parsley (optional), mix, serve hot.  Posted by Judy Karpen to rec.food.veg.cooking on 19 Jan 1996.
Peruvian Quinoa with Vegetables ------------------------------- Here is a recipe that originally appeared in the March/April 1995 issue of Natural Health Magazine .  3 cups cooked quinoa (can be cooked in water, broth, orange or apple juice; I used broth.) 2 tbl olive oil 1 1\2 inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced 1 small carrot, peeled and diced 1 rib celery, diced 1\2 red bell pepper, seeded and finely diced 1\2 green bell pepper, ditto 1\2 corn kernels, fresh or frozen 2 scallions, white part only, finely sliced Salt and ground black pepper 1\4 c. fresh Italian parsley, chopped or 1 tbl fresh thyme leaves  In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil with ginger. When oil is hot and ginger smells aromatic (about 2 minutes) but has not yet colored, add carrot and saute 1 minute. Stir in celery, then add red and green peppers, corn and scallions. Saute just long enough for veggies to heat through. Stir in hot quinoa. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in parsley or thyme leaves and serve immediately.

Summer Salad with Quinoa ------------------------ Here is a recipe for vegetable kebabs with quinoa which we have tried a couple of times and really enjoy. It is from Vegetables on the Grill by Kelly McCune (Harper Perennial, 1992) as reprinted in the Baltimore Sun. Although intended to be a summer dish, it also makes a great antidote to the midwinter doldrums. Serves 6.  1/2 package of fresh spinach (about 5 oz.) 1 bunch curly endive 1 c. uncooked quinoa 2 c. water 1/4 tsp. salt (optional) vegetables/fruit for kebabs:   selection of yellow and green squash   carrots   bell peppers   new potatoes   Belgian endive   pineapple lemon-mustard vinaigrette (recipe below) avocado for garnish cherry tomatoes for garnish  Prepare vinaigrette and set aside. Wash and/or soak spinach as necessary to remove grit, and pull off stems. Wash curly endive. Pat or spin dry both spinach and endive. Tear into pieces and set aside in refrigerator.  Rinse the quinoa thoroughly in a sieve under cold running water, tossing a few times to make sure all the grains are rinsed. Bring the water to a boil, add salt if desired and stir in rinsed quinoa. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. The grain, when cooked, should not be mushy, and the tiny spiral of the germ will be visible. Fluff the grain with a fork and set aside to cool.  Wash and slice the vegetables and fruit (except the avocado and cherry tomatoes) into bite-sized chunks and skewer. Use some of the vinaigrette as a light baste. Grill the vegetable skewers (on barbecue or in oven) until browned and tender, approximately 15 minutes for everything.  Toss the quinoa, spinach and curly endive together with just enough vinaigrette to moisten the leaves lightly. Toss again with the grilled vegetables and serve immediately, garnished with chunks of avocado and cherry tomatoes.  Lemon-Mustard Vinaigrette ------------------------- grated zest of 1 lemon 2 tbsp. lemon juice 2 tsp. Dijon-style mustard 1/4 c. olive oil salt and black pepper to taste  Combine the zest, lemon juice and mustard in a bowl. Whisk in the olive oil until emulsified. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Posted by John D. Klemm to rec.food.veg.cooking on 20 Jan 1996.

Herbed Quinoa ------------- Yield: 4 servings    1 c  Quinoa; thoroughly rinsed   2 c  Water   1 ts Salt 1/4 c  Olive oil   1 md Garlic clove; peel and mince        Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 c  Fresh basil, packed* or 1/4 c  Fresh tarragon plus   2 tb Fresh thyme  *If the listed herbs are unavailable, substitute an equal amount of parsley, or 1 ts. dried thyme, basil or oregano.  Put quinoa, water and salt in a medium-size saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover partially so the steam can escape, and cook at a slow boil until grains have doubled in size, become translucent, and are cracked open so that the spiral germ of the grain is visible, about 12 minutes. If necessary, continue cooking, uncovered, until all the liquid has been absorbed or has evaporated, which may take 1 more minute.  While quinoa is cooking, combine olive oil, garlic and a generous amount of pepper in a warmed medium-size bowl. Just before the quinoa is cooked, coarsely but neatly chop basil leaves and mix them into the olive oil mixture. When quinoa is ready, add it to the olive oil, tossing until it is thoroughly combined. Check seasonings and serve immediately.  Nice accompaniment to steamed fish or to roasted meats or poultry. Or serve as a main course along with a variety of vegetables and salads.  From Farm House Cookbook by Susan Herrmann Loomis. New York: Workman Publishing Company, Inc., 1991.  Pg. 241.

Remove 2 c. liquid from the pot and set aside in a 2-qt. pot. Place onions, carrots and turnips on top of the chickpeas and add enough water or stock to just cover vegetables. Add salt, garlic, bay, cumin, pepper and olive oil. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce to light boil and cook for 40 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts and cook an additional 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning.  While vegetables and chickpeas continue to cook, add 2 c. water and salt to the stock in the 2-qt. pot and bring to a boil. Heat a thin pan, add oil and, while stirring continuously, toast quinoa for 10 minutes. Add to boiling stock, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Gently mix from top to bottom with a damp wooden spoon. Cover pot and allow to rest for another 5 to 10 minutes.  Serve by placing a large mound of quinoa on each individual plate. Flatten the mound in the center and fill with vegetables and chickpeas. Pour 1/2 cup of hot stock over all and serve hot. Yield:  4 servings.
