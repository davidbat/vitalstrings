I'm so sick of reading reviews about a recipe when they don't follow recipe. What's the point? They'll give something 4 stars and then say "This was delicious! I omitted the parsley and mint, and I didn't put in the raisins, I omitted the regular onion, and used a whole lemon instead of 1 tablespoon." Isn't it a different recipe at that point? It would be nice to read reviews by those who followed the recipe. Isn't the whole point to rate the recipe?

I've never made quinoa before.  this recipe was awesome!  I can't stop eating it!  I didn't put in the raisins and used red onion instead of regular onion, but otherwise I followed it.  Worked out great!

This went very well with the lemon bay shrimp kebabs.  I prepared this dish and placed the kebabs over it for a great summer dinner outside!

Loved this!  My changes to it: I used both mint AND parsley.  I omitted the regular opnions (but kept the green ones). I put in more tomoato and cucumber than called for. I also used the juice of a whole lemon, which is more than what is called for.  I made it the night before a dinner party and chilled it. But my secret ingredient - I de-seeded a pomegranate the night before and stored the seeds in a separate bowl (covered). Before I served it I mixed in the pomegranate seeds and it was great!  It added some nice sweet/tartness/crunch to the salad. I waited till the last minute to mix in the seeds so that they wouldn't stain the quinoa overnight and make the salad look pink.
