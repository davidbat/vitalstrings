Welcome to our database of hometown quinoa pages designed to help you find quinoa in your local stores.
Quinoa (KEEN-wah), the South American seed that packs a nutritional punch, has been a staple food of the Andean people for at least five centuries, but has only recently come to worldwide attention.
High in protein, fiber, and many essential minerals, quinoa also boasts a balanced profile of all necessary amino acids. Vegans and vegetarians appreciate the protein boost; celiacs and others with gluten sensitivity choose quinoa because it is naturally gluten free.
It’s no surprise that so many are jumping on the quinoa bandwagon.
