1 medium sweet red pepper, chopped
1 small carrot, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh broccoli
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon pepper
Directions
In a small nonstick saucepan coated with cooking spray, toast quinoa over medium heat until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 12-15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, saute onion in oil for 2 minutes. Add the red pepper, carrot, broccoli and garlic; saute 3 minutes longer. Add basil and pepper; cook and stir just until vegetables are tender. Stir in quinoa; heat through. Yield: 4 servings.
Editor's Note: Look for quinoa in the cereal, rice or organic food aisle.
