Joden, you can find nonfat greek yogurt at Fresh Market, or Whole Foods if you have one close to home.

I  used my own homemade guacamole instead on the greek yogurt, and used whole wheat pita. Still absoloutely delicious, but with less calories!!

This recipe was delicious! I made smaller patties and served with hummus to add another sauce. Had it for lunch and my husband ate it all up!

This was an excellent sandwich.  Calories figure out to be329 when divided into 4 patties.  Too big! 220 calories when divided by 6.  I wish all recipes had nutritional info also. Pita buns were my choice, easier to eat the burger.  This added 100 calories.  MmMm good!

Depending on what brands you use, this could be as much as 753 calories per serving, according to the recipe analyzer on CalorieCount.about.com. I'm sure it's delicious, but that's a lot for something you guys are putting in a Natural Living and essentially "health" magazine.

For my family's first dinner with quinoa, these burgers went over pretty well. I used cannellini beans, which worked fine. I had no trouble forming the patties as described in the recipe. The yogurt sauce was tasty (got the Greek variety at Trader Joe's), and with the whole wheat pitas, it was a dinner I felt good serving.

What is the nutritional value? Thanks.

I hadn't heard of great northern beans, so added kidney beans instead. The burgers were delicious....... also added the quinoa after blitzing.

To veganize this recipe replace the egg with 1 tbsp flax powder 3 tbsps water, sub nutrional yeast for the parmesan. Use soy yogurt of tofu for the sauce/dip

This is a great recipe! My family loved it!  I added quinoa after I put it through the food processor, added more bread crumbs and refrigerated before making into patties and they stayed together perfectly!

I had trouble getting the burger to stick together, but  it was just as good as a "filling."

I love these! They are so delicious! A regular healthy favorite at our house. The burgers never quite stick together as burgers, so I just cook the mixture in the skillet and fill the pitas. I use a fluffier pita that is sealed and bake them until they are a little crispy then I put the quinoa mixture on top and eat it like a gyro rolled in flatbread. Yummy, yummy!

A coffee filter works better than a paper towel.

I found it better to finely shred the carrot using my food processor. These are really good patties!

you can drain regular yogurt in a paper towel lined collander suspended above a bowl (to catch the liquid that drains) and it will give you the equivalent texture of greek yogurt.....it's also a good way to make a ranch salad dressing without all the fatty mayo...

I didn't make this recipe because I am not really crazy for the quiona.  So I grilled some turkey cutlets on my stovetop grill (no added oil) and placed them into the wheat pita bread.  My store didn't carry greek yogurt either so I picked up some plain non-fat yogurt and added the rest of the ingredients.  My family like them.

lcosen5: did you add the olive oil to the quinoa mix?  I am puzzled why they were runny.  I did not add oil to anything but the pan to cook them (2TBSP) and they definitely needed to cook for 8-10 min, even though I made mine smaller.  They really sucked up the oil.

I thought these were delicious! My husband liked it too. I ate it a day late because they took me too long to make and they were too runny so I refrigerated them overnight. They were still mushy the next day and fell apart in the pan but they still tasted good. The recipe didn't say how much oil to use in the pan to cook them.

I just made them with 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs instead of the suggested breadcrumbs; sooo tasty!  We also made them into small patties, about 2-2.5 inches wide.  We are saving this recipe.  Now I can have them on my salad tomorrow for lunch during the challenge.

The burgers were delicious, but came out a bit too moist and kept falling apart.  Next time, I'll try 1/2 cup of breadcrumb instead and make sure not to blend the ingredients too much.  That should help.

I couldn't find any quinoa and found that cous-cous can be substituted, so I used that...I really didn't like it all, and it was awful with the yogurt. Maybe I should try to find quinoa from a health food store, and that would be better? I don't think I'll try to make this again though.

there are greek yogurts that are sold in regular supermarkets .. oikos and fage are 2 .. but trader joe's is by far tastier and cheaper than the others . it comes in fat free and is full of protein .  love the recipes but wish the nutrional value was listed for each .

Joden...
If you can find "Liberty Mediterranean Plain Yogurt", it may be full-fat, but for the small amount you'll be using on a burger, it is absolutely fabulous...the best yogurt I've ever tasted and well worth the calories.

Doesn't anyone proof-read the recipes before adding them to the website?
This recipe needs editing...
