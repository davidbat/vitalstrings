Quinoa ( Spanish : quinua, from Quechua : kinwa), a species of goosefoot (Chenopodium), is a grain -like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. It is a pseudocereal rather than a true cereal , or grain, as it is not a member of the grass family . As a chenopod , quinoa is closely related to species such as beets , spinach , and tumbleweeds . Its leaves are also eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth , but the commercial availability of quinoa greens is currently limited.
