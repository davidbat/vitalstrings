Pronounced keen-wah, this grain comes from the Andes Mountains in South America where it was once a staple food for the Incas.
Quinoa has a delicious light, nutty flavor. When it cooks, the grain opens up to make tiny spirals.  Quinoa contains all eight amino acids and therefore has better protein value than most grains. A nutrient-dense grain; perfect for those who have elevated needs, such as pregnant or nursing mothers.
Here are some tips and tricks on how to cook this nutritious grain:
Pinch of sea salt
1 3/4 cups water
Rinse quinoa well with warm water and drain. Quinoa has a natural coating called saponin that repels insects and birds and can create a bitter taste.  Rinsing with warm water removes the saponin.  Place rinsed quinoa, salt, and water in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer 15-20 minutes, until all the water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork before serving.
Preparation time: 20-25 minutes
