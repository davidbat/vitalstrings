Independent productions [link]
His first album, titled No Mercy , was produced in 1995 when Ayala was eighteen years old. [2] The production did not sell well, and he continued his work within the genre for the rest of the decade, eventually forming a duo with Nicky Jam . One of the duo's songs, "Posición", was included in the soundtrack of One Tough Cop, a movie directed by Bruno Barreto , that was released in 1998. Beginning in 2000, Ayala began concentrating more on his solo career, releasing albums produced outside studios. The first production he released was titled El Cartel, featuring elements of the mixtape style. [2] In 2001 El Cartel II was released, a direct sequel to the previous production, and influenced by similar genres.
In 2005 El Cangri.com was released, and became the first album in Ayala's career to sell well outside Puerto Rico, mostly in the United States. [2] The album was produced by VI Music, an independent recording studio in Puerto Rico, and was not supported by a major label. [2] The most successful single from the album was "Latigazo", which received significant play on radio stations in New York and Miami . [2] The album reached #43 on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. [2] Following the release of this disc, Ayala performed at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum before 12,000 fans. [3] The following year VI Music produced Los Homerun-es. [2] The album became the leader in sales in Puerto Rico during a year in which several other reggaeton artists released significant productions, including Luny Tune's Mas Flow, Don Omar's The Last Don, and Tego Calderón's El Abayarde. [2] The album's success helped Ayala receive the publicity required for a crossover to the United States market, and marked the last album he released with VI music before signing a contract with Universal
2004–2005 [link]
Ayala's next album, Barrio Fino , was produced by Luny Tunes and released in July 2004 by El Cartel Records and VI Music . It was the most highly anticipated album in the reggaeton community. [4] Ayala had enjoyed Salsa music since he was young, and this led him to include music of genres besides reggaeton in the album. [4] The most prominent of these cross-genre singles was "Melao", in which he performed with Andy Montañez . [4] The album was described as his most complete, and with it he intended to introduce combinations of reggaeton and other genres to the English-speaking market. [4] Barrio Fino was followed up by an international tour with performances in numerous countries including the Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Mexico , Panama , Peru , Honduras , Spain , Colombia , Argentina , Venezuela , and the United States. [4] The album has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and has sold well throughout Latin America and worldwide. [5]
In 2005 Ayala won several international awards, making him one of the most recognized reggaeton artists within the music industry. [6] The first award of the year was Lo Nuestro Awards within the "Latin music" category, which he received for Barrio Fino. [6] In this event he performed " Gasolina " in a performance that was described as "innovative". [6] Barrio Fino also won the "Reggaeton Album of the Year" award in the Latin Billboard that took place on April 28, 2005, [6] where he performed a mix of three of his songs in a duo with P. Diddy . The album was promoted throughout Latin America , the United States, and Europe, reaching certified gold in Japan. Due to the album's success, Ayala received promotional contracts with radio stations and soda companies, including Pepsi . [7] His single "Gasolina" received the majority of votes cast for the second edition of Premios Juventud, in which it received eight nominations and won seven awards. [6] Ayala also made a live presentation during the award ceremony. "Gasolina" received nominations in the Latin Grammy and MTV Video Music Awards. [6]
The successful single, "Gasolina", was covered by artists from different music genres. This led to a controversy when Los Lagos, a Mexican banda group, did a cover with the original beat but changed the song's lyrics. [8] The group's label had solicited the copyright permission to perform the single and translate it to a different music style, but did not receive consent to change the lyrics; legal action followed. [8] Speaking for the artist, Ayala's lawyer stated that having his songs covered was an "honor, but it must be done the right way." [8]

On April 30, 2006, Ayala was named one of the 100 most influential people by Time magazine , which cited the 2 million copies of Barrio Fino sold, Ayala's $20 million contract with Interscope Records , and his Pepsi endorsement. [9] During this period, Ayala and William Omar Landrón (more commonly known by his artistic name Don Omar ) were involved in a rivalry within the genre, dubbed "tiraera". The rivalry received significant press coverage despite being denied early on by both artists. It originated with a lyrical conflict between the artists begun by Ayala's comments in a remix single, where he criticized Landron's common usage of the nickname "King of Kings". [10] Don Omar responded to this in a song titled "Ahora Son Mejor", part of his album Los Rompediscotecas. [10]
