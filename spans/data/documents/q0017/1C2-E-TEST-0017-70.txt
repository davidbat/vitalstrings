BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Colombian salsa singer Joe Arroyo has died at age 55 after a monthlong hospitalization.
Arroyo's manager Luis Ojeda says the singer died early Tuesday in Barranquilla, where he was being treated for hypertension and fluid in his lungs.
Arroyo composed some 200 songs, including the hits "La Rebelion" and "Tumbatecho" and he had performed with singers including Celia Cruz and Shakira.
He first appeared in the 1970s with the orchestra "Fruko y sus Tesos," and he formed his own band in Medellin in 1981 called "La Verdad."
His full name was Alvaro Jose Arroyo. Ojeda says the singer was to receive a career achievement Grammy in November.
Ojeda says Arroyo is survived by his wife Jacqueline Ramos and eight children.
