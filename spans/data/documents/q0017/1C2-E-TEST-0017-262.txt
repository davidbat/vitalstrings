Johnson, the Arroyo Seco golf course opened in 1955. Comfortable, accessible and imminently relaxing, Arroyo Seco is consistently ranked one of the top par-3 courses in the Southern California. Narrow fairways lined with magnolias, sycamores and palms end in particularly well-groomed greens. A flowing creek and pond make for lovely scenery, but a nasty water hazard whether playing the front or back nine.  On any day you may see the wild parrots that make their home around the golf course and the surrounding neighborhood.
