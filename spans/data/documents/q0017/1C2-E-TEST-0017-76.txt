Joe Arroyo y la verdad - Rebellion
Singer, bandleader, composer, arranger and producer. 
Colombia's most popular salsa artist and an international star in the Latin and non-Latin markets.
 Began as vocalist in small groups in Cartagena and Sincelejo,
 later relocated to Barranquilla 
and joined Orquesta La Protesta (founded '70), 
then moved to Medellin '71 to sing with Fruko's bands Tesos
 and the Latin Brothers (from the mid-'70s); 
he also recorded with Los Lideres. Arroyo founded his own band 
La Verdad '81,
 a debut album Arroyando followed by twelve more '81-93. 
He almost died '83 from a combination of intensive gigging and drug abuse.
 In addition to performing typical Latin rhythms
 (son, montuno, salsa, his native cumbia and others) 
Joe created his own 'Joesón' style and spearheaded 
the pan-Caribbean fusion style known as son caribeño.
 He made his UK debut at London's Empire Ballroom '89; 
an edited version of the gig was broadcast in BBC 2's Rhythms Of The World series '90. 
Albums Fuego En Mi Mente '88 , 
En Acción '90 
and La Guerra de Los Callados '91 were released in the UK by Mango .
 By '90 Joe had won the Congo de Oro prize at Barranquilla Carnival 
so often the Super Congo de Oro award was introduced for him 
to give other artists a chance. 
Arroyo ended his 20-year association with the Fuentes label
 and switched to Sony '91 for Toque de Clase, followed by Fuego '93. 
Various compilations have been issued incl.
 the recommended UK collection Rebellion '89,below 
featuring some of his best tracks from his strong '86 to '87 period 
and the six-volume Grandes Exitos '93 from Fuentes, 
which cover his work with both Fruko and La Verdad.
