Very, very sad.
Colombian salsa star Joe Arroyo has passed away at 55-years-old after suffering from kidney failure, heart problems, and other ailments.
Here's what Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos had to say about Arroyo's death via Twitter:
"It's a great loss for music and Colombia."
Even before his death was announced, the Latin Academy had released a statement saying that they would honor Arroyo with a Lifetime Achievement Award during November's Latin Grammys.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to Arroyo's wife Jackelín Ramón, along with the rest of his loved ones. So tragic that he was taken from this Earth at such a young age.
He will be missed.
