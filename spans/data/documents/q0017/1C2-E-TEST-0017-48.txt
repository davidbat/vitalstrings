Master Class
About 357
We are a local community of your neighbors, friends, and family who are committed to reaching financial independence. Through education, shared experience, and accountability 3-5-7 provides not just head knowledge but systems for real life application and change.
We teach time-tested, proven principles that lead us from the slavery of debt service and the constant, insatiable, demands for “more” into a life defined by Financial Integrity, Intelligence, and Independence.
True Independence. Not what your broke brother-in law says is independence or some financial company is pushing at you as independence. And not just independence for “someday/maybe” but Independence NOW from the nagging financial concerns and anxieties that have plagued us all regardless of income or background.
3-5-7 is not about the latte factor or buying generic brands on triple coupon day. It is far more powerful than that. It is about living a life driven by your deepest values and unique purpose and how we align our money with what really matters.
We offer one on one coaching, live classes and workshops, and in-depth webinars to educate us on best practices and to make sure we can apply them to our daily lives.
Many people, over many generations, have used these principles to enter into a profound and lasting freedom.
The invitation is ours to do the same.
