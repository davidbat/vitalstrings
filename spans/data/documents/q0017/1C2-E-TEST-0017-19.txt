Bogota –  Joe Arroyo, the prolific Colombian singer and songwriter who created his own signature style of dance music, died Tuesday in a hospital in the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla, his family said. He was 56.
The artist "died peacefully," his wife - Jackelin Ramon - told the press after being with him during his last moments in his room at the La Asuncion clinic where he had been receiving care since June 27.
Pneumonia, a cardiac crisis and poor kidney function had led to his hospitalization, but his health had progressively deteriorated over the past few weeks, medical authorities said.
The health situation of the creator of "joeson" ("Joe sound") had captured the attention of his fans around the country, among them President Juan Manuel Santos , who had extended his best wishes "for your quick recovery" via Twitter .
"I am lamenting the death of Joe Arroyo, a great loss for music and for Colombia . I send all my solidarity to his family and loved ones," wrote Santos on Tuesday on Twitter after he was informed of the artist's death.
The man who managed Arroyo's career for the last 28 years, Luis Ojeda, emphasized the artist's vast output, including "countless songs" that he collected on more than 150 albums.
"There are, some 300 more songs," Ojeda added, emphasizing that Arroyo "was a noble guy, a person of great worth, a great singer, a great composer."
"La rebelion," "El caminante," "El ausente" and "Tania" are just some of the many hits that Arroyo had over the course of his career.
