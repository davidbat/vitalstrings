Been going to Joe's for quite a few years now. Mostly just get strings there for my acoustic instruments, but once spent about 3 months, off and on, looking at a particular banjo he had in there made by Terry Mead. Every time I went in, Joe was more than accommodating in allowing me to test that instrument. Eventually, I had a custom banjo made for me, but have been back a number of times and Joe still provides excellent service for me. I even had a little traditional session upstairs there one day, and Joe encouraged it. Great place!!
