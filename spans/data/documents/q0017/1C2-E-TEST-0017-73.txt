Great March 13, 2003

Please understand that the person that wrote the March 7th review has absolutely no clue what he's talking about. This is a salsa/CUMBIA compilation of Joe Arroyo's greatest hits. Understandably a person who can understand the lyrics and the music itself will appreciate this album, but even if you are not latin, and you feel the soul of the music, you'll like this. Instead of criticizing something you barely understand, write a helpful review on something you know, Mr. Olympia!
Que viva Joe Arroyo! Que viva COLOMBIA!
