Ben The Balladeer
I love music, mostly Ballads be it US, Caribbean and all parts of the World. My second  love is South American and Caribbean dance music. I'm not a technical  listener  but an emotional one. The voices, backing vocals, band, lyrics must touch me for me to like it. So don't expect me to dwell into technical details of songs, if it's on this blog, it's there because it touched me in one way or an other.
