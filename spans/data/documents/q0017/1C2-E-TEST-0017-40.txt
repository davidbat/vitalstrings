Record Grading
Each entry indicates reference number, speed (LP/45), Artist, Title, Label, Label #, Condition, comments and price. All prices are in US dollars.  Unless noted, every record is an original issue for the label and catalog number given. Heres a brief explanation of my grading system, followed by an overview of abbreviations you will encounter...
SS  Still Sealed - in       factory-fresh condition
M  Mint - I don't use       this grade.
M- Mint Minus - a       near perfect, probably unplayed record
VG+  Very Good Plus       close to like new with only superficial signs of use that dont affect       play. Only well cared for records will grade out to VG+. Will satisfy all       but the most demanding collector.
VG Very Good - a used,       reasonable copy. There will be obvious signs of wear and the possibility       of light surface noise between tracks or during quiet passages, but still       quite nice.
VG- Very Good Minus -       significant wear and marks and usually quite noticeable surface noise.
G+ Good Plus. In the       record world, 'Good' is not good! From here on down (Fair, Poor), we're       talking about beat-up records.
