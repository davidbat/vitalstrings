About Trader Joe's
Trader Joe's is a chain of specialty grocery stores that mostly sells products made under its proprietary brand name. They specialize in gourmet foods, organic foods, vegetarian foods, vegan foods, and wine and beer. Trader Joe's stores have a reputation for carrying "alternative" groceries, such as ethnic frozen foods and herbal supplements, as well as environmentally-healthy products (e.g. free-range and organic meats). Due to their rapid expansion and generally favorable customer reviews, especially when it comes to private label Trader Joe's recipes, the chain is one of the better esteemed grocery retailers in the US.
