The Barranquilla clinic caring for the mysteriously ill 'Joe' Arroyo  released a medical report detailing the singer’s condition following  demands from family and fans.
In a statement Sunday evening , the Barranquilla Assumption Clinic unveiled the health problems that caused Joe Arroyo’s June 27 hospitalization, which included a hyper-intensive crisis that led to emphysema, an ischemic heart disease and diabetes.
The singer was admitted to the clinic in the northern coastal city of Barranquilla after his health failed him for the second time in two months .
Controversy emerged when the specifics of his medical condition was withheld not only from his fans, but from Arroyo’s own family.
The singer’s daughter told the Barranquilla Herald that Arroyo’s longtime girlfriend forbid her assistant from sharing the medical information with his family.
After a string of rumors on several social networking sites reported the star’s death, Arroyo’s daughters and brothers came to the clinic at 9PM Sunday and demanded answers.
While intensive care physicians conceded to share information , they added that the “next 48 hours will be crucial to (Arroyo’s) development.”
“[Arroyo has] lung problems that require mechanical ventilatory support, cardiovascular dysfunction that require medications to maintain blood pressure and worsening kidney failure.”
The star remains unconscious and under strict medical supervision so that he can receive adequate artificial respiratory support.
