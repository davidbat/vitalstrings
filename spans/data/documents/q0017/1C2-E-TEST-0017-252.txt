2012 is the 100th birthday of Woody Guthrie and the 11th year of my Tribute To Woody Guthrie. I will probably mostly be doing the Woody tribute all year long. It also will be the year of the release of the DVD of the show.  We filmed  it on September 17 at Berkeley's Freight & Salvage, with Greg Dewey on washboard and drums, Suzy Thompson on fiddle and Cajun accordion, and Blake Richardson on washtub and upright bass. Pete Slauson shot it with 5 hi-def cameras and 24-track digital audio.
Music from the forthcoming DVD of my Tribute To Woody Guthrie is now available for download here.

I have put together a fifty-minute "Tribute To Florence Nightingale And Nursing" using spoken word and song. I have tried to tell the story of the Lady With The Lamp and my interest in her life in an entertaining and educational way. The listener will gain much new information about the founder of modern nursing from her own words and the words of experts on her life and my songs about her and nursing and my own words. If you are interested in having me come and perform this tribute please e-mail me. Read a story about the show from NurseWeek, and another about my performance at Samuel Merritt University.
