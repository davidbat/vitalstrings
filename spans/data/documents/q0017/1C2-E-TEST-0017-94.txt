Joe Arroyo
Columbian Joe Arroyo (born Alvaro Jose Arroyo                      González) began his career at a very early age, when                      at age 8 he sang in a dance hall in his birth city, Cartagena.                      In 1971 he got his big break when he signed for Discos Fuentes                      and was recruited by Ernesto Estrada, bass player, singer,                      composer and producer of Fruko y sus Tesos.
He was with them for 10 years until in 1981 he began his solo                      career leading his own band, La Verdad, with whom he decided                      to mix several musical influences (salsa, compás, merengue ,                    reggae, soca) into irresistible dance music.
