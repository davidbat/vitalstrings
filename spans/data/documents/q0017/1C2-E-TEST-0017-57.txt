Name: Alvaro Jose Arroyo González
Date of birth: 1 November 1955
Place of birth: Cartagena, Colombia
Joe Arroyo has always been into music,  already singing at an early age  in one of Cartagena's popular music halls. His father had 40 children, with many different women, a story that he usually tells.
In 1971 Arroyo was discovered by the bass player and singer of the band "Fruko y sus Tesos" Ernesto Estrada and signed up with Colombian record label Discos Fuentes. He performed with the band for ten years until he began his solo career in 1981 with his own band, named "La Verdad". Joe Arroyo’s success came due to his mixing of salsa, merengue, soca, kompa, zouk and other music from the African Diaspora, in a unique style and blend that earned him the epithet of Sonero de la Salsa by his critics and fans.
Due to Joe Arroyo's health problems he was thought dead because of his abrupt absences from the stage and the media.  After recovering from a 3 month long coma due to drug abuse he wrote the song A Mi Dios Todo Le Debo.
Trivia:
Joe Arroyo’s famous song "Rebelion (No Le Pegue A La Negra)" is considered one of the greatest salsa songs of all time.
