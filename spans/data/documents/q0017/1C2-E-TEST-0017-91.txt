Joe Arroyo, Legendary Salsa Artist Passes Away
 
 
Barranquilla has declared 3 days of mourning after the death of the legendary musician Joe Arroyo on 26th July 2011, as well as renaming a transmetro station in his honour.
Born in Cartagena, “El Joe” died at the age of 55 after a month long battle with various medical conditions in Barranquilla. He was the composer of such salsa classics as La Rebelion and Echao pa’lante and Tania, not to metion En Barranquilla Me Quedo. He won numerous awards “Golden Congos”  at the annual Barranquilla Carnaval (a total of 18 – leading him to become known as the king of the Congos de Oro”) and was loved by the city as well as Colombians throughout the world.
The Latin Recording Academy praised Joe Arroyo for his unique style, combining many influences including salsa, merengue and reggae, even creating his own style known as Joeson. They said that his contribution would be rewarded at a special award ceremony in November.
I am fortunate enough to have been to one of  his concerts at the Hotel El P rado a few years ago, even though El Joe was not dancing as he used to it was still a great and memorable concert. 
Alvaro Jose Arroyo is survived by his wife, Jacqueline Ramos, and eight children, the final weeks of his life were marked by an almost soap opera like twist where his current wife has battled with his children and his best friends and co-performers such as Checa Costa, not to mention his ex-wife, as she forbid anyone from visiting him in hospital.
Many artists including Juanes and Shakira have led tributes to this unique, refined and gracious star of Colombian and international music. It is hard to imagine any other event within our lifetimes which will unite his beloved Barranquilla in a feeling of such a deep loss and grief.
