Julio Ernesto “Fruko” Estrada and Álvaro José Arroyo González are well known as Colombia’s original bad boys of tropical music and ‘Rebelión Tropical’ tells their story.
Part 1 shows how Fruko single–handedly brought modern New York style salsa to Colombia becoming a Quincy Jones type figure for Colombian music. Fruko y sus Tesos were the premier powerhouse salsa band at Discos Fuentes in the 70s and 80s and here we bring together their most celebrated tracks that feature a raft of talented vocalists, including of course Arroyo. We’ve also collected together the steamiest music that Fruko produced inc. tracks from the Latin Brothers, Afrosound, Wganda Kenya, La Sonora Dinamita and Los Corraleros De Majagual.
Part 2 sees us representing Fruko’s partner in crime Joe Arroyo. Kicking the album off with some of Joe’s most boom–ting vocals for Fruko we then delve into Joe’s work with La Verdad which was at the forefront of tropical innovations in the 80s and saw him invent his own rhythm the ‘joeson’.
From cumbia to salsa, champeta to chicha, Latin funk to the almost unclassifiable sound of the “joeson” (Joe Arroyo’s special self–invented genre from the 80s), this collection has it all – over 150 minutes of pure vintage jungle heat to get your rebellion started. 38 tracks!
