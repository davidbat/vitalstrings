Álvaro José Arroyo González (also known as “Joe Arroyo” or “El Joe”) was a Colombian salsa and tropical music singer and songwriter.
Joe Arroyo was born in Cartagena. At the age of ten he was already singing in one of Cartagenas’ popular music halls. His father had 40 sons with different women, a story that he usually tells.
In the year 1971 Arroyo had his biggest opportunity of becoming a nationally known artist. He was discovered by Ernesto Estrada, the bass player and singer of the band “Fruko y sus Tesos” (Fruko and his buddies) and signed up with Colombian record label Discos Fuentes. With the band he performed for ten years until in 1981 when he began his solo career leading his own band, named “La Verdad” (The truth).
Joe Arroyo became very successful by mixing salsa, merengue, soca, zouk and other Afro-American music beats in a unique style that has earned him the prefix of Sonero de la Salsa by renown critics and fans.
