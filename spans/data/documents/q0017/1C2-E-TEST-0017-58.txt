July 26, 2011 – The Latin Recording Academy announced today that Joe Arroyo, who unfortunately passed away this morning in Barranquilla, Colombia, will be honored with the Prize of Musical Excellence at the Special Awards Ceremony on November 9, 2011, as part of the Latin Grammy celebration.
The CEO of the Latin Recording Academy in Los Angeles, Gabriel Abaroa, released the following statement an hour ago:
“Today we had the pleasure and honor of announcing our 2011 Latin Recording Academy Special Awards recipients. Among them is the celebrated artist Joe Arroyo, whose untimely passing has left us all greatly saddened. A celebrated singer, songwriter, and composer, Joe leaves a legacy of exceptional music and diverse talent. Crossing many styles including salsa, merengue and reggae, his unique abilities led him to develop his own style known as Joesón. A dedicated artist, Joe's career began at age 8 and went right up to his final days. Today and at our Special Awards Ceremony on Nov. 9, we will celebrate his music, his life, and the imprint he has made on Latin culture. Our deepest sympathies extend to his family, friends and fans during this difficult time as we remember a great music man.”
