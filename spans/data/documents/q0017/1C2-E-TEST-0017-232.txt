A for-awesome Trader Joe's - well stocked, clean (including the restroom), and excellent service. Sizable too, and my main reason for coming here to review -- they had several things we can't even get in San Francisco last time I checked, which is under a week ago.
Most notably, they had Gingeroos (a low-fat ginger cookie in the Trader Joe bag). I LOVE Gingeroos. I first found them in early June in Eugene Oregon on our way up to the Oregon coast. And we totally fell in love with the buggers (so much we hid them from my parents, whom we were meeting -- I am a horrible greedy Gingeroo-obsessed daughter). I totally digress. So, Eugene to our north has Gingeroos. Arroyo Grande to our south has Gingeroos. Why doesn't San Francisco (or Daly City, or Menlo Park, or Burlinggame or whereever that other TJs we have been to) have Gingeroos? Why is bay area Gingeroo free?
This is getting ridiculous. Other good can't-find-in-SF finds were the Low-Fat Cinnamon Rolls (I used to get these, but they disappeared on me until today), Sutters Formula cookies (an awesome peanut chew with chocolate chunks and a comparatively lowish fat count), and a Lowfat Apricot Teacake. They also had a lowfat marble teacake as well. I sure hope to see those up our way, love their healthy loafs.
Anyway, an excellent Trader Joe's for sure. I have to say that TJ's really hires the friendliest people - whereever we go we seem to stop at a TJ's, and they always have super-friendly cashiers (and today was no exception - they guy with the peace sign necklace would have definitely received UFC votes from me if I could).
Glad we stopped by on our way home. I wish this was our regular TJs!
