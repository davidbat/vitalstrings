Joe Arroyo was born in Cartagena. At the age of ten, he was already singing in one of Cartagena's popular music halls. His father had 40 children with different women, a story that he usually tells.
In 1971, Arroyo had his biggest opportunity of becoming a nationally known artist.

With the band he performed for ten years until in 1981 when he began his solo career leading his band, named "La Verdad" (The truth).
Joe Arroyo became very successful by mixing salsa, merengue, soca, kompa, zouk and other music from the African Diaspora in a unique style that has earned him the prefix of Sonero de la Salsa by renown critics and fans. One of his most famous songs is "Rebelión (No Le Pegue A La Negra)". It is widely considered one of the greatest salsa songs of all time.

He was once in a coma for 3 months due to his drug abuse. After recovering from the coma he wrote the song "A Mi Dios Todo Le Debo" (I owe God everything).
