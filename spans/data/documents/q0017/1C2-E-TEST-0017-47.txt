Master Class
Referral Directory
This directory is a response to the overwhelming request made upon myself and my staff for references of professional services and contractors. Those represented here are the finest individuals and companies serving our community. They have a “heart of a teacher” and are here to serve our needs rather than sell their product.
Position in this directory is never bought. It is earned. We charge a fee to those listed in this directory to cover the cost of web maintenance and shared expenses. That’s it!
I have personally used the services of every member or would use those services if a myself or a family member is in need.
We demand excellence from every member for every service. Accountability for results is a big part of who we are and we strongly encourage you to let us know your experience. Only the best of the best are to be listed here.
If you have any suggestions for a business to be in this directory we would love to receive your input!
