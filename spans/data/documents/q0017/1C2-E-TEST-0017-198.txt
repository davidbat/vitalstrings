Are you arguing too much?  Does everything you say get taken the wrong way?  Does your relationship feel like a minefield? Do you want to get closer but feel shut out?  Nothing affects your sense of contentment, satisfaction and fulfillment like the condition of your family relationships.  When life at home is in turmoil, nothing else runs smoothly.   It is possible to improve the communication, reduce the conflict and bring peace back into your home.
As a specialist in couples therapy, I can help you reconnect with your spouse and return you to the path of a close, growing relationship.  If you want a happier more fulfilling life at home AND are willing to put in the effort, I would be grateful for the opportunity to help.
