We had the Arroyo’s en mass to the house Sunday afternoon. Linda and I hosted Michael and Andrew, back from USAO and St. Gregory’s for the weekend and their grandparents, my father, Jose’ or “Joe” and his wife, Frances Arroyo. We had a fantastic afternoon and it was a great opportunity for Dad and Frances to see my two youngest, whom they have not seen since they were very small. I don’t think they have had the pleasure since before Michael was in 3rd Grade!
