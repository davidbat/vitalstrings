I'm I blind or can I not see Mikko Hirvonen on that list?
kind of stupid that Ogier and Latvila are on that list but Hirvonen is not have just narrowly missed out on taking the WRC title...
and 3, V8 supercar drivers who have also appeared on the list in previous years anyway is a lot?
I call banana hammock...
