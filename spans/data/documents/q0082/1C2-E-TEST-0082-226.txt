Best NASCAR Driver?
The Best F1 driver has been done to death, but I don't think this discussion has come up as of yet. Who do you think the best NASCAR driver is? I think after this season, Kevin Harvick deserves the nod but Dale Earnhardt Junior always seems to be up there too. What do you think? It'll be interesting to see everyone else's opinion!

I guess that's a tough question in any motorsport. Earnhardt Junior and Harvick are clearly out there, but so are Stewart and Johnson. They are all great drivers...
What's nice is that they are all competing for victories. This makes it more difficult to (maybe it's always difficult
) really say who's the best.
