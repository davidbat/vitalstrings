F1 Melbourne Circuit Open House this weekend at SimDeck in our F1 Simulator
Posted on March 23, 2009 by simdeck
The Formula One 2009 Season gets underway in hours and we’re celebrating with a Special F1 Open House so you can also race on the Melbourne circuit. The cars are new, the rules have changed a season of drama is about to unfold, so here is your chance to get behind the wheel of an actual real open wheeler race car and take it out onto the virtual Melbourne track.
NZ’s only current Formula One driver Brendan Hartely, will be NOT be driving in the Red Bull team after all the anticipation since his super licence never came thru in time, so we think it is only fitting that you will be driving the virtual version of his car around Melbourne. Come and experience a high speed adrenalin rush in the life size and life like virtual SimDeck world.
STOP PRESS – Breaking News TODAY, Kiwi Company brings Formula One to a new level of realism for the world to experience for the first time this weekend. Click here for details .
SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR PARENTS – Here is something fun you can do with your children THIS WEEKEND.
We are looking forward for all boy racers, mums with a burning ambition to lay some rubber, youngsters who one day dream of owning their own race car, and adults reliving some lost dreams to step up to the challenge and try a few laps on a virtual race circuit in a Formula race car. Your chance to celebrate being a Kiwi Champion on the first weekend of the 2009 Formula One season.
With speeds of over 300kph, split second timing, accurate driving lines and serious concentration we expect to see some nervous drivers taking the controls.
There is a small charge of $5 per driver which will give you at least 5 minutes or more in the car.
This experience is unique in NZ that has previously has not been readily available in NZ.  The enormous 2.5m wide virtual reality screen puts you into a full life size virtual world where you feel every bump of the road and shudder of the engine as you race an actual race car.
Melbourne Formula One Track
Recent visitors have been espousing how life like the experience is which is what we are aiming to achieve and to take the realism way beyond what people can re-create at home.
This is what North Shore Mayor and now boy racer, Andrew Williams had to say.
I had the real pleasure of trying out the SimDeck Formula Race car simulator at a function I attended in May 2008 – and I’ve got to say that the whole experience was something I could imagine you could very easily get hooked on!
The sheer exhilaration of feeling like you are actually driving a high performance vehicle at speeds of up to 300kph left me as a total convert to this concept which is truly exciting and immensely challenging to those among us who are Formula One followers.
A combination of life size virtual world images, real time dash gauges, vibration sensory feedback and enough sound to recreate the on-track atmosphere resulted in a blurring of reality and virtual reality for me and made the racing seem absolutely realistic. Andrew William, North Shore City Mayor, www.northshorecity.govt.nz

After appearing on national radio with Danny Watson on Radio 2ZB’s “Tech Tuesdays” programme this week talking about this uniquely kiwi experience, we have been told we could cause a traffic jam out on the street. Now that is kinda cool a virtual car race creating a real world traffic jam. Of course this fits right into our motto. “SimDeck creating the reality in virtual reality”.
So if you come along please wait your turn with a smile and everyone will get the chance to race…even if we need to run the Open Day again on another weekend.

You provide the drinks, BBQ food and up to 12 enthusiastic drivers. We provide the venue, actual race car all set up and BBQ facilities.
