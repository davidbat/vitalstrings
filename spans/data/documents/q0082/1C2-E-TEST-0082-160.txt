Sebastian Vettel looked set for an easy victory until his car failed beneath him, and he was just one of a number of high profile incidents. Four retired cars, one safety car period, another McLaren pit stop failure, several collisions and a number of steward interventions made this the most interesting race around the Valencia streets that we have seen to date. Alonso took his second victory of the year, joined on the podium by Kimi Räikkönen and Michael Schumacher - the German's first podium since his comeback in 2010.
