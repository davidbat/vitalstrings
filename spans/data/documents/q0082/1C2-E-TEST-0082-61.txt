The correct Brasilian pronunciation for Ayrton is like this: "eye-ear-tone," with "tone" almost having a closed "M" sound to it. Senna is pronounced just as it appears.
I lived in Brasil, and it seems like every neighborhood has a street named "Ayrton Senna."
Vettel just happens to have an excellent car. Put other drivers (Hamilton, Rosberg, Button, Alonso,etc) in the same car and watch them dominate. Give Seb a less-excellent car and see how he does. That's the true test of being one of the world's greatest drivers.
