Eddie Cheever, America's most experienced Grand Prix driver, says his home country needs an F1 driver if future events in Austin and New Jersey are to survive. The 53-year-old also believes the 2005 Michelin tyre drama at Indianapolis, a race where only Bridgestone runners competed, made American fans turn away from the sport.
Cheever started 132 F1 races, earning nine podium finishes
"I don't think Formula 1 can be successful in America without an American driver, but there are a lot of Ferrari fans who follow the sport everywhere and there are American Formula 1 fans," Cheever is quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated.
"There would be a lot more success with American drivers. We were doing well at Indianapolis until they dropped the ball with the tire fiasco in 2005. The fans are very fickle and they didn't come back."
Cheever reckons a change of mentality may be needed in order to inspire groups of Americans to chase an F1 future, with most native drivers moving on to careers in NASCAR or IndyCar racing.
"Almost all of the young drivers in America want to be in NASCAR and we need more to want to get to F1. Just having one driver won't do it," he added. "Maybe having one in F1 would galvanize F1 in America so more young drivers wanted (to get involved).
"It is a process that is going to take a long time, a five-year plan (supported) by a corporation or a car manufacturer to develop talent."
