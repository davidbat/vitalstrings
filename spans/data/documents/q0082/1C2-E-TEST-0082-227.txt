Apologies for not doing a Japanese Grand Prix Review until now. And unfortunately this time it won’t be a video review either. I’ve been really sick with the flu (hopefully not swine flu!
) but it’ll be back to business as normal for the Brazilian Grand Prix.
First up, what was with all the accidents in qualifying!? I’ve never seen a qualifying session like that before and I don’t remember Suzuka being that dangerous the last time F1 raced there. Real shame about Timo Glock in particular – just as he was starting to shine
Quick points that stood out from the race:
Sebastian Vettel – A champion’s drive. Shame he probably won’t be champion – not this year anyway
I say give it to both him and Jenson! They’ve both deserved it as much as each other at different points in the season
Jenson Button – After a great drive in Singapore this performance was very disappointing. Kind of sums up the 2nd half of the year for Jenson.
Jarno Trulli – Great job from Jarno and Toyota. One wonders what would have been if Glock was able to race too. Let’s hope Toyota can continue the momentum into next year.
Lewis Hamilton – Another good race from the Englishman. Some championship-winning consistency there. If only McLaren didn’t have such a poor start to the season…
Heikki Kovalainen – Very surprised he didn’t get penalised for completely screwing Adrian Sutil’s race up. Sutil made the cleanest pass possible then Heikki just straight out punts him off. I’d be surprised to see him at McLaren next year.
Kimi Raikkonen – Like Lewis, Kimi is getting some good consistent results.
Nico Rosberg – Can’t wait to see him in a (hopefully) better car next year.
Fernando Alonso – First race in a long while where he’s completely not been a factor.
