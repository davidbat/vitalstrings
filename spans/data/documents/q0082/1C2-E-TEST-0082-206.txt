Welcome                 to the most vibrant single-seater championship in the world: the Dunlop MSA Formula Ford Championship of Great Britain
The                 launch of the stunning 2012 EcoBoost Formula Ford car is the                 latest generation of one of the most important formulas in the                 history of world motorsport.
Formula                 Ford is globally renowned as the first step on a driver's career                 path to Formula 1. Relatively simple, strong cars that rely on                 driver skill rather than aerodynamic aids to win.
This                 is where it has started for motorsport stars for over 40 years -                 it is Formula Ford that has allowed young drivers to develop,                 refine and ultimately prove their racing talent, before going on                 to greater things.
Whilst                 other racing series have come and gone around the world, Formula                 Ford has remained consistent and true to its original guiding                 principles. For, although for 2012 the engines have grown in                 power, grip from tyres has increased, and the car design has                 become ever more sophisticated, the Formula continues to deliver                 an intense learning experience to its drivers for both driving                 and engineering aspects. Ask anybody involved in motorsport and                 they'll confirm that the closest racing and the best learning                 comes from Formula Ford. It's very simple - if you succeed in                 Formula Ford racing, the motorsport world knows that you truly                 have what it takes.
In                 2012, the MSA Formula Ford Championship of Great Britain will                 have drivers from all over the world competing in the                 closest-fought racing on the planet. Our own television                 programmes on both Channel 4 terrestrial and Motors TV across                 Europe reflect the popularity of our racing.
 
2009                 F1                 WORLD CHAMPION JENSON BUTTON:
"Formula Ford was a great championship for me to start my career in single-seater cars. For drivers making the step up                 from karts to cars, Formula Ford couldn't be a better                 championship to introduce rookies to the open wheel racing.                 After winning the British Formula Ford Championship and the                 Formula Ford Festival, the next step up for me was Formula 3. I                 definitely think that Formula Ford gave me the right preparation                 and experience needed to move up again in my career."
F3                 AND SPORTS CAR RACER NICK TANDY:
"Formula Ford has not only been the greatest training                 ground, but also the best racing environment of my career to                 date. No matter what track the series visits, it seems to                 provide the highlight of on-track action at any given meeting                 and I feel very proud and privileged to have been part of it for                 the two seasons I competed. Unlike                 the various one-make championships around, FF being a                 multi-chassis formula enables the drivers to fully interact and                 play a pivotal role in the development process of the cars. It                 builds skills and knowledge that some will never have, so when                 your F1 team boss asks you to assess the new anti-dive                 suspension kit they've just made, it'll be much easier to fully                 understand and provide relevant feedback!"
What                 makes Formula Ford different?
One                 of the key elements of Formula Ford's success over 40 years is                 that, unlike all the other single seaters series that have come                 and gone, it is not a one-make championship. By allowing freedom                 of chassis design, engine build and numerous technical items of                 specification on the car, this drives the technical standards to                 exceptionally high levels from both teams and drivers.
Contrast                 the fixed specification of rival single-seater cars with the                 engineering freedom permitted for Formula Ford, and you will                 rapidly appreciate why Formula Ford drivers leave the series                 with exceptional levels of understanding of car set up and the                 implications of each chassis variation they try. This tends to                 be the reason that their careers progress so far thereafter.
If you are serious about your driving career, missing the                 crucial learning experience that Formula Ford provides might                 just be the biggest mistake you make...
