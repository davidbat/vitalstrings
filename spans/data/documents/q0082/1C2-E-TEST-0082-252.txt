US Formula First Championship Series
In 2002, Formula  First became a low cost reality in US open wheel road racing. The class has  continually grown to become recognized by multiple sanctioning bodies throughout  the US. The Formula First Drivers Association (FFDA) was formed to focus our  growth into promotion and organization. The FFDA annually plans, schedules and  executes a series of race meetings to showcase Formula First. The FFDA utilized  our intense level of competition and camaraderie to create The Hoosier Tire US Formula First  Championship Series.  Here is the 2012 FST  Series Preview .
This website is pleased to be your  information headquarters for all things Formula First, the FFDA and The Hoosier Tire Formula First Championship  Series. Please patronize all of  our sponsors as each of them help us to bring you the website you are now  enjoying.
