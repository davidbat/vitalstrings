Barrichello still hungers for the title - Daniel Sancho
Many drivers have raced in Formula One without taking the championship. Here is a brief rundown of some of those drivers.
As with all sports, they can be only one winner. These are the men that take the glory and go down in history for all time. But, what of the men who finish as runner-up? Here, we take a look at some of the better drivers in the history of Formula One who were able to finish second (some more than once) but never were able to take the crown.
Stirling Moss
Stirling Moss is one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all-time. In his eleven year career, which lasted from 1951 to 1961, Moss crossed the line victorious no fewer than 16 times. That is an impressive feat, considering he drove against another all-time great, Juan Manuel Fangio. Moss finished second in the championship to the great Argentinean in 1955, 1956, and 1957. In ’58 Moss finished second once more, this time to fellow Brit Mike Hawthorn. In the final race , Hawthorn needed only a second place finish to take the title, which he did, following Moss to the flag. However, it was discussed that Hawthorn should be penalized for some of his actions on track, a charge that Moss vehemently denied. His honesty cost him the championship, but marked as a great sportsman for all time.
Jacky Ickx
The speedy Belgian, Ickx, will forever be remembered as a sports car ace, having won the 24 Hours of Lemans a total of six times – a record that has only just been broken. He was also a pretty good Formula One driver, taking the track for teams such as: Brabham, Ferrari, Lotus, and McLaren. He was a master in the wet, taking a number of his 8 total wins in such conditions. Ickx finished second in the championship to Jackie Stewart in 1969, and came even closer in 1970, nearly overhauling the point total of Jochen Rindt (the only posthumous champion in the sport’s history).
