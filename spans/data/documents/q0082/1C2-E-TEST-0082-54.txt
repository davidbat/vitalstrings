In conjunction with F1 bad boy Fernando Alonso’s newly signed million Euro deal with Ferrari, sources revealed that Alonso is the highest paid driver on the 2011 Formula One driver’s pay list. F1 drivers are among the best paid sportsmen in the world apart from football players who are ridiculously overpaid.
The pay list below excludes sponsorship endorsements which easily contribute millions to driver’s pocket. Don’t forget some drivers get decent company cars if their principle is a car manufacturer. The lucky ones like Button and Hamilton gets the new McLaren MP4-12C for free, Alonso and Massa has plenty of Ferrari’s to choose from, also Schumacher and Rosberg with their fleet of Mercedes cars at their disposal, for free. Meanwhile Petrov, Kubica and Heldfied should be lucky to get Renault hot hatches or Lotus sport cars as free cars rather than Protons.
Traditionally, Ferrari pays the highest among all teams and you can see why Alonso tops the list. McLaren pays equally to their world champion drivers while Red Bull should consider paying Vettel more in order to keep him longer. Even F1 rookies like Perez, Maldonaldo and Di Resta, are paid equally at 200,000€ but it might change by next year depending on their performance in 2011.
Here’s the list in Euros. If only we can earn as much as they can…
1. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 30M€
2. Jenson Button (McLaren) 10M€
3. Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) 10M€
4. Felipe Massa (Ferrari) 10M€
