I ordered my unit for the British F1 Gp for home delivery, just wondered when they were being sent out? Also noticed that if i had waited to order one i would have saved £25 ( is that discount already included in what i paid?) and the chance to win a meet with Paul Di'resta will i be entered in to that or did i miss out?
