Instructions
1
Get involved with karting at a young age. Most Formula 1 drivers begin their racing careers behind the wheel of a kart by the age of ten. Visit the World Karting's homepage (See Resource section below). Find a list of tracks in your area that are sanctioned by the World Karting Association, the authority for karting in the United States.
2
Attend racing school. Reputable racing schools offer multi-day classes at tracks throughout the country. Learn the basics of handling a more powerful open wheel car.
3
Move to Europe as a teenager. Get a ride in Formula 3 or Formula 3000. While a few drivers who honed their skills on the American circuits have successfully made the move to Formula 1, there is a much greater chance of success if you climb the racing ladder in Europe.
4
Race hard and move to teams that offer a greater chance to finish on the podium. Attract the attention of a Formula 1 boss by performing consistently well in the lower levels. Find a good agent to help promote you and capitalize on your success on the track.
5
Become a test driver for a Formula 1 team. It is preferable to start Formula 1 racing, but some current drivers first honed their skills as test drivers-developing race strategies through endless test laps as they learned the nuances of each track on the circuit.
6
Find funding to support your campaign. Smaller teams with more precarious funding consider taking a driver who brings sponsorship to the team.
Tips & Warnings
Expect to invest several thousand dollars in your racing career before you reach the upper levels of competition.
