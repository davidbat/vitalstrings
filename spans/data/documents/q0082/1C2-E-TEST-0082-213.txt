JORDAN (T Carlin): "... We have been very lucky to put together            a driver line-up which gives us a really strong package in terms of            youth, technical ability, speed and talent. I            know Narain very well because he drove for me in 1998 in Formula 3 and            I have run him in various formulas every year since then. We've won            a lot of races together. He's very competitive, a super-quick driver,            sometimes a little bit raw and wild in his style but he is a proven            race winner and I am confident that in our environment he will thrive.He's            ready for F1 now I think he'll do a good job for us."
KARTHIKEYAN: "... My aim has always been to compete in F1, it is            where no Indian driver has been before. I've got the hopes of a nation            behind me so I've no choice but to succeed now. I have tested with three            different Formula 1 teams at various circuits and I'm going to give            it everything I've got so I am confident that this is going to be a            good year for me."
MONTEIRO: "... I'm more than excited to be part of Jordan Grand            Prix this season. I have worked hard each season to be able to race            one day in F1 and I really want to make the most out of this to thank            everyone who helped put me here today. Portugal was waiting for a F1            driver for nearly ten years and the fact that I'm going to represent            my country and the Portuguese culture all over the world makes me proud            and gives me so much motivation"
Pastorelli            joins Jordan as test driver

PASTORELLI: "I am very excited about this opportunity and I would            like to thank Jordan for placing their trust and confidence in me. Getting            some laps in the car at the Barcelona test last week was an unexpected            but fantastic experience and I want to do a good job for the team now as an official test driver. I'm looking forward to my next F1 outing."

At            the same time, I am excited about my new role and look forward to contributing            as much as possible as the team repositions itself as Midland for the            2006 season.
