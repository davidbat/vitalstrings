Tyler McQuarrie vs. Chelsea DeNofa – Best Wreck View [VIDEO]
While the Livestream and some other people have caught some glimpses of the wreck or a super far away angle with the help of Brian Chin we scored this footage above. A fixed camera angle on the bank shows Tyler McQuarrie crash into the bank and Chelsea DeNofa immediately lock up the tires and work to avoid Tyler McQuarrie in the GoPro / Mobil 1 Chevrolet Camaro but slid up into the wall and then slammed into Tyler McQuarrie. Sadly Chelsea DeNofa took the brunt of the force in his E36 BMW and we are pretty sure it is totaled out.
Tyler Gets the Win? [SNAPSHOT]
I know that a picture only tells 1,000 words but it sure seems to represent what our whole staff saw and left us scratching our heads at Wall Speedway this evening. Tyler McQuarire crashed right into the wall and then Chelsea (since he was drifting and following line and did I mention proximity) wound up in the wall because he had no where to go and then hit Tyler (who clearly has done it all wrong as seen here) but was allowed to move on.
Once we can pull the Live Stream video feed along with some amateur video men who hopefully have captured it but this once again shows that car to car contact continues to baffle Formula Drift and they need to create some more hard and fast rules on these subjects. Doesn’t this just feel like Chris Forsberg vs. Calvin Wan 2009 all over again ? How you could ever put Chelsea at fault for hitting a car that has crashed on course is beyond me.
Nice screen grab KeepDriftingFun and we will have more on this subject on Monday but please chime in your thoughts on the whole event.

2012 Formula Drift Round 4 at Wall [RESULTS]
One head splitting mind numbingly confusing event which watched the three championship points drivers go out early. Wall was reclaimed by Falken Tire once again after no win in 2011.

1. Vaughn Gittin Jr.
3. Chris Forsberg
4. Daigo Saito
