Featured Race British Grand Prix 1966
Jack Brabham proved his win at Reims was no fluke when he followed with victory in the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, a result which opened up a sizeable lead for him in the drivers' championship. It was the first time a driver-owner led both the drivers' and constructors' standings. Ferrari was absent - blaming a strike in Italy - while BRM faced a hectic build-up while it tried to prepare a second car for Jackie Stewart following a major crash at Spa. The Brabhams were undoubtedly the class of the field, however, as Brabham led home team-mate Denny Hulme.
