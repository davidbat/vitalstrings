5. Jackie Stewart (1939 - )
Born in Scotland in 1939, Jackie Stewart grew up around cars as his father owned car dealerships. His brother Jimmy also raced cars. After successful stints in F3 and F2 racing, Stewart joined the Formula 1 circuit in 1965. After moderate success early in his career, Stewart won six of 11 F1 races in 1969 and the World Championship. He would go on to win two more world titles in 1971 and 1973. In his Formula 1 career, Stewart ranks fifth in career F1 victories with 27.
4. Ayrton Senna (1960 - 1994)
Ayrton Senna is the most decorated Formula 1 driver born in Brazil. Although he won the F3 championship at an early age, Senna won just six races in his first three years of Formula 1 racing. But when he joined Alain Prost on the McLaren racing team in 1988, Ayrton Senna won eight races that year, taking home the World Championship. He also won the world title in 1990 and 1991. Senna ranks third in total F1 victories with 41. Ayrton Senna died tragically at the age of 34 in a crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.
3. Alain Prost (1955 - )
After participating in a number of different sports in his native France, Alain Prost began kart racing as a teenager. In 1980, Prost joined the McLaren racing team on the F1 circuit. Following an unsuccessful rookie campaign, Alain Prost joined the Renault team and gradually improved each year. But in 1984, Prost rejoined McLaren and his career truly took off. Alain Prost won four World Championships and a total of 51 Formula 1 races, a record at the time this feat was accomplished.
2. Juan Manuel Fangio (1911 - 1995)
Until Michael Schumacher broke his record in 2003, Juan Manuel Fangio had won the most F1 World Championships (five) in history. Hailing from Argentina, Fangio was already an accomplished driver by the time he joined Formula 1. One of the oldest racers on the track, Juan Manuel Fangio won the second F1 World Championship ever at the age of 40. Fangio would go on to win a total of 24 Formula 1 events; an impressive total given the fact that there were less than 10 F1 races per year throughout most of the 1950's.
1. Michael Schumacher (1969 - )
Michael Schumacher is unquestionably the greatest Formula 1 driver in history. Born in Germany, Schumacher began kart racing at a young age, like many drivers. Starting F1 racing in 1991, Michael Schumacher had already won his first World Championship by 1994. Throughout his career, Schumacher has won seven world titles and an astonishing 91 races, both of which are Formula 1 records. Although often criticized for his driving style and enhancements found to be illegal in his car, Schumacher's achievements are remarkable. Click here to see a video of Michael Schumacher.
