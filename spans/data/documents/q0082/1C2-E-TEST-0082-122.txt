The Top Formula One Driver on Facebook
Easy. It’s the reigning world champion, Lewis Hamilton, who has 326,022 fans on Facebook. Fernando Alonso is second with a paltry 68,626 .

F1 Fanatic recently made a chart comparing the popularity of Formula One drivers on Facebook and found that Hamilton had more Facebook fans than all other 2008 Formula One drivers combined. But Valentino Rossi, the MotoGP champion and sometime rally driver , trumps them all with close to a million fans . From F1 Fanatic:
A quick way for Hamilton to make up the ground to Rossi would be to successfully land an airliner on the Hudson River. That propelled Captain C.B. Sully Sullenberger 536,579 fans in a matter of days.
Poor Anthony Davidson doesn’t seem to have a fan page. And I assume Facebook isn’t very popular in Japan, as Takuma Sato and Kazuki Nakajima have fewer fans than F1 Fanatic does.
To put the whole list into perspective, the Facebook user with the most fans is Barack Obama, with 4,721,908 supporters. None of the F1 drivers are more popular than cult ’80s kids TV show Thundercats.
And how do Nascar drivers compare? Not too well. Dale Earnhardt Jr. has 18,781 fans , which would put him in fifth on the Formula One list. Most of the other drivers have a ways to go to catch up to even Robert Kubica’s level of Facebook popularity (12,768). The three-time Sprint Cup champion, Jimmie Johnson, has only 6,545 fans . Tony Stewart has 8,563 fans .
