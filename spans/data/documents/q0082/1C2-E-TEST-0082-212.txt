The World of Formula            One
In the field of motor sport Formula            One is the undisputed pinnacle. For this reason manufacturers and drivers            alike aspire to compete and win in this arena, which brings not only            fame (and fortune) but the maximum publicity and honours around the            World.
Car racing goes back almost as far as            the invention of the Motor Car itself, but it is since the end of the            second world war that Formula One has really taken off. Early races            were dominated by Italy with the Alfa Romeo and Maserati teams at the            front of the field, while later Ferrari became the name which captured            the imagination of racing fans, the latter now known as the "tifosi" in Italy. Mercedes entered a Grand Prix Team in 1954 and dominated for            two seasons, after which they abruptly withdrew.
In the earlier dyas of Formula 1, drivers            such as Farina, Ascari, Gonzalez, Fangio were the leading drivers, and            later British stars such as Sterling Moss, and Mike Hawthorn joined            the winners circle, followed in later years by names such as Jim Clark,            Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill, John Surtees.
In the 60's and 70's specialist            constructors such as Cooper, Lotus, Brabham, and Tyrrell started to            dominate Formula 1 with rear engined cars, and at about that time sponsorship,            initially from tobacco giants started the trend to greater commercialism,            and the sponsors name being incorporated in the "team" name,            for example Lotus became Gold Leaf Team Lotus, and later John Player            Special.
This trend in Formula 1 of specialist            constructors has continued to the present day, with familiar names such            as McLaren, Williams, Benetton, Jordan, Minardi, and Arrows emerging,            being joined by Sauber and BAR in more recent times.
Within Formula One, only Ferrari has            been consistent retaining the name of the cars it is world famous for            throughout this period and ironically the trend is now back to the motor            manufacturers which reflects legislation preventing tobacco advertising,            and a recognition that success in Formula One reflects on the car manufacturer            in terms of brand recognition and hence world wide sales of its products.
Hence we now see the ever consistent Ferrari joined by McLaren Mercedes, BMW Williams, Honda BAR, Honda Jordan,            Prost Peugeot, and Jaguar Ford, and shortly by Renault and Toyota.
Thanks to both sponsorship and the power            of TV, revenues from which have funded much of the change from what            was essentially an amateur sport to the highly professional "circus" we see today, the FIA and the Formula One Association headed by Bernie            Ecclestone have made a tremendous success of growing Formula One into            a world wide business, with 17 races per season staged in Australia,            South America, North America, the Far East, and Europe.
Points in  Formula 1 are awarded            in each race both for the winning Constructors and Drivers which count            toward the World Constructors Championship, and the World Drivers Championship.
Established drivers such as, Mika Hakkinen            (current world champion), Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, Rubens            Barrichello, Jacques Villeneurve and Eddie Irvine, are joined by aspiring            up and coming names such as Jenson Button, Ralf Schumacher, and Pedro            de la Rosa, while the older stalwarts like Johnny Herbert, Jean Alesi            and Mikka Salo soldier on in the hope of better times ahead.
Formula One Merchandise is a large and            growing part of the world wide development and recognition of Formula            One. Ferrari and Jaguar are huge brands, while BMW, Mercedes Honda,            and Renault are recognised throughout the world. All have a wide range            of clothing ranging from Tee Shirts, Caps, Polo Shirts, Fleeces, and            Jackets, while other items in the range include Mugs, Watches, Key Rings,            Sun Glasses, Mouse Mats, Coasters, and Stickers.
Formula One models, Videos, Books and            Calendars complete the range of formula one merchandise, all of which            are essential possessions for the Grand Prix enthusiast, and make ideal            presents and gifts at Christmas and other anniversaries such as birthdays.
Drivers too have their own branded            formula one merchandise with Michael Scumacher leading the field, followed            by David Coulthard, Jenson Button, Jacques Villeneuve and Eddie Irvine.
