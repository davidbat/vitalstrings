8. Compstar titanium pushrods, springs, and retainers
9. SLP loudmouth stainless exhaust

13. Custom boost gauge and oil pressure gauge that appear OEM
14. HP custom dyno tune and a SAFE TUNE (performed by SR racing)
15. New 160A tread tires on all 4 wheels. (Less than 3,000 miles on them)
16. Metal braided hoses
17. Custom tented windows
All stock parts are available for the car even the stock    tires, provided the shipping is paid for by the new owner
Now I will disclose the problem list that is short and sweet;
Air conditioning not working. System is holding pressure. I am sure that      the team at SR racing would be able to fix this.
Front bumper has a slight rub on the left side. No break in the plastic      of the bumper, just in need of a little touch up from a body shop.
How to get the car:
I can drive the car to Kentucky. (I make a trip there once per month)
I can pick you up at the Albuquerque airport in the car, do paperwork      and get you back on the road by 6 pm. Flights cost me approx $330 round trip      through American Airlines.
You can bank wire the money to me, and have a transport pick up the      vehicle.
I work 7 days on and 7 days off, so finding a scheduling date should not      be a problem.
Questions or comments;
First try Sracing. Jim knows my car, and has worked on it with      modifications many, many times. He also has dyno results of the car’s      performance.
Contact me at (502) 370-5900. My name is Matt Zagula. Keep in mind that      I am Mountain Standard Time, and 2 hours behind Kentucky.

FOR    SALE - I have to get the car out of the trailer and into the garage    to get it ready for sale, but in a nutshell: mid-70's D-13, Satterly regional    motor
Lybarger short-box, NEW Lybarger 1:22 long box (with axles and tubes, probably    everything needed to assemble drum to drum) - just got this back from LRE a    couple weeks ago. Transponder. 4 sets of tires - 8 mounted slicks (not sure    how good), 4 mounted intermediates,  4 unmounted rains and 4 four rims (rims    need a good cleaning/blasting). Complete spare body, plus two additional spare    noses, PLUS nose mold. Complete (drum to drum) spare beam
Will be putting in PI/2 data system (or send with car if sold before I get to    putting it in). Will be putting in radios (or send along if sold before I get    them installed). It's my understanding that the belts were replaced in 2010 (5    year belts) but I have to verify that when it comes out of the trailer. I also    understand that in 2009 there were new brake pads,    heim joints (all), trailing arms, fuel cell w/cockpit braded lines w/AN    fittings, offset front kingpin bushings by Dietmar, new link pins & bushings,    rewired, axle boots, F&R seals, Celastos, more. Prefer to sell    everything as a package, but might sell without the long box, data and radios    depending on price. Trailer is a homebuilt, enclosed unit - nice trailer,    brakes, tows well behind Jimmy/Blazer type vehicles.  Could use a fresh paint    (which I might do if it doesn't sell too soon). Looking for $7K for    everything except trailer.  Will take $6500 if sold before installing    the data and radios (but they go with). Will take $5,500 as is without    the long box and related pieces. Would like to get $1500 for the    trailer (if not sold with the car - car buyer get's first crack at trailer). ( Photo1 )    ( Photo2 ) ( Photo3 )    ( Photo4 ) Car and    all parts and trailer - $7,500 if sold before I install the data and    radios. Bob Stack, EMAIL (03/19/12)
