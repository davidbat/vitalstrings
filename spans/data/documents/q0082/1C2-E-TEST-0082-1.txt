Formula One , abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. [1] The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform. The F1 world championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix , held usually on purpose-built circuits , and in a few cases on closed city streets. Drivers are awarded points based on their position in each race, and the driver who accumulates the most points over each calendar year is crowned that year's World Champion . As of the 2012 European Grand Prix , there have been 866 FIA World Championship races since its first event, the 1950 British Grand Prix . [2]
Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher holds the record for the most championships, while his 91 wins, [3] 155 podium finishes and 68 pole positions are also records. [4] Rubens Barrichello has entered more Grands Prix than anyone else—326 times in total—as well as having made an unsurpassed 322 race starts. [5] The United Kingdom is the most represented nation, having produced a total of 158 different drivers. Eight nations have been represented by just one. Russia became the latest country to be represented by a driver when Vitaly Petrov made his Formula One debut at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Renault F1 . [6]
