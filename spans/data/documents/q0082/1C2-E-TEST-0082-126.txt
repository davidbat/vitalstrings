'Driver skill more important in 2012'
Former Toro Rosso driver Jaime Alguersuari believes that a lack of technical advantages has resulted in a renewed focus on driver ability.
Thus far this season, there have been six different winners in the six completed races, a far cry from the dominance exhibited by Sebastian Vettel last year.
Alguersuari, who is now working as a television pundit, feels that the lack of a technical gimmick that has given one - or a couple - of teams a distinct edge means that driver skill has become more important.
"The season has been very close so far this year. There are no technical secrets at the moment as there were in recent years with the double diffuser, the F-duct or the exhaust-blown diffusers," the Spaniard wrote on his column for the BBC.
"The cars came back to reality, in a way, which is why they are much closer in terms of aerodynamic performance.
"There have already been six different winners in six races so far this year, and I expect to see even more than that as the season goes on."
Alguersuari believes that it is this parity between cars that has resulted in Fernando Alonso heading the Drivers' Championship.
"The drivers are more important this year. When everything is so close, the drivers make the difference. That's why you see Fernando Alonso leading the championship," he asserted.
"His car was 1.5 seconds a lap slower than the best in Australia, a second slower in Malaysia and China. It has never been on pole position, and he is leading the championship after six races!
"He hasn't got the best car, but he has shown that at the moment he is the best driver out there."
