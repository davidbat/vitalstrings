Best Formula 1 driver ever
Ranking created by antoine
Of course if you look at the numbers, there is little doubt that Michael Schumacher should be voted best Formula 1 driver ever. He is leading in almost every category: number of World Championships (7), number of Grand Prix won (89 and counting), number of pole positions (70 to date). And yet, some argue that Schumacher never showed the class of Juan Manuel Fangio, who won five World Championships in the fifties. And then there is Ayrton Senna, the Brazilian virtuoso who died in a car crash just when he seemed on his way to shatter all records. So is Michael Schumacher the best after all?
