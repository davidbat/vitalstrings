The Top Ten
1Ayrton Senna
During Senna's time, he was up against many great drivers; prost, piquet, mansell etc. So during his time it was difficult to shine, but he did because he is the BEST! Rest in Peace Senna.
Senna loved it when it rained once he climbed from fifth to first on the first lap. He could also do well in the dry and won three world championships. He gave to lots of Brazilian charities and was loved by everyone everywhere
He only had one speed, fast. Seriously, he was a driven racer with a complete feel of the car and track, it was basically instinctive for him to feel the limits of what the car was doing.

2Michael Schumacher
Schumacher has shown over the years, that he is a brilliant driver with great talent and skill - proven by his constant wins. He beats both Senna and Clark hands down.
Michael Schumacher is clearly the best F1 driver ever
He's won so much! Can't argue with it

3Jim Clark
1. Won Indianapollis 500 and World title in same year - only man to do so.
2. Win percentage of 34% (25 wins from 72 starts) - Senna by contrast is only 25% (41 wins from 162 starts) Pole percentage of 45% (33/72) to Senna's 40% (61/162) and Fastest Laps 39% (28/72) to Senna's 11% (19/162)
4Juan Manuel Fangio
5Niki Lauda
6Fernando Alonso
A great driver. Still has a long time to win even more. He's 5th on wins list. He needs to be ranked among the greats. He also beat schumacher in head to head in 2006.
7Jack Brabham
8Nelson Piquet
I TOTALLY AGREE. iF PEOPLE TAKE THE TIME AND TAKE AN UNBIASED VIEW, THEY WILL TRULY APPRECIATE PIQUETS CAREER. TITLES, THREE DIFFERENT ENGINES, COSWORTH, BMW, HONDA. WINS ON 3 MAKES OF TYRES. IN 85 AND 91 ONLY DRIVER WHO COULD DELIVER ON PIRELLIS. BRABHAM WAS ONLY CAUSE OF PIQUET.
HIS TITLES WERE ALMOST IN 3 DIFFERENT ERAS, IN 81 BEAT. JONES, REUTEMANN, ANDRETTI, VILLEUNEVE AND PIRONI. 83 NEXT GROUP OF TOP MEN, PROST, ROSBERG, LAUDA. 87 BEAT, MANSELL, SENNA AND PROST, THE BEST GROUP OF ALL TIME.
BESIDES THE RESULTS WERE ABSOLUTE TOP 5 OF ALL TIME, HE LIVED LIFE THE WAY A SUCCESFULL SPORTSMEN SHOULD. ALWAYS JOKING AND PLEASANT FOR ALL THOSE AROUND HIM. ONLY IN 86 AND 87 WHEN MANSELL A REAL A HOLE WAS HIS TEAMMATE DID NELSON MOUTH OF ABOUT MANSELL ONLY. LETS NOT FORGET NIGEL, GOT EVERYONES BACK UP. SHOW ME ONE NEGATIVE THING PIQUET EVER SAID ABOUT GREAT CHAMPIONS SUCH AS FANGIO, STEWART, LAUDA, PROST SCHUMI OR ANY OF THE SPORTS BOSSES, ECCLESTONE, BALESTRE ETC.
NELSON ONLY GETS A BAD RAP, BECAUSE OF THE BRITISH JOURNALISTS. IT STARTED BEFORE NELSON EVEN GOT INTO F1, WHEN HE WAS THRASHING DEREK WARWICK( A BRIT
PIQUETS TECHNICAL ABILITY IS UNQUESTIONED. HE DEVELOPED TYRE WARMERS IN F1(WERES THE CREDIT FOR THAT? ) HE WAS PART OF THE REASON FUEL STOPS WERE INTRODUCED INTO F1 IN 82.
AS FOR COURAGE, HE SHATTERS HIS LEGS AT INDY IN 92, COMES BACK A YEAR LATER AND RACES SO HE CAN COMPLETE WHAT HE STARTED. WERE IS THE CREDIT FOR THAT.
iN MY OPINION NELSON WAS AS GOOD AS ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF F1, HE JUST DIDNT PLAY FOR THE CAMERAS AND CALCULATE HIS EVERY MOVE TO GET AHEAD LIKE SENNA OR SCHUMI DID.
HE WAS THE ULTIMATE F1 HERO IN MY EYES.
Never acted like a big shot, was truly the last driver who exemplified the stereotypical idea of how one sees a racing driver.
Won two titles with the small, almost private team Brabham against all the factory teams. Won races on 3x different makes of tires (Pirelli, Goodyear and Michellin. Won races during 10 different seasons. A top driver allround.

9Alain Prost
The most strategic F1 driver of all time. That's why he's slightly (only slightly, but nevertheless) better than Senna. Sadly, in business he wasn't so strategic.
10Nigel Mansell
