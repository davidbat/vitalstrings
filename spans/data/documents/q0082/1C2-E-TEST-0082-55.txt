Scottish Formula 1 Drivers, David Coulthard - Rick Dikeman
David Coulthard, Allan McNish and Paul Di Resta are the most recent Scottish F1 Grand Prix drivers.
Apart from Jim Crawford’s brief flirtation with F1 in 1975 and Johnny Dumfries’s solitary Grand Prix season in 1986 there hadn’t been a Scottish Formula 1 driver since Jackie Stewart won his third title in 1973. David Coulthard became the next Scottish F1 during the 1994 season.

David Coulthard graduated to a Formula 1 race seat in tragic circumstances. Williams had signed triple F1 champion Ayrton Senna to race alongside Damon Hill in 1994, but the partnership lasted just three races. While leading the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola Senna’s Williams left the track on a flat-out left hand curve called Tamburello, struck a concrete wall and inflicted fatal injuries on the great Brazilian.
Coulthard was the Williams test driver and found himself promoted to replace Senna, an unenviable task. Nevertheless he acquitted himself well and stayed with Williams for 1995, scoring his first Grand Prix victory that season. For 1996 Coulthard moved to McLaren, where he remained for several seasons. A consistent points finisher, Coulthard also racked up 13 wins during his career but was outperformed by his McLaren teammate Mika Hakkinen and never became champion.
Coulthard’s final seasons in Formula 1 were with Red Bull. Following his retirement from racing he has forged a second career in the sport as a presenter for BBC Television’s Formula 1 coverage. Coulthard lives in Monaco and is also a successful businessman.
