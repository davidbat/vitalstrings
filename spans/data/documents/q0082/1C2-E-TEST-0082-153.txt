well i dont usually like saying i told you so but the smart ass that asked my tips for the weekend race
pretty sure i said hamilton or alonso
mind you everyone will say hamilton didnt deserve it because vettel and alonso's tyres were going off so ill answer that now saves you all posting it
wether they pitted for new boots or wether they didnt hamilton would of run away with the race either way you look at it
gotta mention perez and grojsean aswell exceptional drives from the pair of them
curt {Ed001's Note - exciting finish wasn't it? Where did Alonso finish in the end, can anyone remember?}

Yer i started fallin asleep at the beginning of the race then heard them getting a bit happy and it woke me up lol
erm i believe it was hamilton, grojsean, perez, vettel, alonso and i do believe mark i think it was finished right up alonsos rear end another lap he would of nicked the spot
curt {Ed001's Note - it was a bit of an up and down race, bit boring, then a little excitement, back to boredom, then exciting. They didn't get the DRS right for it, it was too difficult to pass.}

Yer mate spot on
cant remember who it was but there drs opened and didnt even get near the car infront
curt {Ed001's Note - the Renaults seemed to be able to just drive away from the Saubers, even with the DRS wide open on the Sauber. I noticed Kobayashi was losing ground on Raikkonen down the straights every lap. Strange that they got it so wrong, they seem to have this desire to make huge changes each time, instead of just tweaking it slightly, until they get it right.}

I know and considering they have 3 practice sessions you think they would be prepared for it
i dont understand drs theres a few tracks its not worth havin it on
the only car it seems to work nicely on is mclaren
curt {Ed001's Note - they keep saying the Mercedes has the best system, but I have yet to see any evidence of it, it never seems to help them out.}

Yer i dont understand mercedes there supposed to have amazing cars all the time it comes to the race and a flop
curt {Ed001's Note - and Schumacher has so much bad luck it is unreal.}

Yer people slating him saying he shouldnt of returned but alot of it really isnt him, its just wierd how rosbergs car never really goes wrong
to be honest if hamiltons pit crew werent on valium i think he would be much further out infront than just the 2 points
curt {Ed001's Note - it's amazing how those two seem to have been dogged by all the difficulties in the teams they drive for. Rosberg seems to have a bullet proof car and Button doesn't seem to have many problems either. Well other than being unable to get to grips with the new car. Strange how a driver normally so adept at keeping tires in good nick, is struggling so much now looking after tires is a major priority!}
(0)
Yer lets deffinately something strange with hamilton and schumi's cars compared to there team mates
its also strange how the pit crew mess up with hamilton but not button
curt {Ed001's Note - that is the weirdest thing, especially as Hamilton is their best shot at winning the title. So it can't be deliberate, maybe they are just trying too hard?}
(0)
Well you would imagine its not deliberate
can understand hamilton getting annoyed with mclaren couldnt see him leaving them though
if the pit crew pull themselves together hamilton will do the buisness on the track i believe
i myself am a huge fan of hamilton im glad hes back with nicole he went downhill when they split. WOMEN
good to see hes back to his old self though
another thing that annoyed me last season was this buisness with massa them 2 crashing in multiple races but lewis would get the blame for it when i think maybe one incident was his thought

Fault**
curt {Ed001's Note - there is a definite dislike of Hamilton, he was getting penalised much more harshly than other drivers do.}

Schumacher thought the DRS was so short he tried to keep his open ;). I thought it was a very good race, as good as this season although if the DRS was the same as last year I would say it would have been too long. Maybe move the detection to before the hairpin then have it activated sooner on the straight? Hamilton driving like that has to show that he has changed how he drives. He has showed a much more mature person this year.
Welsh Dragon  {Ed001's Note - I just wonder why they removed the other one? One to get closer and the other to overtake, if you have short ones.}
(0)
Lol well we all know schumi doesnt always like a fair race lol
hamilton would be like vettel was last year if his pit crew didnt mess up
curt

Probably felt it was too easy. Its always a difficult one and there will always be people arguing either way. I think they should go for the one that would give the most amount of overtaking in this sort of situation.
Welsh Dragon {Ed001's Note - I just thought they found it a bit too easy last year, so shorten one a bit. No need to make a major change just yet, it was brilliant last year, so why mess about with it quite so much?}

Enjoyed the race really thought SFI had it in the 1st round of stops but that back fired badly. thought hamilton had a great race & fair play to alonso think if vettel never pitted then he would have got more points than him which alonso seems to be good at,doesnt need to win the race just needs enough points to keep him in with a shout.
2nd & 3rd place were good drives too. the thing with grojsean is hes a coin toss. one race hes good the next hes crashing or doing daft things.
tbh im just gald vettel isnt running away with it,dont mind if he wins races just hated last year after lap 15 hes away by a mile.
button/hamiton - button i like was just wanting more 'tyre time' with the SS. couldnt understand the amount of pit stops so just took it as a school day really. think when it comes to hamilton its just they try too hard. we all do it work/football/golf etc etc you make a few mistakes & then you try & perfect everything & you usually mess something up.
i wonder when the pack will start to open up more right now im still not sure who will win it but to me alonso could steal it.
still along way to go but overall 7 races 7 different winners.... and people ask me all the time whats the big deal with f1 its just cars going round & round...so is football 22 guys kicking a ball round for an hour & a half lol

ps good to see this page flowing again !

My moneys on hamilton this year personally he looks fresh his pit crew like you say just need to concentrate a bit and dont panic in the pit stops (like they do with button hes stops are fine)

Not much to disagree with there from everyone.
I myself felt a wee bitty sorry for Di Resta, seemed his options just went off 6-7 laps quicker than everyone else. Either that or he didnt take the risk that they would come back to him again as a few folk started to struggle around the 12th lap or so on them. Such ashame as he could have got himself a good points haul yesterday.
HAmilton was solid. He put the foot down when he needed too and i think ferrari let mclaren off the hook a little by not pitting alonso at the same time, same for red bull. Wouldve been an even better finish if all 3 had fresh tyres at the end.
Anyways canada doesnt disappoint yet again... next up valancia? (if thats right) oh bloody joy!!

Give di resta i better car i really feel he could produce something and maybe even win the championship atleast once i like his driving style
curt {Ed023's Note - Apparently Mercedes are interested in him, very good driver}
(0)

That would be interesting if he goes there really think he could do something at mercedes put schumi back in a ferrari
curt {Ed001's Note - Di Resta has worked with Mercedes for years, he was their number one DTM driver prior to joining Force India, and he was brought in at the behest of Mercedes as part of the engine supply deal.}
(0)
Well lets hope he does get a seat next year he deserves a better car

Im a big di resta fan (more so because im scottish lol) but you have to give credit to young sergio perez think this time next year he could be in a 'better car'
ive only been following f1 the last 2 & half years (when vettel one it 1st time round) so dont really no what kimi was like back in the day but do you think lotus will keep him on next year or move way for someone like perez etc ?
lenny {Ed001's Note - Kimi at his best is incredible, he was the only racer that Schumacher feared at his peak. If he gets back to anything like his best, there is no way they will let him go.}

Gotta agree lenny, Perez deserves a good car aswell and there was a point raised on the F1 coverace about Sauber actually having a very good car but they keep trying to make such sweeping changes to it all the time rather than taking progressive wee steps. If they get their development right he could be in a very very good car next season anyways without moving.
Di resta by the end of this year deserves a competitive car. I think both he and hulkenberg have done a good job with a really middle of the road car this year and agree he has potential in the right situation to be a world champ one day.
bring on the future i say but please can we have some sort of problem meaning valencia gets cancelled!
