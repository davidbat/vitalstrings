Fun:   
The game was released incompleted, packaged just with the basic funcionality for F1 game. SOME flaws:
1) No replays, unless during the race, we can't get a save not even for one lap.
2) No Pace Car and poor managing the accidents events.
3) Pit stops are dummy, we need to press the 4 controler buttons, when it should be done for itself.
4) No race delegates with flags anywhere, not even crossing the line for chess flag, nobody waving a flag there, just a symbol in top of screen, very poor.
5) Running outside the track and eating the sand or grass don't bring much trouble to car speed or performance.
6) Chase right in back of another car don't shows very good air tunnel effect.
7) Multiplayer: US version DON'T allow on-line play with EURO version and vice-versa !?!?
8) Crashed cars (our ours) disapear from track moments after accident or other event that not allows to proceed in race. Big flaw. If we see one accident, in next lap the track is completely CLEAN, not a clue if any accident happen there. (I raced one lap where I saw one car engine blowing in front of me and when I turn I saw it disapear and I got up one position in race, not realistic at all.
9) I tested Logitech Wheel (Driving Force Pro) with it, no Force Feedback at all.
...and many others flaws, not to forget its based on 2006 championship, not allowing us to update/customize drivers or team names.
...BUT, the game is the best F1 game ever, provides lots of fun and is addictive, mainly because PS3 power provides it, visualy and speed almost make us forget the flaws. This game need to return to dev time and should came a new version as UPGRADE for F1 owners, as its really incomplete.
My 4 starts goes mainly for the addictive fun we can get from it. Gameplay = good but imperfect, Simulation = far form reality.
We can just hope the 2007 version with all the flaws fixed and some extra bonus for all people who got this dated 2006 version.
