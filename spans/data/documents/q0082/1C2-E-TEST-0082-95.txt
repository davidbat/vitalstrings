Who was the lst driver to win a world championship in a front-engined car? Mike Hawthorn --Motorsport News; --;The claim of being the complete book of F1 is true --Daily Echo (Bournmeouth), November 2008--Every once in a while something special turns up in the MN office, and the newly-released updated version of the Complete Book of Formula One by Simon Aaron and Mark Hughes is just such a gem. Aaron is, of course, MN's editor-at-large and resident Ralf Schumaker fan, but we're not saying this is good just to keep him happy: it really is. The book contains information and photographs of every car and every driver to ever grace the sport, from the age of Lewis Hamilton going right back to the days when they thought an upturned pudding bowl to be adequate cranial protection. The concise page layout makes the book ideal reference material, breaking every season down into bite-sized chunks and enabeling you to flick throguh an entire decade in one sitting without breaking a sweat. It's all good stuff, well written as well. Some may think the price a bit steep, but well worth it for such a wealth of information. Possibly the most enjoyable feature is the car-by-car breakdown following each brief season review, where you can settle those late-night pub arguments over how many World Championship points eugenio Castellotti scored with his Lancia-Ferrari in 1956. --Motorsport News;worth a look...and a gift-wrapping --Road and Track; Quite simply, this is the best motoring book I have ever read! it has 490-pages and over 4,000 photographs showing almost every car and driver that has taken part in Formula One racing form 1950 up to the present time. It's title The Complete Book of Formula one, is competely true and you can buy this with confidence. --Daily Express;Formual One nover fails to divide motoring enthusiasts - and this book is an essential reference for any F1 fan --Vintage Roadscene
This large format book, printed on high-quality glossy paper, sets out to provide a phootgraphic record of every car/driver cmbination that has taken part in an F1 World Championship Grand Prix from 1950 to 2008. Clearly the result of an intensive amount of research and tracking down of elusive photos, the book draws heavily on the well known lAT archive. The format couldn't be simpler. there is a chapter for each year, which begins with a few pages summarizing the season accompanied by several relevant large photos of the world cahmpon and any other significant subjects. This is followed by a number of pages full of thumbnail phoots of each car/driver combination that appeared during the year along with details of the events attended. One thing you ntoice quite quickly, flicking throught the pages is the sheer variety of cars and drivers that appeared in Grand Prix; ofetn with local drivers turning out for their national event or enterprising engineers chnacing their luck with some unusual machinery. Untill about the mid 90s that is whe it was deemed necassery that only a limited number of accredited teams should be permitted in F1 and that driver changes should be strictly constrained. Probably the only disappointment of this book is that the thumbnails are quite small and one often wishes to see a full size image. however, this is a large and heavy book alreadt and to make the photos larger would have resulted in a far more expensive multi-volume production. So, all in all an excellent addition to any F1 enthusiast's collection. --Speedscene, July, 2009
