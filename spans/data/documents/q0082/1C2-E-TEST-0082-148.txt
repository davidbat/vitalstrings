Baron Emmanuel 'Toulo' de Graffenried
1950s Baron Emmanuel 'Toulo' de Graffenried helmet.    Toulo began his racing career in 1936, driving his own Maserati    voiturette. He won the 1949 British Grand Prix in a Maserati 4CLT/48, a    year before the FIA World Championship began. In 1951 he drove the Alfa    Romeo 159. He continued to drive in occasional races over the next six    years, with his best finish being 4th place at the 1953 Belgian GP.    Following his retirement from racing, de Graffenried earned his keep    operating his car dealership in Lausanne, selling Alfa Romeo,    Rolls-Royce & Ferrari automobiles. He also acted as stunt double for    Kirk Douglas during the filming of 'The Racers'. The b/w picture shows    the Baron in a Maserati A6GCM at Silverstone during an F2 race, bearing    the very same vintage Swiss Coat of Arms as used on his helmet. This    hard shell Geno helmet with leather ear and chin straps was made in    France. It is accompanied by a signed 1/16 scale model of the Maserati    250F - similar to the car he drove in 1955 & 1956. It is unclear if he    added this sticker on at a later date, but the helmet shows wonderful    patina.
