Formula One Drivers' Helmets?
Don't you think they have got really boring and similar? I remember you used to be able to tell a driver by his helmet... and there were some classic designs...
Damon Hill - used his father's design, London Rowing Club, iconic image
Nelson Piquet - original and unique to him with the teardrop..
Ayrton Senna - he chose his yellow helmet to reflect his Brazilian nationality, and to warn drivers when they looked in their mirrors that Senna was coming!
Rubens Barrichello - bright and unmistakeably him
David Coulthard - brilliant take on the Scottish flag
Now they are just boring, especially Kovalainen and Raikkonen, who seemed to chose their latest ones on how well it merges into the car... if they both drove for the same team you would not tell them apart!! I like Nelson Piquet Jr's because its based on his dads, as is Nakajima's, I like Lewis modelling his on Senna's too.. but mostly they are fairly unremarkable
