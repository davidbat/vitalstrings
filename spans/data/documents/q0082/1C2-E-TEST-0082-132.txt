The top drivers make upwards of £20 million a year.  But a rookie who has just started will probably be making £100k or £200k a year.
A few years ago, many weaker drivers paid for their drives, paying £10m or so for a years driving, because the team needed sponsorship money.  Nowadays though, drivers are chosen on skill because of the increased wealth of teams.
