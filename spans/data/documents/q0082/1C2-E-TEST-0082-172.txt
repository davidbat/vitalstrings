Maldanado Wins the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix -  Race Report and Results
Written by Nishant Raj
The curtain has fallen down on the Spanish Grand Prix and it is the young Venezuelan Pastor Maldanado who has come on top of it.Initially the race was led by Fernando Alonso but during second round of pitstops the williams team brought pastor in before Fernando.While Pastor was busy setting hot laps after his second pitstop Fernando Alonso struggled to cope with the backmarkers and this meant that when the Ferrari driver made his second pitstop he handed over the lead to Pastor Maldanado.From then on there was no looking back by the young venezuelan though Fernado Alonso put on a brave show and challenged Pastor till the finish line.At a point of time after both of the drivers had completed their third pitstops it looked like Fernando would pass Pastor easily and run away but that was not to be so as the williams driver kept his cool and drove brilliantly defending the two times world champion as well as conserving his tyres.
The top two were followed up by the lotus duo of Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean.Kimi had a lonely race as he was too far to fight with the top two.Romain Grosjean was involved in number of battles during the race, even colliding with Bruno Senna at a point of time but didn't suffer any major damage.
Bruno wasn't that lucky as he ended up  parking his williams after getting hit by the seven times world champion Michael Schumacher.The German was not happy with the Williams driver and called him an idiot over the team radio after the incident.Both of them are under investigation by the stewards.
Sauber team had good and a bad day with Kamui Kobayashi finshing the race in solid fifth position while Sergio Perez retired with wheel nut problems after his pitstop.Kamui was followed up by Sebastian Vettel who had a topsy turvy race after inccurring a penalty for not slowing down during the yellow flag period.The Two times world champion put on a brave show after that fighting his way up to sixth position.The German was followed by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg who struggled with tyre problems at the end of the race.He was followed up by  the Mclaren Duo of Lewis hamilton and jenson Button in 8th and 9th places respectively.Hamilton fought his way up from 24th place on the grid after being disqualified from qualifying while Jenson Button struggled with balance of his Mclaren and ended up in a dismal 9th place.
Rounding of the top 10 was the Force India Driver Nico Hulkenberg who had to defend hard against the Red bull of Mark Webber.Webber had been running strongly during early stages of the race but suffered a issue with his front wing which meant he had to come into the pits for unscheduled wing change.This cost the Red bull driver a lot of time and potential points.Mark Webber was followed by the Toro Rosso duo of Jean Eric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo.Felipe Massa's problems continued as he finished in 15th place after incurring a drive through penalty for not slowing down during the yellow flag period. But he couldn't keep up with pace of Sebastian Vettel with whom he had been battling for most of the race.
16th and 17th places were taken up by the usual back markers Heikki Kovalinen and Vitaly Petrov.They were followed by the Marussia of Timo Glock and HRT of Pedro De La Rosa. Charles pic and Narain Karthikeyan suffered mechanical problems and didn't finish the race.

Ferrari’s struggle continues
Written by Nishant Raj
Fernando Alonso topped the first practice session in Barcelona but the  Second Practice showed the true picture about how the pecking order  would be for this Sunday’s race. Felipe Massa ended the day 11th fastest  while Fernando Alonso was only 14th fastest.
Fernando Alonso is still optimistic about Ferrari’s chances as the  updates they brought in Mugello and the updates in Barcelona seemed to  be working in a positive way. The overall handling of the Scuderia has  improved but in F1 Development and updates never stop. As a result  though Ferrari have improved their car they are still in the same place  as they have been in terms of pace. This is because all the other teams  have also brought major upgrades to Barcelona. The positive thing at the  end of the day for Ferrari was that the data gathered in both practice  sessions was in accordance with the data gathered in the wind tunnel  tests. This confirms that the team is moving forward and in a positive  direction.
Both the Ferrari drivers experimented with various configurations in the  morning session. In the afternoon they mainly focused on the set-up and  tyre behaviour. But the team were unable to compare the data gathered  in practice sessions with the data gathered during pre-season testing  and conditions were widely contrasting. The track temperature was around  44 degree celcius which means that tyre wear is going to be a big  challenge during the race.
So though Ferrari have improved their car they still look to qualify and  finish the race in same position like in previous races.

Nico Rosberg creates history by winning Chinese Grand Prix 2012 : Report and Results
Nico Rosberg did an incredible job by winning his first ever Grand Prix. Nico Rosberg crossed the line and punched the air. That was some drive by the Mercedes driver who has absolutely dominated this race. Based on that performance, it's difficult to understand why this is his first win in 111 races.
Mercedes boss Ross Brawn fights back the emotion as he tells his charge: "Brilliant race Nico, just Brilliant." Nico Rosberg replies: "Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees, thank you Ross." Prepare for some emotional scenes in parc ferme, folks.
Mercedes team bossRoss Brawn: "It was stunning, we still had the fear with the tyres but he used them perfectly. It's just a tragedy that we had the problem with Michael [Schumacher] because he would have been in great shape too. We have started a new adventure, I have been lucky to have a lot of special days and this is certainly a special one."
Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg, race winner: "It's an unbelievable feeling. I'm very happy, very excited. It has been a long time coming for me and team after two years and a bit. We are finally there. It's nice to see how quickly we are progressing. We didn't expect to be that fast today but I'm very happy with the pace.
McLaren driver Jenson Button, who finished second: "Before that our race pace was good, I had some really good battles out there. It was a pity because when I exited the pits I had four cars in front of me who I wouldn't have been up against. If that didn't happen, I would have had a clear run on Nico. All in all though, it was a fun day, I really enjoyed it out there."
McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, who came third: "We knew Nico would be really quick, and we knew if he got away it would be hard to catch him as it proved. First pole and first win is always special so congratulations. I'm happy to be on the podium after starting seventh, the strategy was good - it was one of the best races of the season. There was a trail of cars behind me at the end, but overall it was a fantastic day."
McLaren duo Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton completed the podium, ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel.
Kimi Raikkonen's two-stopping Lotus held second going into the closing stages, but trying to do half the race on his third set of tyres proved too optimistic, and he tumbled from second to 14th in just a handful of laps.
Vettel, following a similar strategy, was first to pass Raikkonen, and looked like he might salvage second from his qualifying disaster. He could not hold off the McLarens or Webber with their fresher tyres from a three-stop strategy, with Button getting through five laps from the end and Hamilton and Webber doing likewise amid a thrilling tussle over the last two laps.

Alonso wins a rain hit Malaysian Grand Prix 2012 in style : Report and Results
You cannot write a script better than this. Fernando Alonso with his Ferrari has won Malaysian Grand Prix 2012. No one including Ferrari had dreamt of a win this early in F1 2012 season. A sterling drive from the Spaniard, finding strong wet-weather pace in the troublesome F2012 to score a much needed boost for the team. There were tears all round at Ferrari as they embrace each other on a quite remarkable victory. The team radio Fernando Alonso saying: "This is one of the most beautiful races."
Perez comes home a remarkable second after an incredible drive, but it could have been more after he was with Alonso in the closing stages. This has out-scored his total points gained in 2011 in just one race here, for his first podium. The Mexican collected 14 points last season with his best result being eighth in Japan. It's also the first time a Mexican has made it onto the podium in 41 years.
Hamilton struggled to match the pace of the Ferrari-powered pair ahead but brings home a third place finish for McLaren.  It's fourth for Webber in the Red Bull, with Rakkonen fast throughout the race and taking fifth place for Lotus.
It was again a disappointing day at office for Mercedes', with Schumacher only able to get back up to 10th after the first-lap clash and an additional tyre stop leaving Nico Rosberg 14th.

Jenson Button wins Australian Grand Prix 2012 : Results and Report
Jenson Button punches the air as he secures his 13th career victory. "It shows what a winter does," he says on the team radio, "the car is beautiful and she's quick. What a way to start the season."
A great start from the McLaren man put him into the lead at the first corner and he brings it home in a typically controlled performance. 
BBC F1 co-commentator David Coulthard "Lewis Hamilton is not able to use his tyres as well as Jenson Button. We could see him snaking around at Turn Three. Is he at the point of burning out these tyres?"
Vettel grabs second for Red Bull, splitting the McLaren pair thanks to some strong pace and good fortune at the safety car. 
Hamilton holds off Webber at the flag, with the Australian taking his best home finish after a battle back from a scrappy first lap. 
Alonso salvages fifth for Ferrari ahead of Kobayashi after the exit of Maldonado on the final tour. 
Raikkonen ended up seventh after cutting through the final lap carnage. 
Rosberg was clearly struggling with some problem on the last lap as that battle got hairy and trailed over the line in 12th, 17 seconds behind that group.
