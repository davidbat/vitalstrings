Hamilton is not similar to Senna in any way. Hamilton is definately not the best driver. Seeing how Alonso's leading the championship with a dog of a car, I guess he is the best at nothing other than being the most adaptive driver in the last 10 years of the sport. Button won his title with Bridgestones, so I don't really know where you were going with that. You say Vettel's success was due to Newey? I guess you mean Nigelï»¿ Mansell, Alain Prost and Mika Hakkinen didn't deserve their titles too?
