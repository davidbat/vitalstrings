No fatal accidents there.
Contrary to what some people are saying there are no fatal accidents in this sequence. I have been a big F1 fan since the early 80s and recognise all but 1 of those accidents. In fact the worst injury sustained in any of those accidents is a broken leg.
The person who claimed Senna's fatal accident is in the sequence is probably confused with Nelson Piquet's accident at the same spot in practice for the 1987 San Marino GP. The two accidents do look similar but Piquet only sustained minor injuries.
