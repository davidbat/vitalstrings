Arguably faster than any other driver of his era, as his 41 grand prix wins and three world titles proved, Senna also had a ruthless streak like no other.
Prior to his death at Imola in 1994, his incredible skill was showcased with some sensational wins, like his record six at Monaco and the famous displays of wet weather virtuosity at Estoril and Donington Park.
He will be remembered as much for his colliding with arch-rival Alain Prost - a man with whom he shared a mutual contempt after a McLaren team orders argument at Imola in '89 - at Suzuka title deciders in two successive years as for anything else.
He was a man who simply had so much self-belief that he could not fathom the idea of being beaten. It was the key to his greatness and his biggest flaw. Genius or thug? The debate will run and run. Not so the argument about his claim to be the greatest.
