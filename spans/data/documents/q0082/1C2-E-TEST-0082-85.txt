Fernando Alonso has been labelled as the Formula 1 driver with the most by Spanish publication El Mundo and Business Book GP, which claim that the Ferrari man is receiving an annual salary in the region of 30 million euros (24.5 million pounds), excluding advertising revenue.
Alonso’s estimated salary is nearly double that of Hamilton
Having picked up double world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, Alonso made the switch to Ferrari by replacing Kimi Räikkönen following tough campaigns with McLaren in 2007 and Renault for the following two years.
However, with the Finn having been the sport’s previous highest earner, Alonso is now believed to be enjoying almost double that of next man Lewis Hamilton, who signed a 20 million pound-per-annum, 5-year deal with McLaren prior to 2008.
On 14 million, other Ferrari driver Felipe Massa is fourth-highest ahead of second McLaren pilot and reigning World Champion Jenson Button.
Also on the list of 26 is Räikkönen, who is still being paid by Ferrari and indeed makes the top three following the team’s premature termination of his contract.
