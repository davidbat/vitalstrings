F1 Clip
I'm 17, i've been watching NASCAR, F1, IRL, CART (or champ w/e), ALMS, sedan racing, basically anything since I was around 6 or 7. I have never seen such fantastic racing in my life. The thing that makes this clip so great is it features Gilles, and the fact that Gilles and Arnoux trade the lead back and forth. At the very instant it seems like one of them has the lead fairly secured, the other takes it from them. The current state of F1 is S**t , the racing boring because the trailing car can not follow closely enough for an extended period of time like in this clip because of over heating issues, and because of the rules which try to artificially create good racing. The field is also much smaller, which reduces the amount of passes per race. Then again, nothing is as great as a F1 standing start. NASCAR is terrible compared to this. period
