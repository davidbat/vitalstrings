There was always the feeling that Jim Clark could drive a milk float and make  it fly around a grand-prix track. Adept in saloon cars and sports cars,  he was the yardstick by which every driver wanted to measure themselves  in Formula One. There was nothing he could not do at the wheel of a  Formula One car and his marriage with Lotus was made in grand-prix  heaven. The shy son of a Scottish border farmer had little to say for  himself and would have been out of place in todayâ€˜s publicity-hungry  environment, ruled by sponsors flinging around money and demanding the  attention of the drivers they backed. Clark was a gentleman amateur who  drove simply because he loved driving. And he was sublime at the wheel,  his touch and feel for his car and the circuit without peer. He could  administer a trouncing that would leave his rivals in admiration, no  more so than at the extraordinary Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium.  In the 1960s, the circuit was more than eight miles long, winding  through the dense forests of the Ardennes, with its quixotic  micro-climate, which struck on race day for the Belgian Grand Prix in  1963. Clark drove through the pouring rain to lap the entire field,  which effectively put him eight miles in front of his nearest  challenger. Clark was also impressively accident-free, registering only  three crashes in eight Formula One seasons, which only underlines the  paradox of his death.
