Formula One Driving School: Roadway Safety
We                           believe that a good driver, know how to be a safe driver and that                           begins with Road Awareness.  From preparing the drivers to be                           aware of roadway movement, to possible unexpected events, we train                           drivers to be prepared for those unexpected events: deer leaping onto                           the roadway, semi-truck movement, bolting children or bicyclists,                           sharing the roadway with oversized vehicles, rain hydroplaining,                           navigating mountainess snow & icy conditions,...more.  There a                           hundreds of unexpected events that a driver must face.  Our                           patient instructors build confidence in users while promoting roadway                           awareness and safety.
Formula One Driving School: Affordably and Effective
How                       can F1DS beat competitors' prices?  Simple.  Instead of                       using large horsepowered expensive cars, we use cars                       that have high ratings for safety and reliability. Our late model cars reflect what typical drivers                       use.  Our car fleet, and quality instructors with proven                       track records of drivers demonstrating safety at the wheel under our                       tutelage, has resulted in lower operating costs.  This means where                       we save, you save.
