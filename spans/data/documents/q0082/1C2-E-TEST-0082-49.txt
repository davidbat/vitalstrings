The Top Ten
1Michael Schumacher
“"Senna would not have stood a chance with Schumi... best driver ever"... no arguement needed... RIP Mr. Senna...

“Many forget he won races when Senna was alive.
“Michael Schumacher has always been my only greatest driver ever in F1
2Senna
Reasons he's the best:
*Competed with legends like Prost, Piquet, Mansel, Lauda, and Shumacher. Not to include other great champions like Hil, Hakkinen and Rosberg.
*Pole Position master;
*Performed great under pressure and in bad conditions.
This guy would cast a shadow on Shumi if he was still alive.
Peace be with you Senna.
Senna performed in under performing cars. Schumacher always had the most dominant car underneath him. Senna is King!
