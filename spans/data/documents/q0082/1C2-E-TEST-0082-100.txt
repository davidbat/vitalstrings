The End of the Line
A story based on fact in the dark days  of grand apartheid, but with the rich  promise and hope that a new South Africa  can bring.
"THE END OF THE LINE could be described as a "faction", a fiction with a serious factual grounding. It is simple, and therefore moving. It gives yet another highly individual portrait of that troubled land, and it does so through a believable and sustained narrative form."
In THE END OF THE LINE, Craig Lock has created a passionate tale of South Africa, a story of the bad old days, but with the hope of the new.  Everything in this book could have happened.  Perhaps it did...

Angolan Dawn
This is a story based on Faction: Fiction based on Fact. The people are true though the events surrounding them may be made up. A family struggles to survive through the bitter war torn strife of Angola. A father makes the decision to travel far from home to work in the gold mines of South Africa only to have a terrible accident occur which leaves him unable to return home.
The story continues with his son who then grows up trying to understand his father's abandonment, his country's political strife, and man's own wicked tendencies to hurt others.
This is a story based on Faction: Fiction based on Fact. The people are true though the events surrounding them may be made up. There are many facts (horrible, sad but true) about the gold mines of South Africa and the terrible devastation of the land mines left in the fields from the war.
ANGOLAN DAWN
"In most respects, this is an individual and innovative piece, with considerable character. It is conventional only in so far as the author has takenpains to structure this work in accordance with the dramatic necessities of pace, exposition and denouement. It is all the stronger for having what I would call a 'classic' plot: one which has guts to it, which takes its readers on a clear and well-defined journey from A to B and leaves us feeling like we have truly experienced something at the end of it. Not that there is anything at all 'obvious' about the manner in which the tale unfolds. Far from it- the world of the novel, though a fictional creation of some substance, is as unpredictable and enigmatic as reality.
The essential realism carries over into the body of the text itself. The  writing is packed with the products of real experience; little insights and observations combine with the fictional material to give the work a powerful relevance to its readers. Essential 'scene-setting' details and other information are not relayed in huge indigestible chunks, but are instead woven carefully into the fabric of the plot itself. The dialogue is particularly well handled: sharp and convincing. The total result of these factors working together is what the papers might call 'a thumping good read'!
The written style is excellent, perfectly suited to the tale the author has to tell. Without seeming at all self-conscious, this author has found a voice in which he writes with fluency and confidence. The book is written in an engaging and convincing manner, with an appealing quality of direct communication.
In short, this is a stylish and well-structured piece of work, a compelling tale, which deserves to do well in the marketplace."
 
OUR TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE YEARS    DOWN UNDER IN NEW     ZEALAND (KIWILAND)...AND I'M STILL  DAMN    WELL HERE TEN YEARS LATER!
... and                      LOVING it even more.
A South African's and "exile Kiwi's"            light-hearted look at life in laid-back,  provincial New Zealand.. Eventually life in "Sleepy Hollow"  became so quiet that we decided to write  a book about it...  although there were one or two adventures from time to time.                   A new immigrant family's view of rural 'Godzone'  and culture shock after     rriving from a large city in South Africa to start a new lifestyle ...  with a  rather drastic change of pace on the other side of the world.
Now six years later,  I take it all for granted...   and appreciate it even more.                                                     *
"Nothing much happens over there. The headline in a major capital city was           'golf-ball thrown at police constable'."
- comments by British entertainer Julian Cleary on a recent visit to                   “Godzone”.         And that's in a "metropolis". Just wait till he gets to "Sleepy Hollow" and sees the "local rag" in “Sleepy Hollow”!
"Dropped out in Godzone": Craig Lock's humorous travel book about his adventures in provincial New Zealand...
One man and his family - and their experiences "Down Under".  The author and his wife contrast life in colourful, vibrant South Africa with calm and kindly New Zealand - and with large dashes of humour offer much understanding of, and sympathy with the social attitudes of the two worlds.  A new immigrant's impressions of life in provincial New Zealand (after coming from a large city in South Africa) ... and there were one or two rather funny adventures,  nay escapades in "Sleepy Hollow" from time to time!
REVIEW:
"DROPPED OUT IN GODZONE is an original and agreeable piece of work. The picture it gives of New Zealand- to one who has never been there- has a ring of complete authenticity. The feeling of the country is relaxed, and perhaps rather unstimulating, but we get an overall impression from the writer that he views his time there with some affection, and above all with tolerance."  This book breathes a natural humour and kindliness, which is what gives it the individual character that is so appealing.  Autobiography has a particular value as a literary form. It is a shared kind of writing and I'll continue to bang the drum. It is unusual to encounter two such different manuscripts from the same author. Both  (THE END OF THE LINE is the other book) have quality and share an easy and assured writing style that is a pleasure to read.  Both of these short books are of first rate quality."
 
Endless Possibilities
The central theme of this new work by Craig Lock is the "great thought"... that somewhere, somehow in the future there are endless possibilities. The ideal, the vision, the dream is to usher in a new age to bring peace to a world "hell-bent" on destruction.  This "story" can be read at different levels from the personal, to a national, interenational or "spiritual" perspective ("go as deep as you want").

Here, There and Everywhere
*  HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE:
Craig Lock is an extensive world traveller and failed "professional emigrater" who has spent most of his life's savings on airfares. He is still 'sliding down the razor blade of life', stuck on a deserted (other than a few brilliant rugby players) island at the bottom of the world near Antarctica, where he is 'trying to throw a double six' to get off and go out into the real world - but he doesn't know where!
In the style of Bill Bryson, HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE tells tales of Craig's hilarious hair-raising adventures in his younger years through 'Grate' Britain and the Continent.

Over the Rainbow
A moving tale of the lives of ordinary South Africans today. It also tells the stories of the transition to democracy in the New South Africa, as seen through the eyes of some of the diverse people, who make up this fascinating and vibrant country.

Return of the Chickens' ,
'Return of the Chickens' , a "wacky" look at the 'beloved country' by Craig Lock.  This work is dedicated to all those who "suffered" under the old South Africa - that is ALL South Africans. I hope that we can all learn to laugh at ourselves more in the New democratic South Africa.

Steps to Success, Prosperity and Happiness
A "humorous and "mad" look at                 how to make the most of yourself.                      How to utilize your                                most probably unfulfilled potential                to the fullest...                                   as well as finding the "crazy" bits in you.      The "secrets" by someone who thinks he has now found them - by "throwing a double six", at long last - after many, many years of "sliding down the razor blade of life". Also after having had many detours and come to numerous 'cul-de-sacs' (dead-ends) along the long and windy road that is life. Up hill and down dale, no rather up mountain and       down valley - that is the story of my life.
Written for the ordinary "bloke" or woman           in the street..

THE NEW RAINBOW
A tale of the many people in the   rainbow nation of  New South Africans.
Like Alan Paton, Craig Lock reaches to the heart of the troubled 'Beloved Country'. In his new novel, Lock, perceptively and with an understanding of the historical elements, writes of the situation as it was, as it is, and as perhaps one day it will be, in the New South Africa.
 
To The End of the Rainbow
TO THE END OF THE RAINBOW: An Outline (brief)
Tags: (Key words) books, new books, ‘To The End of the Rainbow‘, ‘The End of the Rainbow’, Craig Lock
FRAMEWORK
I want to engage with the reader (fully) , so that the reader makes CHOICES leading to different paths (please let me or my publisher know which   ones YOU would have made in the circumstances, travelling along the amazing  'journey of life'based on experiences (life).
1. FAMILY HISTORY (Locks, Sudells)
2. THE NEWSPAPER REPORTER
3. F1 (Grand Prix) champ
4. PASTOR/EVANGELIST: REVELATION
5. THE WRITER
" I think Damon Galgut is an impressive writer who writes perceptively about South African issues with an universal perspective."
- anon
And every time c came to a cross-roads in her (or his) "rather eventful" life (and they were many of them, key intersections, life crises and time to make major decisions, choices on what path to follow,  that would have significant impact on the way his life unfolded. So c followed her instinct, gut feeling, the line of least resistance, heart, whatever you may wish to call it. It really was a battle between the mind and the heart... and her heart ALWAYS won!
So c chose the highest path, "the road less travelled".
And so c carried on writing... and here it is!
"The path (the mind) chooses the route you are travelling on; but, most importantly, the heart determines the direction. Just keep moving... one step at a time in the right direction through following your heart.. and one sunny day you'll get there... to the end, the Source of the rainbow."  - "the writer"
PEACE
