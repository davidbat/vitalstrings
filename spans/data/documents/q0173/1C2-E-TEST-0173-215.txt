We know that there are many things right now that we could be recycle. It is nice to know that even an old HP ink jet printer can be used to print an electronic circuits. Thank you with Seyed Bidoki for experimenting this one.

Hey, please forgive me for going slightly off-topic, but would you guys know anything about converting an inkjet printer so that it could be mounted on top of, say, a large sheet of paper and made mobile so that it could be moved around on  that paper and print on it directly (without having the paper go through printer’s roller assembly)I’m thinking of it like a large stamp-like device.
