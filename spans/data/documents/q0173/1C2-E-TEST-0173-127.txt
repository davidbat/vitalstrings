Seiko Electronic Ink Womens Watch
PRESS RELEASE [ via SEIKO / Engadget ]
Last November the 2006 Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Gen√®ve prize for electronic watches was awarded to SEIKO's remarkable Electronic Ink watch, because of its breakthrough display technology. With its ultra-thin profile display, its extraordinary contrast and clarity, and its unrestricted design potential, SEIKO's Electro-phoresis Display watch has captured the imagination of the industry.
For 2007, these unique capabilities have been fused into a delightful bracelet watch for women which is the perfect expression of SEIKO's emotional technology. If the wearer is at work, it can be set to its 'efficiency' mode; the display is informative and easy to read. If, however, the watch is set to its 'mystery' mode, the panel expresses the time in a more imaginative, evocative style. Just pick the style to reflect your mood!
