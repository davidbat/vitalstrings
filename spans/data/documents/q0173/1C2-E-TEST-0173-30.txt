Electronic Ink
Electronic ink combines the look of ink on paper with the dynamic capability of an electronic display. Electronic ink displays are being designed for many applications, including handheld devices, outdoor billboards, and electronic books and newspapers. Ultimately, electronic ink will permit most any surface to become a display, bringing information off of computer screens and into the world around us. New companies such as E Ink and well-known companies such as Xerox are working on products for electronic ink and electronic paper.
