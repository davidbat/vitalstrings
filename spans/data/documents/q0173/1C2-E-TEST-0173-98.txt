This is a great printer for the price.  It did include a toner cartridge when shipped.  I was going broke buying ink for my deskjet, so I wanted to replace it with a laser printer. Now I don't need to worry about the ink drying out!  It is fast and quiet.  I will be setting it up as a wireless printer through my router so it can be accessed from any computer in the house, but haven't done so yet.  It was simple to setup and works great!
