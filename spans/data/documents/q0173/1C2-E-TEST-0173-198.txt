April 17, 2005 Seiko Watch Corporation demonstrated the world's first watch to utilize an electronic paper display for the first time at the Baselworld Watch and Jewelry Show held in Basel, Switzerland. The design incorporates an easy-to-read, ultra-thin, low-power display integrated into a curved band. The unique electronic paper display module in this Seiko watch is the result of a joint development effort, bringing together E Ink's 'electronic ink' technology and Seiko Epson's advanced display manufacturing and electronic circuitry techniques. When combined, these technologies offer a wide range of display design possibilities - including flexibility!
This electronic paper technology enables a new generation of personal devices with the following display benefits:
Ultra High Contrast: The display is made up of pure black and pure white particles which allow the same contrast as found on a printed page; twice the contrast, in fact, of an LCD panel. It can be easily read in either bright sunlight or in dimly lit environments.
Ultra Thin / Flexible: The display is much thinner than is possible with any conventional display technology, analog or digital. The display can also be flexible allowing designs never before achievable.
Low Power Consumption: Since the display is readable under very low light conditions, no backlighting is required. The display also has an inherently stable 'memory effect' that requires no power to maintain an image. For these reasons, battery life can be extended.
Seiko expects to commercialize this 'Future Now' watch in Japan by the spring of 2006. Plans for the international launch are under consideration, along with other design interpretations.
