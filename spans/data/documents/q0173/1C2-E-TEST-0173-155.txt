To commemorate Esquire's 75th Anniversary, we have published an experimental limited-edition of the October 2008 issue that features something called electronic ink, with moving words and flashing images, which you can see in the video above. It is available at some major bookstores and newsstands. To learn more about the E-Ink cover, as well as how to recycle and potentially even hack the issue, we invite you to visit the links below.
