Ink Level Reset Instructions for Canon PG-40, PG-50, CL-41 and CL-51 cartridges
With the cartridge facing the same way that it goes into the machine, but with the electronic strip facing you, do the following:
Cover only the top row of contact pads that you see with tape.
Put the cartridge in the printer, and it will give you a message "Cartridge Not Inserted".
Remove the cartridge from the printer.
Now cover only the top two rows of contact pads with tape.
Put the cartridge in the printer, and it will again give you a message "Cartridge Not Inserted".
Remove the cartridge from the printer again.
Carefully, remove the tape that you had covering the top two rows of contact pads on the electronic strip.
Place the cartridge back into the machine. The machine should now show that cartridge with a full status.
This process is designed to work for one cartridge after each refill. It will need to be repeated for any other cartridges that you are refilling.
