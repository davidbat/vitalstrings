On June 1, 2009, E Ink Corp. announced an agreement to be purchased by one of its primary business partners, Prime View Int'l Co. Ltd (元太科技工業), for US $215 million. [2] It is predicted that the purchase by this Taiwanese company will put the production of the E-Ink EPD on a larger scale than before, as Prime View also owns BOE Hydis Technology Co. Ltd (京东方海帝士科技) and maintains a strategic partner relationship with Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., which is now Chi Mei Innolux Corp. (奇美電子), part of the Hon Hai- Foxconn Group (鴻海富士康集團). It is noteworthy that Foxconn is the sole ODM partner for Prime View's Netronix Inc. (振曜科技), the supplier of E-Ink-panel e-readers for rebranding (the end-user products may appear with any of several brands, e.g., Bookeen, COOL-ER, PocketBook, etc.).
[ edit ] Technology
The material is processed into a film for integration into electronic displays , particularly for e-readers . The Motorola F3 was the first mobile phone to employ E Ink technology into its display, taking advantage of the material's ultra-low power consumption. In addition, the Samsung Alias 2 uses this technology as the display on the buttons change. [3] The October 2008 limited edition North American issue of Esquire was the first magazine cover to integrate E Ink and featured flashing text. The cover was manufactured in Shanghai, China, was shipped refrigerated to the United States for binding and was powered by a nominal 90-day integrated battery supply. [4] [5]

Vizplex is sometimes used to refer to specifically the first-generation of the line, in order to distinguish it from further generations, though properly speaking, Pearl and Triton are also types of Vizplex displays, as indicated by the text "E Ink Vizplex" at the bottom of startup screens for those displays.

[8] [9] Sony has also included this technology into its latest release of the Sony Reader Touch edition. [10] This display is also used in the Nook Simple Touch , [11] Kobo eReader Touch , [12] Onyx Boox M90 [13] and X61S. [14]
