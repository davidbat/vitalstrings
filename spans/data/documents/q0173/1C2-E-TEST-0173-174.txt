On the morning of July 22, 2011, many friends and admirers of Chief Judge Rader gathered at the University of Washington's High Technology Protection Summit to focus on the Chief Judge's many important opinions written during his more than 20 years on the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The morning consisted of two lengthy sessions following a keynote speech by a former student of mine, now a very experienced patent judge, the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff. The morning concluded with an address by the President of the University of Washington, Michael K. Young. Because President Young was instrumental in making the Chief Judge a permanent member of The George Washington University Law School faculty, his talk was the perfect capstone to the morning's events. Much of the afternoon was focused on Chief Judge Rader's influence on the patent laws of countries other than the United States. Many of the speakers were kind enough to prepare formal remarks for the conference, and these papers form the basis for this festschrift.

We are celebrating Chief Judge Randall Rader’s service to the federal court over the past 20 years. His opinions reflect his exceptional background in patent law, experience in the trial and appellate courts, participation in the legislative branch, dedication to teaching, breadth of international scholarship, and thoughtful writing. Therefore, it is fitting that we gain special insight into his opinions and reflect on his over 20 years as a Federal Circuit judge.
Tuning the Obviousness Inquiry After KSR

One of the most important and delicate judicial tasks in patent law is to keep the obviousness doctrine in reasonable working order. There are several reasons why the obviousness doctrine has been the subject of frequent judicial tinkering. First, patentability doctrines interact with each other, so doctrinal alterations that seem to be entirely external to the obviousness doctrine frequently have ripple effects on obviousness. The interaction between the utility and obviousness doctrines provides one good example. Second, the obviousness doctrine is internally complex. Cases in the chemical and biotechnology areas over the past several decades have amply illustrated this point. This Article examines Chief Judge Rader’s contributions to the task of tuning the obviousness doctrine, with particular attention to cases that have arisen after the Supreme Court’s pronouncements on obviousness in KSR v. Teleflex.
Patent Law's Falstaff: Inequitable Conduct, the Federal Circuit, and Therasense

For decades, the relationship between the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and patent law’s doctrine of inequitable conduct has resembled that between Shakespeare’s Prince Hal and John Falstaff. The former recognizes the excess, the deservedly ill repute, even the at least occasional wickedness of the latter, but cannot tear away from his close companion. Likewise, for decades, Federal Circuit judges have criticized the excesses of the defense of inequitable conduct, which can render a patent unenforceable as a result of misrepresentation or nondisclosure to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Nevertheless, U.S. patent law remains wedded to the defense’s existence. Without a real option of repudiating the defense, the Federal Circuit has instead sought to guide and confine the defense’s application in hopes of advancing legitimate aims at acceptable social cost. In this effort, the opinion for the en banc Federal Circuit written by Chief Judge Randall Rader in Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co. figures prominently. The background, content, and prospects for the Federal Circuit’s legal rulings in Therasense are the focus of this Article.

Chief Judge Rader influences patent jurisprudence in other nations through his interaction with judges and lawyers from these jurisdictions. He also uses the comparative method to gain insights from experiences in these jurisdictions to improve U.S. patent jurisprudence. This Article discusses opinions authored by Chief Judge Rader from the comparative law perspective. It discusses his influence on European and Japanese patent jurisprudence in the three areas: the (I) patent eligibility, (II) nonobviousness, and (III) enablement-written description requirements. Judge Rader likewise used his knowledge of foreign jurisprudence to interpret U.S. patent statutes and to develop doctrines in these areas.
Antiformalism at the Federal Circuit: The Jurisprudence of Chief Judge Rader

Commentators have long noted that the Federal Circuit tends to produce formalistic patent doctrine that favors bright-line rules over extensive engagement with facts and context. This Article, however, argues that Chief Judge Rader’s approach to patent law diverges sharply from this methodological tendency. In particular, it explores Chief Judge Rader’s rejection of formalism by examining his contributions to three areas of patent doctrine: claim construction, patentable subject matter, and the written description requirement. Throughout his engagement with patent law, Chief Judge Rader exhibits a striking sensitivity to context, policy considerations, and exogenous sources of authority that distinguishes himself from his more formalistic colleagues. The Article concludes with a brief normative assessment of Chief Judge Rader’s “antiformalist” methodology and its value to patent jurisprudence.

Chief Judge Rader’s judicial opinions contribute significantly to patent infringement jurisprudence. He writes from a teacher’s perspective, providing context and a clear lens through which legal issues may be examined. His deep reverence for the rule of law pervades his opinions, as he injects a cadre of principles governing his approach. Each opinion builds a foundation made of consistency and clarity in upholding the fundamental purposes underlying the patent grant.
Fostering the Business of Innovation: The Untold Story of Bowers v. Baystate Technologies

Perhaps the law review literature does not need another article on the Federal Circuit’s Bowers v. Baystate Technologies case. That case has received more than its share of attention from commentators, all criticizing Judge Rader’s majority opinion and most extolling the virtues of Judge Dyk’s dissent. Despite the storm of scholarly criticism, however, courts have followed Judge Rader’s opinion. This Article tells the untold story of why courts have been wise to do so. The Article explains how commentators have argued that federal intellectual property law should have preempted Bowers’ claims for breach of a shrinkwrap license prohibition on reverse engineering. Instead, Judge Rader’s majority opinion eliminated Bowers’ copyright claim by refusing to award Bowers any remedies for copyright infringement and hinted that in many instances contract damages for breach of a prohibition on reverse engineering would be de minimus. By using remedies rather than federal law preemption, Judge Rader’s approach achieved a result that was fairer to the parties and more congruent with sound innovation policy and the business of innovation.
Chief Judge Rader's Material Contribution to Geographic Indicator Analysis

Geographic indicators—trademarks that use a place name to indicate goods or services—are now theoretically easier to register, even if the good or service does not actually come from that place. This shift is a result of three cases, two authored by Chief Judge Randall R. Rader of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (California Innovations and Les Halles), and one where he served on the panel (Spirits International). These cases made it more difficult for a trademark examiner to reject an application for a primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive mark by adding a materiality requirement. However, raising the bar was not the intent of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) amendments, the subject of interpretation in the case trio. This Article tracks the significant change in the analysis of geographic indicators, ultimately arguing that the Federal Circuit should take guidance from its earlier opinions, In re Wada and Save Venice, and be willing to infer materiality when a location is known for a particular good or service.

No individual U.S. judge has influenced the evolving IP system and law of China through international outreach more than Chief Judge Rader of the Federal Circuit. Through tireless efforts, he has made an indelible footprint in the history of Chinese IP law as a judge, a professor, and an author. Chief Judge Rader has garnered rock-star status in China through dedication and commitment to contribute to, and to be a part of, China’s IP system and law. He has secured a legendary standing and will be long remembered by the Chinese IP community as an ambassador of IP and judicial goodwill.

The Honorable Chief Judge Rader has often emphasized the importance of establishing clear standards in the field of patent law. Similarly, Japanese courts in this field seem to make an effort to present a clear rule in their holdings. Patent exhaustion theory is one of the fields where a clear and concrete standard by the courts is especially needed. This Article explains several clear standards held by Japanese courts regarding this issue. It then discusses a problem raised by establishing clear standards by courts in a civil law country like Japan and also presents the Japanese Government’s efforts to ensure legal predictability in the patent field.
