What C.A.R. members are saying about zipLogix Digital Ink®
I truly enjoyed the Webinar and learned a lot. Enough that I was able to send 3 offers to my client for signature. Gone are the days of running around trying to make time to meet with your client to sign documents. This is a beautiful and efficient system and I am very happy that it is now a FREE service offered by C.A.R. I am an ecstatic agent.

I have known about e-sign but never really had the chance to use it. Last week I was sending an offer through and my buyer said that she preferred me to do everything by e-sign. I called C.A.R. and they directed me to where I found your wonderful material. It was wonderful and easy to learn. So 5 minutes later I did a test e-sign to myself and VOALA!
