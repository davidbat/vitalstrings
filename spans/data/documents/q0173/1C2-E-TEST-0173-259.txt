Ink Tags
Benefit Denial Security Tags discourage shoplifters even before they attempt to   steal.   WG's range of ink tags contain sealed vials of permanent dye that break if forcibly removed from the garment, rendering   the item unsuitable for wear, return or resale.   Ink Tags are Ideal for cost-conscious   retailers who choose to implement a   security program using these economical tags as a stand-alone security   device. Ink Tags also serve well in a layered security approach, providing   addition security by combining the Ink Tag with existing security tags in   conjunction with existing EAS systems.
Just Ink Tags
Just Ink  Tags offer two implementation methods; in a benefit denial mode,   by combining the Ink Tag with a locking clutch or in conjunction with a live EAS hard tag,   replacing the pin with the Ink Tag. The visible ink ampoules are designed to break   damaging the garment when the tag is tampered with, rendering the garment   useless to the shoplifter for resell, personal use or return. This   oval-shaped economical ink tag is available in clear, beige or grey.
