How to Ink a Sharp XE-A102 Cash Register
The Sharp XE-A102 electronic cash register is designed to print receipts and reports with a single ink roller housed at the front of the printer compartment. When the roller runs out of ink, the printouts will appear faded or become unreadable. As Sharp states that you should never re-ink a roller that stops working, the only way to "ink" a Sharp XE-A102 is to replace the used roller with a new one.
