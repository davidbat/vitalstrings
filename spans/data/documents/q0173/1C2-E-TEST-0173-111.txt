boost for mobile electronic reading
E-Books have promised much but the P-book is not giving up without a fight.  A new technology - E-Ink - might be a way forward.

The past year has been exciting for electronic reading devices.  One of the leading suppliers - Gemstar has come out with its new REB line of                                  e-book readers, major bookstore chains like Barnes & Noble now sell e-books and Steven King sparked serious interest in electronic resources at a popular level. The result is that portable e-book readers have                                  made terrific inroads in terms of mass acceptance.  E-books have a long way to go but they have certainly done well so far. 
E-book designers have striven to make the reader emulate the paper reading experience - a sensible                                   market strategy. The paper book has thrived for a long time and has a very loyal following.  People, organizations and societies love paper and are, it would seem not ready to move away from the paper paradigm.  People  love  paper - they need to be able to "curl up" with their books, take them into the bathtub, and they need paper copies of their favourite web article.  This is a “comfort zone” response. People have mastered the paper technology and are reluctant to have to introduce and thus learn a new reading platform.
So, enticing people over to the electronic reading experience, with e-book devices that  “read like a paper book” is probably a shrewd                                  move.  Eventually, we will get beyond this paper clinging mindset to embrace an electronic world where the possibilities for information providers and consumers can be fully realised.
Electronic books will help move us through                                  this transition phase to a paperless society, but they may, themselves,  need help  in the shape of another product  - Electronic Ink.
What is E-Ink ?
‘Electronic ink’ generates an image of a piece of paper that glows with letters like a neon                                  sign.  That is  not far off. This technology is the ability to put electronic charge to particles on flexible sheets about the thickness of paper and thus have these particles form words.  Instead of using computer screens, these flexible sheets emulate paper and as such are portable and reusable. Imagine having a road map that could change depending on what city                                  you were in or a newspaper that didn't have to be discarded, it would be updated each day.
There are two major players working on electronic ink technology. E Ink Corporation ( http://www.eink.com ) of Cambridge Massachusetts and Xerox in Palo Alto, California ( http://www.parc.xerox.com ).  Both work using  the same basic principles, but approach the                                  product in a slightly different manner.
E-Ink Corporation
E ink partnered with Lucent Technologies ( http://www.lucent.com ) in June of 2000. Lucent's research arm, Bell Labs has developed a proprietary flexible ink display.  Lucent has                                  licensed this display technology to E Ink and invested multiple millions of dollars in the company. In exchange Lucent received a minority equity share in E Ink.  One year after                                  their development project was announced, the two companies demonstrated prototypes of the new technology.
"True electronic paper has, in many ways, seemed like a futuristic technology," said Jim                                  Iuliano, president and CEO of E Ink. "Today we have brought that concept closer to reality by demonstrating that electronic ink works with Lucent's flexible plastic transistors. With                                  this combination of technologies we believe that we have found a very promising means for achieving paper-like electronic displays."
E Ink has received funding from other interested parties including Motorola Incorporate and                                  Hearst Corporation interested in electronic newspapers applications.
How E-Ink’s product works
E Ink’s product is comprised of tiny spheres called microcapsules. Millions of these spheres ha
ve a clear outer shell and are filled with blue dye. Within each sphere there are                                  microscopic chip of white pigment. These chips are positively charges. When a negative charge passes along either the top of the capsule or the bottom of the capsule, the chips move to the top or                                  bottom making the sphere blue or white. Put these combinations together and symbols can be formed.
 Lucent worked on the plastic circuitry that charges the particles. The transistors that                                  make up this circuitry are made of low cost plastic.

display is also very bright and easily read in both bright light as well as dim light.  According to E Ink because the ink is bistable,                                  meaning it only needs to be powered when the paper is “charged”.  It is also reflective and can be read in a variety of lighting conditions.  It does not require power to hold the display.                                  (http://www.eink.com/company/hotnews.shtml)  A commercial product now available from E Ink called Immedia used for large area signs only uses 0.1 watts of power.
Xerox and electronic paper
The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) started work on a similar project back in the 1970’s.

Xerox has taken a slightly different approach and calls their product electronic paper.  The display technology is called Gyricon.                                  On a transparent sheet of plastic, one finds millions of charged beads. Each half has a contrasting colour (white/black, white/red). When a charge is applied, the beads rotate to show                                  one side or the other, thus forming words or images.  Like the E Ink technology, once charged, the image stays until a new charge is                                  applied.  These microscopic beads are suspended in an oily liquid and applied to rubber sheets produced by partners 3M.
The interesting thing about Xerox is that they have already mastered 200dpi. That is not to                                  say that E Ink won’t get there. They are predicting with the help of Lucent’s transistors E Ink books (thin sheets of flexible paper bound together, complete with batteries and memory                                  chips located in the spine) will be available within the next five years. It is an interesting image. A book that looks and feels like a paperback but is actually “charged”.
So now we are seeing a technology develop that will saddle itself more to the book analogy.                                  Unlike the portable e-book readers where you must click to simulate the turning of a book page, with electronic ink/paper you will actually be able to do the page flipping.  These                                  products take us even closer to the paper reading experience than the existing portable e-book readers.  It will be the best of both worlds.
It is said that true innovation comes only with a complete paradigm shift. E-ink is not a                                  complete shift  but  both portable e-book readers and electronic ink/paper are a great start.  In order to secure acceptance, E-book devices are trying to emulate the paper book                                  experience.  This, however, may be restricting some of the more innovative and exciting possibilities of the  technology.  As a result progress may be slower in this direction.  Electronic ink is a product that may start out in the book emulation game but could be  a stepping-stone to better products . E-ink  could come from the back of the pack in the race  to win over readers and paper lovers, and lead us into a truly paperless world.
