How Do Electronic-Ink Microcapsules Work?
The display is manufactured by printing the electronic ink onto a sheet of plastic film that has been laminated to a layer of circuitry. The circuitry forms a pattern of pixels that can then be controlled by a display driver. The electronic ink, which is composed of microcapsules suspended in a liquid vehicle (carrier medium), can be screen printed onto a variety of substrates including glass, plastic, fabric and paper. The company claims that ultimately the electronic ink will be able to be printed on almost any surface to make a display.
The company also offers Vizplex imaging film. This consists of microencapsulated electronic ink coated onto an ITO-coated plastic substrate to create an ink film, which is then combined with a thin adhesive and a plastic release sheet. After converting the film into individual sheets, it is available for sale to TFT display manufacturers.
