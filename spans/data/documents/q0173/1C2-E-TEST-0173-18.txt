Electronic Ink
Electronic ink is a special type of ink that can display different colors       when exposed to an electric field. It is made through a two step process       that involves creating two-toned charged particles and encapsulating them       in a transparent polymeric shell. The resulting nanoparticle shells are       suspended in a solvent until the ink can be applied to a surface. First       developed in the early 1990s, electronic ink promises to revolutionize the       printing industry and maybe even change the way we interact with the       world.
Background
Ink has been around for centuries and for the purposes of displaying an       idea, ink on paper has many advantages over electronic displays. Paper is       easy to carry around and can be read almost anytime and anywhere. It does       not require a power source and is relatively durable. However, ink on       paper has the disadvantage of not being able to be updated. Electronic ink       has been designed to maintain the advantages of traditional paper and ink       while providing the added advantages of updating and high capacity data       storage.
Electronic ink is like traditional ink in that it is a colored liquid that       can be coated onto nearly any surface. Suspended in the liquid are       millions of microcapsules that contain tiny, two-toned polymeric       particles. One side of the particle is a dark color while the other is a       contrasting light color. Similar to a magnet, the dark colored side of the       particle has an electric charge that is opposite that of the light colored       side. When the ink is exposed to an electric field, the particles realign       themselves, depending on the charge of the field. When all of the dark       colored sides are attracted to the surface, the ink looks dark. When an       opposite electric charge is applied, the light colored sides orient face       forward and the surface looks light. This ability to change from white to       black or visa versa whenever desired makes electronic ink extremely       useful. When a book or other surface is coated with electronic ink, it can       be reprogrammed to display different words or pictures.
It has long been known in the printing industry that letters and pictures       can be displayed using distinct dots, or pixels. The more pixels that can       be placed closer together, the better the image looks. On a standard       newspaper about 300 pixels are used in the area of a square inch. When       electronic ink is coated on a surface in specific quantities, each of       these pixels can be made light or dark depending on how the electronic       field is applied. Printing technology is already available to cover       surfaces with over 1,200 pixels per square inch of electronic ink. This       resolution makes electronic ink suitable for almost any printed work.
The way that an electronic ink display would work is much like a computer       screen. Each pixel of ink could be controlled by an attached computer.       Groups of adjoining pixels could be turned on or off to creates letters,       number, and pictures. While this might be difficult to achieve on a piece       of standard paper, a specially designed paper is being developed which       will feel and look like paper but actually be a mini-computer complete       with a vast array of electric circuits to control each pixel. This special       paper would not be essential however because a special scanner could also       be developed to have the same effect.
One of the most useful characteristics of electronic ink is that after the       electric field         is removed, the ink remains in its configuration. This means that only a       small amount of power is required as compared to typical electronic       displays. The configuration can be changed however, by applying a new       electric field whenever desired. This means that if a book was printed       with electronic ink, it could contain the words of one book on one day and       another book the next. If fitted with memory storage, a single electronic       book could contain thousands of different texts.
History
While the printed word has been around for centuries, the idea of       electronic ink is a relatively recent invention. In the late 1970s,       researches at Xerox PARC developed a proto-type of an electronic book. The       device used millions of tiny magnets that had oppositely colored sides       (black on one, white on the other) embedded on a thin, soft, rubber       surface. When an electric charge was introduced the magnets flipped making       either a black or white mark similar to pixels on a video screen. The       device was never a commercial success because it was large and difficult       to use.
Over the next decade various screens were introduced and the idea of an       electronic book became a reality. However, these devices still remain more       cumbersome than printed paper. In 1993, Joe Jacobson, a researcher at MIT,       began investigating the idea of a book that typeset itself. He conceived a       variation of the PARC idea using reversible particles. Eventually, he       created electronic ink, which utilizes colored polymers encased in a       transparent shell. He submitted his idea for patent in 1996 and was       eventually rewarded one in 2000.
Jacobson formed E Ink Corporation which was designed to bring electronic       ink to the marketplace. The first commercial product is the Immedia       display. It is an advertising sign that looks and feels just like a paper       sign. However, this sign is coated with electronic ink allowing it to be       programmed to change its message. E ink anticipates that electronic ink       will eventually be utilized in an area where traditional ink is used such       as newspapers, books, magazines and even clothes.
Raw Materials
A variety of raw materials are used in the production of electronic ink.       These include polymers, reaction agents, solvents, and colorants.
Polymers are high molecular weight materials which are made up of       chemically bonded monomers. To make the charged, colored portions of the       electronic ink polyethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride or other suitable       polymers are used. These materials are useful because they can be made       liquid when heated, solidify when cooled, and will maintain stable dipoles       which are long lasting.
Filler materials are added to the polymers to alter their physical       characteristics. Since polymers are generally colorless, colorants are       added to them to produce the contrast needed for electronic ink. These may       be soluble dyes or comminuted pigments. To produce a white color, an       inorganic material such as titanium dioxide may be used. Iron oxides can       be used to produce other colors like yellow, red, and brown. Organic dyes       such as pyrazolone reds, quinacridone violet, and flavanthrone yellow may       also be utilized. Other fillers such as plasticizers can be added to       modify the electrical characteristics of the polymers. This is       particularly important for electronic ink. During production the polymer       is heated. For this reason stabilizers are added to prevent it from       breaking down. Heat stabilizers include unsaturated oils like soy bean       oil. Protective materials that are added include UV protectors such as       benzophenones and antioxidants such as aliphatic thiols. These materials       help prevent UV degradation and environmental oxidation respectively.
During the electronic ink encapsulation process various compounds are       used. Water is used to create an emulsion and provide a vehicle for the       encapsulation reaction to take place. Monomers are added to produce the       encapsulation shell. Cross-linking agents which cause the monomers to       react are utilized. Silicone oil is the hydrophobic material that gets       incorporated with the colored particles in the encapsulate. This material       provides a liquid medium for the particles to travel through when the       electric field is applied. It is clear, colorless and extremely slippery.       Other gel or polymeric materials
Made up of tiny, two-toned charged nanoparticles, electronic ink can           display different colors or messages when exposed to an electric           field. Depending on the type of charge, the particles will either be           attracted or repelled from the surface, thus creating different           effects.
can be added to the encapsulate to improve the stability of the system.
The Manufacturing Process
Electronic ink is made in a step-wise fashion. First, two contrasting inks       are given opposite charges. Then the inks are encapsulated in conductive       micro spheres and applied to the desired surface.
Producing charged ink
1 Two contrasting liquid polymers are loaded into separate containers         which have attached atomizing nozzles. The materials are kept heated so         they remain liquid. One of the nozzles has a positively charged         potential while the other has a negative potential. Pressure is then         used to force the inks through the nozzles causing them to break into         tiny particles and also acquire the opposing charges. The containers are         situated next to each other so when the inks exit the nozzles they come         in contact. Since they have opposite charges, they are attracted to each         other and form larger, neutral particles.
2 After the larger particles are formed, the materials are allowed to         cool which causes them to solidify. This results in a small two-toned         solid particle which has a positive and negative side. The particles are         then run past a heating element which reduces surface tension and         creates a more perfect sphere.
3 The particles are then run through a set of electrodes to separate out         the ones that are imperfectly charged. As they pass the electrodes, the         imperfect particles are attracted to the corresponding electrode and         then removed. The rest of the particles are transferred to the         encapsulating area.
Encapsulating ink
4 The particles are moved into a tank which contains a liquid solution         of monomer in a silicone oil. The particles are mixed thoroughly so they         are evenly dispersed. This solution is combined with an aqueous phase         which creates an emulsion. An emulsion is a semi-stable mixture of oil         and water. The electronic ink particles remain in the silicone oil which         is surround by water.
5 A cross-linking agent is added to the solution which causes the         monomer to react with itself. This produces tiny spheres which contain         some silicone oil and the electronic ink particles. The ink particles         can then be separated from the aqueous phase for various applications.         This can be done by evaporation with subsequent solvent washing.
6 After the reactions are complete, the electronic ink articles are         stored in a liquid solvent until they can be applied. Depending on the         final product, this application process can involve spreading the liquid                   ink on specialized paper, fabric, or other kinds of fibers.
Quality Control
To ensure the quality of the electronic ink, each phase of the production       process is monitored. Since it is a relatively new technology, electronic       ink is not made in large, rapid quantities. For this reason each step can       be thoroughly tested before proceeding to the next. Inspections begin with       an evaluation of the incoming raw materials. These materials are tested       for things such as pH, viscosity, and specific gravity. Also, color and       appearance are evaluated. After the electronic ink is finished, it is       tested to ensure that it will properly react to an electric field. The       material may be spread on a thin surface and have an electric field       applied. The color of the surface should change accordingly. The particle       size is also tested using various mesh screens.
The Future
The first products utilizing electronic ink are just being introduced.       They are simple two-toned devices that are not more impressive than flat       paneled electronic displays. However, future generations promise to have       broad applications and may significantly impact the way we interact with       the world. The hope that electronic ink manufacturers have is that this       material will initially be incorporated into outdoor billboards, hand-held       computer devices, books, and newspapers. But ultimately, electronic ink       will be put onto any surface such as clothes, walls, product labels, and       bumper stickers. It will then become ubiquitous to the environment so that       any message can be displayed any-where at anytime.
Since the current electronic ink product is made up of only two colors,       the products made with it can not create a full colored display. In the       future, more colors of electronic ink will be developed. Scientists still       have to work out how to display these differing colors at the proper time,       but once accomplished, any surface coated with electronic ink could become       as interesting to look at as a television screen.
