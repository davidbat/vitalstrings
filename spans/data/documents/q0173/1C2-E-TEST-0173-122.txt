The SolidTek DM-L2 DigiMemo L2 8-1/2-by-11-Inch Digital Notepad is a stand-alone device that can digitally capture what you write and draw on regular paper–with no special paper or computer. The Digital Notepad remembers the strokes that you draw and when you are done, you simply plug the Notepad into your computer via USB and upload your notes. Then you will have both a digital and a paper copy. The included DigiMemo Manager software lets you easily view, edit, and organize your digital pages in Windows. The digital pages can be saved as BMP, JPG, GIF, or PNG formats. You can then easily share your digital pages with others, or highlight, annotate, and edit them.
When the pad is connected to a PC, it can function as a graphics tablet, with the writing on the paper and the writing on the screen synchronized. The DigiMemo L2 has a writing area of 8 by 11 inches and has 32 MB of built-in storage, with a CompactFlash memory card slot for expansion. The pad is light and thin, and isn’t uncomfortable to hold or use. The battery of the pen can last about 14 months and the pad will last about 100 hours on four AAA alkaline batteries. The unit automatically shuts down after 30 idle minutes.
