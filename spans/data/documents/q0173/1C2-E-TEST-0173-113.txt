Why it matters what paper you use
Few people spend much time thinking about paper and its role in the printing process, yet the quality of the output is significantly influenced by the paper used. For best results, be sure to use the correct printer driver and tray settings for your printer.
 
HP LaserJet printers use a fuser to bond dry toner particles in very precise dots to the paper. HP laser paper is designed to withstand this extreme heat. Using inkjet paper not designed for this technology could damage your printer.
 
HP Inkjet printers spray fine amounts of liquid ink onto a page to create an image and text. Laser papers are not designed to absorb ink, which could result in smearing or streaking.
