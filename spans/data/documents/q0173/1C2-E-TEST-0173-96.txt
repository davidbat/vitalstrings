COMPANY
Zikon Inc. uses proprietary REED (Reverse Emulsion Electrophoretic Display) technology to create low-cost nanotechnology-based electronic Ink for flat panel displays. Zikon¡¯s technology enables next generation flat and flexible displays for the multi-billion wave of up-and-coming consumer and commercial applications. Our core business is to manufacture the electronic Ink and not the entire display.
Zikon¡¯s Ink is low cost, energy efficient, and clearly viewable in direct sunlight. Furthermore, Zikon¡¯s Ink is compatible with current LCD fabrication processes and cuts multiple steps out of the LCD supply chain. Zikon¡¯s REED technology and processes are proven and patented. They have been validated by accredited third parties including top-tier universities and LCD R&D facilities.
Zikon will initially commercialize single-color Inks for application in outdoor display screens, signage and mobile devices. The company¡¯s initial target market are consumer goods where bright-light viewability and beautiful, vibrant single-color displays will provide added value. Shortly thereafter, Zikon will commercialize full-color Ink for use in handheld devices and other consumer and commercial electronics such a PDAs, medical devices and video billboards.
