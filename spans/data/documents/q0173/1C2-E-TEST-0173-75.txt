Instructions
1
Dampen a soft cloth with water and mild detergent. Wipe the cloth on a hidden area of the device to make sure the solution will not discolor the device. If there is no discoloration, wipe the ink from the device with the cloth.
2
Moisten another soft cloth with water, and then wipe the cloth over the area to rinse away the detergent. Dry the device with a soft, dry towel. If the ink stain remains, dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and wipe the swab over the ink.
3
Rinse the rubbing alcohol off with the cloth dampened with water, and then dry off the device with the soft, dry towel. If the ink stain persists, moisten a cotton swab with nail polish remover and gently wipe the swab over the ink until the ink is gone.
4
Remove the nail polish remover by wiping the area with the cloth dampened in water. Dry off the device with the soft, dry towel. If there is ink on the device's screen, make a solution of half water and half rubbing alcohol in a cup.
5
Dip a cotton swab in the solution and gently rub the cotton swab over the ink until it is removed. Rub the cotton swab very lightly over the screen to avoid damaging it. Wipe off the alcohol with the soft, dry towel.
Tips & Warnings
Use only nail polish remover that is acetone-free. Acetone can damage plastic surfaces.
Do not apply water directly to the device, but only with a damp cloth. Pouring water directly onto the device could permanently damage the device.
