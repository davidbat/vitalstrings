Welcome to NAPIM
The National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers (NAPIM) has been the only national trade association for the printing ink industry since it’s founding in 1916.  The overall purpose is to promote the general development and improvement of member companies by fostering greater understanding and knowledge of the printing ink industry as well as representing the industry as a whole on a national basis. In addition, NAPIM provides seminars, conferences, publications, bulletins and consultation services to its member companies on an ongoing basis. The association exists in order to serve its membership, which is accomplished by being both re-active and pro-active on key issues affecting the ink industry. NAPIM members include ink manufacturers, companies that supply raw materials and manufacturers of instrumentation and equipment utilized by the printing ink industry.
