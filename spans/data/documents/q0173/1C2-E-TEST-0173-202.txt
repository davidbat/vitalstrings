E Ink 9.7-inch AM300 Electronic Paper Display Prototype Kit
With a view of offering a wide range of application sizes, E Ink has launched a 9.7” AM300 Electronic Paper Display (EPD) Prototype Kit. This high resolution promises to fulfill the growing needs of EPD. It is said to be useful for larger displays of various documents like newspapers, textbooks, and more.
“The success in the eBook space has prompted a lot of interest in eNewspaper and eTextbook applications,” said Sriram Peruvemba, Vice President of Marketing for E Ink. “E Ink Vizplex displays provide the best digital reading experience, and are fast becoming a better alternative to printed paper in certain applications.”
The E Ink technology is specially designed for mobile and handheld devices. It claims to offer comfort while reading in any type of lighting and from any angle. This technology can be ideally used for both consumer and industrial applications.
The 9.7” diagonal display has a resolution of 150 pixels per inch and it displays multiple shades of gray. The image once updated remains onscreen without consuming any energy. Compared to traditional LCD’s, it reduces energy consumption by about 90 percent. The device also features a graphical display similar to electronic paper and pen input.
The prototype kit is a simple way to start working with E Ink technology. The display is said to assist the development of next generation ePaper products. The device also incorporates Linux x86 operating environment, E Ink API software for Broadsheet, various sample images, open source software drivers and applications including support for MMC cards, Bluetooth and USB.
The 9.7” AM300 is now available for per-orders on the company’s official website at a price of $4000 (approx Rs.1,96,940) and will be shipping by the end of this month.
