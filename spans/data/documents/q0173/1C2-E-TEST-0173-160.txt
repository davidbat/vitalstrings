Unisen specializes in developing unique and cost-effective Acousto-Magnetic (AM) and Radio-Frequency (RF) hard tags, AM/RF labels,                     and EAS accessories that are fully compatible with Sensormatic UltraMax®, Checkpoint systems, and other branded EAS systems,                     detachers, and deactivators. Unisen also produces its own line of benefit/denial ink tags, which are widely used by many retailers                     wanting to create an effective deterrent to shoplifting. We pride ourselves in working with our customers to design custom tagging solutions                     to suit their individual needs.
We also supply advanced Telsec brand RF security systems, deactivators, people counters, and many other security devices.
Unisen guarantees the quality and authenticity of every product we manufacture and sell.
UNISEN has recently opened new distribution facilities in Belgium and Hong Kong. These strategically located facilities                     enable us to ship orders more quickly and cost-effectively to customers in all regions of the world.
