Electronic Ink’s mission is to make technology easy to use.
Technology has proliferated, touching nearly all aspects of our lives. But with explosive growth came hasty design.
People need technology to work for them, not against them. Who hasn’t been frustrated by an office system that doesn’t work, or an online transaction that simply won’t go through?
When a person has to work – or even struggle – to interact with technology, technology has broken its promise of making life easier.
There is a cost to every labored or failed transaction – wasted time, reduced efficiency, drained productivity and lost money. It doesn’t have to be that way. Technology can communicate clearly, transact smoothly, and satisfy completely.
That’s the founding principle upon which, in 1990, Harold Hambrose built Electronic Ink. Hambrose created Electronic Ink to provide insightful design solutions that solve problems by doing something radical: considering human behaviors first and foremost. It was the practice of user-centered design, before it even had a name.
