Our Southcenter (Tukwila) store opened in early 1998 and has continued the practice of reuse and recycling that was made popular by our Seattle store. At almost double the warehouse space of our Seattle location, RE·PC Southcenter has the same great variety of computers, parts, peripherals and miscellaneous with more space for racks, networking, misc software and other unusual stuff. Located just south of Southcenter, our Tukwila location also takes in a wide variety of computer and electronics related recycling. We buy, sell, recycle and repair at this location as well.
Please note that the Southcenter store does NOT have a computer museum like  the Seattle  store does; it does, however, sell a lot of vintage  computer equipment  and accessories in the store as well as online.
Also, The Ink Stop, a company independent of RE·PC, is located inside RE·PC in Tukwila. The Ink Stop refills inkjet cartridges and also offers a full line of laserjet toners,  remanufactured and compatible inkjet cartridges. They also supply remanufactured and prefilled ink-jet cartridges at our Seattle location.

Please note that RE·PC and The  Ink Stop  are two different companies, so please direct your questions  accordingly.
