SMM Electronics Challenge
The use of electronic products has grown substantially over the past two  decades, changing the way and the speed in which we communicate and how we get  information and entertainment. According to the Consumer Electronics  Association (CEA), Americans now own approximately 24 electronic products per  household. 1
Donating used electronics for reuse extends the lives of valuable products. Recycling electronics prevents valuable materials from going into the waste stream. Consumers now have many options to recycle or donate for reuse their used electronics. Many computer, TV, and cell phone manufacturers, as well as electronics  retailers offer some kind of take back program or sponsor recycling events. About half of the states currently have laws on disposal and recycling of electronics
and several other states are considering passing similar laws.
Unfortunately not every electronic recycler follows environmentally sound recycling practices; however, responsible electronics recyclers and refurbishers can now become certified by demonstrating to an accredited, independent third party that they meet available standards on responsible recycling practices. EPA encourages all electronics recyclers to become certified and all customers to choose certified recyclers.  Visit the eCycling Certification page for more information.
