Was hard to get ink started.  Followed inst. to disassemble pen to clean tip.  Once I got the pen to function,  product worked just great.  Waited the 24 hrs. to cure, cleaned up the traces, test..  Repaired 5 circuit traces on a ribbon cable for my pellet stove.
"Great for repairing auto defroster grids" by cbroyard on 6/13/2011

Repaired my rear window defroster grid w/ it. Also bought  the conformal coating pen you use to apply  a protective coating over the repair.The Circuit Writer Pen was on sale for less than $20.00 and the fact that my auto dealer would have charged $85.00 just to "look at it" made it very cost effective. Lucky for me, I could see the breaks and was able to apply the conductive coating to bridge the breaks.  The area of the defroster that was not working is fine. and for a fraction of the cost of having it repaired by a dealer/mechanic. If you know "what you are doing" to repair somthing like this. this will fit the bill. I saved over half ( $40.00) by buying  both pens from MCM !!!!!!
