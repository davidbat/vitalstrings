Introducing ePad-ink, Todayâ€™s Most Advanced E-Signature Device Targets Corporate, Government and Retail Documents, Forms and Transactions
Camarillo, California, May 22, 2002 -- Interlink Electronics, Inc., (Nasdaq: LINK), the worldwide leader in the development of intuitive interface technologies and e-transaction solutions, today announced availability of ePad-ink--the most technologically advanced signature capture device available. The newest member of Interlink's family of ePad e-transaction products, ePad-ink uses a liquid crystal display (LCD) to capture and display signatures as they are written along with data from the document being signed. The ePad-ink input pad also captures handwriting biometrics including stylus pressure and timing data. Combined with the unique electronic identification number coded into each ePad-ink device, these biometrics help ensure the security of signatures within the digital domain.
ePad-ink - The Most Intuitive Form Of E-Signature
In a single step, ePad-ink transforms the handwritten signature into today's most intuitive form of electronic signature. Simply sign the pad with a stylus just as you would a piece of paper with a pen. Its ergonomic design makes signing easy and visual feedback from the input screen produces a natural signature within an intuitive signing context
"To reduce costs and transaction times, businesses and government institutions are leveraging their IT investments to automate the processing of paper documents and forms-including those requiring a binding signature," says Rod Vesling, vice president of sales and marketing, electronic transactions, Interlink Electronics, Inc. "Fortune 1000 companies and government agencies will appreciate ePad-ink's LCD display, ergonomic form-factor and competitive price-point."
"ePad-ink is designed for retail systems and is compatible with today's leading point-of-sale (POS) terminals," continues Interlink's Rod Vesling. "Its deployment can dramatically decrease a merchant's overhead due to charge-backs and receipt storage. Customers making in-store purchases simply sign the electronic receipt that appears within the ePad-ink screen. The transaction, along with its digital receipt and signature, is electronically stored for easy retrieval."
