Since 1946, Electronic Surplus has been serving the needs of hobbyists, inventors, HAM radio operators, engineers, and technicians in Cleveland, Ohio and around the world. We specialize in hard to find electronic parts from audio ICs and devices, to transformers and relays. Our inventory is made up of obsolete and active items, all at surplus prices. Some items are gently used and others are new in the manufacturer's packaging.
