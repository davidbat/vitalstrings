Clip Board Gets High-tech For Coach
Trademark of the Coach: his ever-present Clipboard and whistle. A little twist however, the whistle stays, only the clipboard gets modern; its the E-Ink Electronic Coach Playboard. Using E-Ink technology (for longer battery life), the clipboard can be used to draw out strategies for multiple games like baseball, basketball, football, soccer, etc. Templates of the field/court come pre-loaded, just choose your game and start drawing out the moves using your finger. The instructions can be reviewed and replayed numerous times, till the athletes get the game-plan perfected. Go get em tiger!
