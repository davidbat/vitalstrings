Inkjet                      Technology as a Manufacturing Process:
Much Promise, But a Long Way Off
Inkjet technology is an                      extremely flexible technology that has the potential to expand                      beyond printing applications into manufacturing and deposition                      applications. This is possible because inkjet heads are precision                      instruments that deposit small droplets of a fluid (both ink                      and non ink) in a defined, repeatable pattern. When jetting                      inks, inkjet heads are used for printing as we know it. When                      jetting non fluids, inkjet heads can be used in deposition                      and manufacturing applications. When used as a manufacturing                      tool, inkjet heads will deposit conductive chemistry, creating                      in effect "printed electronics." Using inkjet technology in                      this way to print electronics is a concept that holds promise                      and elicits much discussion, opinions and hype. However, while                      there are many advantages to inkjet used as a manufacturing                      process to print electronics, in reality the market is in                      its very early stages and real products are more than ten                      years away.
According to Mark Hanley,                      President of I.T. Strategies, "The reason for the interest                      in digital technology for manufacturing printed electronics                      is that today's manufacturing process for integrated circuits                      is subtractive at high temperatures and very costly. The process                      lays down more very expensive material than is required and                      then strips away what is not needed. On the other hand, inkjet                      technology is an additive process that allows materials to                      be deposited only where required at low temperatures, on flexible                      substrates at low cost. This method of manufacturing would                      also require a lower investment in plant costs compared to                      current integrated circuit manufacturing. Inkjet technology                      used in this way has the potential to open up the market for                      new, low-cost electronic goods, such as disposable radio frequency                      identification (RFID) chips." There are many advantages to                      printed electronics. Among them:
The generation of ultra low-cost, ubiquitous consumer                        electronics through a radical shift in the manufacturing                        process from very-high cost integrated circuits to a mass-production                        process processing technology that holds the promise of                        cost reducing electronics to the point of allowing them                        to become throw away.
The ability to create flexible printed electronics.
The ability to create large area electronics, which is                        prohibitively costly for standard, integrated circuit-based                        electronics manufacturing.
The potential to put electronics manufacturing in-line                        or close-to in line with the manufacture of products on                        which or with which the electronics are designed to function.
The potential for scalable manufacturing and on-demand                        response which are enablers of new markets of new users                        who will require high customization on a low scale on short                        notice at profitable pricing levels.
Although inkjet technology holds out                      the promise of low-cost manufacturing, printed electronics                      are not simply a substitute for existing integrated circuit                      based electronics products. Their functionality and their                      economics are very different from integrated circuits and                      the point of printed electronics is not to substitute for                      existing processes but rather to create new markets. This                      creates some large barriers to market development including:
Slow development curve as the new market develops
No established market means no established standards among                        developers
Need for extraordinary degree of economic and technical                        cooperation between otherwise independent companies developing                        components today
No single integrated market could lead to distracted                        development efforts and misplaced investment time and money.
Inkjet technology has                      proven to be very effective as a precision manufacturing system.                      However, while there are many advantages to inkjet as a manufacturing                      process, the market for printed electronics is in its early                      stages. The eventual goal of jetting RFID tags onto goods                      is probably more than ten years away.
