Silhouette CAMEO®
The Silhouette CAMEO® is an electronic cutting tool for personal use. Like a home printer, it     plugs into your PC or Mac® with a simple USB cable.  However, instead of printing     it uses a small blade to cut paper, cardstock, vinyl, fabric and more up to 12" wide and 10 feet long.     The machine also boasts a quiet motor and the ability to register and cut printed materials.
