Epoxy Printing: Epoxy printing is a    process where by the epoxy-based ink is printed on the surface of the    keycap. After the legend is printed on the keycap, the ink is left to    cure for a 24-hour period. Then a UV clear coat is applied over the    legend. The UV clear coat protects the printed legend from wear and tear
