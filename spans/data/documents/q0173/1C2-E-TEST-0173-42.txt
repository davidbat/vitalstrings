Rated 1 out of 5 Tried to use it to stamp date and times of food safety checks. Not rugged enough. Works for a few minutes until the printer fails and you have to reset. After 1 day of resetting a few times, the reset button broke and I now have an [$] paperweight.

Lasted one year; I am buying another Rated 4 out of 5 As a physician, this stamp helped me keep up with the onerous government regulations of dating and timing every piece of paper that I have to fill out every time I see a patient. Whenever I admit a patient to the hospital, I have to sign my name, and date and time documents THIRTEEN times. My stamp lasted one year...I am buying another one as soon as I finish this rating.

Complete failure of user interface Rated 1 out of 5 This product is a complete failure of user interface. It has the hardest to understand set up I have ever encountered for a piece of electronics. And I am speaking as someone who has training setting up and programing video/audio equipment. The uses for the buttons and various modes are entirely unintuitive and unhelpfully labeled. God help you if you lose the instructions. Not that they were very helpful, as it still took me 30 mins. to program it for our secretary. Parts of the instructions were even inaccurate. Also, when I did figure out how to change the settings, the buttons only worked some of the time. Once you have it programed it prints OK I guess. It has an alarm feature but we found it complicates the user interface and our secretary has never needed it. I cannot believe this product costs [$]. The plastic and rubber is frankly cheap. I wouldn't have guessed it cost more that $30, tops. Please save yourself some aggravation and don't buy this worthless product.
