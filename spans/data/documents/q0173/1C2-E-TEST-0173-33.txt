Nature's "electronic ink"
Retinal protein crystallized on space mission
Sept     17, 1998: Anyone who has ever fallen     on grass knows that nature has chemicals that are as permanent     as ink. At least one of those chemicals holds promise as an "electronic     ink" that can be used in improved computer displays.
The chemical is bacteriorhodopsin, a purple protein essential     to the cell wall of Halobacterium halobium, a mysterious     resident of salt-marshes and lakes. When nutrients get scarce,     this bacteriorhodopsin becomes a light-converting enzyme that     keeps the organism's life cycle going. It's a protein powerhouse     that in times of famine flips back and forth between purple and     yellow colors. If controllable, this could be valuable in computer     display panels.

Above: Artist's concept of microorganisms         in the Owens Lake - the image represents a magnification of approximately         2000x. The red coloration of the brine is caused primarlity by         rod-shaped, salt-loving bacteria (Halobacterium). There are also         two or more species of halophilic green algae, one of which,         the Dunaliella, has an intense red form that adds to the         reddish color of the lake bed. All are shown swimming among cuboidal         crystals of sodium chloride (salt).
In the last 25 years, bacteriorhodopsin         has excited a great deal of interest among biochemists, biophysicists,         and most recently among companies seeking to build battery-conserving,         long-life computer displays. The protein, sometimes called nature's         "electronic ink" was grown in orbit on board the Space         Shuttle for a scientific team from Justus-Liebig University in         Glessen, Germany and the Institute for Physiological Chemistry         in Hamburg.
Part of the attraction to understanding these light powerhouses         is that natural materials often perform very complex functions         that cannot be easily obtained from manufactured materials such         as semiconductors. They have been optimized for these functions         by billions of years of evolution and often perform them better         than any human-designed material could.
For example, bacteriorhodopsin is an attractive material for         all-optical 'light' computers because of its two stable protein         forms, one purple and one yellow. Shining two lasers of different         wavelengths alternately on the protein flips it back and forth         between the two colors. Several research groups have already         used bacteriorhodopsin as computer memory and as the light-sensitive         element in artificial retinas.
According to their report, the space crystal
was stabilized under microgravity conditions...           Further experiments in microgravity, as a favorable environment           of improved crystallogenesis, provide additional progress in           the investigation of difficult membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin.

In nature, this salt-loving, probably ancient, organism undergoes     a light-stimulated cycle of protein rearrangements which can     interact photochemically. This may be much how similar retinal     proteins in the eye allow more evolved organisms to see.
Analyzing them on Earth has been difficult because these kinds     of complex membrane proteins typically require detergents to     make them compatible with biological analysis in water.
The cubic-shaped space crystals showed a nearly 20-fold larger     volume compared to earth-grown counterparts. In comparing space     grown crystals of the bacteriorhodopsin with similar crystals     formed on earth, the team found that a favorable environment     minimizing gravity may advance the search for new means to reveal     the biological function of these complex molecules.
The large volume of the space-grown crystals will help scientists     read the protein's blueprint and understand how it operates.     From this, they hope to develop versions that could be used in     future computers.

One of several stories summarizing results         from the 16-day Life         and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS), which flew June 20-July         7, 1996, aboard Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-78; left). It featured         40 scientific investigations from 10 countries. Its record development         and cost - each experiment cost about half of most Spacelab experiments         - make LMS an example of how future space station missions can         control experiments remotely from locations around the globe.         LMS results were recently published by NASA (see below). The         investigation in this story used the European Space Agency's         Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility.

Nature's sugar           high - Spacelab successfully crystallizes           an intensely sweet protein from the African Serendipity Berry           that has 3000 times the kick of table sugar - and no calories.
Great Bugs of           Fire Spacelab crystallizes a protein           from a very weird, and surprisingly common, volcano-loving bug.           Scientists hope to discover how these organisms can survive in           such extreme conditions.
Nature's "electronic           ink" Another extremophile - a           bacterium which thrives in high-salt conditions - produces a           fascinating protein which changes color extremely efficiently.           Crystals from Spacelab make scientists hopeful that they can           understand the biological function and apply it to, for example,           artificial retinas for people. (this story)
Biotechnology in space
Some estimates suggest that human biology         depends on the action of nearly half a million different enzymes         and proteins. In fewer than 1 case in 100, we have a three-dimensional         picture of shape and function of these complex chemicals. Since         1984, the Space Shuttle has carried experiments to determine         the structures of large, biologically important molecules. This         research has compiled results for a host of human diseases ranging         from insulin (for the control of diabetes) to one enzyme called         reverse transcriptase that can be blocked to inhibit HIV infection.
In comparing more than 33 such different biological         molecules crystallized on the Shuttle and also in similar conditions         on earth, space produced larger space crystals in 45% of the         cases and new structures in nearly 20% of the cases. As many         as half the space crystals had a 10% or better improvement in         the x-ray brightness or the crystallographic resolution. Both         are important to determining these large molecules' shape and         exact atomic positions.
