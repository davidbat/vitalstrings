What is Electronic Waste  or eWaste?
 
Many types of                  electronic                  products used in                  the workplace                  and homes                  contain                  hazardous                  substances like                  lead and                  mercury. When                  these products                  reach the end of                  their useful                  lives or become                  obsolete, some                  are considered                  hazardous waste.                  In general,                  hazardous waste                  may not be                  discarded in the                  regular trash.                  Instead, it must                  be sent to a                  facility that                  has a permit for                  treatment                  (including                  recycling),                  storage, or                  disposal.
Electronic                  hazardous wastes                  (e-wastes) are                  different from                  industrially                  generated                  hazardous wastes                  in that almost                  every                  individual,                  institution and                  business                  generates them.                  Proper                  management and                  recycling of                  e-waste poses                  lower risks than                  managing many                  industrial                  hazardous                  wastes.
How do I Know if                  my E-Waste is                  Hazardous?
 
 
State                  regulations                  require the                  generator of a                  waste to                  determine if it                  is a hazardous                  waste (this                  requirement is                  found in section                  66262.11 of                  title 22 of the                  California Code                  of Regulations).                  Wastes are                  hazardous waste                  when they                  exhibit one or                  more of the                  following                  characteristics:                  toxicity,                  ignitability,                  corrosivity or                  reactivity. Many                  electronic                  wastes exhibit                  the toxicity                  characteristic                  due to the lead                  content as well                  as other heavy                  metals.
In addition                  to the four                  hazardous waste                  characteristics,                  DTSC has listed,                  in regulation,                  specific wastes                  that are                  presumed to be hazardous and                  must be managed                  as hazardous                  waste. The law                  does allow                  individuals to                  test specific                  devices to                  determine                  whether or not                  they are                  hazardous.                  However, in the                  absence of                  testing, all                  wastes listed by                  DTSC are                  presumed to be                  hazardous.                  Several                  categories of                  e-waste are                  included in the                  list; these are                  listed below                  under the                  heading "How do                  I Know if my                  E-Waste is                  covered by the                  Electronic Waste                  Recycling Act?"
Law, Tests, Fact                  Sheets, and                  Reports on                  E-Wastes
How do I Know if                  my E-Waste is                  Covered by the                  Electronic Waste                  Recycling Act                  (and therefore                  needs to be                  handled                  differently?)
As part    of its implementation of the Electronic Waste Recycling Act. DTSC has    tested certain types of electronic devices to determine which would be    hazardous waste when discarded; only video display devices that DTSC "determines are presumed to be, when discarded, a hazardous waste" are    potentially covered by the Act. Currently these devices include:
cathode                     ray                     tube                     (CRT)                     devices                     (including                     televisions                     and                     computer                     monitors;
LCD                     desktop                     monitors;
laptop                     computers                     with                     LCD                     displays;
LCD                     televisions;                     and
plasma                     televisions.
portable                     DVD                     players                     with                     LCD                     screens                     (added                     December                     31,2006)
Note:    Many electronic wastes not covered    by the Electronic Waste Recycling Act are still considered hazardous    wastes and may not be discarded in the regular trash.
If a consumer purchases a "covered electronic device," the    retailer may require the consumer to pay the recycling fee on the    device. When the consumer discards a "covered electronic device," it    becomes a hazardous waste, called a "covered electronic waste." Qualified e-waste collectors and recyclers may receive cost    reimbursement from the fund established from the recycling fees for    their management of covered electronic wastes. (Since portable DVD    players with LCD screens greater than four inches in size did not become "covered electronic devices" until December 31, 2006, they are not    subject to the EWaste recycling fee until on and after July 1, 2007.)
