“The “global brain” is a metaphor for the intelligent network formed
by the people of this planet together with the knowledge and communication technologies that connect them together. The different approaches leading up to this conception, by authors such as Spencer, Otlet, Wells, Teilhard, Russell and Turchin, are reviewed in their historical order. The contributions are classified in three major
approaches: organicism, which sees society or the planet as a living system; encyclopedism, which aims to develop a universal knowledge network; and emergentism, which anticipates the evolution of a suprahuman level of consciousness. The shortcomings of each perspective lead us to propose an integrated approach, based on evolutionary cybernetics. Its selectionist logic allows us to analyse the process whereby initially selfish individuals self-organize into a
synergetic system functioning at a higher level of intelligence, making use of an advanced version of the world-wide web.”
First and foremost, this is an ongoing project!  It is rising from the collective imaginations of human beings who are carnally minded!  What ‘spirit’ governs the carnal mind?  If you’re a born anew Christian you should know the answer!

Research has been going on into neural interfaces that would provide a direct two-way connection between the human nervous system and computers for quite some time.  Could Somark’s chipless RFID tattoo be nothing less than a wireless direct neural interface?  Nanoscale electronic components can be printed on various substances using ‘electronic ink’ already, and thats exactly what this tattoo, or mark, is made of!  Could a human not be allowed access to the advanced World Wide Web, the ‘Global Brain’, without this tattoo, or something like it, in the near future?

Well, boys, what do you think?  Connecting the dots yet?

Ever heard of a BAN?  It stands for Body Area Network.  In the near future emerging technologies such as ‘Ambient Intelligent Environments’ will be enabled by nanotech electronic technologies, including and especially chipless RFID ink!  This, according to various reliable scientific sources, will open the way for the use of nano-scale devices attached to and/or implanted on, the human body.  Molecular computing allows biological and artificial components to communicate physical and psychological information received by scanners and sensors strategically placed which is rapidly ‘decoded’ and acted on!  This is artificial psuedo-telpathic communications!  The goal is to have everyones mind PERMANENTLY LINKED to the advanced Internet, and through this advanced Internet everyone else’s mind, creating the ‘Global Brain’.  Once this is accomplished, it is hoped that the content of a person’s brain, all the memories, thoughts, and feelings can be transferred to an even higher performance storage and processing system or device.  Not the ressurrection that Christ experienced is it!

This is very scary if you ask me.  I work for the government, and now our badges are microchiped so they know our comings and goings, when we log onto the computers, our websites, our keystrokes, everything.  I fear this is the next step as foretold.  I will never take the mark and would rather starve than do anything to dishonor myself before God.  I truly believed this was coming years ago, so I brought a farm with 40 acres and a fishing stream.  I plan on being self sufficient before this comes so that I can rely on my Father God to provide for me, not our government.  People wake up and smell the coffee.  It’s coming!

In case you haven’t noticed the leadership in this nation doesn’t want you, or anyone, to be ‘self-sufficient’!  The laws have already been created to make anyone who will not participate a threat.

this is fairly amusing…

I think the mark of the beast is here and it has been here for a very, very long time.  Think about it the bible tells us in revelation 13 that all humanity will be forced to take the mark by the hand or forehead: no one will be aloud to buy sell or trade without it….Well we all are given a socail securtity number by hand and some of us even memorize it in our heads….we also cant buy sell or trade without it..in order to make money you have to have a job that requires you social number that money then lets you buy witch  someday things you buy you then sell or trade so without that number you cant make money to do any of that…thats just my thought on that

Douglas, from Brazil, I also believe that the Mark will be made in ink, but with a kind of ink with magnetic properties that can be written and read by scanners all the information of the person to possess, will not be a chip implanted, because there would be resistance, but as the tattoo has been highly accepted by society, nobody will say no to a brand of paint that will bring social benefits, financial and global status.
Brazil, also awaiting the return of the Lord Jesus, Douglas, professor at the Rom .. Messianic teaching Brazilian Mission to bring Jesus to the Jews lost the house of Israel.
Grace and peace to the brothers of Jesus there.

Obviously, all of you guys missed something in Revelation 13:15-17…. There are Three Entirely Different Marks to be wary of!
#1 – “The Mark Of The Beast” [ or The RFID Implant].
#2 – “The Name Of The Beast” [Catholicism or Sunday Worship].
#3 – “The Number Of His Name” [Membership Within One Of Satan's Secret Brotherhoods].
The Mark is simple to understand; and in fact, most people get it. After all it is described as human invention made within that nation which rises up out of nowhere [ergo, The RFID ].
The Name is more difficult to understand; because, so very few of us realize that: “The Sabbath” – isn’t Sunday. Or that ‘Sunday Worship’ is called: “Baal Worship” – within The Old Testament Scriptures. A particularly detestable abomination according to Yahweh!
Finally, The Number is even more difficult to understand for most people; since they not only don’t believe in: “The Luciferian Conspiracy”, and its, “Secret Brotherhoods [The Illuminati, Freemasons, Wicca, Satanism, etc...]” – but they also don’t understand their commonly shared Occult Symbology.
Consequently, without opening your own Bibles, most of you will be lost! If you think that Spiritual Babylon’s Churches will help you to understand these things, then you’re already lost… and I’m deeply sorry for you. But, if you’ll Wake Up, then there is still time to learn these things for yourselves. It’s all up to you!

Jesus created a set number of angels. all angels are male. 1/3 of all angels rebelled against Jesus. Jesus turned the rebels into spiritual darkness (aka demons) and expelled them from heaven down to earth. all demons are male. demons disguise themselves as ghosts, aliens in ufos, greys, spirit guides, ascended masters, pagan gods and goddesses, channeled entities, dead relatives during seances, ouija board movers, psychic’s sources, medium’s source of info, astrologer’s helpers, seer’s well of info, oracle’s guide, automatic writing spirits, meditator’s cohabitors, and, of course, as the “good fellas” (angels of light). the only way to fight demons is to be a christian.
-demons will land their ufo ships on the streets and will invite people to be healed. whoever goes in, comes out a zombie.
-80 foot dinosaurs will come out through lakes and sinkholes to eat us.
-evil red-eye antichrist with white powder on his face will come to power. this clown is gay. whoever worships this clown, goes to hell.
-evil electronic 666 tattoo by lasers with small grey world passport will become mandatory. whoever gets it, goes to hell.
-whoever gets chipped is easily tracked to get lasered. so, avoid getting lasered by not getting chipped.
1)demons have 4 ufo bases:
a)moon
c)underneath mariana trench (atlantis is here)
d)lake baikal
2)airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus.
3)ufos are powered by diamonds.
4)whoever goes inside a ufo ship to be healed by demons, comes out a zombie
