Super Bowl week has officially started! In less than one week the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will square off in Dallas in Super Bowl XLV for the Lombardi Trophy. Get ready for a full week of coverage here at Cippin on Sports. Were kicking it off with a video tribute to Aaron Rodgers.
Aaron Rodgers in the new NFL “it” quarterback. Like all the others before him, he is being deified. He is being thrown into the discussion of being one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks . He does deserve it though. After all, he is NFL career leader in passer rating . What? Yes, I’m serious. Just another point to prove how useless that stat is, but it still doesn’t take away from Rodgers is doing. He’s the “it” quarterback right now. Just like Drew Brees was this time last year .
One thing that the media has fallen in love with is Rodger’s touchdown celebration . When Rodgers scores he pretends to put a championship belt on his waist. It has become so big that you can even bet on if he will do it in the Super Bowl . Early odds have “yes” at even money. One fan has has taken a liking of the celebration, and created a compilation of Rodgers doing it. He also adds a Prince like soundtrack in the background. It runs a little long but is definitely worth checking out. It also includes special guest appearances by B.J. Raji and Matt Flynn.
