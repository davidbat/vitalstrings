More about Justin Timberlake
Many years before he sang about the golden rule of three-ways on Saturday Night Live, Justin Timberlake enjoyed a Baptist upbringing in a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee. It was there that he gained an early appreciation for music through his father, who was the director of a choir at a local church. From there, the future star started singing on his own, but instead of embracing bubble gum pop right away, he was enamoured with country music. His liking for country twang was so strong that at age 11, he shared it with television audiences by singing under the name of Justin Randall on the pre-American Idol talent show favorite, Star Search.
More about Aaron Rodgers
Aaron Rodgers is no stranger to adversity. A native of Chico, California, this 6’2” signal caller was passed over by every major college in the nation, despite throwing for 4,419 yards over the course of his final two years of high school. Undeterred, Rodgers enrolled at nearby Butte College, where he led the Roadrunners to a sparkling 10-1 record and a NorCal Conference championship while throwing for 2,408 yards and 28 TDs. His eye-popping production earned him NorCal Conference and region MVP honors and third-team All-America mention from JC Grid-Wire.
