I was explaining the concept of excessive celebration penalties to my wife today while watching football. She doesn’t understand how it is okay for the players to dance around individually, but they are not allowed to do any multi-player/team celebrations.
Come to think of it, neither do I.
I mean I understand the rule, but the NFL now stands for the “No Fun League.” I love watching the endzone dances and creative ways the players come up with to have a good time. Then the dictator known as Roger Goodell tells them no more shenanigans in the endzone, and although we get some fun moments we don’t get those hilarious, laugh-out-loud touchdown dances that we were accustomed to seeing from Randy Moss, Ochocinco, and T.O.

My all-time favorite was when Saints wideout Joe Horn’s touchdown “dance” consisted of taking a hidden cell phone from the field goal pads to call his dad and tell him he scored a touchdown. I laughed so hard I fell out of a chair.
 
When Randy Moss fake mooned the Packer crowd after scoring a touchdown Joe Buck exclaimed it was a “disgusting act.” Obviously Joe Buck didn’t grow up with brothers if he considers a fake mooning disgusting.
 
And don’t even get me started about linemen recovering a fumble for a touchdown. Fat guy endzone dances are the best. Hands down, no question about it.
 
I would say my favorite touchdown dance these days is the Aaron Rodgers dance. No, not the discount double check; his championship belt dance.
 
As a casual wrestling fan, I like the championship belt they got him at the Super Bowl and I dig the dance. He has been dancing a lot lately as the Packers are now 10-0. I wouldn’t put it past them to add another title belt to his collection.

These are just the four celebrations that came to mind after my discussion with my wife. I’m sure I missed plenty.
