The Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers capped a brilliant playoff run with a 24-39, 304-yard, three-touchdown performance in the Packers’ 31-25 Super Bowl in over the Steelers , earning him MVP honors. And when that honor was officially bestowed on him, he celebrated in the way he’s quickly made famous.
Yes, the famed championship belt made an appearance. And really, it kind of had to. The guy just led his team to a Super Bowl championship – he’s more than earned his trademark celebration, not to mention a replica championship belt, which you’ll see him receive below (again, that had to happen eventually). And in case anyone doubts the guy’s motivation to be at his absolute best at all times, he even expressed disappointment the offense didn’t finish the Steelers off with a touchdown while being named Super Bowl MVP.
Video of the presentation – and celebration (the initial one happens at the 13-second mark; he gets the actual replica belt at about 1:13) – below. One announcer mentioned Rodgers will probably never have to endure another Brett Fare comparison. God, I hope not.
