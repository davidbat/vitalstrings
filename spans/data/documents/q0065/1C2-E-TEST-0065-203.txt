After the Packers defeated the Eagles on Sunday in the wild-card game, FOX Sports' Pam Oliver spoke with Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers . Not particularly newsworthy since postgame, on-field interviews happen every week. This time, though, things were a little different...
Eagles wideout and former University of California player DeSean Jackson comes out of nowhere to forearm shiver/chest-bump former Cal QB Rodgers -- mid-chat with Oliver -- before hugging him... and does both without saying a word. And as soon as Jackson had appeared, he vanished into the distance (and scene).
I had no idea Cal alums had such a strong bond. The only thing missing from the reunion was Marshawn Lynch flying through the frame .
