The NBA is doing an awesome job with the Knicks. Novak is an exciting player, the whole team looks like a group of improbable misfits. They have charisma. New York is a huge market. The NBA is finally getting back to basics as an entertainment product - find charismatic entertainers and have the refs cheat so those teams win. There was too much parity, too much emphasis on fairness and skill. Guys like Lin and Novak are much more interesting, it makes a better entertainment product.   My sugggestion is the NBA find some more improbable, interesting players, for example a short Hasidic Jewish man with incredible hops who can dunk, then give them the cushion of referee advantage they need to win. Imagine the finals - Lin and Novak versus the hopping Jew and maybe a one-armed man. Or maybe a huge Polynesian football player who can't shoot but pounds everybody for rebounds. That's entertainment. I might even watch the Finals if it was something like that.
