Just took the dog for a walk? Beltworthy. Made an omelet? Beltworthy. Watched your QB win the Super Bowl MVP? Absolutely Beltworthy.
The limited-edition #12 Championship buckles were uniquely designed to be unisex and be worn (shown off, really) for all occasions – from the everyday to, of course, Game Day. Perfect for a Rodgers fan, a Packer fan and definitely for anyone who is just a fan of doing “the belt.” Truly a unique (and awesome) Packers item to have, or to give as a gift.
Our buckles manufactured with special, high-quality grade zinc and possess universally appealing bright silver finish (to match the Lombardi trophy) and are made to LAST. Use with standard snap-adjust leather belts.If you need a belt, you can find hundreds of choices at Amazon ranging from $3 and up.  You can really personalize your style with green, brown, pink or classic black.
