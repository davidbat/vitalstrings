Miami (Oct. 17): Missed some practice time during the week due to the concussion, but returned to make his 38th straight start. Finished with 313 yards on 18-of-33 passing with a TD and an INT. Threw a career-long 86-yard TD pass to Jennings late in the first quarter, the longest completion by a Green Bay QB since Favre’s 99-yard scoring strike to WR Robert Brooks at Chicago on Sept. 11, 1995. On the final possession of regulation, engineered a 69-yard drive that he capped off with a sneak up the middle on fourth-and-goal from the 1 to send the game into OT…Vs. Dallas (Nov. 7): Registered a 131.5 passer rating on 27-of-34 passing for 289 yards and three TDs.

San Francisco (Dec. 5): Earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors as he completed 21-of-30 passes for 298 yards and three TDs for a 135.1 passer rating. It was his fourth straight contest with a 110-plus passer rating as he became the first NFL QB since the 1970 merger to accomplish that feat in consecutive seasons. Didn’t throw an INT for the fifth straight game, the first Packers QB to do so since Starr in 1966. Had a pair of TD passes over 55 yards for the first time in his career, connecting with Jennings for a 57-yard score in the second quarter and with Driver on a 61-yard TD in the third quarter that saw the veteran WR break several tackles on his way to the end zone…At Detroit (Dec. 12): Threw for 46 yards on 7-of-11 passing before departing due to a concussion. With just over three minutes remaining in the first half, scrambled for an 18-yard gain to the Green Bay 43 but took hits from S Amari Spievey and LB Landon Johnson, with his head hitting the turf. Took three more snaps before being replaced by Matt Flynn for the remainder of the game. Prior to his exit, saw his career-long streak of 181 attempts without an INT come to an end when a deep pass in the first quarter bounced out of Jennings’ arms and into Spievey’s. It was his first INT since his final throw of the first half vs. Minnesota in Week 7, a streak of 181 passes that put him at No. 2 in the team record books behind only Starr (294, 1964-65)…At New England (Dec. 19): Inactive due to the concussion, which snapped a streak of 45 consecutive starts that was the fourth-longest streak in the league among active QBs at that point…Vs. N.Y. Giants (Dec. 26): Returned to action and turned in one of the best outings of his career on his way to earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Threw for a regular-season career-high 404 yards on 25-of-37 passing while matching his career high with four TD passes. His yardage total was the most by a Green Bay QB in the regular season since Dickey’s 418-yard game vs. Tampa Bay (Oct. 12, 1980), and it was the first 400-yard, four-TD, zero-INT performance in franchise annals. It also marked the 10th time in his career that he threw three-plus TDs and zero INTs in a game, the most in NFL history by a QB within three seasons of his first start (Warner, nine, 1999-2001). Led the Packers to 515 total yards, the most since the team posted 548 at Oakland (Dec. 22, 2003). Big play was an 80-yard TD pass to Nelson in the second quarter as he became the first Packers QB to throw 80-yard TDs to two different players in a season since Starr in ’66…At Philadelphia (NFC Wild Card, Jan. 9): Led the Packers to his first postseason win with an efficient 18-of-27 outing for 180 yards and three TDs (122.5 rating). With seven TD passes in his first two postseason starts (four in ’09 Wild Card game at Arizona), set an NFL record, topping the previous mark of six TDs held by five other QBs…At Atlanta (NFC Divisional, Jan. 15): Had one of the finest playoff games by a QB in NFL playoff history, connecting on 31-of-36 passes for 366 yards and three TDs. His 136.8 passer rating was the highest in league postseason history among QBs with 35-plus attempts. The 31 completions and 86.1 completion percentage were franchise single-game postseason records, and the completion percentage ranks No. 1 in NFL history for QBs with 35-plus attempts. Scored on a 7-yard TD run and consistently avoided pressure to throw with accuracy outside the pocket. Became the first QB in NFL playoff history to throw for 350 yards, three TDs, zero INTs and rush for a TD in a game. Jennings, Nelson, Driver and Jones all had at least 75 yards receiving, the first foursome in NFL postseason history to do so. Completed all 10 of his third-down passing attempts for 151 yards. Helped lead the Packers to a franchise postseason-record 48 points. Combined with the 45-point outing at Arizona in the 2009 Wild Card contest, the Packers became the first team in NFL history to record 45 points in a game in consecutive postseasons. Those two games are the highest-scoring performances in team playoff annals. His three TD passes gave him 10 in his first three postseason starts, the most in NFL history as he surpassed George, Lamonica and Marino (nine each). Along with his 121.4 rating at Arizona in the ’09 playoffs and his 122.5 rating at Philadelphia the week before, became the first QB in NFL history to register a 120-plus rating in each of his first three postseason starts. Also became the first QB in NFL postseason history to throw for three-plus TDs in each of his first three playoff starts…At Chicago (NFC Championship, Jan. 23): Completed 17-of-30 passes for 244 yards, including seven completions of 20-plus yards. Rushed for 39 yards on seven carries (5.6 avg.), including a 1-yard TD on a bootleg run on the opening series. Was picked off twice in the contest, but made one of the key plays in the game following one of the INTs. Was intercepted by LB Brian Urlacher on third-and-goal at the Chicago 6 in the third quarter, but tripped up Urlacher, who otherwise had an open field, with a sliding tackle after a 39-yard return. Green Bay’s defense would force a punt three plays later…Vs. Pittsburgh (Super Bowl XLV, Feb. 6): Closed out his torrid postseason by earning Super Bowl MVP honors with a masterful performance in the world championship game. Completed 24-of-39 passes for 304 yards and three TDs. Joined Montana, Young and Jake Delhomme as the only QBs to throw for 300 yards and three scores in a Super Bowl. First TD pass came on a perfectly placed throw to Nelson for a 29-yard score. Threaded a pass into the hands of Jennings for a 21-yard TD in the second quarter with S Ryan Clark just missing the ball and S Troy Polamalu’s hard shot from behind failing to knock it free from the WR’s arms. Found Jennings once more in the back right corner of the end zone in the third quarter to extend the lead to 28-17. Perhaps his best throw of the game came on the Packers’ clock-killing drive late in the fourth quarter. On third-and-10 from the Green Bay 25, fired the ball to Jennings down the seam just beyond the outstretched arms of CB Ike Taylor as he hit the WR in stride for a 31-yard gain and a new set of downs. The drive burned 5:19 off the clock and set up a 23-yard Mason Crosby FG to extend the lead to 31-25, forcing Pittsburgh to drive for a TD instead of a game-tying FG.

Minnesota (Nov. 1): Connected on 26-of-41 attempts for 287 yards, three TDs (two to Havner, one to Jennings) and no INTs for a 108.5 rating.

The yardage total is tied for No. 5 in NFL playoff history, and his 319 yards passing after halftime set an NFL playoff record, eclipsing the previous mark of 274 yards set by Miami’s Dan Marino (at Buffalo, Dec. 30, 1995).

Dallas (Nov. 7): Registered a 131.5 passer rating on 27-of-34 passing for 289 yards and three TDs. Also rushed for 41 yards on five carries (8.2 avg.), including a season-long 27-yard run on the Packers’ first TD drive. Completed 16-of-18 passes to six different receivers for 174 yards and a pair of TDs in the first half as Green Bay built a 28-7 lead…At Minnesota (Nov. 21): Threw a regular-season career-high four TD passes, connecting on 22-of-31 passes for 301 yards for a season-high 141.3 passer rating.

Completed passes to eight different receivers, with Jennings, Jones and WR Jordy Nelson each posting five grabs. Engineered a 16-play, 90-yard drive late in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 17, operating out of the no-huddle for most of the drive. Found Jones for an 18-yard gain on a shovel pass to convert a fourth-and-1, and four plays later, found Nelson with a 10-yard bullet in the corner of the end zone to even the score…Vs. San Francisco (Dec. 5): Earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors as he completed 21-of-30 passes for 298 yards and three TDs for a 135.1 passer rating. It was his fourth straight contest with a 110-plus passer rating as he became the first NFL QB since the 1970 merger to accomplish that feat in consecutive seasons. Didn’t throw an INT for the fifth straight game, the first Packers QB to do so since Starr in 1966. Had a pair of TD passes over 55 yards for the first time in his career, connecting with Jennings for a 57-yard score in the second quarter and with Driver on a 61-yard TD in the third quarter that saw the veteran WR break several tackles on his way to the end zone…At Detroit (Dec. 12): Threw for 46 yards on 7-of-11 passing before departing due to a concussion. With just over three minutes remaining in the first half, scrambled for an 18-yard gain to the Green Bay 43 but took hits from S Amari Spievey and LB Landon Johnson, with his head hitting the turf. Took three more snaps before being replaced by Matt Flynn for the remainder of the game. Prior to his exit, saw his career-long streak of 181 attempts without an INT come to an end when a deep pass in the first quarter bounced out of Jennings’ arms and into Spievey’s. It was his first INT since his final throw of the first half vs. Minnesota in Week 7, a streak of 181 passes that put him at No. 2 in the team record books behind only Starr (294, 1964-65)…At New England (Dec. 19): Inactive due to the concussion, which snapped a streak of 45 consecutive starts that was the fourth-longest streak in the league among active QBs at that point…Vs. N.Y. Giants (Dec. 26): Returned to action and turned in one of the best outings of his career on his way to earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Threw for a regular-season career-high 404 yards on 25-of-37 passing while matching his career high with four TD passes. His yardage total was the most by a Green Bay QB in the regular season since Dickey’s 418-yard game vs. Tampa Bay (Oct. 12, 1980), and it was the first 400-yard, four-TD, zero-INT performance in franchise annals. It also marked the 10th time in his career that he threw three-plus TDs and zero INTs in a game, the most in NFL history by a QB within three seasons of his first start (Warner, nine, 1999-2001). Led the Packers to 515 total yards, the most since the team posted 548 at Oakland (Dec. 22, 2003). Big play was an 80-yard TD pass to Nelson in the second quarter as he became the first Packers QB to throw 80-yard TDs to two different players in a season since Starr in ’66…At Philadelphia (NFC Wild Card, Jan. 9): Led the Packers to his first postseason win with an efficient 18-of-27 outing for 180 yards and three TDs (122.5 rating). With seven TD passes in his first two postseason starts (four in ’09 Wild Card game at Arizona), set an NFL record, topping the previous mark of six TDs held by five other QBs…At Atlanta (NFC Divisional, Jan. 15): Had one of the finest playoff games by a QB in NFL playoff history, connecting on 31-of-36 passes for 366 yards and three TDs. His 136.8 passer rating was the highest in league postseason history among QBs with 35-plus attempts. The 31 completions and 86.1 completion percentage were franchise single-game postseason records, and the completion percentage ranks No. 1 in NFL history for QBs with 35-plus attempts. Scored on a 7-yard TD run and consistently avoided pressure to throw with accuracy outside the pocket. Became the first QB in NFL playoff history to throw for 350 yards, three TDs, zero INTs and rush for a TD in a game. Jennings, Nelson, Driver and Jones all had at least 75 yards receiving, the first foursome in NFL postseason history to do so. Completed all 10 of his third-down passing attempts for 151 yards. Helped lead the Packers to a franchise postseason-record 48 points. Combined with the 45-point outing at Arizona in the 2009 Wild Card contest, the Packers became the first team in NFL history to record 45 points in a game in consecutive postseasons. Those two games are the highest-scoring performances in team playoff annals. His three TD passes gave him 10 in his first three postseason starts, the most in NFL history as he surpassed George, Lamonica and Marino (nine each). Along with his 121.4 rating at Arizona in the ’09 playoffs and his 122.5 rating at Philadelphia the week before, became the first QB in NFL history to register a 120-plus rating in each of his first three postseason starts. Also became the first QB in NFL postseason history to throw for three-plus TDs in each of his first three playoff starts…At Chicago (NFC Championship, Jan. 23): Completed 17-of-30 passes for 244 yards, including seven completions of 20-plus yards. Rushed for 39 yards on seven carries (5.6 avg.), including a 1-yard TD on a bootleg run on the opening series. Was picked off twice in the contest, but made one of the key plays in the game following one of the INTs. Was intercepted by LB Brian Urlacher on third-and-goal at the Chicago 6 in the third quarter, but tripped up Urlacher, who otherwise had an open field, with a sliding tackle after a 39-yard return. Green Bay’s defense would force a punt three plays later…Vs. Pittsburgh (Super Bowl XLV, Feb. 6): Closed out his torrid postseason by earning Super Bowl MVP honors with a masterful performance in the world championship game. Completed 24-of-39 passes for 304 yards and three TDs. Joined Montana, Young and Jake Delhomme as the only QBs to throw for 300 yards and three scores in a Super Bowl. First TD pass came on a perfectly placed throw to Nelson for a 29-yard score. Threaded a pass into the hands of Jennings for a 21-yard TD in the second quarter with S Ryan Clark just missing the ball and S Troy Polamalu’s hard shot from behind failing to knock it free from the WR’s arms. Found Jennings once more in the back right corner of the end zone in the third quarter to extend the lead to 28-17. Perhaps his best throw of the game came on the Packers’ clock-killing drive late in the fourth quarter. On third-and-10 from the Green Bay 25, fired the ball to Jennings down the seam just beyond the outstretched arms of CB Ike Taylor as he hit the WR in stride for a 31-yard gain and a new set of downs. The drive burned 5:19 off the clock and set up a 23-yard Mason Crosby FG to extend the lead to 31-25, forcing Pittsburgh to drive for a TD instead of a game-tying FG.

Minnesota (Nov. 1): Connected on 26-of-41 attempts for 287 yards, three TDs (two to Havner, one to Jennings) and no INTs for a 108.5 rating.
