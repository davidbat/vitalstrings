 Aaron Rodgers plays for the Green Bay Packers in the National Football League, and was born on December 2, 1983 in Chico, California.  He was the 24th pick in the first round of the NFL Draft in 2005 by the Packers.  Prior to the 2008-2009 season, Rodgers has been the team’s second quarterback behind Brett Favre .  As starting quarterback for the last two seasons, Rodgers has proven himself to be extremely valuable with impressive statistics in pass and rush yardage.  He signed a 6-year extension with the team on October 31, 2008 for $65 million through the 2014 season.
 
In his earlier years, Rodgers began to show notable statistics in high school, setting records in passing and touchdowns.  As a sophomore in college, he started some games as quarterback for the University of Berkeley, and helped lead his team to an 8-6 record for the season.  He also set the team record for the lowest percentage of intercepted passes.  As a junior, he lead the team to a near perfect record, losing only one regular game for the season.  He has received several honors and awards in 2003 and 2004 for his outstanding achievements in the sport of football.
 
While in the NFL, his performances in the regular season earned him a spot in the Pro Bowl in 2009 as third quarterback behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre.  Due to certain circumstances, Rodgers was able to be the starting quarterback for the Pro Bowl representing the National Football Conference (NFC).   In the end, however, the NFC ultimately lost the game.
