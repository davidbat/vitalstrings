Feb 8, 2011 - 11:24 AM
Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on the "Late Night with David Letterman Show" on CBS on Monday night. The Super Bowl MVp was presented with a WWE Championship title belt by Letterman. "The belts really caught on," Rodgers said before spinning the title belt. "It's just a celebration that started in practice really, and the fans love it." To watch the footage, head to CBS.com .
Powell's POV: For those who missed it this morning, WWE has has invited Rodgers and his teammates to tonight's Smackdown taping in Green Bay. The tapings will begin roughly 90 minutes after the Super Bowl parade is scheduled to end. WWE is getting a lot of free publicity from the Packers and their title belt love.
