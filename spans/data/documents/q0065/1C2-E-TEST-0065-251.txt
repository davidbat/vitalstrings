ASHWAUBENON - Members of the Green Bay Packers were special guests on “WWE Friday Night SmackDown.”
The show was taped Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon. When a handful of Packers showed up, the crowd was loving it! Clay Matthews, Bryan Bulaga, Scott Wells, Tom Crabtree, Matt Wilhelm, and Graham Harrell were special guests at the event. When the lights went out, between matches, the crowd randomly chanted "Go Pack Go" and "We Want Clay." For fans of WWE and the Packers, Tuesday was the perfect combination of events.
“(The) Green Bay Packers have been celebrating touchdowns and big plays by motioning to a title around their waist during the Packers amazing quest to the Super Bowl. Now, Packer players will get their own WWE titles to wear," WWE officials said in a statement.
"Aaron Rodgers has been doing the championship belt for a while but we all know the best belts come from the WWE of course so I just had to put on my own little Green Bay touch. It's my own belt here," said Brad Borchardt of Iron Mountain, Michigan, as he showed off his belt with a "G" in the center.
During the show, cameras showed the Packers players on the big screen in the front row, and then they, and the audience took in the rest of the show.
The episode that was taped Tuesday is scheduled to air on Friday on the Syfy network.
