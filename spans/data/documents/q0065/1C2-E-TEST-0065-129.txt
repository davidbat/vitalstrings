Last night, the Green Bay Packers edged the New Orleans Saints in a game that made us all very happy that we have NFL football back. In that contest, last year’s Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers looked like he might the best player in football. Not just the best QB, but best football player alive.
And as usual, every time Rodgers is on national television, I look at this site’s traffic stats and I see two phrases “Aaron Rodgers Gay” and “Is Aaron Rodgers Gay?” driving more traffic to TSB. During the postseason these search numbers increased, peaking at the Super Bowl of course. Despite the women he’s been linked to, lots of people out there seem to think Rodgers is a homosexual.
I’m telling you now that we will not attempt to answer the question of Rodgers’ sexual orientation here. In fact, I’m not even going to venture a guess about whether Rodgers is straight or gay. What I am going to do is present what we do know about his personal life, and ultimately why none of that has anything to do with why he could be the NFL MVP this season.
