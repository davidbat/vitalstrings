Aaron Rodgers celebrates touchdowns like a superstar

Aaron Rodgers is on the verge of becoming a superstar NFL quarterback. He's had back-to-back stellar playoff performances and has the Green Bay Packers one win away from returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1997.
Plus, he's even got his own touchdown celebration:
 
OK, so it's no Ickey Shuffle , but Rodgers has garnered some attention by pretending to put on a championship belt after scoring touchdowns. Last weekend, Atlanta Falcons defensive end John Abraham mocked the celebration after sacking Rodgers, who had already notched a pair of touchdown passes in putting his team up, 28-14, to start the third quarter.
Rodgers told Tom Mulhern of the Wisconsin State Journal that he means no harm. He said the mime routine started as a way to amuse teammates on the sideline -- a position Rodgers is very familiar with after three years as Brett Favre's backup.
"A lot of times, on the scout team, you've got guys who wish they were starters, or older guys who aren't playing, or important backups who might not want to put as much effort into the scout team as you do as a quarterback trying to make that your whole game," Rodgers said. "So, I just tried to make it fun. So, the celebrating kind of grew and the guys enjoyed it."
With a win over Chicago in Sunday's NFC championship game and a victory in Super Bowl XLV, Rodgers will be able to replace the imaginary championship belt with a real championship ring -- and will likely solidify his status as a superstar quarterback.
