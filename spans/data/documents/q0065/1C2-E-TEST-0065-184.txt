Is Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers playing beautiful music with Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott? We don’t know but they they sure look good dancing together in this paparazzi photo courtesy of TMZ.com.
The pic was reportedly taken at the Vanity nightclub at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. TMZ sources say the two were very “coupley” whatever that means. Touching, hugging, and kissing perhaps? Or does “coupley” mean wink wink wink and nudge nudge nudge. Ah, we’re getting silly. Anyhoo, what do you think, about these two dating? And are they really dating or are they just friends sharing a lovely night? We hope its the latter because we’d like to have the football quarterback for ourselves. Hehe. Silly us, as if that’s gonna happen.
Last year, he was reportedly to have dated this silly girl:
Who’s the bimbo? And why is she posing in her underwear? Is Aaron Rodgers dating her because of her underwear, that’s why she’s, like, showing it to us?
Well, it turns out that the bimbo is not just a bimbo. She is a model and an heiress too. Her name is Julie Henderson and she’s reportedly the granddaughter of Samuel Henderson who, according to her publicist (via Gawker), invented the Henderson grapefruit in the 1960′s and built an empire in Texas. We’re guessing that means you can think of Julie, being an heiress and all, as the Paris Hilton of the modeling world.
UPDATE: Aaron Rodgers Shirtless Photos
Hello googlers who are looking for Aaron Rodgers’ shirtless pics, we’re afraid these are the closest thing to shirtlessness we’ll ever see from the Green Bay Packers quarterback. Maybe he’s shy, maybe shirtlessness is not his thing, maybe he’s got an ugly tattoo, or maybe he’s got a big mole covering his chest? Whatever reason, Aaron is obviously not the shirtless kind of guy.
