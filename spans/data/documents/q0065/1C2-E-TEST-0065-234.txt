——————-
After making memories with his heroic play in Super Bowl XLV, what is Aaron Rodgers going to do next? In the frenzied moments just after his team claimed the National Football League championship Sunday night in Dallas, Aaron stood in front of a TV camera and shouted five words that have become an almost iconic reaction to milestone achievements: “I’m going to Disney World !”
Aaron’s pronouncement, part of the production for one of TV’s most enduring and celebrated commercials, was captured after the Green Bay Packers’ 31-25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers – a game during which Aaron threw three touchdown passes and was named MVP.
On Monday, Aaron Rodgers will celebrate the Packers’ big win with a Super Bowl Victory Parade down Main Street U.S.A. at the Magic Kingdom .
This is the 25th year of the “I’m going to Disney World” commercials.   The campaign pays tribute to personal achievements of athletes and continues to be an iconic celebration as only Disney can do.
