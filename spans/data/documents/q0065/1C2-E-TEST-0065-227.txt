5. Total receiving yards for Hines Ward: Over 42.5 (-125) or Under 42.5 (-105)?
6. Total rushing/receiving yards for John Kuhn: Over 17.5 (-115) or Under 17.5 (-115)?
7. Total passing yards for Aaron Rodgers: Over 275.5 (-135) or Under 275.5 (+105)?
8. Total receiving yards for James Jones: Over 39.5 (-125) or Under 39.5 (-105)?
9. Total tackles/assists for Clay Matthews: Over 4.5 (-115) or Under 4.5 (-115)?
10. How many times will FOX mention Brett Favre on TV during the game? Over 2.5 (-160) or Under 2.5 (+120)?
The key here is that either Joe Buck or Troy Aikman have to say "Brett Favre" in its entirety for it to count. "Favre," "The Old Gunslinger," "Number Four" and "The Guy Who Sends Inappropriate Text Messages" do not count toward the total.
11. Which will be higher on February 6, 2010, Ben Roethlisberger's Completions or Paul Pierce's Points?
On Sunday, Paul Pierce plays the Orlando Magic, a very bad team on defense, but Pierce is averaging only 16 points per game against the Magic and 19 points per game overall. Roethlisberger's completed 19 passes or more in six of his last eight games and the Steelers are much more of a passing team than people give them credit for.
12. Will a punt hit the scoreboard? Yes (+750)
13. Will a Steelers player do the Aaron Rodgers championship belt celebration during the game? Yes (+115) or No (-155)?
When Rodgers was on the Packers practice squad, he would gesture like his was wearing a wrestling belt if he made a big play. He kept the celebration when he became the starting quarterback, and now every time he makes a big play, he shows off the fake belt. During the course of the season, a few defenders have mimicked the celebration, and the Steelers have enough swagger on defense with LaMarr Woodley, James Harrison and Larry Foote that this bet is a near lock if one of them sacks or even tackles Rodgers. The only hard part is going to be catching the elusive quarterback.
14. Will there be a defensive or special teams touchdown? Yes (+140) or No (-170)?
15. What color will the Gatorade be that is dumped on the head coach of the winning team?
Blue (5-1)
