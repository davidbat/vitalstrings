Players that play as little as Seton Hall’s Peter Dill rarely get noticed, but few bench-warmers playing basketball in the NCAA can bring what Dill brings every night when his Pirates are on the court; an abundance of energy via his over-exuberant celebrations.
With only eight career minutes played, Dill was able to catch the eye of some when he was spotted performing his Aaron Rodgers belt celebration from the bench during last year’s Big East Tournament.  He was at it once again during Seton Hall’s 75-63 victory over No. 8 Connecticut on Tuesday night, as he pulled out the “booty slap”, the “down-low fist-pump”, and the “Thor hammer.”
ESPN captured it all.  You can check it out in the video below.
