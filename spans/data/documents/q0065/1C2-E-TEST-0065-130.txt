It was down for a couple hours and the only real difference I see is the change in statuses and the "Recently Updated" column to the right has teams instead of players on it.  
BTW- to help everyone know when I post as opposed to someone else (since the statuses are screwed up), I added a nickname on here.  (I was the anonymous Legend that has been posting here.)
