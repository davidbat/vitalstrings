Rodgers and the Pack whipped the Falcons.  They should have plenty of confidence without Roddy’s comments.
And what do you expect from one of the best receivers in the game?  He needs to show that he is confident as well.
All this to say, who gives a damn what these guys say to each other.  The Falcons don’t like the Pack and vice-versa.  It is amazing that these professionals need to draw motivation from comments from the other team.

Obviously the FalCONs have a short memory.  You got owned in the playoffs. Deal with it. No Rowdy Roddy White, you weren’t better than the Packers then, and you’re definitely not better than the Packers now. I’m surprised Rodgers even responded to this idiot.  Stupidity seems to flow through his veins – from the “Free Mike Vick” shirt he revealed after scoring a touchdown in 2007, to the stupid comments he made on Twitter about New Orleans and the Saints (and how many championships have the FalCONs won?), he is clearly a person who is thought to be a fool and removes all doubt by opening his mouth.

Roddy, open mouth, now stick foot in it. Roddy is right of course (sarcasm) because the Falcons had a better record than the Packers during the regular season and even beat them in Atlanta in their first meeting. So the better team based on their record were destroyed by an inferior opponent (if we take White at his word) at Atlanta in a playoff game  which doesn’t say a lot for White, his team or their coaching staff. But this season the Packers are the better team with a 4-0 record and the Super Bowl Champs while Atlanta is not as good as last year. Good luck Roddy because you’ll need it. Just keep talking thrash.

i’m sorry to all the Packers fans, but what would you have said when your team was 13-3 playing the #6 seed at home? on paper they WERE the better team. Green Bay proved themselves in the game, but a 13-3 team with a home record like Matt Ryan’s, they should have won. Clearly Green Bay has become the better team now though.
emoney826 says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:21 PM
Whether or not White thinks he’s reaching for motivation, he pissed off a guy who is going to embarrass the falcons defense. White better hope his offense can keep up. The falcons were and still are over rated.
bigslizzle4twizzle says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:23 PM
Im a Falcons fan and I will be the first to say that Green Bay is the best team in the league by a mile. Atlanta has a decent offense but a swiss cheese defense. In no way would ATL want to give the Packers bulletin board material. Roddy was by no means saying that Atlanta is better than GB he was just saying that Atlanta is better than how they played in the playoffs last year. That is apparent they were blown out in the playoffs but beat GB in the regular season. Im sure ATL respects GB. They have to after the beatdown they were handed in the playoffs. On the other side of the coin this is football and Aaron Rodgers has to realize that teams are coming to play a football game and not to kiss the rings.
oldgil says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:23 PM
This motivational stuff is interesting. My theory is that a particular teams more driven players try to fire up their lazy teammates, who are not feeling naturally obligated to playing their best for pay, fans, etc, by appealing to a more simple “defend your manhood” mechanism.
Don’t tell me that this kind of nonsense makes any kind of difference to Aaron Rodgers.

You are clearly one of those nimrods that repetitively whines about how “THEY ALL SHOULD JUST SHUT UP AND PLAY THE GAME,” but if every pro athlete heeded your advice than we wouldn’t have much to comment about on this site. Despite their idiocy, Cromarties and Ochocincos KEEP THINGS INTERESTING.

Nothing wrong with what White said. I’m pretty sure every player felt like they let their fans down after playing a fairly mistake-free regular season, so I’m not sure what they expected him, or any other player on the team to say afterward. They got to the playoffs and were unable to do what got them there in the first place – control the clock, pressure the QB and finish plays. I truly hope Sunday night’s game is more like their regular season matchup from last year, but I won’t hold my breath. Rodgers and the GB offense is phenomenal – I’ll be there firsthand.
shecklesmckenzie says:

@ TominMilwaukee:
Wait wait wait, let me get this straight…..You are saying, that Aaron Rodgers, the guy that has been killing it all season and the guy that smoked the Falcons last year, is going to put up big numbers against an Atlanta defense, the crappy defense that let Tarvaris Jackson throw for 300+ and hasn’t had a sack in 3 weeks???
Your analysis is impressive.  Should I start Rex Grossman this week?  He is on a bye, but maybe you have some insight there.  Also, I don’t know if I should start Calvin Johnson or Early Ducet.  I can only pick one.  Please help me!
captaincanoe says:

I think the Falcons 13-3 record was the only fluke last season. They beat the Packers by 3 and Ravens by 4. Besides that they beat up on the likes of Cle, Cinn, SF, Car x 2, etc.

Aaron is a great QB but he has his insecurities.  He wines about Sanchez being on GQ, he wines about Favre not giving him enough love, he wines about the Falcons not “respecting” him after a big win.   I suppose we’ll hear about how he felt dissed by writers when Brady ends up with another league MVP.
Oct 7, 2011 12:40 PM
@emoney826,
If Rodgers has to manufacture motivation from something a WR said last season, than he isn’t as motivated as advertised.
There was nothing disrespectful about what White said.
BTW, you should listen to what GB players have to say about their opponents after a loss. Driver said nearly the same thing as White said after the Patriots beat them.

If you were Rodgers and a team that you smoked said that they’re still better than you, would you not respond to that? Facts are facts. They had a better record last year but BARELY beat us the first game. And then they were embarrassed in the playoffs. The packers were the better team with many bumps in the road last year. The falcons were relatively injury free last year and played over their heads.
acmepacker says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:56 PM
All the comments about Rodgers being whiny are being made by people who didn’t see what he went through when he took over from Favre.  He got hate mail, people offered to fight him, was called horrible names and had his ability and manhood questioned, not only in Green Bay but all over the league.  He didn’t say anything, just went out a played crazy good football and earned even his worst critics respect.  He might be driven, but he’s proven he can take it.
thejuddstir says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:56 PM
Now we need to have “Clay n Rod n Greg n Jamarcus” and the rest of the team step up and defend poor Aaron by making comments to support his comments…….kinda like the big brother sticking up for the little brother. I have yet to see a Rodgers comment that didn’t require his babysitters to stick up for him…….gone is Brett but now we get to deal with Aaron. If Rodgers wants to be considered in the same class as a Brady or Manning then he needs to shut up and just let his play do the talking for him and not his teammates. I don’t really care what all the Packer fans want to comment, Rodgers is a GREAT QB but also a big baby.
childressrulz says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:57 PM
Nothing wrong with what Rodgers said either. If he doesn’t feel as though he is respected he will get respect one way or another. I think Rodgers just wants players and coaches to tell the truth and that is not only that they respect him but that they honestly fear Rodgers (you know they do). A game with Rodgers could wind up getting a coach fired and they know that. Say some asinine thing like we are better than the world champs and expect to get taken out to the wood shed. Seeya sunday.
tjstyles says:
Oct 7, 2011 12:59 PM
Packers are the better team, but what is White supposed to say? “We lost because the Packers are better”?  Anything short of saying “the better team won” could be taken as “disrespecting” the Packers, and anything giving credit to the Packers for playing better can be taken as him bashing his own team.  It’s a lose-lose situation.
annnann says:

judsonjr says:
Oct 7, 2011 1:03 PM
I’m a Packers fan, but I think that for the most part the Falcons played better than the blowout score indicated.  Ryan made a stupid play at the end of the half, and the Packers marched on their 1st drive of the second and suddenly what looked like a 4 point game at the half was a whipping.
Really I think this game will come down to turnovers and Special Teams.  Both teams will get their yards/points but who is going to make the big play or gaffe that swings the game.   If neither team turns it over, my bet is that whoever has the ball last wins.
In any case it will be great to not have watch the Curtis Painter led Colts in a national TV game

Oct 7, 2011 1:39 PM
The Falcons were not 13-3 for no reason last year.
And if you recall The Packers did just squeak into the playoffs and some of that was based on other teams resting players.
(which brings to mind that you should be careful what you wish for when you try to help a percieved ‘weaker’ team get into the playoffs.)
The Falcons did not play at their best that night.  They played terrible.   The Packers did play their best that night.   And really that is all that matters.  The Pack won the game and advanced.  The goal in the NFL is not to be the better team for the year.  The goal is to win the Super Bowl. (That’s why I perfer limited teams making the playoffs.  Helps the odds that the best team does win the title)
So at the time the 6 seed that barely got into the playoffs beat the #1 seed.   Of course it is reasonable for a player on the 13-3 team to feel the better team did not win.
If White said the Falcons of October 2011 are better then the Packers of October 2011, THAT would be worth questioning.  But he said it about a 13-3 team and a wild card team after the 13-3 team played their worst game of the year.

Agreed. I always thought that Rodgers was every bit as arrogant and  as big as of a jerk as either Cutler or Rivers.
I am not sure why Rodgers gets a pass. I remember the playoff game between the Packers and the Cards, and the AZ defensive line went after Rodgers hard because he is arrogant and disrespectful. He hadn’t won a playoff game and he did that belt celebration.
The guy is as big of a jerk as any other QB you put him up against.

here we go again with this cry baby.
i swear, if the other team isn’t licking his knob, then they are disrespectiN””!
does he need everybody to worship the ground he walks on?
‘oh well, they, they didn’t say we were the best team of the century, so they have no class. they are sore losers.’
does he just browse press clippings looking for a reason to be so angry at everything?

I live in cheeseland as a vikings fan.  Plenty of great people and I understand the whole support your team thing -but the cheesers on this blog are over the top.  Maybe I’m biased, but it seems the vikes’ bloggers offer more football analysis and the cheddarheads just want to make things personal.  They’ve got the better team (for now) so why all the hate?  Cue the haters, I know….

he’s from california. so he probably needs the world to revolve around him 24/7.

I am not sure why Rodgers gets a pass. I remember the playoff game between the Packers and the Cards, and the AZ defensive line went after Rodgers hard because he is arrogant and disrespectful. He hadn’t won a playoff game and he did that belt celebration.
The guy is as big of a jerk as any other QB you put him up against.

This isn’t worth whining about, Rodgers.
Tom Brady is called expletives from his opponents and he doesn’t cry about it.
Obviously, u r a patsy fan…do u live in New England?  Lil Tommy Brady is the biggest whiner in the NFL…the sissy ducks when there’s no one near him (play-off loss vs Jets last year).  Rodgers isn’t whining, just answering a question he was asked.  I am so hoping for a Packers vs patsies SB XLVI match up…living in NE when Packers won SB XXXI was awesome…can only imagine what SB XLVI celebration would be like.  If you read this site, read who the players talk about being the biggest whiner…Brady…every eff’n time he gets hit he is beggin’ for a flag…typical.

___________________________________ Wow…u r even more of an idiot than I thought!  Rodgers got facemasked on that last play in the AZ play-off game and you never read/saw anything about him bitching about the non-call.  In fact, he manned-up and took upon his own shoulders.  To call Rodgers arrogant and disrespectful is to only show ur own.  Educate urself b4 u come on this board and post ur snot-sniveling crap.

“And if you recall The Packers did just squeak into the playoffs and some of that was based on other teams resting players.”
Yes, they squeaked into the playoffs, but name one team they played that rested their starters.  The Bears played their starters from the kickoff to Cutler’s last second interception.  You can try to argue unprovable things like subconsciously, the Bears weren’t as motivated because they already had the division and 1st round bye, but don’t act like teams lied down.  For example, the Giants needed to beat the Packers to get in and they got whipped.

Doesn’t matter if it’s a perceived slight or not.  There’s a few things you need to know about this game.
1. Atlanta’s secondary is not any better than last year yet.
2. Their pass rush has been insignificant.
3. This is a dome.
4. Jermichael Finley, Ryan Grant are here this year
5. Aaron Rodgers has extra motivation for this game (Roddy White, Brett Favre)
If he doesn’t put up a 135+ Passer rating it will be a surprise to me.
Oct 7, 2011 3:05 PM
yikes. when will teams/players learn not to give #12 ANY sort of motivation?

I love Aaron Rodgers and think he’s the best QB in the NFL today…..that said, he sure is a sensitive fella. Maybe he needs to tone it down a bit.
I mean it’s his right and maybe he gets a mic to his face a lot more than in years past but seriously….that chip on the shoulder is getting ridiculous.

boiler72,
At 10, I wasn’t following any NFL team. In my free time, I played violin and was in my school’s orchestra. Sorry.
I begin following the Patriots when I saw Drew Bledsoe play.
Also, you probably shouldn’t “LOL” your own inane sentences. It’s like an idiot laughing at his own unfunny jokes.
You Packer fans are incredibly fragile bunch.

All this trash talking by dudes getting paid millions to play a kids’ game has become very tedious. I kinda miss the days when you turned on CBS 30 minutes before the game, you got a few live shots from the home stadiums and some tips from Jimmy the Greek, and they played the damn games.
———————————————————
Jimmy the greek? You must be old. If it bothers you that much then stop reading about. Stop watching it on TV. If it is so tedious then find another sport to follow. It’s that easy.

All you morons hating on rodgers are just jealous he’s not on your team. There is nothing to criticize him about.
And to the turds saying he has thin skin?? How many times has he been asked a question about favre and how many times did he give you an answer you hoped he’d say? Just the other day, he was asked about favres comments. And what did he say? Nothing but compliments to his ENTIRE team for winning the super bowl. He’s not arrogant or all about himself. He’s about winning and not trying to put the spotlight on him.

Any perceived disrespect the Packers feel the Falcons have for them should be taken out on the field. Rogers needs to let his play speak for him. Nothing is served by speaking out about something like this. The Packers are the league’s most dominant team right now but it’s a long season and things can change. Complaining about lack of respect makes Rogers come across as a bit arrogant. Beat the Falcons soundly and then make a comment about the team not showing you enough respect.

Once upon a time, the NFL had real men who played quarterback.  There names were Baugh, Graham, Unitas, Starr.  These are guys that took every nasty hit a defensive player could give them and they got up, went to the huddle and called the next play.
Today’s quarterbacks are made of glass!  Yeah, they might throw the ball a million miles, but they are no more real football players then punters!!
If Rodgers, Manning, Brees, Vick, etc…had to look over the line and see Dick Butkus, Deacon Jones or Alan Page coming after them, they’d have to change their panties after every series.
So, to ALL the so-called quarterbacks playing in the NFL today…shut the hell up, you wusses!!

Rodgers has to be the most thin-skinned quarterback in the league. Any hint of criticism and he’s all over it, using it as motivation. How about just doing your job and not worrying about what people say?
——————————————————
Most Thinned Skin…………are you kidding me. With all he put up with during the Favre situation. No QB other than Steve young replacing Montana has had to put up with so much. Montana went about his buisness and never went to a division rival
Aaron Rodgers has to be about the coolest customer around.
If by chance you don’t think he’s doing his job, look at his stats the last 10 games. No QB has ever put up those type of numbers

I think that contest was a bit big for the Atlanta franchise & their hubris will not allow them to accept defeat.  White’s missing an opportunity of introspection.
I just don’t see the Falcons as a team that performs well on A big stage.  More sour grapes from Atlanta!
Guess when Rodgers is tightening his belt buckle as defending Superbowl Champ people will have to invent another excues.  Let’s see. . .the Pack’s unfair advantage is NOT participating in offseason workouts. . .

————————————that sums it up quite well vadog!!! To compare these skirts nowdays to what it meant to be a real qb, tells me that these people don’t really know what they’re talkin’ about and that’s somewhat surprising coming from “green bay” where they have one of the oldest franchises. Can you imagine what the really great qb’s would do if they could’ve wore skirts and not have a defensive back even cough in the direction of their wr?? Not to mention the roids and HGH that players use today. kinda like comparing Babe Ruth with Barry Bonds!!!!

yeah, cause when it came to a player or two not being able to go to a field trip during the preseason, viking bloggers (the ones that didn’t vanish after the 2010 season) were offering very insightful football analysis and not teaming up and taking whatever little shots they could at the Packers and their fans…talk about being bitter… why all the hate? your team is irrelevant.

—————–
Rodger’s Game Stats in the Packer 22-14 win over the Falcons:
26/39, 396yds, 2 TD, O Int.
Relatively speaking, Rodgers could’ve played better. He only had a passer rating of 117, which is below his average.
