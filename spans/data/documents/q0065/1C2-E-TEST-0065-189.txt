Maybe he is gay and he is using her to cover it up? Maybe she's being a good friend. Not saying he is, but it has been brought up before, I don't really know if people were serious though. He does spend a significant amount of time with Kevin.

I dont doubt that he has his reasons. As I am sure she has hers for staying with him if they are still together. But I have issues with it.
For him to say "I am single" when he clearly was/is not makes him out to be a douche bag. Any women I know would kick the ass to the curb. You dont do that to someone that you love or care about. You are showing a serious lack of respect to the women in question and relationship. If he did/does it to protect her, yes that is sweet but like legend said if its not creating its desired effect for him then try something else.
And for her to go along with it really raises questions about her for me. It shows that either she really is this golddigger that some people try and make her out to be. And I say this bc if you have a ounce of self respect why on earth would you put up with beig treated like a toy? Or that she has serious self respect issues and thinks that this is "normal" to be treated like a play toy or that this is what you need to do to be with a man.
Now I dont know why she stays or went along with it nor do I know why he says what he says but this is a issue I have always had with their relaitonship.

I dont ever buy that someone is single till they are married, I get the concept of it. But I dont think you just wake up one day and say "hunny I love you, wanna get married and make our realtionship official" A relationship and commited feelings take time to build and you dont get that by just being casual. Atleast thats how I feel about it.

While I may not be 100% certain of his intention when he said he was single, I don't think that Aaron's intention is to mock or disrespect Destiny by saying he's single and I certainly don't think he's having a good laugh at her expense... he doesn't hate the girl after all if he is indeed in a relationship with her.  I'm assuming his mother taught him to respect women.  It could be something as simple as that his intentions were good, but it didn't have the desired effect.

Soph, when you first got here, you called people names and weren't very nice at all.  Since you decided to give it a shot and not act in a bullying way, you have been extremely civil and I appreciate it.  Before then, however, please understand you weren't.  The poster read your previous comments in the history and it left a bad taste in her mouth and colored her reaction to your current post.  It's an unfortunate consequence.
That being said, my comment about the name-calling and being a royal ass was actually more of a general statement and not pointed towards any specifc person.  Reading back over it, and I can see it could be taken like that.  I should have been clearer, I apologize.

I didn't think Soph's comment was bitter at all.  Although I do agree that when someone tries to defend Destiny by name-calling and being a royal ass, it just puts the people here on the defensive and they are more inclined to bash her just to piss the one who's trying to defend her off.  I've had that urge multiple times with some of the more aggressive defenders in the past and I don't even think that badly of Destiny.

Just makes her an average girl, nothing special so where is the point in talking about her if she's irrelevant? Nothing rude about that. Why are you so angry?

At soph, honestly the way that you respond with such bitterness day after day makes ppl want to "bash"  destiny to just spite you. If you care about her at least show that you do. The constant attack shows that all you want is a fight and at her expense. If you were defending me, hypothetically, I would tell you to not do it anymore because ...simply you are not being a friend.

The relationship could have fizzled out by now, who knows?  The only ones that know for sure that the two are currently in a relationship and how serious it is is the two themselves, their family and close friends.

I understand athletes that keep their wives out of the spotlight in an attempt to protect their privacy and keep their private lives private. In those cases, the athletes do acknowledge publicly that they are married, or at the very least "off the market" so to speak.  It's just not something they advertise.  If Aaron is trying to do the same with Destiny, then the intention is understandable.  However, by him flat-out stating he is single and not acknowledging that there is ANYONE (much less a specific person) that can claim to be his girlfriend, it causes people to make the assumption that either the relationship, or he himself, is just not serious.  When you assume the relationship IS serious and yet he says in the media that he is single, it shows people that you can't always believe everything that comes out of his mouth.  That is going to cause him to lose credibility with people who want to believe that he is the nice, down-to-earth, approachable family-driven guy that he has built himself up to be in the media.

And is she really alright with this? I doubt it. No, I dont know her, but for her to agree on something like this, it has to hurt. She may not show it outside, but on the inside it has to crush her feelings.
If she didnt like it, she wouldnt stay in it. He could date models and actresses but he remains with her. Obviously they're both ok with it. It works for them. Plus you dont know why they do what they do- it may affect you one way but it doesnt mean they are affected the same way

The fact he doesn't say "I'm not talking about that part of my life" or "I'm seeing someone", but instead says, "I'm SINGLE" says a lot too.

If there were a group of women sitting around calling one of them names, yes she would be hurt. However, she can't be hurt by it if she wasn't there to begin with.  That's what I meant by her dealing with it and not letting anonymous people on the internet rule her life.  It's remarkably easy to ignore the opinions on a particular website, you simply don't go to that site.  Its a hell of a lot easier than a group of women sitting face to face.  
People who hold your opinion have been coming here fairly regularly for about a year to try to get the posters here to stop talking the way they talk.  The level of negativity in gossip about her has remained the same not matter how many people come here to try to get it to change.  Like Anna said- it's not right, but it is reality. Gossip (and negative gossip in particular) is a multi-billion dollar business.  It doesn't make it right, but people all over the world like to do it and its not going to go away any time soon.

I dont end posts with idiot, turd, stupid, moron. You get what you give on here basically. You are entitle to your opinon, no one is saying you arent, its just all in the presentation.

Hurt on an emotional level or a physical level do the same amount of damage legend. No matter what you say it doesn't make purposely going out of your way to hurt somebody, their family ect an acceptable action. It may be "talk" but if you were sitting around a bunch of women and all of them are calling one of them names, just because that woman  isn't physically hurt, you don't think its doing damage to that person? That doesn't make sense.

Let me ask you a question then Ana and Legend. Why is it ok for everyone to sit around calling people names, bullying ect, but the MOMENT anybody with an opposing opinion does the same its automatically scrutinized? It makes no sense... So its ok for one side to do it, but the second someone else with an opposing opinion does it, its blasphemy?

I hold a differing opinion than MANY posters here.  People don't gang up on me at all.  The difference is that I treat people with respect.  I also understand something that you will not, or are unable, to understand- while people here don't like Destiny or tend to be extremely catty towards her, its all just talk.  Talk and gossip and catty judgements.  It's not right, but it is essentially harmless towards Destiny on a physical level.

People, even your precious Ana, turn it all around and into some sort of joke. Everyone treats her like she's a saint when really she's just as guilty as the next guy... She won't admit it either. But you're right. Two wrongs fo not make a right. But just watch. No matter how you approach it on here, if you have a different opinion, people will gang up on you. Fact. I've tried it many times.

Reply-to:I wasnt nice to anybody last night. Just to the legend from today who admitted the wrong that happen on here. Dont pull that bullshit ana, youre such a turd. How many other times have you pretended to be multiple people? How shocking. Youre the biggest joke out of all of them. Anything you say has no merit and Im not going to waste my time on you. Youre here to bully people you dont know and you cant admit that what you do is wrong. If people want to support that, it just shows your character and the character of those who back you up.
While I appreciate the fact that you were nice to me, there's a few things you need to understand.
Stop name-calling. It's only going to cause people to not take ANYTHING you say seriously. They will just be looking to fight you.
Anna does not make a habit of pretending to be multiple people.  She tested a theory last night because she's been the main target lately.  It seems as though people will attack Anna for being Anna but not for what she actually says.  To be succinct- hypocrite much?
I appreciate that you and I were able to have a discussion and actually listen to each other, but what I DON'T appreciate is bullying people that you claim are bullying someone else.  Two wrongs will never equal a right, and you get more flies with honey than vinegar.  If you are ABLE to refrain from attacking people, then people would be more willing to at least give your argument a second thought.

Obviously it is Destiny as she is the topic of discussion and this is an "Aaron Rodgers girlfriend" board. You just make things up to fit what you say. No merit to your "points" and you obviously don't use logic. There is no point arguing with you as you flatly refuse to acknowledge fact and instead make things up.

Haha! Excuses? Come on vet. They are FACTS. You can't change facts. This whole place is just a bullying platform for you and your buddies on here. If it weren't Destiny it would be somebody else. If Aaron ever dates anybody else, its going to be the same for that girl, and it won't stop even when he's married it is most certainly jealousy. Who wouldn't be jealous of a girl who has an attractive, sweet, funny, talented, and very successful boyfriend? Especially with the fact that to find somebody like that even without Aarons career is. Hell, I'm jealous but that doesn't mean I have to treat her like garbage. The fact is, is that he could have pretty much anybody he wanted. He obviously choses to keep her around so she must have more qualities than drinking. I say good for them, if they love eachother than all the more power to them. You can't justify the bullying on here, what goes on isn't right. And if they ever end it I feel sorry for whoever he ends up with in the sense that she will get the same treatment from you.

Hahaha vet are you a little mad/jealous? Because SHE drinks that automatically makes me a boozer and a liar? For your information I've never, ever, in my life touched alcohol. My cousin was killed by a drunk driver while he was riding his skateboard home from school when he was in eighth grade. I spent years of my life in therapy because I was supposed to walk home with him that day and I went home with a friend last minute instead. For you to make those generalizations makes you look like a giant ass. Secondly, he DIDN'T take his family to recieve his MVP award, the Derby was clearly a boys weekend, he didn't bring his family to the ring ceremony... You're talking out of your ass. Just admit that NOBODY except for YOU will ever be good enough for Aaron. You are jealous, and it doesn't matter if its Destiny, it could be ANY girl and you would treat them the exact same way. You don't know anything, and when you're presented with a FACT you throw a tantrum. You will believe what you WANT to believe. The fact that you can't change is that she shows up with him regaurdless of the type of event. He wants her there. You can't change the facts, no matter how much you want to. So twist it all you want there Vet, it doesn't do anything. At the end of the day you're just a bully on an online chat room. If that's what you decide to take to your gave, so be it.

That person also said "Destiny wouldn't give Aaron the time of day in high school." Destiny was four years younger than him... Why would he be going around with someone so young? That's just a classic example of you believing everything you read. I would HOPE he wasn't dating a ninth grader as he was about to graduate and go into college. That person lied about a lot of things. Just because someone is "from" there doesn't mean they actually know Aaron and Destiny.

Hey Legend. You are the first and only person to ever sit there and type out a logical response to the situation. Not only did you admit that what people do on here is wrong, you also admitted what a cowardly act sitting behind an anonymous name bullying someone is. I still don't agree that you know EVERYONE on here and what they are and are not capable of, and I don't think its safe to say someone on here wouldn't try stalking her, some of these people really are angry towards her. The only thing she did is date Aaron R. odgers and she got all of this for it. Thank you for admitting for the first time that what happens here is wrong. I completely respect your o pinion now, even if I don't agree with everything you say.  I'm really impressed, almost at a loss for words. Thanks for being an actual human being.

I think she is learning a lot about social media through her facebook. She just hasn't learned that if she doesn't want it out there don't put it out there or make your facebook page extremely private. You can do that. My facebook page is very private and I'm very particular about who I friend and I'm not in the public or dating a public figure.  She just chooses not to. For those of you on this site questioning why she needs to have it private and upset that there are people out there looking for her facebook page...why again are you on here.The more you comment about that the more you look stupid because this is a form on Aaron Rodgers' girlfriend.

I would be extremely surprised if any talk on this board resulted in an actual physical threat against Destiny Newton. You're right that I can only be responsible for myself, but I've been here long enough to know what to expect from this board- and all anyone can expect here is shit-talking. THAT'S IT. You are also right in saying that people here are cowards- they love to talk big because they can do it behind an anonymous moniker. Does that sound like the type of person that will personally go and try to track the girl down with the intent to physically hurt her? Hell no! Then they would have to be held personally responsible and they couldn't be unknown. I never said that this type of talk isn't wrong. It is wrong and Destiny does not deserve it. That's a recurring argument on here but not the point we as arguing for or against in this discussion. The point we are trying to make is that Destiny should not allow the opinions of a handful of anonymous strangers to rule her life. If she wants a Facebook page so bad, go for it! Yeah, people will pick apart whatever, but she needs to focus on HER and stop worrying what WE think, because I can gaurantee that if she continues like this then not only is her life going to end up to be unfulfilling but people here will lament the fact that she has no backbone or self confidence. She needs to forget about us and just live her life.

Yes, she does have a right to a fb acct. But bc of her position she just needs to make sure its on private and that she is fine with everything that she puts out there.  Its just common internet knowledge.

No. She has every right to have a Facebook page just like you do. The fact that she had to hide it in the first place is pathetic. Quit trying to act like you people do nothing wrong. What you do is not right. Quit trying to act like your horrendous, invasive, behavior is acceptable. You do it anonymously because not only are you classless and evil, but you're also a coward. If you try to justify your bullying here, you are justifying bullying in general. You can't be selective in it. You are wrong and everyone who doesn't have ice on their heart can see that treating another person like garbage is wrong. Go ahead and try to justify your actions. You're wrong, hurting people is never right no matter who they are. Get a moral backbone.

And who are you to say she doesnt have to worry about being hurt or stalked. You're only responsible for you, it doesn't mean your thoughts and actions are the same as everyone else on here. People on here are truly obsessed with her. I would not blame her for a second if she felt violated. You only have the right to speak for your actions, no everyone else's.

As a person you should never allow people to who have control in your life, especially if they cannot bring anything of merit to you.

I could not imagine caring about what people think of me on the internet. Just by being a member of this board, I've been called almost every name under the sun. It doesn't bother me. The minute I shut down this site or move to another page in my browser, this site and all the people here cease to exist. I guess I can say that because I'm not the subject of such scrutiny like she is, but to me its just not worth it to spend time worrying about what people think of me on a message board. I'll never see any of you, so who cares? I think what you guys don't understand and what I realized a long time ago is that the talk here is just that, talk. Its a boredom buster, stress relief, whatever you want to call it. I'm not making light of it, but am just trying to explain that Destiny really has absolutely nothing to worry about when it comes to someone physically stalking her as a result of this board. No amount of talk here will ever lead to that.

The point is, no matter how you slice it, what you do on here is wrong. To spend your free time demeaning a stranger and to get pleasure out of it means that there is clearly something wrong with you. You treat her like trash, and no matter what you say, you can't make it ok to do that. It's wrong to treat somebody like that. If you cant say anything nice, dont say it.

It goes back to what was said earlier.. she is allowing random people on a random message board to rule her life. Its not healthy. If she truly took it down because of what was said here? Then I can guarantee that she will not last as Aaron's girlfriend. Think its bad now, wait till they get married. It would be ten times worse. She can't live her life in fear of a few people she's never going to meet on the internet. No one here has EVER threatened her physically or in person. Its all shit-talking on the net. I'm not trying to make it seem like the people here shouldn't be talking about her like that but the girl needs to develop a thicker skin if she plans on going further with her relationship with Aaron. This type of thing happens with everyone that is dating a celebrity or sports figure, and most everyone else has learned to ignore it. To put it succinctly, and I know I'll get blasted for this, the girl needs to get a grip.

I wouldn't want you to know anything about me, good or bad. It's not only bullying, but its extremely invasive.

The very definition of "Troll" has been well displayed tonight.  I do find it amusing that one poster that's been lurking for the last day or so, waiting for someone to talk just so they can start an argument mysteriously quieted when the second poster showed up.  I'm not saying they're the same person, as I can't prove it, but...
While I am not a fan of the way that Destiny is talked about in this forum, I do have to say that I agree with Anna when she said that Destiny is letting anonymous posters rule her life if she took down her facebook because of what's been said here.  Personally, I think she should probably delete this website from her favorites and pay less attention to what random people think on the internet if it's causing her that much anguish.  I know it would sound like I'm making Destiny to blame when obviously most of the blame is to be shared among the people that say such rude things about her here.  However, if you can't change the way people talk (and really, after a year of her "friends" trying to get people to talk nicely about her- it ain't happening) then the next step would be to ignore it.  Ignoring this website and the contents is really easy, considering.  You just don't come here.  Easy peasy.  It's not like Destiny is going to meet 99.999% of the people on this board face to face, so why let it get to her that much?

I think that this forum and the other hundreds that are for wags is meant for gossip and opinion, right or wrong that is its design. Just like the tabloids and online gossip sites. Everyone has a choice to or not participate. It is a choice for all. It is also designed to allicit one side vs. the other. Thats how they make money. Destiny or anyone else who is on a wag site should never allow this type of media to define them. Do u think gisele looks on bradys site? No. why? Because at the end of the day she is confident in who she is and her relationship. Destiny needs to be confident and move on. If she conts. To follow this site it sends a very strong msg. Shes not confident in herself or the relationship.

I can help but keep thinkng about this post that Vet had posted earlier
What is an Internet Troll/ Forum troll?
An "Internet troll" or "Forum Troll" or "Message Board Troll" is a person who posts outrageous message to bait people to answer. Forum Troll delights in sowing discord on the forums. A troll is someone who inspires flaming rhetoric, someone who is purposely provoking and pulling people into flaming discussion. Flaming discussions usually end with name calling and a flame war.
A classic troll is trying to make us believe that he is a genuine skeptic with no hidden agenda. He is divisive and argumentative with need-to-be-right attitude, "searching for the truth", flaming discussion, and sometimes insulting people or provoking people to insult him. Troll is usually an expert in reusing the same words of its opponents and in turning it against them.
While sometimes, he may sound like a stupid, uninformed, ignorant poster, do not be deceived! Most trolls are highly intelligent people trying to hide behind a mask of stupidity and/or ignorance! They usually have an agenda. Very few trolls come out of pure skepticism.
A Troll is generally a person who is extremely skeptical of the main forum subject.
He is generally interested to make other forum members look stupid. A troll will sometimes use insults to provoke other people to insult him. Then, he will complain to moderators of being insulted and will request that his opponents get banned from further discussion.
I keep rethinking about this post tonight. So thanks Vet for that.

After all of the mean things posted on here about how she's dressed and what she looks like. What's it going to take for you supposed adult women to stop? If it wasn't her it would be the next girl he's with. I can see right through your whole "I'm not jealous" act. You would be jealous of any girl he was with and you would be the first ones to treat that girl poorly as well. Anybody with half a brain can see how mean you girls are and the lengths you will go to to make it known that you don't approve. I'd hate to break it to you, but I don't think he gives a damn about what you think about his personal choices. Whatever crusade you are on isn't working.

She took her pages down, what more do you want from her? Stop trying to act like you're so much better then this girl. You're the ones sitting here anonymously cyber bullying some girl you don't know. You don't seem to take issue with that at all. You're disgusting, immature, and obviously have no moral code.

And none of you take ownership for your actions. You have these loud opinions about everything this girl does, which leads me to believe you're just washed up hags who have no other outlets. You chose to conduct yourselves this way because you can do it anonymously. How pathetic do you honestly have to be to pour this much time and effort into hurting somebody?

If you want a fb page then put it up, its no big deal. Just dont put pics on there and dont allow anybody to tag you in a photo without your permission. And make your fb profile pic somehting random like a fower or animal or a senic view, something generic. Its not that hard to keep it private.

Ana: Her page was taken down very soon after. Same with this new one. You won't remember it correctly though because you can never be wrong. Now cue all of the ana backup even though we all know how it played out.

If I remember right, those pics had been posted here for at least a month before she deleted her facebook.  They kept getting re-posted actually (to the point of annoyance).  I think it took one of the other more main-stream gossip sites to post the pictures for her to delete her FB page.

Reply-to:Ana... I think once you set your profile to private, you would think that it would be closed off to strangers. There is a lot more to it then that. If you dont remember, people on here made a big deal out of her deleting her Facebook after that person began to post her personal photos. That sounds like she responded right away to me. If she even went to the lengths of changing her name on Facebook to ward people off, it sounds like she was trying to lay low from you people.
No it took her awhile to delete her page, I do beleive. And yes if you were to make assumptions one would think that setting your acct to pirvate you would think that no one else could see the pics or post. But if you take a minute to read your options on fb you would see that you can change all sort of settings and see that their are different level of pirvacy on there. Again it comes down to taking a active role in your ife escpecially where the digital world is concerned.

Reply-to:@Ana: I just thought of something. I hate to beat a dead horse by bringing this old topic up, but my idea is correlates with it. The incident on Wednesday night? Remember the stolen FB pictures accusation? This never occurred to me then (I wish it did): those pics might not be stolen after all.
I have never thought her pics were stolen. Again for me its this simple. You control what is put out there. If you dont want everybody to see it then dont post it and be aware of who your friends are. And if you arent going to take a active part in your digtal life on social networking sites then dont complain when things get out of control and dont place the blame on anybody but you. Bc you are the one that controls it not anybody else.

Since I include personal friends, past acquaintances from high school and college and coworkers from previous jobs on my facebook, I have one rule when it comes to my posting of pictures- If I'm not comfortable with the picture being seen by anyone and everyone, I don't post it.  Any intensely personal things get sent by private message.  Anything I consider for a status gets treated much the same way.  Private things stay private.

Reply-to:For me personally, I have no need to connect w my friends in that manner. I just pick up my phone and call or text. I also use something really old fashioned called a photo album. Lol. I have not embraced all of technology.
Well you know there is something fun about pulling out the photo album and sharing a moment with friends and family. The internet makes is so impersonal. Its like receiving a letter in the mail. Its just nice to know that someone took the time to take time out of there day to think of you and write you a letter. Its not pratical but its personal and special.

Reply-to:Ana: it wasnt her friends that leaked photos. It was a friend of a friend. There are so many different privacy settings on there, and it doesnt help that theyre constantly changing. I agree though, just give up on facebook. Its frustrating because it is such a simple way to keep in contact with friends and.family you dont see every day, but the girls (or old women) on here seek her out. She cant use anything without one of you becoming invasive and over stepping boundaries. Dad how truly pathetic most people in here are and the lengths they will go to try to hurt somebodys feelings.
But my issue is still, she controls the settings and no one else. At the first sign that her pics were being posted publicily she should have taken action, imo.

Reply-to:From what Ive read (on numerous blogs and magazines): Facebook owns whatever content that you place on your web page, which is why I careful about what type of pictures that I put on there.
I have heard that too, which is why I dont post pics of me on there. I dont like the concept that fb owns my pics , they are mine and mine alone.

I have fb friends that will post their relationship problems on there or post a refernce to it and then enveryone puts in there 2 cents and that always ends up badly. Or you end up with these fb stalkers that are looking for a good time on fb with random stangers, my one frined has that problem. Again its just common sense. I remember lisening to the radio one morning and it was about how one of the biggest problems in relationships is over sharing due to social networks like fb, twitter, and my space and all I could think of was no sh!t sherlock.

I know way too many people who uses their Facebook pages as either a therapist, as a friend or a dating service. Then they tend to mix business with pleasure. The best way to use FB is to be mindful of the content that you put on your page and to be mindful of the people that you allow to read your page.

Reply-to:IMO, when it comes to FB and the friend-collecting feature, there are people who use it negligently. They treat adding on friends as if they were ten years-old again and collecting baseball cards. They want to bring that they have 500 friends on FB, when in reality, they can only count three of those people as being their actual friends. So when they brag about having 1,000 friends on FB, what they really are doing is telling you that they have 1,000 strangers having access to personal sh!t, such as pics, info about their jobs, etc.
I agree with that. But what really gets me is when those people then complain about their crap getting out. No one made you post all of that and no one made you accept all those friend requests either. So there is no one to blame but yourself. A little common sense goes a long way.

yea I dont understand why she would have wanted a fb page agian after what hapened last time. Its obvious there is some problem with the fb friends she had/has and pics getting leaked. So if it were me I would close the acct and let it go. Is posting pics really that important? To me it isnt but thats just me.

Maybe she thought no one would find it? Seems hard to believe considering all that has happened. I would have thought she would discontinue the pics but she really must like them alot.
