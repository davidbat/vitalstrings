Aaron Rodgers Celebrates Touchdown By Declaring Himself WWE Champion

Aaron Rodgers is in complete control of the Green Bay Packers NFL playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons . Through just under three quarters, Rodgers has completed 27-31 passes for 330 yards and three touchdowns. He is  carving up the Falcons defense  in every sense of the word. As a cherry on top of the Packers' playoff sundae, he called his own number to put Green Bay up 21 in the third,  scrambling into the end zone for the touchdown . 
When all was said and done, Rodgers put took the liberty of strapping on the championship belt, fitting after the performance he's put on so far. Just picture Jim Ross screaming "THAT'S AARON RODGERS MUSIC" while watching this, courtesy of  BubbaProg .
Playing on the road, Rodgers and the Green Bay offense look like a juggernaut that can't be stopped again this week. Rodgers has had a hand in all but one of Green Bay's touchdowns tonight. In two playoff games this year, Rogers has thrown for 510 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions.
On top of all that, he's now the NFL Intercontinental Quarterback Champion after hitting the Falcons with a steel chair off the top rope.
