Losers, yours truly CCWriter discovered Aaron Rodgers strapping on imaginary title belts games before his own mom knew he was doing it and certainly prior to Packer Nation.  Why was CCWriter from losersbracket.com the first to take note of the title belt celebration?  Well, as well documented, CCWriter has been an acclaimed critic of Aaron Rodgers.  I missed that first train that left the station and chose to spend some time observing TT’s “golden boy.”  A couple of years have passed and I find myself creating prototypes of products that will undoubtedly contribute to the potential legend of A-Rodg.  Yes, this title belt is a losersbracket.com Exclusive Limited Edition Patent Pending Product. How can you attend the next Packer Party, the NFC Championship, or the Superbowl without draping this F’n title belt over your shoulder?
We’re ready to fire up the assembly line and ship these to your door.  So place your pre-production orders right now, today!  How much do these title belts cost, you ask?  I don’t fricken know yet.  I’m the artist, the creative guy, the guy who builds shit…  That’s got to go through corporate and all that B.S. yet.  All I know is this, who cares how much it costs, you need one and all of Packer Nation needs one.  Plus, this aint no China made WWF belt, this thing is designed and crafted in the U.S.A.  No bullshit here.  Give me some feedback on this losersbracket.com Exclusive commemorative offering.  –CCWriter
