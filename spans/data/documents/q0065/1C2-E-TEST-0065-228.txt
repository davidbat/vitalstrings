That's pretty good, won't lie. He'd better be able to do that though to be honest.
I was probably more impressed with Drew Brees on Sports Science if anyone's ever seen that episode. He's more accurate than an olympic bow shooter or whatever the hell they do shooting arrows at a target.
more accurate than a olympic archer, I dont buy this , it's a Brees promotional, and also a NFL promo.
Brees is very accurate, so are othe rQB's
But I've shot at a club where several Olympic archers trained, they dont misss at 20 yards, unless there in a wind storm.
good flick though.
