Aaron Rodgers , Super Bowl MVP, addressed the Lambeau Field crowd at the Green Bay Packers Super Bowl celebration, which remains still entirely not a parade. While other players were herded on in groups, Rodgers got the stage all to himself.
Hey I just want you to know, for the next year you guys can steal my belt celebration because we’re the champions of the world. Put that on whenever you want. Until two days ago, the greatest day of my sporting career was when this organization picked me in the draft.
It’s been a great journey, the last six years with you guys. We got the greatest fans in the world. Nothing better than Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas hearing that “Go Pack go!” at the end of the game.
Rodgers also big-up’d the entire organization, including the many players who were brought on to replace injured players.
He remarked on losing Donald Driver , and credited Jordy Nelson with helping the team implement its gameplan of spreading out the Pittsburgh Steelers .
Before he left the stage, Rodgers described the team’s core as remaining in place for next year and predicted a return to the Super Bowl again next year.
