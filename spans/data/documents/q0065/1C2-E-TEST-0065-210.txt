Aaron Rodgers Contenders Rookie Ticket Auto
One of the differences between someone like Rodgers and a similarly talented QB is that Rodgers autograph has been included in products at a drastically reduced rate. Because the Packers are undoubtedly one of the most popular teams in the league, and Rodgers is the best player, he is in high demand. When there are very little amounts of cards to go around, you can see how it would be an issue.
The Pack is rolling, knocking off Atlanta on Sunday night to go 5-0, and there is no sign of stopping quite yet. Oddly enough, they are not the only undefeated team in the NFC north, but they are definitely the best. Rodgers is making it look easy, to say the least, and it is spurring a bigger bump in a lot of stuff that was once a lot cheaper. His rookie cards have jumped almost 50% since the start of the season, some of which were already sky high thanks to the Super Bowl win.
If the Packers and Rodgers roll to another Super Bowl this year, we could be entering Tom Brady during the undefeated season territory. Football card collectors have always valued Super Bowl wins over everything including recent success and stats, something of which Rodgers has both. He is already the most valuable current player you can pull out of packs, and that doesnt look like it is going to change any time soon. I dont usually say this when values are this high, but there may even be some room for more bumps in value.
