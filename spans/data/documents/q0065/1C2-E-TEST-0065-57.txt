Aaron Rodgers is a boss.
His beard is top notch. His championship belt celebration is awesome. And he’s the best player on the team that just won the Super Bowl.

“‘We have dancers that just got off the Usher tour,’ said [choreographer] Blakely. ‘We have one dancer that just got off Justin Bieber tour. We have another guy who was hired by Michael Jackson to be on the ‘This Is It’ tour. All the dancers are working and are very professional.’”

"The bass player for the rock band Sugar Ray is directing the video."
Usher, Justin Bieber, Michael Jackson, the bass player from Sugar Ray?
Aaron Rodgers should not be sponsoring 14-year-old-girl music. He should be slinging lasers up the seam and gloating like a professional wrestler.
Damn you, the lockout.
