Before Sunday's Super Bowl, Aaron Rodgers was presented with a WWE replica title. After the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl, Rodgers was wearing the championship belt during the post-game celebration and Lombardi Trophy presentation. Tonight, WWE is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for Monday Night RAW. Can the WWE convince Rodgers to appear on RAW tonight?
This would be huge for the WWE if they could work out a deal to get Aaron Rodgers to appear on RAW tonight. Without a doubt, he would get the loudest "pop" of the night. In fact, I think the crowd would riot in celebration of the Super Bowl victory.
I doubt the Packers have left Dallas yet. But, WWE should personally fly Rodgers to Milwaukee and then to Disney World so he can celebrate his Super Bowl victory as many players in the past have. With the short amount of time to make the arrangements, the odds of a Rodgers appearance are slim. However, if there was a time for WWE to "pull out all the stops" then this would be it. The mainstream attention would be huge.
