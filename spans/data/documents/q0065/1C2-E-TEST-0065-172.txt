Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has had a tough year by all accounts. After dealing with the storm of controversy regarding Brett Favre (something that obviously still bothers him), he made his first start at Lambeau Field, getting in a win against the Minnesota Vikings.
He's down at the Super Bowl in Tampa this weekend, hanging out at Gatorade's G Studio, and I had a chance to chat with him. I left the Favre questions to the ESPN junkies -- I was more interested in this pro athlete's fitness tips. Check out the gallery to see the interview!
