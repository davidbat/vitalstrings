“The new heavyweight champion of the world hails from Green Bay, Wisconsin…”
No, that’s not the opening line from TNA Wrestling World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson.  Well, sometimes it is, but in this case we’re referring to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
After last night’s Super Bowl XLV victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Packers linebacker Clay Matthews presented Rodgers with the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt while he was already holding the Vince Lombardi trophy.
Ironically, the move was orchestrated by TNA Wrestling’s Ric Flair.
Regardless, it was pretty cool to see a wrestling belt featured at the most-watching sporting event of the year.
Interesting side note: WWE Monday Night RAW is live tonight from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and tomorrow night’s Smackdown taping is being held in Green Bay.
The real question is, which prize would you value more, the Lombardi trophy or the World Championship belt?
