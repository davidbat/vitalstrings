Aaron Rodgers: “I Haven’t Been Out Carousing”
by Robert Littal | Posted on Thursday, February 3rd, 2011
I like the word “Carousing”, sounds like something Bill Clinton would say.
Now that I have that out of the way, Aaron Rodgers is very smooth with his subliminal professional ether.  Doesn’t matter if he taking subtle shots at his own injured teammates, how he answers questions about Brett Favre, the Championship Belt TD celebration or smoothly getting on the Steelers about their partying.
Check out what he had to say.
“I haven’t been out carousing,” Rodgers said today. “I am a homebody,  so I’ve been spending a lot of time in my hotel room watching film. I  think it is important at the same time that you are sticking with your  normal routine. I like to go out to dinner when I’m back home in Green  Bay so I’ve gone out to dinner, to a couple of really nice spots, and  then come home, relax and watch film.”
On Monday night, Steelers receiver Hines Ward was reportedly out at a strip club . On Wednesday night, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was reportedly “ boozing ” at a piano bar.
Rodgers is a smart guy, he knows what he is doing.
I don’t think Hines Ward’s strippers or Roethlisberger buying out the bar will have an affect on the game, but the mind games are interesting.
I will say this if the Steelers lose, these small stories may turn into big stories, but if they win it will all be forgotten.
