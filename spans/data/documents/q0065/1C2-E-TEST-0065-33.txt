Rodgers’ Championship Belt

As Packer fans get pumped for Sunday, we wanted to pay homage to what we called the “Best Celebration in Packers’ History” back in May: Aaron Rodgers’ Championship Belt pose.
The t-shirt features a vintage/distressed print on a super soft American Apparel Tri-Blend t-shirt.   Get it today to help you celebrate the Packers’ impending championship!

I can't stand it when he does this.  Only good thing about it means that we just scored a touchdown.

You guys need to create a belt.  MMA style with a big GD “G” on it for sale.

gah, I liked this one better, why is it no longer for sale?  Sure the sequel may be a better pose, but he's not even close to touching what was initially an imaginary belt.  So if you insert a belt photoshopically, I would think you'd make it look like he's at least actually putting it on… I'm torn : /
