Grading System Â 
BIO: Junior college transfer who made a major mark on the Cal program the past two seasons.  All-Conference selection as a senior after posting 66.1 percent/2,566/24/8.  Also added 247 yards rushing with three additional scores.  Junior quarterbacking totals were 61.6 percent/2,903/19/5.
POSITIVES: Athletic passer with the physical skills and mental intangibles needed to lead a franchise at the next level.  Quickly sets up in the pocket, sells ball fakes and technically very sound.  Poised under the rush, steps up to avoid defenders and works to keep the play alive.  Patient, buys time in the pocket and waits for receivers to come free.  Does an excellent job with his reads and natural looking off the safety.  Does not make mental errors and throws the ball away rather than toss the errant pass.  Times the short and intermediate throws well, as receivers rarely wait for the ball out of their breaks.  Outstanding vision and immediately spots the open receiver.  Possesses a quick release, live arm and zips the outs or gets the ball downfield.  Throws with touch.  Sits in the pocket and takes a big hit in order to get the pass off.  Fleet-footed and picks up yardage with his legs when necessary.
NEGATIVES: Though accurate, lacks top pass placement and has receivers extending vertically to pull the ball out of the air.  Must improve his accuracy down the field.  Lacks top footwork releasing the ball off a three step drop.  Lacks pocket stature.
ANALYSIS: A physically gifted passer with a great understanding of the position, Rodgers has made himself one of the nation's top quarterback prospects the past two seasons.  May not fit every system, but should quickly flourish in the NFL for a timing offense that does not throw the ball down the field with regularity.  Offers a good amount of upside and is a coachable player who should continually improve his game.
