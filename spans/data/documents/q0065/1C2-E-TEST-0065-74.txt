Aaron Rodgers Celebration Picture?
Does anyone know where I can get a clear picture of Aaron Rodgers' touchdown celebration dance? He's the quarterback of the Packers and when he scores a touchdown he a "championship belt" celebration.

I'm not a Packers fan but went to CAL when Rodgers was the QB so the Packers can lose all their games for all I care. I'm just a Rodgers fan.
