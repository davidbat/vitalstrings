When the Super Bowl Trophy was awarded to Aaron Rodgers last night one of his teammates placed a WWE World Championship replica belt on his shoulder...Aaron Rodgers is know to do a taunt when he makes a big play where he would signal the belt around his waist the way a wrestler would...during a ESPN special about Aaron Rodgers belt Triple H commented on the taunt and gave him a few pointers.
