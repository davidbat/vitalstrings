Moments after winning the Super Bowl and being named the MVP of the game, Aaron Rodgers celebrated while holding a replica World Heavyweight Championship belt that was given to him by Clay Matthews.  I wonder if this means we will be seeing Aaron or any of the Packers appear on WWE television this week.  Tonight's edition of Monday Night RAW will be taking place in Milwaukee while Friday Night SmackDown will be taped in Green Bay tomorrow.
