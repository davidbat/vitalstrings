Belt Dance Suggestions
The Belt Dance is more than just a hip thrust and arm movement: It’s an art. The belt dance is quite complex, but can be split up mainly into two main parts:
1. The thing you did to deserve doing the belt dance: Most people forget this part when they do the belt dance, and I think most of us would agree that out of context, this move looks awkward, abnormal, and we feel sorry and somewhat embarrassed for the person doing it. But if you do a gainer off a high dive, land a backflip on your snowmobile, or save 5 small children from drowning in a river, that same move looks pretty flippin awesome!
2. The Belt Dance: This is where your art comes in. This is where you show the real you. Are you arms strong when you show your opponent your belt, or are they casual, simply pointing to the fact that you are, indeed, better than them? Is your face angry, passionate, apathetic, or laughing? Are you kicking, jumping, screaming, singing?
Treat the belt dance like a belt dance, and you’ll get an awkward hip thrust. Treat the belt dance like an expression of your art that internally flows out of you, and you’ll get something of Beauty.
