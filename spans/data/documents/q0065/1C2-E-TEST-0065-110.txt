Keep minimizing him / "disrespecting him" in the lad's vernacular.
Motivate Aaron Rodgers to get better. This will NOT work out good for his naysayers.
Our line has sucked for him. Ted understands, finally. Aaron seems to not care about even that slowing him down anymore.  Frankly, I'm thinking some profoundly new QB ground to be hewn.. I know it when I see it comin'...
(Oh, and you dicks that plan to type "that's about right" better remember you'd blow him to even know him on the Vikes
)
imo
:P
So Rodgers has turned into the QB you always suspected he would be and you've turned into the troll we've always suspected you were.
If you've come here to rub it in, rub in your ass!
