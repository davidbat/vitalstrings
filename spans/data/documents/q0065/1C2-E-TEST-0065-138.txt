Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a concussion and might have to sit out the October 17,2010, game against Miami, the latest blow that has hit the Green Bay Packers in a season they hoped would end in the Super Bowl. Rodgers got the concussion during a helmet-to-helmet hit late in Sunday's overtime loss at Washington on October 10, 2010. Oh my aching ChaCha!
