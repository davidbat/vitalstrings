Professional athletes on championship teams and their love affair with WWE title belts continue. First, there was Aaron Rodgers gesturing he’s putting on a title belt as his personal celebration. This eventually trickled down to the rest of his Green Bay Packers teammates, as they marched all the way to a victory in Super Bowl XLV. Rodgers was awarded a replica of the WWE World Heavyweight Title on stage after accepting both the Vince Lombardi Trophy and MVP honors.
