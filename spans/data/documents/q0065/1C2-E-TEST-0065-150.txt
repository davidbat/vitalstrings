He's no farve, all the packer fans should be more appreciative of the best qb they have ever had as well as one of the best in NFL history. Instead of throwing him to the side for Aaron rodgers. They act like he is the second coming of Jesus. Farve never has never had the weapons rodgers has. Rodgers has never been and never will be the clutch gunslinger farve was. And all these packer fans throw that to the side and hate on farve or refuse to acknowledge his greatness. Aaron rodgers has had one good season and a superbowl. And there is now an Aaron rodgers day in Wisconsin... Why all this praise? Why the neglect of farve? Why the cocky bullcrap from you cheeseheads? The bears have had 15 different starters at qb since 1992. The packers have had 2. You ungrateful pigs. Farve is the man and if the bears had ever gotten a qb like farve everyone would love him forever no matter what. Rodgers is a cali boy. Farve is the man. Hotty toddy
