The Aaron Rodgers Hip Thrust of Mystery
Four days till gametime, and an important question has arisen: What is this strange touchdown dance Aaron Rodgers has started doing? The one where he puts his hands on his hips and sticks out his pelvis? I think he’s holstering a pair of imaginary six-shooters, but he could also be striking some kind of bodybuilding pose, or receiving a sexual favor, or I don’t know what. In any case, I don’t think the gesture comes off quite as macho as it’s intended to.
Watch the whole thing here. And give me your best guesses for what the hell this is supposed to be in the comments.
And thanks to Unpacked reader Joel for bringing this very timely issue to the forefront.
Update: Mystery solved! And by no less an authority than Deadspin editor A.J. Daulerio: “Oh, he’s the heavyweight champion. He’s putting on the belt. (See: Mitchell, Freddie).” Thanks, A.J. And thanks for reminding us of that whole 4th-and-26 thing. Dick.
Kidding! Really, thanks. I’ll sleep better knowing.
