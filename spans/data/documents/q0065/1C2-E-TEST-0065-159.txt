State Farm debuted the third in its ongoing series of ads featuring Aaron Rodgers on Friday--this one with Clay Matthews playing a starring role.  The new ad comes not long after another teammate, B.J. Raji, danced his way into the spot that pokes fun at Rodgers and his 'title belt' celebration.
We see a couple of new actors in this one, but agent Mike Sollie (a real insurance man) returns.
Unfortunately for Aaron, Matthews has now taken over the office and created an entirely new look for the "Discount Double Check".  Watch below.
Matthews had some endorsements after last season's Super Bowl run.  The State Farm ad won't hurt his marketability either.
The ads are tightly produced and have been very popular for the company, which also scored well with its series of "Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm is There" ads last year.
