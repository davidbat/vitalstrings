Zumba fitness PS3 Move video game quick review/demo 11/18
Got the game today (11/18) and now wish I'd waited to see some of the reviews first. My first impressions are not good. The game has some overall good points (music) but the hip belt controller holder concept is a big FAIL. When I had the controller in the belt holster, during play it easily hit the buttons that paused the game, so i took it out and held it instead... and discovered I could wave it around in any manner, even sitting, and get great scores. And the tutorials are kinda useless --- they don't count steps or tell you when to switch sides or... anything. It's all just watch and copy, no vocal instruction. And they are set at a ridiculous pace, which is what I'm demonstrating here. Just move a teeny bit faster and bam! tutorial over! If you could return video games... not sure I'd keep this one. Just found this youtube.com Now this is what the tutorial SHOULD have been like! I can enjoy the game more now after seeing steps broken down like that. :)

Alice Pack BOB_72 hour pack Part 1
Here is a description of my Alice pack Bug out Bag or 72 hour pack. I plan on buggin in, however you never know when you may have to leave your house for things such as wildfires, hazardous material spills, natural disasters or other man made disasters. I am always changing and upgrading my pack, contents and setups. I have used the Alice pack for years as well as many other packs, I keep returning to the Alice pack as my pack of choice due to its versatality. I have slightly modified my pack to make it more comfortable by using the Molle II straps and hip belt. I have also added the Molle II Modular Sleep System Carrier for my sleeping gear. I use this pack for other things as well such as for Civil Air Patrol extended missions, 2-5 day trips, and some overnight trips. Depending on what I will be doing is how I will load it out.

Deuter Futura Zero 40SL Backpack Review
If you're pack doesn't fit right, all the options in the world aren't going to be worth anything. The deuter Futura Zero SL was design to fit the shorter torso and natural curves of women. Don't let the fitted design and attached flower (removable) fool you though. This pack is tough enough to run with any of the other designs in Deuter's inventory. It features: • made with light but strong and abrasion-resistant micro-rip/ripstop nylon and 210-denier and 420-denier nylons • SL refers to Slim Fit, specifically designed with narrower, shorter shoulder straps and shorter back system proportions to fit those up to 5' 7'' tall • Deuter's Aircomfort patented suspension allows warm air to escape and fresh air to circulate between pack and your back for increased comfort • Suspension consists of a spring steel frame that is flexible and light, and tensioned to support the suspended mesh for ventilation • Contoured, padded shoulder straps are lined with MeshTex fabric for breathability and feature stabilizer straps for proper positioning of pack • Soft hip pads and hipbelt wrap body, stabilizing and controlling lateral movements of pack while on the go; hipbelt features a valuables pocket • Main compartment has plenty of room for a full day hike, on or off the trail • Front stash pocket and side mesh pockets store often-accessed gear such as water bottles, headlamp, first-aid kit, sunscreen, multi-tool and more • Top lid pocket can hold your map, compass or GPS, spare batteries <b>...</b>
