An unsolicited tip to all NFL defenders: If you're down 14 points in a playoff game, don't mock the quarterback that's beating you after making a relatively inconsequential sack at the start of the second half.
Sadly, this advice comes too late for John Abraham (notes) . The Atlanta Falcons defensive end sacked Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (notes) at the start of the second half and celebrated by mocking Rodgers' championship-belt move. Not a terrible move, but better done when your team isn't down two touchdowns at home.

Later in the drive Rodgers got the last laugh when he scored a touchdown and emphatically performed his patented move, in apparent defiance of Abraham:
You have to believe that Rodgers' vigorous celebration, and the pause he made before it, was inspired by Abraham's mocking celebration. 
Green Bay went on to win the game 48-21 and advance to the NFC championship. Rodgers finished 31-36 for 366 yards and three touchdowns.
