In addition to the traditional Pete Rozelle Trophy, car, and Disney World commercial, Super Bowl XLV MVP Aaron Rodgers received something else for his outstanding performance in Dallas – a World Wrestling Entertainment championship belt.
Rodgers had become known for his championship belt celebrations, even receiving advice from WWE wrestler Triple-H on how to perfect the move.
However, the eight time champion’s opinion of Rodgers turned sour when he saw the Green Bay signal caller celebrating with it onstage.
“It’s ridiculous and completely underserved,” said Triple-H, whose contact information was obtained through his steroids distributor.  “It’s a [fake] slap on the face.  I’ve earned mine by overcoming Rock Bottoms, Stone Cold Stunners, Power Bombs, and a marriage to Stephanie McMahon.”
Super Bowl XLV MVP Aaron Rodgers may soon find himself on the receiving end of a Triple-H Pedigree.
When reminded that the gesture was simply a take on Rodgers’ celebration and a reward for his play on the football field, Triple-H remained unimpressed.
“Anybody can throw a football,” said Triple-H.  “The real questions is, can he get back up from a Pedigree?”
Triple-H didn’t stop there.
“In fact, let’s find out.  I officially challenge Aaron Rodgers to a steel cage match at Wrestlemania 45, or however many we’re at now.”
Five Guys, a Girl, and a Blog sought to track down Rodgers to inform him of the impending challenge.  In order to draw his attention, we sent one of our reporters in undercover as a breast cancer survivor seeking an autograph, surely a set-up that would draw the Packer QB’s attention.
Apparently not.  Five Guys, a Girl, and a Blog will be sure to keep you up to date as we attempt to track down a response from Rodgers.  Meanwhile, Stone Cold Steve Austin was sought for comment but could not be found – anywhere.
