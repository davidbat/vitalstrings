Matthew Ryan dinked and dunked his way to 166 yards and 2 picks
Another robust 6.4 YPA for him…I’d point out again how silly it is that he got the Pro Bowl nod over Rodgers who is clearly better but the Super Bowl teams don’t send guys anymore so hopefully this won’t be an issue
Tramon Williams played Ryan like a fiddle on the game-breaking TAINT to end the half…fantastic season for him
91
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez has the highest WAR evah!
Says:
No player has benefitted from the hype of a nickname more than “Matty Ice”.  If his name was Harvey, he wouldn’t be in the Pro Bowl.
