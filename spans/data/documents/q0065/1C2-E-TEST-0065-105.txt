Video: Packers QB Aaron Rodgers Has His Championship Belt Stolen By State Farm’s ‘Discount Double Check’
Found October 09, 2011 on Rant Sports:
After winning the Super Bowl last season, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers became well known for his popular touchdown dance of the championship belt. Now, the Super Bowl MVP has teamed up with State Farm Insurance to promote their new move–the “Discount Double Check.” State Farm recently released their new commercial in which Rodgers is caught off guard when he realizes people are using his touchdown dance for the Discount Double Check instead of the championship belt. Overall, a pretty funny commercial and if you’re a fan of the championship belt–you’ll love this new commercial with Rodgers.
