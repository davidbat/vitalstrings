– A replica championship belt, which looked very similar to the current WWE World Heavyweight Championship, was presented to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers last night after the Superbowl.   He was presented with the belt during the Packers’ official victory celebration after winning Superbowl 45.   A picture of Rodgers with the belt is below.
It should be noted that this week’s edition of WWE Smackdown will be taped in Green Bay on Tuesday night. F4WOnline.com reports that with their win, the Packers are slated to attend the tapings.
