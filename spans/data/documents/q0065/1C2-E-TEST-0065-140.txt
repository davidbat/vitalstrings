SportsCenter’s Routine About Benchwarmer’s Antics Pretty Solid (Video)

Featuring two of the best anchors at the Worldwide Leader in Sports — Neil Everett and the lovely Linda Cohn — the above video of a SportsCenter segment that highlights the offbeat bench antics of little-used Seton Hall senior basketball player Peter Dill is a real hoot.
Primarily, the segment showcases Dill’s courtside celebrations when one of the players on Seton Hall’s squad does something remarkable on the court, and since Dill doesn’t see the court often, I suppose seeing great plays is about as close as he gets to being involved with one, which is cool.
One cannot help but admire his enthusiasm, and his expressions of joy and the manner in which he exudes his “Gotta Support The Team”-ness are certainly worthy of a few chuckles on their own. For example, his co-opting Aaron Rodgers belt celebration is solid, as are his many variation of the act of fist pumping. But when the graphics wizards at ESPN adds a little lightning into his “Hammer of Thor” celebration, well, it’s pretty good stuff.
Well done, ESPN. And I have to admit, as far as my antagonistic attitude towards ESPN is concerned, this nifty little highlight package about one Peter Dill has left me in a bit of a pickle.
