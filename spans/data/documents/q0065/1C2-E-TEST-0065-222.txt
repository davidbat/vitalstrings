NORTH TEXAS  – Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers was presented the 2011 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible at a press conference Monday after leading the Packers to a 31-25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday evening in Super Bowl XLV.
A media panel and fan vote on www.superbowl.com determined the MVP Award winner, announced during the Super Bowl Postgame Show on Fox, presented by Chevrolet. Rodgers completed 24 of 39 passes for 304 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions Sunday night.
”We think the new Camaro Convertible is a fitting tribute to that great performance last night,” says Kevin Mayer, director of Chevrolet marketing.
The Camaro Convertible appeared on the field during the postgame celebration, and debuts in Chevrolet dealerships later this month. The convertible continues the momentum of Camaro, which is the sales leader in its segment in the United States.  Available with an efficient 3.6-liter Direct Injection V6 engine, or as the V8-powered, 426-hp SS model, Camaro now features a power convertible top for the unequalled fun of open-air driving.
The Super Bowl MVP receives the Pete Rozelle Trophy, a silver trophy made by Tiffany & Co., and the Camaro Convertible.
