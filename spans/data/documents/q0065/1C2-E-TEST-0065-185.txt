NFL will hold Pro Bowl in Hawaii this season
QB - Aaron Rodgers
We were hoping to get that day off.  The NFL had internal discussions about getting rid of the game altogether, which would have been a better idea.  Instead, they're giving it one last shot.

The players ultimately decided that the Pro Bowl is "an important tradition." (And they get free trips to Honolulu.)
