Heading into Super Bowl XLV, there are reports that Aaron Rodgers is single. His parents told reporters that their son is definitely single.
Darla Rodgers said "He's not dating anyone, nothing online is true. Early in his career I would call him and say what's this, you haven't told me. Who is she? You can't let mom be the last to know, he said don't believe any of that, it's not true, it never is. I asked him not to let momma be the last to know."
Ed Rodgers said, "Well he's not dating anyone, those things online, 99.9% are not true."
