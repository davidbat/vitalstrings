NFL Career
Rogers saw little playing time during his first three seasons in the NFL, playing two-to-three games each year as a backup to Brett Favre.  When Favre retired for the first time, though later came back to play for the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings , after the 2007 season, Rodgers was named the starting quarterback.
