Jimmy Graham Mocks Aaron Rodgers’ Belt Celebration in Loss
By Larry Brown September 8, 2011 - Posted in Football
That was New Orleans Saints tight end Jimmy Graham mocking the belt celebration Aaron Rodgers made famous throughout Green Bay’s playoff run last season. You know what’s cool? Scoring on the Packers and throwing the celebration back in their face. You know what’s not cool? Celebrating when your team is down by nine points with three minutes left in the game.
Get a clue, meat. If you’re going to celebrate, make sure your team is WINNING.
