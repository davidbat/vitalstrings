The Aaron Rodgers/Green Bay Packers Championship Title Belt Phenomenon
This whole Aaron Rodgers title belt thing is really taking off. I mean, really taking off.
I have seen, in recent weeks, everything from t-shirts trying to capitalize on the Green Bay Packers success and the Aaron Rodgers title belt celebration, to fans in attendance at Super Bowl XLV with home-made Green Bay Packers championship belts.
Yesterday, the official "Return to Titletown" celebration was held in front of 56,000 rabid Packer fans at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, to help celebrate the return of the Lombardi trophy, and to show gratitude to the entire team for their success.
And what do you suppose was seen in the crowd of 56,000 Packer fans?
That's right......championship title belts!
On signs, or home made, it didn't matter. The Packer fans love this whole title belt thing. And why not? Aaron Rodgers started this thing, and Packer fans love Aaron Rodgers, so it only makes sense that they would run with this title belt idea.
But with all the Green Bay Packer and Aaron Rodgers championship title belt stuff I've seen so far, nothing is quite as cool as the custom belt made by BIG BOY BELTS .
Even I have to got to give that guy props. It's a sweet looking belt.
