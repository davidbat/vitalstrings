I agree with jim, this going for all Hollywood, will cause him to lose respect, just like Romo... why dont these guys ever go for some normal people?

It is rare to encounter a professional person in whom you can have some trust. In the world today, nobody really cares about showing others exactly how in this matter. How blessed I am to have found a wonderful web site as this. It truly is people like you who make a genuine difference in this world through the thoughts they discuss.

Aaron Rogers is hot, don't know why he continues to go for those skinny super model types. Guess he figures that is what everyone expects him to date. He needs to date a girl that looks healthy and isn't afraid to eat a meal in front in front of him. That doesn't consist of goat cheese an Tofu. These scrawny unhealthy Lindsy Lohan females (jacked up on something). How bout someone who is down home and healthy lookiing who hasn't had some kind of work done for once would be nice. Don't care if she's tattoo'd. Everyone is now-a-days. Think OUT SIDE THE TACO shaped females.
