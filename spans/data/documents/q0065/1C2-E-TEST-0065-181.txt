it's got nothing to do with the lombardi trophy really
it's just something fans of wrestling do
i'm surprised no one from the chargers has ever done it, they have, or used to have wrestling fans on the team (you can hear them during the redskins pregame that LT won on a run in OT, also hanik milligan doing the john cena taunt during the coin toss leading into OT was hilarious)
