Aaron Rodgers.......show me your belt!
For those fans who have been watching the Green Bay Packers in 2010/11, you've noticed the "championship belt" touchdown celebration that Aaron Rodgers, and other Packers, are fond of.
So in honor of the 2010 Green Bay Packers going to Super Bowl XLV, BIG BOY BELTS of southern Wisconsin has created the championship title belt that Mr. Rodgers keeps alluding to. Their custom work is available for viewing on Facebook as well.
It is based on a 1999 WCW licensed Figures Inc. adult size replica belt. That particular belt was often times referred to as "the 10lbs of gold" by greats such as Ric Flair.
I guess that would make this 'the 10lbs of Green & Gold'???
