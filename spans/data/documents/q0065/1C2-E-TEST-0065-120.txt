[ edit ] Draft
Rodgers was widely projected to be the number one pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, but slipped to the 24th overall pick to the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers' slip to the 24th choice by the Green Bay Packers became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. The San Francisco 49ers , who held the first overall pick, were not interested in Rodgers as then-49ers head coach Mike Nolan , a strong personality, did not believe that Rodgers' attitude could co-exist with him. The 49ers would select quarterback Alex Smith . [39] In addition, many teams drafting between 2nd and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback. [40] Rodgers was one of five other quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round, joining Trent Dilfer , Akili Smith , David Carr , Joey Harrington , and Kyle Boller .

[ edit ] Backup seasons (2005–2007)
Rodgers in September 2007
In August 2005 Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met. [41]
Rodgers spent his rookie season with the 4-12 Packers as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre . He received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre. [42] He had to endure a malfunctioning radio in his helmet and two offensive flags. In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the series by converting two third towns and throwing a touchdown pass to Tight End Ben Steele against the Tennesee Titans . [43] As the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action for the rest of the season. He saw some action behind center against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52-3 victory, and completed his first career pass to Fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards. [32] On December 19, 2005 Rodgers entered in to the competition against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 3-48 loss. [32] He completed eight passes out of the 15 attempted for 65 yards and an interception. [44] Rodgers saw one more play at the end of the season against the Seattle Seahawks , taking a knee to end the game. [32]
Though Rodgers played very little in his rookie season, he ran the scout team during practice. [45] His job was to mimic opponents' schemes for the defense for the game the following week. Rodgers said this was critical to his success, and that those were his game reps. [46] The defense and scouts often complained that he was practicing too hard, and at one point asked him to tone it down. [45] He stated that he had probably "rubbed people the wrong way" with how hard he practiced. [45] Wide receiver Donald Driver , commented that Rodgers took "every scout-team possession like it was the last possession of his life." [46]
After the losing season of Rodgers' rookie year, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by current head coach Mike McCarthy . [47] [48] Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's "Quarterback school" for six hours a day several times a week. [49] This focused on working on his motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics. [45] McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release. [38] He was also instructed to lower his body fat ratio from 15 percent to 12 percent. [45] Rodgers was resistant to the changes at first but later commented that he thought they were for the better. [49] During practice in 11-on-11 drills, Rodgers completed 62.7% of his passes with seven interceptions, and McCarthy commented that "He's getting better" and that "You're looking at a guy who's going to mature. He's got athletic ability that people still haven't seen." [38]
Favre did not attend the quarterback school under the new coaching management and thus knew none of the terminology in the new system. It was here that the friendship between the two began to form as Rodgers instructed which plays in the Sherman system corresponded to those in the new McCarthy system. [49] When the preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns. [32]
Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season , but did step in on October 2 when Favre left owing to injury, and completed two out of three passes for 13 yards. [32] On November 19, 2006 Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Brett Favre, and missed the remainder of the 2006 season. [49] He made a full recovery and was ready for the start of the 2007 season. With then quarterbacks' coach Tom Clements , Rodgers reviewed every play from the previous season, learning to read defensive coverages and to throw receivers open. [49] He also took the spring practice reps with the Packers first team. [49]
However, weeks after an emotional interview with NBC's Andrea Kramer, following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season , again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Green Bay Packers' starting quarterback. [50] Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss . [51] However, Moss was traded to the New England Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL Draft , and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.
Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on November 29, 2007. [52] He completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions. [52] He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times. [52] Rodgers brought the team back from a 17 point deficit to a 3 point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27. [52]
[ edit ] 2008
Brett Favre 's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008 opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season . Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets , which meant that Rodgers would become the starter. [53]
With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field . This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and 2 touchdowns (1 passing/1 rushing). [54] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Detroit Lions . [55] During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The streak was the third longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163). [56] Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later, which to many proved his toughness. [57] Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so. [57] [58] On October 31, 2008 Rodgers signed a six year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season. [59] [60]
[ edit ] 2009
For the opening game of the 2009 season , Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears . [61] Rodgers was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month. [62] After a mediocre 4–4 start to the season and a devastating loss to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers , the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, 9 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions . Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs. Rodgers also made the record books, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter. [63] His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey 's all-time single-season record. [64]
In his first action as a starter in the playoffs against the Arizona Cardinals , Rodgers's first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie . Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game 28 of 42 for 422 yards with four touchdowns. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on the last play of the game in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory. It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history. [65]
Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third Quarterback behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre . However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV , Rodgers became the NFC's starter for the game. He finished the day 15 of 19 passing with 197 yards and two touchdowns, despite the NFC losing the game.
[ edit ] 2010
After Rodgers led his team to a 2–0 start in 2010 , the Packers lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5. In Week 14 of the season, Rodgers sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Detroit Lions . Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history. [66] However, he turned around the team's performance; they won the final two regular season games against the New York Giants and Chicago Bears, both de-facto playoff elimination games. [67]
With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the NFL playoffs as the No. 6 seed Wild Card. Rodgers led the Packers past the top three seeds in the NFC on the road in consecutive weeks. In the Wild Card round, they defeated the No. 3 seeded Philadelphia Eagles 21–16. In the divisional round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 48–21 victory over the No. 1 seeded Atlanta Falcons. [68] During the contest with the Falcons, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games) . On January 23, 2011 Rodgers struggled with a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship. [69] The Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV , which they won, 31–25, against the Pittsburgh Steelers . Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and 3 touchdowns in the win, and was named Super Bowl XLV MVP for his performance. [70] [18] He was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for the 2010 season. [71]
[ edit ] 2011
Rodgers got the Packers off to a 13–0 start in 2011 until they were beaten by the Kansas City Chiefs . He played the best season in his career to date, throwing for 4,643 yards, 45 touchdowns and just 6 interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which is now the best single season passer rating in NFL history. These numbers earned him the NFC Offensive Player of the Month award for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, & 13). He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping Gobbler for MVP in the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Detroit Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13) . The Packers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, Rodgers playing in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being week 17 vs. the Detroit Lions, a game in which he could be rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week.
[ edit ] Touchdown celebration
Since becoming a starter, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration which he and his teammates have dubbed the "Championship Belt". After a scoring play Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible belt on around his waist. [72] [73] Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: "It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense." [74] The gesture drew the praise of World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic the celebration as a point of pride during games. [74]
In addition to the fans, teammates and opponents have also done the celebration. During the NFC Divisional Round of the playoffs on January 15, 2011 against the Atlanta Falcons , Rodgers was sacked by Falcons defensive end John Abraham who performed the celebration immediately following the play. It was Abraham's only sack of the night. Minutes later, Rodgers scored a rushing touchdown and did the celebration in the Falcons' endzone. The Packers went on to win the game 48–21. [74] Additionally, after scoring a touchdown in the NFC Championship game , fellow Packer B. J. Raji celebrated using the "Championship Belt" celebration. [75] While holding the Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl XLV , Rodgers' teammate Clay Matthews placed a replica of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt on Rodgers' shoulder.
Rodgers' celebration is also featured in a State Farm commercial in which he appears, the celebration is called the "Discount Double Check". [76] A second State Farm commercial with Rodgers featured teammate Raji doing the celebratory move. [77]
