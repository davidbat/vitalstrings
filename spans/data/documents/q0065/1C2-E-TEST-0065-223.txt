I’d rather be a whiny pussy than a faggy goth kid.

Nice “favretard” hidden tag on the jersey shot.  Subtlety is the clitoris of genius or something like that.

I live in Wisconsin – pleae tell me Goth A-Rod will be a regular guest.  The Cheesedicks in GB deserve this…

“Mr. Rodgers, Lynn Dickey and Don Majkowski are on conference call on line one.”
By the way, dick_gozinia, porky1: well played, old chums.

Green Bay has a Hot Topic?

Hey Drew. C’mon! Aren’t you always bitching about over-Favrerization? Can’t you draw upon something else for a change?
Are you honestly gonna give Tavaris a free pass here? The guy who, even more than Rodgers, stands poised to take an otherwise Super Bowl caliber team and drive it straight into the toilet? And drive you to puking in said toilet?
C’mon, you can’t write a better script than a complete disaster of a QB starting for a team with title aspirations and a recovering alcoholic star defensive end! Throw in Childress and certain vag-swilling O-lineman and you have a season-long series!

Damn, Rodgers will never get that fine cheesehead tang (as seen in the GOD jersey pic)

If you want to read a guy who bitches about his favorite team all season long, go read Simmons.

Fuckin’-A, if Brett Favre is God, I’m goin’ Satanist. Besides, the Devil’s been giving me some dynamite proposals lately.

Three thoughts:
1.  That Photoshop is just … wow.  Scrumtrilescent, I guess, would be a good word to describe it.  Is that Fergie’s hair?
2.  Can anyone remember another time where a potential #1 overall pick has been picked 20+ spots later than most experts thought he would be, and still managed to become a bust?
3.  Why, oh why, can’t the Eagles be on the Packers schedule this year? “Goth Aaron Rodgers Meets the Emo Eagles” would make “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein” look like “Scooby-Doo Meets the Harlem Globetrotters.”

Is that Scott Stapp in the last picture?

The world is a festering pile of molten spider excrement. And its people are clones, ghoulish clones of death whose only mission is to suck each other dry, and then to ejaculate their hate babies upon piles of twisted, mangled flesh and broken bones. There is no sun. There is no day. There is only night – a long, dark night of savage bloodletting. In a world of hopeless decay and indifference. Left to its own shadowy fate.
So that’s why all those suburban kids kill themselves?  I still don’t get it, but OKAYEEE.

Aaron’s Mom and Step-Dad TOTALLY don’t get him. OMG.

That last picture is one scary lookin’ Troll Doll.

Greg Olsen is making me sexist
Good ole’ bleeding arms Rodgers.

The guy in the “God” Favre jersey needs to die. That is all.

If there’s a better stereotype of women in Green Bay than the chick on the right of the “God” jersey guy, I’d like to see it.

Deep down we all know that’s a growler on his chin right?

By the way, Drew, where’s your help today? Did the rest of the gay mafia take the day off?

“There is only night – a long, dark night of savage bloodletting.”
Seems somebody else has been hanging out with Ray Lewis.

Whoa, whoa whoa….. is that a black man in the stands at Lambeau?  Didn’t see that one coming.

/feels somewhat less bitchy for naming fantasy team “Aaron Rodgers’ Rage Diaries” now.

Nah. The only way you’d see a black man in the stands at a game in Wisconsin is if Ron Artest played the Bucks.

Well, I guess that makes him good trade bait for the Emo Eagles
