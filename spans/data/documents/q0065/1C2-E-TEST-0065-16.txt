The Evolution Of Aaron Rodgers' Weird "Belt Dance"
Found January 10, 2011 on Sports Page Network:
I am sure we have all noticed what has become Aaron Rodgers' signature celebration . He does something good and then he straps on an imaginary belt.
So is this a championship belt, like what overpaid fake wrestlers get? Is it a belt which he hangs his holsters on because he is a gun slinger (a stab at good 'ol whats his name? The guy who used to be the best Packer quarterback ever)?
The thing is, no one really knows. The more important thing is that it is working.
Aaron Rodgers is one of the hottest quarterbacks in the NFL as of late. He has been leading drives with more confidence than ever and his decision making only gets better.
When I was watching the Eagles-Packers wild card game, I also could not help but notice how much more mobile Rodgers has become in the pocket. He has become fantastic at extending the play in order to find the open receiver down field.
So, as the playoffs enter the 2nd round, keep on eye on Rodgers. If he keeps playing at this level, he will have plenty of reason to continue the belt dance.
