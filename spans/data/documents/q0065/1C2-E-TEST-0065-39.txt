With his Detroit Lions playing in Green Bay, defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was in the spotlight. He delivered a moment that wonâ€™t require a talk with NFL disciplinarians but will add fuel to Packers fans' spite.
Suh drew a two-game suspension for stomping on a Packers offensive lineman in the team's Thanksgiving Day game. Sunday's act wasn't egregious.

It was mockery in high style.
Suh came up with a sack on third down in the third quarter of the season-ending game, a big one that the Lions hoped to win for playoff positioning. And coming off the ground, he proceeded to mock Packers QB Aaron Rodgers' touchdown dance, the title belt-style gesture he turned into a commercial property.
There was one problem with Suh's strut. Rodgers was on the sideline in civilian clothes, held out to prevent injury as the Packers prepare for the playoffs. The sack was on fill-in QB Matt Flynn.
Looking at the game, it's easy to see why Suh might have been confused. Flynn went 31-of-44 passing for 480 yards and six touchdowns, the last one of the game-winning variety in a 45-41 shootout.
Suh, it seems, wasn't the only one doing a Rodgers imitation.
For those who might have forgotten, Suh was suspended because he stomped on Packers guard Evan Dietrich-Smith after having pounded his head into the turf three times.
Suh's next stage will be the playoffs. Despite their loss, the Lions had clinched a playoff spot last week. Because of Atlanta's win over Tampa Bay on Sunday, the Lions will be the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs and travel to New Orleans for their wild card round game.
