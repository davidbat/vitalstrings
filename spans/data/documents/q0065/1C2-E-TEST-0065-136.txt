Brett Favre 's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season.  Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets , allowing Rodgers to take over as the starting quarterback.
With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field , marking the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a game for the Packers.  Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and 2 touchdowns (1 passing/1 rushing). In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Detroit Lions . During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163). Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later which to many proved his toughness. Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.  On October 31, 2008, Rodgers signed a six year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season.
2009 season
Edit
For the opening game of the 2009 regular season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation when his team was trailing entering the 4th quarter when he made a fifty yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to help beat the Chicago Bears 21-15. Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009 when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and had a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month. After getting off to a mediocre 4-4 start to the season, and a devastating loss to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers , the team started to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for 1,324 yards, 9 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions. Rodgers and the Packers won 2 of their last 3 games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7-1 record and an overall 11-5 record; that was good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the 5th seed in the playoffs. Rodgers also made history, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter. His passing yardage was good for second all-time in Packers history behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single-season record.
In his first action as a starter in the playoffs against the Arizona Cardinals, Rodgers first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. However, Rodgers settled down after that miscue to finish the game 28 of 42 for 422 yards with four touchdowns. Despite the big game he had offensively, the Packers lost the game when Rodgers fumbled on the last play of the game in overtime, which was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning score for a 51-45 Cardinals victory. It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.
Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third Quarterback behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter for the game. He finished the day 15 of 19 passing with 197 yards and two touchdowns, despite the NFC losing the game.
2010 season
Edit
Playoff Glory: Aaron Rodgers
After leading his team to a 2–0 start in 2010, the Packers lost three of their next four games including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5. During Week 12 against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers threw 35 passing attempts, putting him at 1,505 for his career – making him eligible for all official NFL quarterback records as recognized by the NFL.  In Week 14 of the season, Rodgers sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Detroit Lions. It was the Lions first division win since 2007, snapping a 19-game losing streak against division rivals.  Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history. However, Rodgers turned around the team's performance, winning the final two regular season games against the New York Giants and Chicago Bears, both de-facto playoff elimination games.
With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the NFL playoffs as the #6 seed Wild Card. During the playoffs, Rodgers led the Packers past the top three seeds in the NFC on the road in consecutive weeks. In the Wild Card round, they defeated the #3 seeded Philadelphia Eagles 21–16. In the divisional round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 48–21 victory over the #1 seeded Atlanta Falcons.  On January 23, 2011, Rodgers struggled with a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the #2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.  The Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV, which they won, 31–25, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and 3 touchdowns in the win and was named Super Bowl XLV MVP for his performance.
He was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for the 2010 season.
