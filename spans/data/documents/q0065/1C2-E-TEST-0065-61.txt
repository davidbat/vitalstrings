Green Bay Packer Aaron Rodgers Putting His Belt On During the Atlanta Falcons Playoff Game
While it might have appeared that Aaron Rodgers was applying the belt to the bottoms of the Falcons, this footage shows him strapping it on after a touchdown. Interestingly, the Falcons player John Abraham taunted Rodgers for his goofy celebration when Atlanta was down by 14. Whoâ€™s laughing now?
