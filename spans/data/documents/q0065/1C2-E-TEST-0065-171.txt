I'm all for celebration and enthusiasm after the win, but I gotta call bullshit on this statement. I've said it before: An NFL guy shouldn't do a championship belt "move" unless aforementioned guy has actually won an NFL championship.
He hasn't earned it until there's another trophy at 1265 and a certain ring on his finger.
