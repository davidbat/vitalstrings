Here I'm again, I wish I could say that to you, but it's impossible. I just want you to know that. I'll see you on Prudential in NJ I just can't Wait. Keep doing what you do Danny.

Danny! I allways use to say that we don't need to say what we are for real, we have to demonstrate what we are, and for me  you are just briliant and also you have a real shine that cames from your heart. Bless you Danny.

Someone help me understand...  1. Adam has stated he has been living as a gay for 8 years  2. He posed for the picture  3. Danny had no way of knowing his cousin would post it on Facebook (are u responsible for your realtives?)MTV is the real culprit here
