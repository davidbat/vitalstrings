first three posters arent even packer fans
you're right
I'm an Eagles fan. !! the packers but I'm an Aaron Rodgers fan. I'm happy HE won the super bowl.
I was telling dudes after last season he is cold-blooded and an elite QB. Even blueprint was telling me he aint !! cuz he didnt win a playoff game but i knew dude was gonna tear !! up this year. Funnest QB to watch after my QB
