Unless there's some new celebration by transference thing I don't know about, Ndamukong Suh mocking Aaron Rodgers ' championship belt move after a sack in Sunday's Detroit Lions-Green Bay Packers game was the dumbest thing that happened during the early games in Week 17. Oh, maybe it wasn't as bad asÂ this orÂ this,Â but it was an insult to all good sense and taunting decency. And isn't that just as bad?
For, you see, Aaron Rodgers wasn't playing on Sunday. He was resting for the playoffs. His backup, Matt Flynn , started in his place. So Suh celebrated a sack of Flynn by derisively performing Rodgers' signature move. That's like sticking out your tongue while posterizing John Paxson

"If people think Colt is worthy to backup Aaron Rodgers, why not keep him and develop him ourselves so we can have a capable backup? Colt's a smart kid. Realistically he knows he's not going to be the starter here or anywhere else for now. If we keep him as a backup, he won't complain and will work hard to get better." - CavsBrownsFan
