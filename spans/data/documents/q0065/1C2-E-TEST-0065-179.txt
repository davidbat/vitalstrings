Aaron Rodgers has been known to play the field …
Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is undoubtedly one of the most private NFL players around.  After looking at his dating pattern over the past two years, it appears this guy isn’t ready to settle down any time soon.
Rumor has it he and ESPN sideline commentator Erin Andrew have been dating quietly for the past six months.  In October Andrews was spotted sitting with the Rodgers family in their private box seats and they all went out to dinner after the game.
During Week 10 in November, a bye week for the Packers, the couple reportedly spent a considerable amount of time together.
That said, it sounds like there have been some sightings with actress Jessica Szohr.  She sat in his box during the December 26 game and the couple attended a Milwaukee Bucks game the following night.
Prior to these recent hookups – the NFL player was in a relationship with Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum fame, and before that there were sightings of the athlete with SI model Julie Henderson, who was looking for a rebound romance after her breakup with hip hop multi-millionaire mogul Russell Simmons.
The 27-year-old hasn’t settled for that special someone but he is working his way through the field of eligible players nonetheless.
Rodgers and the Packers will be going head-to-head against Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons on Saturday, January 15.  One team will move on the Conference Championships.  Ryan is newly engaged to his college sweetheart Sarah Marshall – pics here.
UPDATE 2011:  Rodgers’ current girlfriend is Destiny Newton.  He has recently been photographed enjoying some sun and surf time with the bikini hottie.
