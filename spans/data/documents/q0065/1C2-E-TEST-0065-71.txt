BJ Raji is spicing up Aaron Rodgers championship belt touchdown celebration!
In this new State Farm commercial, Green Bay’s defensive monster BJ Raji gets caught stealing Aaron Rodger’s “Discount Double Check” move in order to save a buck on his insurance. BJ improves on the move by adding his own song and dance to the celebration. You have to check out the big boys moves, he can really get down. This commercial is even better than the original!
