NO JAM WRENCH NECESSARY! Waste King Disposers are "Vortex" powered with permanent magnet motors. These energy efficient, high                 speed motors liquefy food waste just like a blender liquefies food.                 These motors produce more power per pound than any other disposer,                 and virtually eliminates jamming. Our exclusive 180 degree stainless                 steel swivel impellers reduce jamming to the point that a Jam Wrench                 is an obsolete piece of equipment. All units include corrosion proof                 grinding chambers, constructed with the most durable glass filled                 nylon for long lasting performance. This design eliminates "Dishwasher Connection Rot". Every unit features a front                 mounted reset button. You will never need to search for the reset                 button because it is so easy to locate and engage.
For properly sized systems, our units are Septic Safe.
No request is too large or too small. Custom orders are our                 specialty. We offer quick turnaround on all items. Our products meet                 the highest standards of quality and workmanship.
