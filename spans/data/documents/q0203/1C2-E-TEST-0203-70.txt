Garbage-can is a        decision making process which changes the actual organizational problem.        It is said that four basic streams which influence the decision are:        problems, solutions, participants and choice opportunities. In a        Garbage-Can situation how these streams will be mixed it is unpredictable.        It is a situation where problems, solutions, and participants move from        one choice to another, frequently. This situation leads to three kinds of        decision making styles:
 Decision By          Oversight: Decisions are made for the sake of making deci­sion without          considering if they are addressing the real problem or not.
Decision By Flight:          Decision is not made till the time problem leaves the existing and          attached choice.
Decision By          Resolution: The problems are resolved on ad-hoc basis.
 According to the model        participants deals with the same problem again and again, therefore,        efficiency level is low. Below are given three aspects of efficiency:
Problem Activity which          means how much time is spent to the unresolved problems;
Problem Latency which          refers to the amount of time spend to the problem without being linked          to the choice(s); and
Decision Time which          means the "persistence to choices". A good process          would keep both problem activity and problem latency low through rapid          problem solution, however, it is not observed in the garbage-can          process.
The main theme of the        garbage-can is based on that the decision is not necessarily touching the        real problem. Decisions makers are likely to shift from one problem to        another more frequently. As far as efficiency of the organ­iz­ation is        concerned it is low in such cases.
