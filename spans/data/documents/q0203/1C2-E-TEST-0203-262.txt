Hazardous Waste
Hazardous waste presents immediate or long-term risks to                        humans, animals, plants, or the environment. It requires                        special handling for detoxification or safe disposal. In                        the U.S., hazardous waste is legally defined as any discarded                        solid or liquid that
contains one or more of 39 carcinogenic, mutagenic,                          or teratogenic compounds at levels that exceed established                          limits (includingmany solvents, pesticides, and paint                          strippers);
catches fire easily (such as gasoline, paints, and solvents);
is reactive or unstable enough to explode or release                          toxic fumes (including acids, bases, ammonia, and chlorine                          bleach); or
is capable of corroding metal containers such as tanks,                          drums, and barrels (such as industrial cleaning agents                          and oven and drain cleaners).
The EPA has a list of more than 500 specific hazardous wastes.
Who's Responsible?
Businesses such as metal finishers, gas stations, auto repair                        shops, dry cleaners, and photo developers produce many toxic                        waste products. These by-products include sulfuric acid,                        heavy metals found in batteries, and silver-bearing waste,                        which comes from photo finishers, printers, hospitals, schools,                        dentists, doctors, and veterinarians. Heavy metals, solvents,                        and contaminated wastewater result from paint manufacturing.                        Photo processing also creates organic chemicals, chromium                        compounds, phosphates, and ammonium compounds. Even cyanide                        can be a by-product, resulting from electroplating and other                        surface-treatment processes.
If you think industry is the only source of hazardous                        waste, you may be surprised. There is hazardous household                        waste as well. For example, do you use any of the following                        items?*
automotive products, such as gasoline, antifreeze,                        and batteries
oil-based paints and thinners
pesticides, herbicides, and other garden products
household cleaning products
* There are nontoxic alternatives to many of these products                        that, when disposed of, do not constitute hazardous waste.                        Check with a local "green consumer" organization or find                        out more in the related resources section of this exhibit.
