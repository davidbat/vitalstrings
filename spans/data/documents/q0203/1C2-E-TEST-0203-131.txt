Cotton
Background
Cotton is a shrubby plant that is a member of the Mallow family. Its name       refers to the cream-colored fluffy fibers surrounding small cottonseeds       called a boll. The small, sticky seeds must be separated from the wool in       order to process the cotton for spinning and weaving. De-seeded cotton is       cleaned, carded (fibers aligned), spun, and woven into a fabric that is       also referred to as cotton. Cotton is easily spun into yarn as the cotton       fibers flatten, twist, and naturally interlock for spinning. Cotton fabric       alone accounts for fully half of the fiber worn in the world. It is a       comfortable choice for warm climates in that it easily absorbs skin       moisture. Most of the cotton cultivated in the United States is a       short-staple cotton that grows in the American South. Cotton is planted       annually by using the seeds found within the downy wool. The states that       primarily cultivate cotton are located in the "Cotton Belt," which runs east and west and includes parts of California, Alabama,       Arkansas, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico,       North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, which       alone produces nearly five million bales. Together, these states produce       approximately 16 million bales a year, second only to China. Business       revenue generated by cotton today is approximately $122.4       billion—the greatest revenue of any United States crop.
The cotton plant is a source for many important products other than       fabric. Among the most important is cottonseed, which is pressed for       cottonseed oil that is used in commercial products such as salad oils and       snack foods, cosmetics, soap, candles, detergents, and paint. The hulls       and meal are used for animal feed. Cotton is also a source for cellulose       products, fertilizer, fuel, automobile tire cord, pressed paper, and       cardboard.
History
Cotton was used for clothing in present-day Peru and Mexico perhaps as       long as 5,000 years ago. Also, cotton was grown, spun, and woven in       ancient India, China, Egypt, and Pakistan, around 3000
B.C.
Cotton is not native to Western Europe. Around A.D. 800, Arabic traders       likely introduced cotton to Spaniards. By the fourteenth century,       Mediterranean farmers were cultivating the cotton plant and shipping the       fiber to the Netherlands for spinning and weaving. British innovations in       the late 1700s include water-powered spinning machinery, a monumental       improvement over hand-spinning. An American named Samuel Slater, who       worked with British machinery, memorized the plans for a machine spinner       and returned to Rhode Island to set up Slater Mill, the first American       textile mill to utilize machine spinners. This mill represents the       beginning of the U.S. Industrial Revolution, built on the mechanism of the       cotton industry.
Two developments spurred the cultivation of American cotton: cotton       spinners and the cotton gin. The cotton gin, developed by Eli Whitney in       1793, easily removed tenacious cottonseeds. Southern plantation owners       began planting cotton as a result of these innovations, using enslaved       labor for harvesting the cotton. Vigorous cotton cultivation in the South       using enslaved labor is considered one reason for friction between North       and South that led to the Civil War.
Southern cotton was shipped to New England mills in huge quantities. As a       result of machine spinning, weaving, and printing, Americans could cheaply       purchase calico and it became universally worn. However, labor costs were       significant in New England. Mill owners found ways to reduce those costs,       first by employing women and immigrants who were often paid poorly, then       by employing young children in the factories. After oppressive labor       practices were largely halted, many factories moved to the South where       labor was cheaper. (Unionizing efforts affected the profits of those       mills.) Today, a fair amount of cotton is woven outside the United States       where labor is less costly. Polyester, a synthetic, is often used along       with cotton, but has little chance of supplanting the natural fiber.
Raw Materials
The materials required to take cotton bolls to spun cotton include       cottonseeds for planting; pesticides, such as insecticides, fungicides,       and herbicides, to battle disease and harmful insects; and fertilizers to       enrich the soil.
There are agricultural requirements for growing cotton in the United       States. Cotton has a long growing season (it can be as long as seven       months) so it is best to plant cotton early—February in Texas but       as late as June in northern cotton-growing states such as Missouri. Cotton       should not be planted before the sun has warmed the soil. It performs best       in well-drained, crumbly soils that can hold moisture. It can be grown       between latitudes of 30° north and 30° south. Good cotton crops       require a long, sunny growing season with at least 160 frost-free days and       high moisture levels resulting from rainfall or irrigation during the       growing season. However, too much rain during harvest or strong winds       during picking can damage the open bolls and load the fiber with too much       water, which can ruin the cotton in storage. Generally, a cotton farmer       must farm about 2,000 acres (20,000 hectares) if the operation is to be       economically viable. On average, an acre will produce about 1.5 bales of       cotton, or about 750 lb (340 kg).
The Production Process
In spring, the acreage is cleared for planting. Mechanical cultivators         rip out weeds and grass that may compete with the cotton for soil         nutrients, sunlight, and water, and may attract pests that harm cotton.         The land is plowed under and soil is broken up and formed into rows.
Cottonseed is mechanically planted by machines that plant up to 12 rows at a time. The planter opens a small furrow in each row, drops in seed,         covers them, and then packs more dirt on top. Seed may be deposited in         either small clumps (referred to as hill-dropped) or singularly (called         drilled). The seed is placed 0.75 to 1.25 in (1.9 to 3.2 cm) deep,         depending on the climate. The seed must be placed more shallowly in         dusty, cool areas of the Cotton Belt, and more deeply in warmer areas.
With good soil moisture and warm temperature at planting, seedlings         usually emerge five to seven days after planting, with a full stand of         cotton appearing after about 11 days. Occasionally disease sets in,         delaying the seedlings' appearance. Also, a soil crust may         prevent seedlings from surfacing. Thus, the crust must be carefully         broken by machines or irrigation to permit the plants to emerge.
Approximately six weeks after seedlings appear, "squares," or flower buds, begin to form. The buds mature for three weeks and then         blossom into creamy yellow flowers, which turn pink, then red, and then         fall off just three days after blossoming. After the flower falls away,         a tiny ovary is left on the cotton plant. This ovary ripens and enlarges         into a green pod called a cotton boll.
The boll matures in a period that ranges from 55 to 80 days. During this         time, the football-shaped boll grows and moist fibers push the newly         formed seeds outward. As the boll ripens, it remains green. Fibers         continue to expand under the warm sun, with each fiber growing to its         full length—about 2.5 in (6.4 cm)—during three weeks. For         nearly six weeks, the fibers get thicker and layers of cellulose build         up the cell walls. Ten weeks after flowers first appeared, fibers split         the boll apart, and cream-colored cotton pushes forth. The moist fibers         dry in the sun and the fibers collapse and twist together, looking like         ribbon. Each boll contains three to five "cells," each         having about seven seeds embedded in the fiber.
Most steps involved in the production of cotton have been             mechanized, including seeding, picking, ginning, and baling. Samples             are taken from the bales to determine the quality of the cotton.
At this point the cotton plant is defoliated if it is to be machine         harvested. Defoliation (removing the leaves) is often accomplished by         spraying the plant with a chemical. It is important that leaves not be         harvested with the fiber because they are considered "trash" and must be removed at some point. In addition,         removing the leaves minimizes staining the fiber and eliminates a source         of excess moisture. Some American crops are naturally defoliated by         frost, but at least half of the crops must be defoliated with chemicals.         Without defoliation, the cotton must be picked by hand, with laborers         clearing out the leaves as they work.
Harvesting is done by machine in the United States, with a single         machine replacing 50 hand-pickers. Two mechanical systems are used to         harvest cotton. The picker system uses wind and guides to pull the         cotton from the plant, often leaving behind the leaves and rest of the         plant. The stripper system chops the plant and uses air to separate the         trash from the cotton. Most American cotton is harvested using pickers.         Pickers must be used after the dew dries in the morning and must         conclude when dew begins to form again at the end of the day. Moisture         detectors are used to ensure that the moisture content is no higher than         12%, or the cotton may not be harvested and stored successfully. Not all         cotton reaches maturity at the same time, and harvesting may occur in         waves, with a second and third picking.
Next, most American cotton is stored in "modules," which         hold 13-15 bales in water-resistant containers in the fields until they         are ready to be ginned.
The cotton module is cleaned, compressed, tagged, and stored at the gin.         The cotton is cleaned to separate dirt, seeds, and short lint from the         cotton. At the gin, the cotton enters module feeders that fluff up the         cotton before cleaning. Some gins use           vacuum pipes to send fibers to cleaning equipment where trash is         removed. After cleaning, cotton is sent to gin stands where revolving         circular saws pull the fiber through wire ribs, thus separating seeds         from the fiber. High-capacity gins can process 60, 500-lb (227-kg) bales         of cotton per hour.
Cleaned and de-seeded cotton is then I 0 compressed into bales, which         permits economical storage and transportation of cotton. The compressed         bales are banded and wrapped. The wrapping may be either cotton or         polypropylene, which maintains the proper moisture content of the cotton         and keeps bales clean during storage and transportation.
Every bale of cotton produced in the United States must be given a gin         ticket and a warehouse ticket. The gin ticket identifies the bale until         it is woven. The ticket is a bar-coded tag that is torn off during         inspection. A sample of each bale is sent to the United States         Department of Agriculture (USDA) for evaluation, where it is assessed         for color, leaf content, strength, fineness, reflectance, fiber length,         and trash content. The results of the evaluation determine the         bale's value. Inspection results are available to potential         buyers.
After inspection, bales are stored in a carefully controlled warehouse.         The bales remain there until they are sold to a mill for further         processing.
Quality Control
Cotton growing is a long, involved process and growers must understand the       requirements of the plant and keep vigilant lookout for potential       problems. Pests must be managed in order to yield high-quality crops;       however, growers must use chemicals very carefully in order to prevent       damage to the environment. Defoliants are often used to maximize yield and       control fiber color. Farmers must carefully monitor moisture levels at       harvesting so bales will not be ruined by excess water during storage.       Soil tests are imperative, since too much nitrogen in the soil may attract       certain pests to the cotton.
Expensive equipment such as cotton planters and harvesters must be       carefully maintained. Mechanical planters must be set carefully to deposit       seed at the right depth, and gauge wheels and shoes must be corrected to       plant rows at the requisite spot. Similarly, improperly adjusted machinery       spindles on harvesting machines will leave cotton on the spindle, lowering       quality of the cotton and harvesting efficiency. A well-adjusted picker       minimizes the amount of trash taken up, rendering cleaner cotton.
Byproducts/Waste
There is much discussion regarding the amount of chemicals used in cotton       cultivation. Currently, it is estimated that growers use, on average, 5.3       oz (151 g) of chemicals to produce one pound of processed cotton. Cotton       cultivation is responsible for 25% of all chemical pesticides used on       American crops. Unfortunately, cotton attracts many pests (most notably       the boll weevil) and is prone to a number of rots and spotting, and       chemicals are used to keep these under control. There are concerns about       wildlife poisoning and poisons that remain in the soil long after cotton       is no longer grown (although no heavy metals are used in the chemicals).       As a result, some farmers have turned to organic cotton growing. Organic       farming utilizes biological control to rid cotton of pests and alters       planting patterns in specific ways to reduce fungicide use. While this       method of cultivation is possible, an organically grown crop generally       yields less usable cotton. This means an organic farmer must purchase,       plant, and harvest more acreage to yield enough processed cotton to make       the crop lucrative, or reduce costs in other ways to turn a profit.       Increasingly, state university extension services are working with cotton       farmers to reduce chemical use by employing certain aspects of biological       control in order to reduce toxins that remain in the land and flow into       water systems.
