Waste-to-Energy Facility
The Waste-to-Energy (WTE) facility has the capacity to burn 3,150 tons of garbage   every day. The WTE facility processes about one million tons of garbage every   year. The process can produce up to 75 megawatts (MW) per hour of electricity.   It sells about 60 MW to Progress Energy for distribution within the community,   and the remainder powers the plant itself. This electricity powers approximately   45,000 homes and businesses every day. The WTE facility uses state-of-the-art   air pollution control technology, which continuously monitors WTE emissions,   ensuring the plant’s emissions fall within the United States Environmental   Protection Agency’s (EPA) standards.
Ash generated from the combustion of solid waste is transferred to the   adjacent Residue Storage and Processing Building. Here, the ash is size-separated   using screens, and both ferrous (steel) and non-ferrous (aluminum) metals are   recovered from the ash using mechanical equipment such as magnets and eddy   currents. The recovered metals are sold to steel mills and smelters for   recycling, and the remaining ash is used for landfill cover and interior site   berms and roadways.
