There are many options for curbside garbage and recycling service in                  the WLSSD service area .  Residents in the                  WLSSD region can choose the waste hauler that suits their garbage and recycling needs,                  unlike some areas that contract with a single waste hauler for the recycling needs of                  the entire city or county.
Waste haulers are carefully licensed and required to offer specific options for                  garbage and recycling services .
