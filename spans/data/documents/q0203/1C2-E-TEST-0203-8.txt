The U.S. maintains the largest market share, but China is expanding its share.  There are increasing cases where Taiwans manufacturers produce their products in China.
A :
Which countries or regions are included in Others in the 2003 data?
B :
Others includes Malaysia (28 units; 0.413 million yen), Canada (48 units; 0.637 million yen) and Norway (3 units; 1.613 million yen).
A :
How about average unit price?
B :
The average unit price by country is as follows:
U.S.: 11,357 yen; Taiwan: 15,873 yen; China: 5,764 yen; Malaysia: 14,750 yen; Canada: 13,271 yen; Norway: 537,666 yen
Three units imported from Norway are of the highest grade.  Many items priced from 11,000 to 16,000 yen are imported.  Made-in-China disposers cost about half that of average imported items.  U.S.-manufactured disposers are low priced due to volume production.
A :
Do users purchase garbage disposers directly from importers and install them by themselves?
B :
No.  The installation of a garbage disposer involves burial of a processor; so in many cases, general contractors, condominium developers, housing manufacturers and building firms purchase disposers directly from importing firms or Japanese agencies of overseas manufacturers, and entrust installation to sewage work companies.  As for the retail price, single unit types sell for about 50,000 yen and disposers with a treatment system cost about 100,000 to 120,000 yen.
A :
How many drying/biodegrading garbage processors are sold?  And how about distribution channels?
B :
No statistics on sales quantities and amounts have been released.  Distribution channels are the same as for ordinary home appliances; manufacturers sell goods to distributors, who then sell to retailers. Consumers then purchase the goods at retail stores.
A :
What is the cause for the low demand for kitchen garbage disposers?
B :
Many local governments that manage sewage systems give administrative guidance to residents to refrain from using garbage disposers, on the grounds that there is a possibility of drains becoming clogged and corrosion occurring and/or odors in the drainpipe.  Some local governments prohibit the use of garbage disposers by regulation.  Users are required to report to the Sewerage Management Department of their local government before installing a disposer.
A :
Is it true that drainpipes become clogged or that corrosion or odors occur in pipes?
B :
The U.S. garbage disposer manufacturers consider Japan to be a promising market, and are conducting a variety of experiments to prove that there are no such possibilities.  But so far, they have not yet succeeded in dispelling the concerns of Japanese local governments.
A :
I think that garbage disposers are convenient and will become popular in Japan.
B :
I agree with you.  U.S. manufacturers estimate that in the next ten years, Japanese homes with garbage disposers will increase to about 30 million.  To see such widespread proliferation of disposers, though, it is necessary to dispel the various concerns of local governments.  Japanese people are beginning to recognize the convenience of garbage disposers; in fact, the number of people who want to live in apartments equipped with garbage disposers is gradually increasing.
A :
What kinds of barriers are there to the proliferation of drying/biodegrading garbage processors?
B :
When first introduced on the market, garbage processors were large and expensive.  In recent years, however, compact machines at affordable prices from 50,000 to 60,000 yen have been on the market, and garbage processors are becoming more popular.
It has been found that the average amount of garbage produced per day by a family of three is 380 grams and that by a family of four is 437 grams.  As a result, manufacturers have begun producing compact machines with a one-time processing capacity of 400 grams, instead of large machines with a processing capacity of 700 grams.  Due to downsizing, prices have dropped, promoting the spread of garbage processors. In addition, some local governments provide subsidies of 20,000 to 30,000 yen to purchasers, giving an impetus to further proliferation.  Currently, 90 percent of purchasers of garbage processors are dwellers of detached homes.  However, it is expected that the use of garbage processors will spread in collective housing as well, since various garbage-related complaints will be eliminated, such as unpleasant odors in the elevators and taking out heavy garbage is troublesome.
A :
Garbage processors seem to have no drawbacks.  Are there any drawbacks?
B :
There are some drawbacks: 1) You should not put paper and plastic in the machine; 2) You should not put large bones and pickled plum seeds, either, to prevent damage to the inside of the machine; 3) You should not put alcohol-containing food wastes, to avoid any odors being created; and 4) You should only put in tea or coffee grounds after draining the moisture from them.
In addition to these, another problem could occur when garbage processors are used in collective housing.  Food wastes are processed into organic fertilizer that can be used on fields or in gardens, but residents who live in collective housing with no fields or gardens will have a problem of how to dispose of the resulting fertilizer.  They will need to find a way to dispose of the fertilizer, for example by finding relatives or acquaintances who can use it on their fields or gardens.
A :
Are there any restrictions on kitchen garbage disposers?
B :
According to the Electrical Appliance and Material Safety Law, the kitchen garbage disposer is designated as a specified electrical appliance and categorized under motorized equipment. The kitchen garbage disposer is required to be tested and certified to conform to applicable standards by an accredited testing institution.  Only certified products can be marketed.  Moreover, since the Sewerage Law and municipal ordinances on sewage also apply, to use a garbage disposer it is necessary to receive permission from the local government that manages the sewage system.
A :
How about future possibilities for kitchen garbage disposers and garbage processors?
B :
The Japanese market for household garbage processing machines is still in its developing stages.  The potential demand is great, and there is no doubt that the market will grow.  Both kitchen garbage disposers and garbage processors have a lot of future potential in Japan.
