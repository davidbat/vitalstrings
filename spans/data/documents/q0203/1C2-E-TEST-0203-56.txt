Household garbage is no longer a liability to the community, but rather an asset. It is recycled into clean, safe a raw material with many uses. At a WastAway recycling center, tons of household garbage are transformed into a stable product called "FluffÂ®."
Garbage is delivered to our facility by the usual collection vehicles where it is dumped on the tipping floor for an initial pre-shred process. It is important to realize that there is no sorting or preprocessing at the tipping floor. All household garbage is recycled.
A front-end loader is used to load garbage for the beginning of the WastAway process. Our patented process grinds and shreds all household garbage.
The WastAway System, as manufactured by Bouldin & Lawson , processes the garbage as it travels through each step.
The household garbage now begins to be broken down into a homogenous material as the conveyors carry it through the WastAway process. Garbage is processed into Fluff in about 20 minutes. A typical system processes 100 tons of garbage per day. Multiple systems are used to process larger waste streams.
In the final stage of the WastAway process, raw fluff goes through a separation process that removes any remaining ferrous metals and any non ferrous metals. These metals are collected and sold to industry scrap metal recyclers. The beauty of the Wastaway system is that everything can be reclaimed or recycled!
Clean fluff is now ready for transport to a Composite Products of America facility, or used by commercial nurseries as a growing medium for plants, or gasified to create electricity. What was common household garbage just minutes ago, is now a useful raw material ready for a variety of ecologically-friendly uses.
The WastAway process is covered by several patents and represents a real solution to America's landfill problems. To learn more about the uses for Fluff and see products made from fluff, see our products page and also visit Composite Products of America's website.
