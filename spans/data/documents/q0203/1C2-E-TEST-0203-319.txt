Profile
To manufacture plastic pipe, industry uses a process known                        as Profile Extrusion. This process is used to manufacture                        plastic products with a continuous cross-section such as;                        drinking straws, plastic evestroughing, decorative molding,                        window trimming and a wide variety of other products polymer                        melt into the hollow mold cavity under high pressure.
The                        plastic is fed in pellet form into the machines hopper (                        this machine is known as an Extruder ), the material is                        conveyed continuously forward by a rotating screw inside                        a heated barrel being softened by both friction and heat. The softened plastic is then forced out through a die and                        directly into cool water where the product solidifies. From                        here it is conveyed onwards into the take-off rollers, which                        actually do the pulling of the softened plastic from the                        die.
The die is a metal plate placed at the end of the extruder                        with a section cut out of its interior, this cutout, and                        the speed of the take-off rollers, determines the cross-section                        of the product being manufactured. A simple way to understand                        this concept is to consider squeezing a toothpaste tube,                        the product comes out in a solid rod because of the opening                        at the end of the tube, if that opening had a different                        cross-section than the product produced would take on that                        new cross-section.
Pipe is one of the more common types of plastic product                        we are familiar with. Pipe is produced by an extrusion process.                        Basically extrusion can be defined as forcing a material                        through a die orifice. This die orifice produces the final                        shape of the finished product. It is probably a bit of over                        simplification, but extrusion is somewhat analogous to squeezing                        toothpaste through a tube.
Plastic tube, sheet, wire and profile shapes are all also                        manufactured by this process. In fact, the plastic resin                        granules or pellets used for injection molding are produced                        by extrusion. A long strand or filament of extruded plastic                        is chopped or cut into pellet-sized pieces to produce plastic                        injection molding materials.
Extrusion produces an inherently strong finished product.                        More so than a molding process. This is one of the reasons                        that plastic pipe is rated at higher pressures than injection                        molded plastic fittings.
Blown                        Film
To manufacture Garbage bags, industry uses a process known                        as Blown Film Extrusion. This process is used to                        manufacture not only garbage bags but also items such as;                        vapor barrier, bread bags, grocery bags, or any one of thousands                        of different items that you would see packaged for resale.
The plastic is fed in pellet form into the machines hopper                        ( this machine is known as an Extruder ), the plastic is                        conveyed forward by a rotating screw inside a heated barrel                        and softened by both friction and heat. The softened plastic                        is then forced upwards through a circular die in a shape                        of a hollow tube.
This is a continuous process where the tube is expanded                        with air above the die, and collapsed by the take-off or                        nip rollors, the volume of air inside the bubble, the speed                        of the nip rollers and the extruders output rate all play                        a role in determining the thickness and size of the film.
The                        tube or "web" of film is then continuously rolled up by                        take-off rollers, or the web of film may be fed directly                        into a bag-machine in an in-line process. The tube is heat-sealed                        across its width to form the bottom of the bag and cut across                        further up the tube to form the opening.
Extrusion                      Blow
The Extrusion blow molding process begins with the conventional                      extrusion of a parison or tube, using a die similar to that                      used for making plastic pipe.
To manufacture Plastic Bottles, industry uses a process known                      as Blow Molding. This process is used to manufacture hollow                      plastic bottles such as; milk jugs, shampoo bottles, bleach                      bottles, or any one of countless products you might see on                      store shelves.
The plastic is fed in pellet form into the machines hopper                      ( this machine is known as a Blow Molder ), the plastic is                      conveyed forward by a screw inside a heated barrel being softened                      by both friction and heat. The softened plastic is then forced                      downwards through a circular die forming a hollow plastic                      tube called a "parison".
The parison is then clamped inside a hollow mold and inflated                      from with-in. The air pressure forces the parison to inflate                      against the mold surface, the plastic cools in the shape of                      the interior of the mold cavity. The mold then opens and the                      plastic bottle is ejected. The bottle may they be conveyed                      on to trimming, printing and filling stations.
Other processes for Blow Molding include Stretch Blow and                      Injection Blow.
Extrusion blow molding: Can be used to process many different                      plastics, including HDPE, PVC, PC, PP, and PETG.
*Requires relatively small                      capital investment in equipment.
*Is suitable for small                      production runs.
Some uses                      for Sheet extrusion; Automotive, building panels, roofing,                      sky domes, lighting, signage and road noise barrier panels,                      food and medical packaging.
