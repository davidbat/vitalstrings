Slow to Empty Trash
G4 eMac 1.25, OS 10.4.11
My eMac HD has less than 10 Gb capacity remaining. I have started the process of moving seldom or un-used applications to an external hard drive (which is working just fine) and then deleting permanently the duplicate applications from the eMac HD.
I have used both AppCleaner and CleanApp to facilitate the transfer of Library and other 'hidden' or hard-to-find application files to Trash.
The deleting process is taking an inordinate amount of time, especially of the applications related to Apple (eg. Automator). I can hear the HD chattering and grinding away, but the progress bar in Secure Empty Trash remains static, even after a period of 30 - 60 minutes.
I have tried Permanent Eraser as an alternative. It works well with some applications but encounters the same hold-up with others.
I've tried putting Trash contents into a d'top folder and then transferring + deleting items one-by-one but this works only with smaller files.
Suggestions? Workaround? Am I doing something wrong?
PS. No wonder Methusela lived to a great age, he was waiting for the deleting process on a Mac to finish!
