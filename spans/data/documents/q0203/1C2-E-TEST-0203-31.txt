Answer:
Not all garbage can be recycled. You recycle aluminum cans, paper, and plastics, and they go to some factory where they are broken down, and reshaped/transformed into the same thing again or something else, such as the recycled dresses that those showcase girls wore on Deal or No Deal for the environmentally friendly "Green week" on NBC primetime.
{EDIT}
There are new technologies like New Planet Energy that can convert any type of carbon waste (was once alive like tires, rubber, plastics, paper, etc.") without any emissions into ethanol and electricity.
