Materials Recovery Facility (MRF)
The Materials Recovery Facility uses single stream                technology to automatically sort the paper, plastic, cans and glass                collected at curbside in San Jos√©.
As incoming material moves along a conveyer belt,                  workers pull out large items, cardboard and plastic bags and toss                  them into bins. Unusable trash is thrown away.
The recyclables move into a double-deck screening machine that separates newspapers, mixed paper and containers into separate                  streams. Material bounces over rows of square wheels spinning                  1,000 times per minute. Blasts of air dislodge cans and bottles                  from newspapers. Gaps between rollers allow smaller items to fall                  onto conveyer belts.
Workers again pull out any trash and discard it.
Next is the trommel-mag - a large, rotating                  tube with small holes in the sides and an electromagnet at one end. Small items such as bottle caps fall through holes.                  The electromagnet snags tin cans. Then it's on to the air                  classifier, where a powerful fan blows lightweight aluminum                  and plastic onto one conveyer, and heavier glass falls onto another.                  Workers sort glass and plastics.
An electromagnetic device diverts aluminum                  cans into a storage bin.
