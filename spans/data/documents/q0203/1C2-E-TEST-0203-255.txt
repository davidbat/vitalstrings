WITHOUT YOU, IT'S ALL JUST TRASH:
"What Happens To Your Recyclables" 1996
Note to viewers
The residential, institutional, and school "Without you, it's all just trash" videos all contain the same beginning and ending cartoons segments. While most of the information on all the "Without you, it's all just trash" videos is still accurate, please note the following updates since 1996:
The Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island officially closed in 2001.
The Visy (now Pratt Industries) Paper Mill on Staten Island opened in 1996.
NYC residents discard approximately 11,000 tons of trash and over 2,000 tons a day of recyclables.
Broken glass is not currently mixed with asphalt to pave NYC's streets; the NYC Department of Transportation uses its own recycled road millings instead.
There is no longer a local NYC company that turns plastic jugs into sawhorses, street cones, and recycling bins (though this may change in the future).
Plastic and glass   recyclables, like all other recyclables collected in NYC, are separated and processed by contracted vendors who then sell these materials on the open market.
The NYC Department of Sanitation no longer provides mechanized collection service for designated metal, glass, and plastic recyclables; DSNY now collects these materials curbside instead.
When recyclables are set out in plastic bags, only CLEAR bags should be used. (Blue bags were formerly required for designated metal, glass, and plastic recyclables.)
NYC residents should call 311 for recycling information, flyers, and decals; the Sanitation Action Center phone number is defunct.
