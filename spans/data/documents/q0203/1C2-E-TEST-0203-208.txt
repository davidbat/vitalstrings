Garbage Can Model of Decision Making
Garbage Can Model of Decision Making
 
-
 
This model of decision making deals with the pattern or flow of multiple decisions within organizations  - the other models tend to be limited to a single decision.
 
This model was  developed to explain the pattern of decision making in organizations  that experience extremely high levels of uncertainty.
In this situation, goals and solutions are ill defined; ambiguity      characterizes each step of a decision process. Cause and effect      relationships within the organization are hard to identify; and there tends      to be a lot of turnover.
The decision  process is not a sequence of steps that begins with a problem and ends  with a solution.
 
Instead, problems may exist and  no solutions may be generated; on the other hand, there may be solutions out  there but they are not connected to specific problems. A problem may lead to a  proposed solution or it may not.  Problems may not be solved when solutions are  adopted.
 
Problems, solutions, participants, and choices all flow through the  organization
 
So, an organization can be seen as a large garbage can in which these  elements are all being stirred.
 
When a problem, solution, and participant happen  to connect at one point, a decision may be made and the problem may be solved.  But if the solution does not fit the problem, the problem may not be solved.  Many times problems arise that are not solved; and many times solutions are  tried that do not work.
 
In this model decisions are not the result of the  logical step by step sequence that other models of decison  making imply.
