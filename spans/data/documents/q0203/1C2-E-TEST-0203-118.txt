"A great introduction to the garbage process."  Booklist
We all throw out an average of 6 lbs. of garbage every day.  Where does it all go? This film takes us on two fascinating trips -- to the landfill with our regular garbage, and to the recycling plant with our newspapers, cans, glass and plastic. Along the way, a plastic milk jug takes a mysterious detour with a surprising result.
Children lead the way and provide commentary, along with New Yorker cartoonist Ed Koren's "furry creature," who gives us the facts. Award-winning Sesame Street songwriters provide the catchy music and lyrics.

Reviews
"A lively video that has plenty of big machines to catch the eye. At the same time, the bouncy original music, occasional camera tricks, and brisk pacing will keep viewers both interested and informed."
School Library Journal
"Catchy tunes, quirky rewind images, and the presence of excited youngsters make this a great introduction to the garbage process."
