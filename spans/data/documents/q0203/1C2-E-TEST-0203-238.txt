There may be an occasion whereby you need to manually trigger the garbage collection process, as by default it runs every twelve hours.  There aren’t going to be many occasions, but one such occasion might be that you want an immediate, up-to-date report on the size of the DIT and the amount of whitespace within the DIT.

Modifying doGarbageCollection via LDIF (using LDIFDE)
The following sample LDIF file will trigger Garbage Collection on the DC that you run this against.
