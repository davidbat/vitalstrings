Process Research on Reducing Neps & Trash and Short Fibers in Blowing-c arding Card Sliver
Zuo Di (Shandong Textile Engineering Acadamy) Â 
Neps, trash and short fibers is a group of contradiction  i n blowing-carding process. Continuous uniform feeding, thin-layer feeding and  light opening, early dropping dust and little damage, carding transport suitable , neps  trash and short fibers are all taken attention, assure air-stream para meter is proposed by analyzing property of Qingfeng blowing-carding process. Co mplement of opening element and carding element, and adjusting the process accor ding to variety and raw material, strengthing maintenance is the important measu re for reducing neps  trash and short fibers of card sliver.
