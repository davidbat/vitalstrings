Since installing Snow Leopard, files attached to emails are left "in use", keeping the trash from emptying if they are inside, hence i have to "Secure Empty Trash" in order to get it to empty at all in those instances.
Until recently i haven't often needed to do this, but for years now, every time i recall clicking the little (x) in the "Emptying Trash" dialog to stop the process partway, the dialog reports that it's stopping but stays on the screen interminably displaying an indeterminate progress bar.
During that time if i don't notice and try to move other items to the trash, i usually get the dialog saying i cannot move anything else to the trash; but sometimes a second dialog will pop up saying finder is +preparing to move+ the file(s) to the trash, but that too will hang about endlessly until i "Force Relaunch" finder.
*Secure emptying or not, why would i not be able to stop the process?*
*Has anyone else actually successfully stopped the process of emptying the trash?*
