M.V./S.S. _________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________
INTRODUCTION
The intent of this document is to provide shipowners/operators with general information on the requirements for complying with regulation 9 of Annex V. Compliance with the provisions of Annex V will require careful planning by the owner/operator and proper execution by shipboard personnel. When developing the most appropriate procedures for handling and storing garbage. factors to take into account include type and size of the ship, the area of operation (e.g. distance from nearest land), shipboard garbage processing equipment and storage space, crew size, duration of the voyage, and regulations and reception facilities at ports of call.

APPLICABILITY
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Amendments to Annex V of Marpol 73/78. Placards, garbage management plans and garbage record-keeping. (1) Every ship of 12 meters or more in length overall shall display placards which notify the crew and passengers of the disposal requirements of regulations 3 and 5 of this Annex, as applicable. The placards shall be written in the working language of the ship’s personnel and, for ships engaged in voyages to ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of other Parties to the Convention, shall also be in English, French or Spanish. (2) Every ship of 400 tons gross tonnage and above, and every ship which is certified to carry 15 persons or more, shall carry a Garbage Management Plan which the crew shall follow. This plan shall provide written procedures for collecting, storing, processing and disposing of ship-generated garbage, including the use of the equipment on board. It shall also designate the person in charge of carrying out the plan. Such a plan shall be in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization and written in the working language of the crew.” Every ship of 400 tons gross tonnage and above and every ship which is certified to carry 15 persons or more engaged in voyages to ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of other Parties to the Convention and every fixed and floating platform engaged in exploration and exploitation of the seabed shall be provided with a Garbage Record Book. The Garbage Record Book, whether as a part of the ship’s official log-book or otherwise, shall be in the form specified in the appendix to this Annex: • Each discharge operation, or completed incineration, shall be recorded in the Garbage Record Book and signed for on the date of the incineration or discharge by the officer in charge. Each completed page of the Garbage Record Book shall be signed by the master of the ship. The entries in the Garbage Record Book shall be at least in English, French or Spanish. Where the entries are also made in an official language of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly are also used, these entries shall prevail in case of a dispute or discrepancy. The entry for each incineration or discharge shall include date and time, position of the ship, description of the garbage and the estimated amount incinerated or discharged;

•
The Garbage Record Book shall be kept on board the ship and in such a place as to be available for inspection in a reasonable time. This document shall be preserved for a period of two years after the last entry is made on the record; In the event of discharge, escape or accidental loss referred to in regulation 6 of this Annex an entry shall be made in the Garbage Record Book of the circumstances of, and the reasons for, the loss.
•
(4)
The Administration may waive the requirements for Garbage Record Books for: • • Any ship engaged on voyages of 1 hour or less in duration which is certified to carry 15 persons or more; or Fixed or floating platforms while engaged in exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed.
(5)
The competent authority of the Government of a Party to the Convention may inspect the Garbage Record Book on board any ship to which this regulation applies while the ship is in its ports or offshore terminals and may make a copy of any entry in that book, and may require the master of the ship to certify that the copy is a true copy of such an entry. Any copy so made, which has been certified by the master of the ship as a true copy of an entry in the ship’s Garbage Record Book, shall be admissible in any judicial proceedings as evidence of the facts stated in the entry. The inspection of a Garbage Record Book and the taking of a certified copy by the competent authority under this paragraph shall be performed as expeditiously as possible without causing the ship to be unduly delayed.
COMPLIANCE DATES On 14 September 1995, IMO adopted, by resolution MEPC.65(37), amendments to the annex of the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973. Regulation 9 to Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 entered into force effective 1 July 1997 for new ships and 1 July 1998 for ships built before 1 July 1997. A ship’s garbage management plan should contain a list of the particular ship’s equipment and arrangements for the handling of ship-generated garbage, and may contain extracts from and/or references to existing company instructions.

PROVISIONING PRACTICES Although discharge at sea, (except in special areas) of a wide range of shipgenerated garbage is permitted outside specified distances from the nearest land, it is recommended that whenever practicable ships use, as a primary means, port reception facilities. To minimize the generation of waste, provisioning practices should be reviewed with ship’s suppliers in order to determine the optimum packaging for the products. Options include: • • • • Reusable packaging and use of containers. Disposable cups, utensils, dishes, towels and rags and other convenience items should be limited and replaced by washable items when possible. Where practical options exist, provisions packaged in or made of materials other than disposable plastic should be selected to replenish ship’s supplies unless a reusable plastic alternative is available. Stowage systems and methods that reuse coverings, dunnage, shoring, lining and packing materials. Dunnage, lining and packaging materials generated in port during cargo discharge should preferably be disposed of at the port reception facilities and not retained onboard for discharge at sea.

DESIGNATED PERSON IN CHARGE (Environmental Control Officer) As required in Regulation 9 (2), a designated person onboard shall be in charge of carrying out the Garbage Management plan. Such a decision by a Company will be determined by the ship type and trade. For ships other than passenger ships, a senior deck or engineer officer would be most appropriate. For passenger ships, more than one head of a department may be selected but with a coordinated effort to ensure compliance. The onboard responsibility for carrying out the garbage management plan is: • (COMPANY TO IDENTIFY DESIGNATED CREW MEMBER)
Support to the designated person can be provided by departmental staff. Such support is necessary in the collection, separation and processing of garbage to ensure that the onboard procedures are carried out in accordance with the garbage management plan. Support staff representatives from deck, engine, catering or other job responsibilities are: • (COMPANY TO IDENTIFY DESIGNATED SUPPORT STAFF)
From a regulatory perspective, the designated person in charge shall ensure that the procedures within the plan are implemented, which includes: • • Display placards in the appropriate language are positioned to notify the crew and passengers of the disposal requirements prescribed in regulations 3 and 5 of Annex V for garbage disposal within and outside special areas. The prescribed entries for each discharge operation or completed incineration are made in the Garbage Record Book.

DEFINITIONS In developing a Garbage Management Plan, it is important to recognize the following definitions: Food wastes are any spoiled or unspoiled victual substances, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, poultry, meat products, food scraps, food particles, and all other materials contaminated by such wastes, generated onboard ship, principally in the galley and dining areas. Plastic means a solid material which contains as an essential ingredient one or more synthetic organic high polymers and which is formed (shaped) during either manufacture of the polymer or the fabrication into a finished product by heat and/or pressure. Plastics have material properties ranging from hard and brittle to soft and elastic. Plastics are used for a variety of marine purposes including, but not limited to, packaging (vapor-proof barriers, bottles, containers, liners), ship construction (fiberglass and laminated structures, siding, piping, insulation, flooring, carpets, fabrics, paints and finishes, adhesives, electrical and electronic components), disposable eating utensils and cups, bags, sheeting, floats, fishing nets, strapping bands, rope and line. Domestic waste means all types of food wastes and wastes generated in the living spaces on board the ship. Cargo-associated waste means all materials which have become wastes as a result of use onboard a ship for cargo stowage and handling. Cargo-associated waste includes but is not limited to dunnage, shoring, pallets, lining and packing materials, plywood, paper, cardboard, wire, and steel strapping. Maintenance waste means materials collected in the engine department and the deck department while maintaining and operating the vessel, such as soot, machinery deposits, scraped paint, deck sweeping, wiping wastes, and rags, etc. Operational wastes means all cargo-associated waste and maintenance waste, and cargo residues defined as garbage under cargo residues. Oily rags are rags which have been saturated with oil as controlled in Annex I to the Convention. Contaminated rags are rags which have been saturated with a substance defined as a harmful substance in the other annexes to the Convention. Cargo residues for the purposes of these guidelines are defined as the remnants of any cargo material on board that cannot be placed in proper cargo holds (loading excess and spillage) or which remain in cargo holds and elsewhere after unloading procedures are completed (unloading residual and spillage). However, cargo residues are expected to be in small quantities.

GENERAL INFORMATION The most appropriate procedures for handling and storing garbage will vary depending on factors such as the type and size of the ship, the area of operation (e.g. distance from land), shipboard garbage processing equipment and storage space, crew size, duration of voyage, and regulations and reception facilities at ports of call. However, in view of the cost involved with the different ultimate disposal techniques, it may also be economically advantageous to keep garbage requiring special handling (e.g. hazardous wastes) separate from other garbage. Given the importance of waste management plans, crew responsibilities and procedures for all aspects of handling and storing garbage should be identified in the appropriate crew and vessel operating manuals. Procedures for handling shipgenerated garbage can be divided into four phases: collection, processing, storage and disposal. COLLECTION Procedures for collecting garbage should be based on consideration of what can and cannot be discarded overboard while en route. Three categories of distinctively marked garbage receptacles could be provided to sort garbage as it is generated. These separate receptacles (e.g. cans, bags or bins) would receive: • • • plastics and plastics mixed with non-plastic garbage; food wastes (which include materials contaminated by such wastes); and other garbage which can be disposed of at sea.
Receptacles for each category should be clearly marked and distinguished by color, graphics, shape, size or location. These receptacles should be provided in appropriate spaces throughout the ship. Crew members and passengers should be advised of what garbage should or should not be discarded in them. Crew responsibilities should be assigned for collection or emptying of these receptacles and taking the garbage to the appropriate processing or storage location. Plastics and Plastics Mixed with Non-Plastic Garbage Plastic garbage must be retained onboard for discharge at port reception facilities unless reduced to ash by incineration. When plastic garbage is not separated from other garbage, the mixture must be treated as if it were all plastic.

Food Wastes Some governments have regulations for controlling diseases that may be carried by foreign food wastes and materials that have been associated with them (e.g. food packaging and disposable eating utensils). These regulations may require incinerating, sterilizing or other special treatment and therefore these materials should be kept separate from other garbage and disposed of in accordance with the laws of the receiving country. Precautions must be taken to ensure that plastics contaminated by food wastes (e.g. plastic food wrappers) are not discharged at sea with other food wastes. Other Garbage Garbage in this category includes, but is not limited to, paper products, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, dunnage, lining and packing materials. It is desirable to separate dunnage, lining and packing material which will float since this material is subject to a different discharge limit than other garbage in this category. Such garbage should be kept separate from other garbage and preferably retained for disposal in port. Separate cans or bags could be provided for receiving and storing glass, metal, plastics, paper or other items which can be recycled. Oily rags and contaminated rags must be kept onboard and discharged to a port reception facility or incinerated. Company instructions and procedures should provided to shipboard personnel with the collection and separation requirements which are most appropriate for the vessel type and trade.

PROCESSING Depending on factors such as the type of ship, area of operation, and size of crew, ships may be equipped with incinerators, compactors, comminuters or other devices for shipboard garbage processing. Appropriate members of the crew should be assigned for operating this equipment on a schedule commensurate with ship needs. Use of such processing equipment makes it possible to discharge certain garbage at sea which otherwise would not be permitted, reducing shipboard space for storing garbage, making it easier to off-load garbage in ports, and enhancing assimilation of garbage discharged into the marine environment. Compactors Compactors make garbage easier to store, to transfer to port reception facilities and to dispose of at sea when discharge limitations permit. Comminuters Ships operating primarily beyond 3 nautical miles from the nearest land are encouraged to install and use comminuters to grind food wastes to a particle size capable of passing through a screen with openings no larger than 25 millimeters. Such a process is recommended even beyond 12 nautical miles because the particle size hastens assimilation into the marine environment. Incinerators Marine incinerators are predominantly designed for intermittent operation, hand fired and fed by hand. The ash or vapor may be hazardous. Attention is drawn to the separate, but related requirements, of MARPOL Annex VI which entered into force on 19 May 2005 and requires that all shipboard incinerators installed on or after 01 January 2000 on ships that are flying the flag of MARPOL Annex VI signatory State to be approved by the Administration based on the requirements contained in IMO Resolution MEPC 76(40) on Standard Specification for Shipboard Incinerators. Such incinerators must also be operated within the limits laid down in Appendix IV of MARPOL Annex VI. Annex VI prohibits the incineration of MARPOL Annex I, II & III cargo residues, related contaminated packing materials, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), garbage contaminated with more than traces of heavy metals and refined petroleum products containing halogen compounds. The incineration of sewage sludge and sludge oil, generated during the normal operation of the ship, is allowed in main or auxiliary power plant or boilers under Annex VI, but incineration by such methods is banned in ports, harbours and estuaries. Incinerators installed prior to 01 January 2000 on board ships flying the flag of MARPOL Annex VI signatory State may still be used after entry into force of MARPOL Annex VI. Incinerators installed on board ships after 01 January 2000, which may have already been approved by the Administration to resolutions MEPC.59(33) or MEPC.76(40) specifications, may still be used after entry into force

of MARPOL Annex VI. Incinerators installed on vessels solely engaged in domestic trade may be exempted from the 01 January 2000 deadline but only up to entry into force of the Annex. NOTE: IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE RESIDUE FROM PLASTIC INCINERATION IS STILL CONSIDERED PLASTIC AND THUS CAN NOT BE DISCHARGED OVERBOARD. Due to the potential environmental and health effects from combustion of byproducts e.g. scraped paint, impregnated wood and PVC-based plastics, special precaution is required. Special rules on incineration may be established by authorities in some ports and may exist in some special areas. Prior to using an incinerator while in port, permission may be required from the port authority concerned. In general, the use of shipboard garbage incinerators in ports in or near urban areas is discouraged as their use will add to possible air pollution in these areas. STORAGE Garbage collected from various areas throughout the ship should be delivered to designated processing or storage locations. Garbage that must be returned to port for disposal may require long-term storage depending on the length of the voyage or availability of port reception facilities. Garbage should be stored in a manner which avoids health and safety hazards. Separate cans, drums, boxes, bags or other containers should be used for shortterm (disposable garbage) and throughout the voyage (non-disposable garbage) storage. All processed and unprocessed garbage which must be stored for any length of time should be in tight, securely covered containers. Food wastes and associated garbage which are returned to port and which may carry disease or pests should be kept separate from garbage which does not contain such food wastes. Both types of garbage should be in separate, clearly marked containers to avoid incorrect disposal and treatment on land.

DISPOSAL Although disposal is possible consistent with Annex V, discharge of garbage to port reception facilities should be given first priority. When disposing of garbage, the following points should be considered: • Disposal of uncompacted garbage is convenient but results in a maximum number of floating objects which may reach shore even when discharged beyond 25 miles from the nearest land. If necessary and possible, weights should be added to promote sinking. Compacted bales of garbage should be discharged in water depths of 50 meters or more to prevent breaking up from wave action and currents. Maintenance wastes contaminated with substances, such as oil or toxic chemicals, are in some cases controlled under other annexes or other pollution control laws. In such cases, the more stringent disposal requirements take precedence. To ensure timely transfer of ship-generated garbage to port reception facilities, ship agents are to be advised for guidance. Disposal needs should be identified particularly when arrangements are necessary for garbage requiring special handling.
•
•
TRAINING Training should be provided for all crew members who are involved in operating the garbage processing equipment, and handling and disposing of garbage as part of their operational responsibilities. Such a program should be reviewed annually and should define what constitutes garbage and the applicable regulations for handling and disposal. Material for training could include posters, brochures, photographs and video tapes. RECOMMENDATION FOR GOVERNMENTS Governments are recommended to require all ships of their registry to permanently post a summary declaration stating that the prohibition and restrictions for discharging garbage from ships under Annex V and the penalties for failure to comply. It is suggested this declaration be placed on a placard at least 12.5cm by 20cm, made of durable material and fixed in a conspicuous place in galley spaces, the mess deck, bridge, main deck and other areas of the ship as, appropriate. The placard should be printed in the language or languages understood by the crew and passengers.
