Repairing a Garbage Compactor
Filed under: Garbage Compactor - 31 Jan 2011  | Spread the word !
Before you attempt to start repairing a garbage compactor, it’s a good idea to become familiar with common problems that can occur with the device. These problems include a burned out motor, switches that fail, worn out sprockets, roller bearings, power nuts and chains. What’s more, debris often gets stuck inside and restricts movement. If your trash compactor does not come on immediately, check the power at the electrical receptacle and then test the power cord.
Look to see if the drawer is completely closed and search for any loose terminal wires that need to be reconnected when repairing a garbage compactor. Perform a quick maintenance check on drawer safety as well as on and off switches. If your motor is running but not moving, look to see if there is a damaged chain or faulty drive gear. Listen closely for unusual noises and pull out your owner’s manual to see exactly how to lubricate the parts if necessary.
Check for debris if your trash compactor does not start completely. There could be debris hiding in the power screw threads or nuts. When repairing a garbage compactor, you may have to order replacement parts from the manufacture or other suppliers. You will need just a few simple tools to begin working on your trash compactor. The tools you might want to have on hand include screwdrivers, wenches, a nut driver and a multimeter. Be sure to unplug the electrical cord or turn off the circuit breaker when attempting any repairs to avoid possible injury.

Mass Effect 2 Garbage Compactor
Filed under: Garbage Compactor - 28 Jun 2010  | Spread the word !
The Mass Effect 2 video game is very detailed down to a large list of objects that add realism to the game and increase the curiosities of the people who also play the game.  There is a section of the ship in which there is a real working trash compactor.  The trash compactor allows your character to put something inside and compact it with the push of a button.  This is comical in some instances as you can place objects in there that shouldn’t really be compacted and eject them out into space.
There are many reasons why the trash compactor is there.  In fact there is an easter egg (video game secret) which can be accessed by using the trash compactor a number of times with other characters present.  The other thing that happens is that there is an achievement that is possible by using the trash compactor which helps to more complete the game.  The process involves using the compactor several times to get the achievement.  There is no real reason to using the trash compactor, but it does have a use as an atypical weapon for a period of the game.
The trash compactor is as useful as the personal toilet in your character’s room, or the need for bathrooms on the game with different gender assignments.  The shower rooms in the game also exist but really do nothing as there are never any people using them.  The whole point is to have a large amount of realism to the game which makes it more real than a poorly made game which hardly has anything other than simple game play to look forward to.

Garbage Compactor
Filed under: Garbage Compactor - 14 Jul 2009  | Spread the word !
The work of a garbage compactor is to flatten all the garbage in a container as to give convenience in terms of space optimization. The garbage compactors are not meant to clean, purify or sanitize any household or industrial garbage.
There are more than ten types of compactors, including: Commercial Trash Compactors, Indoor Trash Compactors, Outdoor Trash Compactors, High Rise Compactors, Automatic Compacting Receptacles, Bin Compactors, Self-Contained Compactors, Compacting Dumpsters, Stationary Compactors, Pre-Crushers and Specialty Compactors.
It is essential to inspect your garbage compactor on a regular basis to increase its longevity and ensure it’s in workable condition. Further, to maintain sanitation both at your home and at factories, you need to clean it regularly. Dirty garbage compactors have the potential to spread infectious diseases.
When you fail to clean a garbage compactor, it will start to smell. To get rid of the stink in the machine, start cleaning at once. Make sure to wear some protective accessories like a pair of gloves and a face mask. As you start cleaning the interior and exterior, you can spray polish cleaner and wipe the garbage compactor with a cloth to make it look new.
Alternatively, you can just blend your liquid detergent with plain water to clean the garbage compactor. The other option is sprinkling baking soda inside at the time of disposing of the garbage. This will ensure that your compactor is sanitary and also never allows it to develop a foul smell.
Moreover, for high industrial waste, enlist the help of professional cleaners. You should also seek professional assistance if your garbage compactor suffers a breakdown (which can be caused by things such as a breakdown in a fuse, overuse or the tripping of a circuit breaker). By taking care of the problem immediately, you can ensure that your garbage compactor doesn’t suffer from long-term damage.

My Garbage Compactor Saves Me So Much Space
Filed under: Garbage Compactor - 05 May 2009  | Spread the word !
I have always tried to be conscious of how much garbage me and my family produce.  I am well aware of the impact that trash has on the environment (even when it is disposed of properly, that doesn’t meant that it isn’t having an impact; however, obviously the impact that litter has is much worse than that of properly disposed trash), and as a result I have always tried to do my part to cut back as much as possible.  Obviously, I am aware of the fact that I am just one person and we are just one family, but that doesn’t mean that what we do isn’t important.  I may only play a tiny role in the overall big scheme of things, but the thing is that if everyone on the planet would play their tiny role, the combined impact would be huge.  Unfortunately, there are countless people who simply don’t care regardless of what you tell them or how easy the changes are, so the only choice we have is to worry about ourselves.
Now, even though I try to reduce the amount of trash that we create as much as possible, it’s obviously impossible to completely stop producing trash.  Obviously, there are ways to accomplish this goal under extreme circumstances, but we are a modern and busy family, so we can’t completely sacrifice our lifestyle for this type of goal.  Luckily, we have a garbage compactor, which helps us minimize the amount of space that the trash we do produce takes up.
