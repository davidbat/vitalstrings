Features and Benefits of Mark-Costello's           Medical Waste Sterilizer:
 
  
NO PRE-TREATMENT HANDLING RISKS. The           Mark-Costello Co. System utilizes           autoclavable carts that can eliminate           employee handling of untreated waste from           point of generation to final disposal.
  
CAPITAL COST. The Mark-Costello Co.           Sterilizer is by far the least expensive           medical waste treatment system available.
  
STERILIZERS AVAILABLE FOR ANY SIZE           FACILITY. Units are capable of treating           100 to 1,125 lbs. or more per cycle.
  
MAINTENANCE. Average cost to maintain           our stand-alone gravity type sterilizer is           less than $60.00 per month.
  
LONGEVITY. The Mark-Costello Co. has           been manufacturing medical waste steam           sterilizers since 1973. There are           Mark-Costello Co. Sterilizers still in           operation after 20 years of service.
  
LEAST COMPLICATED TO OPERATE. Some           companies actually require the hospital to           send engineers to the factory for training.           The Mark-Costello Co. Sterilizers require           nothing more than a brief in-service           training period at the site following           installation.
  
SIMPLE TO INSTALL. The Mark-Costello           Co. Sterilizers are usually installed by           hospital personnel, or local equipment           contractors.
  
EQUIPMENT DESIGN UNCHANGED. There is           no need to be concerned that the system will           soon be out of date, making it difficult to           obtain parts and repairs.
  
UTILITY CONSUMPTION. Most           Mark-Costello Co. Sterilizers use existing           low cost readily available hospital steam           supply. Only single-phase electricity is           necessary.
  
STEAM STERILIZATION VS DISINFECTION. Because of the National and World focus on           the spread of infectious disease, the           eradication of all microbial life in the           waste stream is imperative. The           Sterilization process is the best assurance           the hospital can have for proper spore kill.
