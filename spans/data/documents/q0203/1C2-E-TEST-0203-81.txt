How to Process Garbage
• Garbage must be placed in a container 40 gallon capacity or less,with a weather proof / animal proof lid and handles on both sides or heavy mil plastic bags. No container or bag to exceed 50 pounds. Collection begins at 6:30 am.
• Bulky items are to be picked up with garbage collection (sofas, chairs, mattresses, etc.) Pressurized or treated lumber is trash and should be set out on your household garbage collection day.
• Appliances: It is necessary to call Veolia Environmental Services and arrange for a special pick up to have the appliance removed. Place these items at the curb away from mailboxes, trees, and/or power lines since these collections are performed with a claw truck that needs the ability to lift and swing.
• Electronics: Items such as computers, monitors, TV’s, stereo equipment, phones, microwave ovens, fax machines and printers may be placed at the curb on the day of the regular household
garbage collection. The electronic item(s) will be tagged and picked up within 24 hours.
• Construction and Demolition Debris: Debris resulting from minor home maintenance and repair will be collected at the curb. The limit per collection/per dwelling unit is 2 cubic yards provided the improvement or repair did not require a permit.
• Unacceptable Items: Automotive vehicles, boats, major vehicle components, land clearing debris, hazardous waste and liquids, bio or medical waste and car batteries.
