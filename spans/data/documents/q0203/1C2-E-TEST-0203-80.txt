Cleaning Process
Our truck-mounted Eliminator™ cleaning unit comes to you!
Designed in Europe and built in the USA, our Eliminator™ mobile cleaning unit is a combination of full size truck and highly effective ultra high-pressure Trash can cleaning system.
ClassyTrashcans LLC will visit soon after your trashcan has been emptied by your regular trash collection service.
 
Your trashcans are loaded into our Eliminator™ cleaning unit to be:
Thoroughly washed internally at extremely high pressure
Disinfected with biodegradable antibacterial detergents
Deodorized and scented
If there is any trash remaining in your trashcan after trash collection has been made, we will bag any remaining trash and place it back into your trash can after our cleaning process has completed.
By continuing to use our service on a regular basis (at least once a month), your trashcan will maintain a respectable level of hygiene.
Our cleaning service are far more effective than that of  manual cleaning your own trashcan with a hose and broom!
 
I will recommend you to all my friends.
You are everything you promised. Continue the good work that you deliver.
