Trash compactors are ahead of their time.  This year was actually the 31st anniversary of the invention of the trash compactor.  It was ahead of its time as it was an environmental novel.  The idea of the trash compactor is that comparatively 5 bags of trash can be compacted down to one in the trash compactor and it is only being used in 3% of American homes.  That's the very low number.
So 3% of American homes actually have a trash compactor and know the value of it.  There is a mechanism that is basically to crush down to garbage.  So, literally as you turn the knob and close the unit, it will crush the trash all the way down.  The more trash you put in there and then when you turn the knob the more it presses down.  So it's pretty much a giant mechanical foot that is pushing down and compressing everything that is in it.  The mistake that some people have a tendency to make is to put hard things like jars in there or cans.  Those things should not be put in there.  Those are recycling items and those were not actually meant to go in the mechanism.   You need to reduce the garbage with your standard trash and not recyclables.
Another feature on trash compactor that is standard for years now and is very helpful is an air filter, because obviously trash smells.  There was an air filter that you can turn on turn it off whenever you want to.  It acts as a filter to purify the air in within the cavity of the trash compactor.
