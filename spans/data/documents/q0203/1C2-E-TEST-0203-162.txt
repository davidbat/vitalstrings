If you've  wondered what happens to all the stuff you wash down the drain or flush down  the toilet, you'll find the answers here.

Then on tothe Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant,  where 25 million gallons per day of sewage are treated through screens, filters  and clarifiers which clean and separate liquids from solids. The tour moves  over to the Honouliuli Water  Reclamation Facility, where the Board of Water Supply further  processes the waste "water" portion into clean water, used for  irrigation. At the Sand Island  Wastewater Treatment Plant you'll be taken into the central  control room where the entire island's wastewater treatment operations are  monitored using a high-tech, computerized SCADA system. Then over to the Synagro Hawaii operations, where the  sewage sludge is processed into fertilizer pellets.

Take a close look at the environmental protections employed by  today's modern landfill at the Waimanalo  Gulch Sanitary Landfill operated by Waste Management, including complex  liner and leachate catchment systems and methane recovery.

Virtual                     Tour
Would you like to take a virtual                     Tour de Trash ? Not quite                     the same as being there, but may help you decide if you would                     like to sign up for one or more of the tours.
The recycling and waste processing sites are most popular.                       People get to see the inner workings of the H-POWER waste-to-energy                       facility -- look into the furnace; peek into the RDF (refuse-derived                       fuel) room; see how metals are extracted from the mixed                       waste for recycling. They walk through a canyon of recycled                       paper bales at Island Recycling. They talk with the recycling                       facility managers, hear about their challenges, ask questions.                       They walk the sort line at Honolulu Recovery Systems, where                       the materials collected in their neighborhood recycling                       bins are sorted by commodity.
Just like tourists, they pose for pictures in front of                       the mountains of metal at Schnitzer Steel Hawaii and get                       free samples of compost at Hawaiian Earth Products.
A host of businesses take the tour groups back-of-the-house                       to show how they’ve instituted successful recycling                       programs – the Hard Rock Café, Hilton Hawaiian Village,                       Hawaii Convention Center are among the leaders. The Sheraton Waikiki                       shows off its mini MRF. Young Laundry demonstrates how                       it put a biodiesel fuel to work.
The facilities and businesses are proud to have this opportunity                       to showcase their operations to a local group of interested                       citizens. They know as well as the City, that educating                       our public about the challenges we face in waste management                       today will provide strong public support for the next directions.
