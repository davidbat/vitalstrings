Our Simple Junk Removal Process
Give us a call at 1-800-468-5865 or book your junk removal appointment online . Our friendly, uniformed truck team will call you 15-30 minutes before your scheduled 2 hour arrival window. When we arrive, just point to the junk you want removed and we will provide you with an upfront, all-inclusive price. Once you say the word, we’ll haul everything away from wherever the items are located and finish by cleaning up the area. Plus, we recycle and donate your junk whenever possible. Since 1989, we’ve saved over 1.5 billion pounds of junk from the landfill and counting.
