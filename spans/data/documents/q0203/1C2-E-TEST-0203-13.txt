America’s waste industry successfully manages               243 million tons of household and other               municipal solid waste annually (U.S. EPA,               “Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling and Disposal in the United States: Facts and               Figures for 2009” [EPA Facts and Figures]).
The average  American discards 4.34 pounds of garbage every day (EPA Facts and Figures).
However, when construction and demolition waste               and non-hazardous industrial waste is included,               the industry manages nearly 545 million tons of               solid waste each year (“Size of the United States               Solid Waste Industry,” R.W. Beck, Inc. 2001).
The total  volume of solid waste produced in the U.S. each year is equal to the  weight of more than 5,600 Nimitz Class air craft carriers, 247,000 space  shuttles, or 2.3 million Boeing 747 jumbo jets (Beck).
If we put all of the solid waste collected in the U.S.  in a line of average garbage trucks, that line of trucks could cross the  country, extending from New York City to Los Angeles, more than 100 times  (Beck).
