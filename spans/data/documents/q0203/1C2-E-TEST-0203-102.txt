Hi Dave,
I thought this was fascinating. And I've been wondering for a long time, actually, how they do the recycling stuff when it's all mixed. (I was afraid that they really just junked it all.)
I just wanted to let you know that the video segments don't play automatically on YouTube, but they do on the RecycleBank website.
