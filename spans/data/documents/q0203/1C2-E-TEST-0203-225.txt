UTILIZING GARBAGE TO PRODUCE ETHANOL AND METHANE 509VOL. 108, 2009process. Following these studies an energy balance was performed to
clarify how much of the energy stored in the garbage was transferred
to the target products ethanol and methane, using garbage from
canteens as the model system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains The flocculating yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae KF-7 was used for SSF
tests. This yeast was constructed by protoplast fusion of the flocculating yeast strain IR-2
(5) and the thermotolerant yeast strain EP-1 (4).
Lactic acid bacteria strain 4, which is closely related to Lactobacillus paracasei (98%
rRNA gene sequence similarity), was isolated from a vegetable beverage and used for
the preservation of garbage.
Garbage Three kinds of garbage were used in this study. The garbage was
collected from the canteen of Kumamoto University (hereinafter called canteen
garbage), from the families around Shin-machi and Onoue-machi of Kumamoto City
(hereinafter called family garbage), and from the concessionaire of Zyonan Junior High
School of Kumamoto City (hereinafter called concessionaire garbage). The garbage was
stored in plastic baskets at room temperature and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultivation
broth was evenly sprayed on the surface of the garbage once a day when necessary. A
water-weight was placed over the garbage to generate anaerobic conditions within the
garbage. The family and canteen garbagewere then stored for about 1week under these
conditions following which this garbage as well as the concessionaire garbage were
stored at 4 °C. The garbage was crushed by a bone chopper (Masuko Sangyo, Saitama,
Japan) and used for all experiments. Representative characteristics of the garbage are
shown in Table 1.
Recovery of glucose by enzymatic treatment One hundred gram of crushed
garbage was added to a 500-ml conical flask containing 50 ml water and subsequently
enzymatic saccharification, or enzymatic liquefaction followed by saccharification, was
carried out. Enzymatic saccharification was carried out at 60 °C and at a shaking speed
of 150 rpm for 2 h by the addition of 40 mg glucoamylase XL-4 (glucoamylase activity,
7024 U/ml; Nagase Chemtex Corporation, Osaka, Japan) and 78 μl cellulase SS (cellulase
activity, 127.4 IU/ml; Nagase Chemtex) to the conical flask. XL-4, is a crude version of
the N-40 enzyme that was used in the previous paper (1), and was used in this study as
a cheaper, commercialized enzyme. Enzymatic liquefactionwas carried out at 85 °C and
at a shaking speed of 150 rpm for 30 min by the addition of 12 mg α-amylase termamyl
(amylase activity, 53,428 U/mg; Novozyme Corporation, Denmark) to the conical flask.
Enzymatic liquefaction and saccharification Kneader, with aworking volume
of 30 kg, was constructed for enzymatic liquefaction or for enzymatic liquefaction
followed by saccharification by the Yoshino manufacturing company (Kumamoto,
Japan). Crushed garbage (15 kg) and termamyl (1.8 g) were added to the kneader and
enzymatic liquefaction was carried out by mixing at 85 °C for 30 min. For enzymatic
saccharification after enzymatic liquefaction, 6.0 g glucoamylase XL-4 and 11.7 ml
cellulase SS were further added and the mixture was then incubated at 50 °C for 2 h.
Preparation of the inoculum Yeast cells grown on 2% YPD slant (2% glucose,1%
yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% agar) were inoculated into 100 ml of 5% YPD medium (5%
glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) in a 500-ml flask. A pre-cultivation was
performed aerobically at 30 °C for 16 h with mixing at 160 rpm using a rotary shaker.
The resultant pre-cultivation broth was used as the inoculum for SSF experiments.TABLE 2. Composition of stillage used for dry methane fermentation.

pH (−) 4.3garbage and 450 ml pre-cultivation broth were added to the fermentor (B. E. Marubishi
Co., Tokyo, Japan) and SSF was carried out at 30 °C and at 100 rpm for 24 h with an air-
supply of 0.1 vvm. For SSF of the liquefied garbage, 1.2 ml glucoamylase XL-4 and
2.34 ml cellulase SS were added together in the fermentor and SSF was then carried out
under the same conditions. Ethanol concentration was measured when the fermenta-
tion was finished. The ethanol yield and ethanol productivity were calculated from the
following equation:
Ethanol yield kð Þ= P= S  92=180ð Þf g  100
Productivity g=l=hð Þ= P=t
where, P=final ethanol concentration (g/l), S=initial total sugar concentration
{(starch+holocellulose)×180/162} (g/l), t=fermentation time (h).
Repeated simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (repeated-SSF)
Following completion of SSF, part of the fermented mash was withdrawn and the
residue mash was used as yeast inoculums for the next SSF. The fresh enzymatic
liquefied garbage with the same amount of the fermented mash withdrawnwas added
to the fermentor, then glucoamylase and cellulase were added, and then the SSF process
was started again (hereafter called the repeated-SSF 1st) under the same fermentation
condition. After 2 h fermentation, SSF was stopped and then followed by the next SSF
for 2 h in the same manner till the SSF was repeated five times. After each SSF was
finished, the concentrations of ethanol, lactic acid and acetic acid in the fermented
mash were measured. The ethanol yield and ethanol productivity were calculated from
the following equation (6):
Ethanol yield kð Þ= Pf = Si  92=180ð Þ  100
Productivity g=l=hð Þ= Pf  Pi

where, Pi=initial ethanol concentration (g/l), Pf=final ethanol concentration (g/l),
Si=total sugar concentration of garbage ((starch+holocellulose)×180/162) (g/l),
and t=fermentation time (h).
Dry methane fermentation The sludge necessary for dry methane fermenta-
tion was provided by Kurita Company (Nogi town, Tochigi prefecture, Japan). One
hundred and sixty-five gram of synthetic waste (dog food, 15 g; copy paper, 15 g;
newspaper, 15 g; water, 120 g) was added to 3 kg sludge and mixed well. The waste was
then added to a 5 l reaction flask used as anaerobic digester (separable flask, SIBATA,
Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at 52 °C. Fresh synthetic waste was added once a week and
the sludge was acclimated for several months using two separable flasks. After
acclimation, the stillage was added in place of the synthetic waste to one of the
separable flasks and the treatment was repeated 14 times in the same manner. As a
control, synthetic waste was added instead of the stillage to another separable flask in
the same manner. The stillage was prepared by distilling the fermented mash under
vacuum conditions at 60 °C, using an evaporator (N-11, Eyela, Tokyo, Japan). Table 2
shows the composition of the stillage.
Analytical methods The total starch-based sugar concentration of the garbage
was assayed by the Somogyi-Nelson method after hydrolysis of a sample of the garbage
with 25% HCl (7). The starch concentration was equivalent to the total starch-based
sugar concentration×162/180 as cellulose powder was not hydrolyzed under this
condition. The concentration of glucose was analyzed by UV using an F-Kit-GlucoseTABLE 4. Results of the repeated-batch SSF in process B, using liquefied family garbage B.
