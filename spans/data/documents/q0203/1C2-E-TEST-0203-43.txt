Abstract:
The  paper summarizes an investigzation into methods for treating sugar cane  trash in preparation for combustion in a spreader stoker boiler  designed for bagasse and supplementary fuel oil. Due to the herbaceaous  nature of sugar cane trash, water leaching was proposed and investigated  as a means of reducing the slagging and fouling potential of the raw  fuel.
