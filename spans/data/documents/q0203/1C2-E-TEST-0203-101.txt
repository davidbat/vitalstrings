E-mail Bills
Save your time and money with e-mail billing:
Send e-mail bills to your customers, either individually or as part of your regular billing        process
All you need is TRASH FLOW and an Internet connection—no need        for your own website
Communication is handled through secure communication via the Internet
E-mail bills go through the TrashBilling.com e-mail system.  No overloading        your own e-mail or clogging your in-box
Payments and Notices
Funds are in your bank and available for use within 2 business days—no waiting a month or        two to find out you're not getting your money
Payments are automatically posted to the proper accounts in TRASH FLOW,        making the process both fast and accurate
Customers receive a confirmation e-mail when a draft or charge is made
You and your customers receive notification if the payment does not go through
Security
All e-mails come from our e-mail system (NetComm@TrashBilling.com)
We work with major e-mail handlers to keep this an accepted e-mail address, including        staying current with new e-mailing standards of identification
When customers sign up for e-mail billing, their e-mail address is tested to insure your        customer will receive the bills
E-mail addresses submitted to TrashBilling.com cannot be used for mass advertising
