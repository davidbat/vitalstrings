WEALTH FROM GARBAGE
1.                INTRODUCTION
Generally                a family of 4-5 people produces garbage of 1Kg. daily. This garbage                can be devided into two groups-wet garbage (organic which can be                decomposed)& -dry garbage (inorganic which can be recycled).
Wet garbage: Which                can be decomposed (organic, natural). E.g. kitchen garbage (stems                of vegetable, used tea powder, fruit peals, bones, egg cover, r                emaining food), hair, nails, dry leaves, coconut fibre, stale flowers                etc. biodegradable material.
Dry garbage: Which                can be recycled. E.g. plastic, paper, glass, metal, rubber, industrial                wrapping etc. This man made garbage should be sent to rag pickers                for recycling.
Wet garbage should be processed like natural cycle & when it                is decomposed, it should be used for gardening. In this process                CO2 & useful juices are produced. These are useful for plant                growth. If these are not used properly, air gets polluted. So this                process of decomposing of garbage should be done with the help of                BIOSANITIZER, which is spread around the tree, in a soil or in pots                where small plants are growing.
Biosanitiser is used as culture for demonstration for “WEALTH                FROM GARBAGE” project. Mosquitoes, bad odour, flies etc. are                not found with the process of decomposition when biosanitizer is                used as a culture. Vermicompost/ bioculture/ vermicasting/ live                earthworms these are all different processes.
2. PROCESS OF GARBAGE DECOMPOSITION
1sq.mt(11sq.ft)                place is necessary for wet garbage from a single family. This place                can be available on land around the trees, terrace, balcony or 7medium                size pots. Biosanitizer should be used in proper quantity.
• Process on land: Biosanitizer should be spread in a soil                which is loosened around the roots of a tree. . A layer of decomposing                garbage of about 2-3 inches should be placed on it. It should be                watered as usual. Then it should be watered daily accordingly to                the necessity of the plant. When the garbage layer blackens spread                next layer on it. There is no necessity of Biosanitizer again.
• Process on terrace or balcony: 1.5 to 2 feet in width & 6 inches in height brickwork on the border without construction                is necessary for this purpose. Spread a plastic sheet on a base & near the wall of about 6” tall in this brickwork. Spread                a layer of about 3”coconut fibre, dry leaves, sugercane waste & fibrous things like this. Spread a layer of 2”of any soil available near your house. There is no need of Poyata soil.                Useful juices from decomposing material are not blown away because                of this soil. These are stored in this soil. The plant according                to its need absorbs them. Then make a room for a new plant to be                planted in the soil, with your hands & then place a new plant                with its roots uninjured & little bit of soil around it. Spread                Biosanitiser in proper quantity. Spread a layer of garbage of about                2”to 3”. Sprinkle water on it. When previous layer of                garbage blackens, then only spread the next layer of garbage. This                layer should not be more than 1 inch. After this there is no need                of Biosanitizer again. This process can be done in pots also.
If soil is not available, use biomass like coconut coir, dry leaves,                sugercane waste which decompose slowly & naturally are which                are fibrous in nature.
As we have seen above, we can start gardening on terrace with only                layer of 2-3 inches of soil. 1 to 2 inch of layer of soil is formed                every year from what we feed garbage to the plants.
• Process in pots: If we already have pots in our garden,                which are filled with soil, then take away 2-3 inches of soil without                hurting the roots of a plant. Spread Biosanitizer in proper quantity                after loosening the soil near the roots. Spread a layer of about                1 to 2 inch decomposing garbage. Sprinkle water on it. After this                time there is no need of Biosanitizer again for this pot.
3. BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT
• To avoid pollution in the atmosphere
• We can grow our garden which avoiding harmful chemical materials.                To avoid polluted air in our house
• We get plenty of good quality vegetables, fruits, and flowers.
• Water is saved because of moisture in the garbage.
• We can avoid some garden works as changing the soil, loosening                the soil etc. There is no need to look after the soil.
• No need of other fertilizer.
• There is increase in the resistance power of plants.
• For all plants, there is same procedure to grow the plant.
4.                USEFUL HINTS & GENERAL SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEMS
• Do not store Biosanitizer in sun. Last longer, when kept                in shadow.
• If you cannot bear view of garbage in your garden, then                spread a layer of a fibrous organic material like coconut coir.                It covers the garbage & allows the air to circulate. When you                have to add more garbage, remove the layer of the fibrous material                for sometime & cover it again.
• Do not spread soil on the garbage.
• Do not dig in the soil or garbage after biosanitizer is                spread over it to find the earthworms. This disturbs the natural                process.
• If you have to go to some other place for about 4 days or                more days, then spread the wet pulp of paper around the plant, paper                is a organic material. So the process will go on.
• Most important is that do not add garbage daily to one plant                or place only. It is necessary to have at least seven pots for seven                days of a week.
• There should not be any bad smell. If the garbage on which                biosanitizer is spread does not stink, the plant looks fresh & healthy it indicates that the process is functioning properly.
5. SOME HOME REMIDIES
• If the garbage is stinking, there is something wrong in                your procedure, then decrease the height of a layer of the garbage,                plenty of water should be given to the plant.
• If red ants are found near the plant then do not add poisonous                chemicals like gamaxin powder but instead increase the quantity                of water. Sprinkle powder of turmeric.
• We may find insects on plants in cloudy weather or when                a climber/plant is in flowering state & the fruit bearing season                starts, during this period the plant is likely to lack energy. At                this point ants may come to eat these small insects, which are on                the plant. So do not add poisonous chemicals to the plant but instead                add garbage which is dipped in water for about 8 to 12 hrs, at the                steam of the plant.
