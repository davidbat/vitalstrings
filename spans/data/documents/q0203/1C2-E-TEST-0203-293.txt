Once a year thousands              of volunteers gather along the Texas waterways to do their part in cleaning              up the environment and participate in the largest statewide event to educate              the public about the importance of our water resources. Trash Bash occurs              rain or shine, unless there are severe weather conditions.

Registration
Each participant          must sign a registration form , also known          as the liability form, for the event. Registration is usually done at          the cleanup site the day of the event. For large groups we recommend you          complete the forms for each participant ahead of time and have them ready          to hand over to the site coordinator the day fo the event. This will save          you and the site coordinators time. Registration starts between 8:00 am          and 9:00 am. Times vary from cleanup location to cleanup location. Please          refer to the individual cleanup        sites for exact times.
Directions
Please see the individual cleanup site for more information. Detailed directions, parking information, and important        instructions will be posted by each site closer to the event.
