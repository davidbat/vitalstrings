New Material Recovery Facilty (MRF) Solid Waste Services offers curbside recycling. Once the recycling material is collected it is then transferred to a Material Recovery Facility.  This facility then separates out each recycling material by category.  It is very important to only place recycling material within the recycling (blue) container for many reasons.  Enjoy the videos below to further understand the recycling process and why only recycling material is placed in the blue container. If you have further questions about what goes into a recycling container click here.
