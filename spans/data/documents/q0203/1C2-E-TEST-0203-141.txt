Why let all that Horsepower go to waste?

My garbage disposal in the kitchen sink sports an amazing 1hp electric motor. For this kind of latent power, I want it to do more than grind up potato peels. Why own a separate food processor that only clutters up the kitchen with odd-shaped attachments? I propose mounting an optional food hopper next to the sink drain that would rotate in under the disposal at the push of a button. Then, when you want to chop, shred, slice, whatever, you turn on the disposal switch and stuff the food down the sink drain where it is processed by the disposal and flies into the hopper. It might even have a self-cleaning cycle where  scalding hot water and disinfectent is cycled through before putting in food. No more washing intricate food processor parts, no more cleaning up the counter after a messy shredding job. Imagine making frozen margharitas by pouring tequila, triple-sec, a whole lime and ice down the drain.

This idea could have gone so well.  Just add attachments that stick out of the sink.  Do that and I'll bake you something nice.
