Trash and Recycling Collection During Inclement   Weather
In the event that inclement weather makes accessing   streets dangerous for collection   staff, trash and recycling collection will be postponed until it   can be safely resumed.  Public Works trash and   recycling customers should leave their carts out at the curb or in   the alley until the carts are emptied. Collection staff will make every effort to resume   normal service as soon as weather and road conditions permit.  Customers with   backdoor service may experience longer delays.  Backdoor customers can assist   Public Works collection crews by taking their carts to the curb or alley for   collection during times of inclement weather.  Back door collection will resume once Public Works   determines that streets and driveways are safely accessible for collection   staff.
