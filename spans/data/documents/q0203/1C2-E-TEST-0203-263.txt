Processing Facility: OPEN TO ALL -commercial        haulers, remodelers and the public. Recycle Depot accepts all construction and demolition debris. Ideal        for residential remodeling jobs, small contractor        services and your basement and garage cleanouts
We are the only permitted facility of this type in this area. What differs from our type of facility is        that we
process/sort and reduce the waste from the        typical waste stream unlike your typical transfer        station which merely redirects debris to the landfill.        From the recycled product, we are able to produce        reusable materials such as landscaping mulch , topsoil, clean fill, as well as send other recycled material to        companies to reuse, such as cardboard and metal. At our        facility, we service other haulers in the area,        contractors, and homeowners, but because we service our        own roll off containers ,        our prices are extremely competitive. .
