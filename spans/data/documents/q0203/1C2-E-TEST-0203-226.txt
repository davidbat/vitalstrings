How to Make Garbage Enzyme
 
 
Black            sugar is needed for            making garbage enzyme. Brown or any raw           unprocessed sugar can also be used but never           use white sugar.
 
Kitchen waste is another ingredient            used for the production of garbage enzyme.           Leftover cooked food from meals like           vegetables is usable too but rinse off any           gravy or sauces from them first before           using. Never use any kind of meat! Fruit           skins should be taken from fruits like           apple, orange, pineapple, pear, watermelon,           grape, lemon, guava but don't use durians!
An             example: Add 300g of sugar +             900g of fruit skins + 3000g of water and             mix well in a 5000cc plastic bottle and cap tightly. Keep in a             cool dry place at room temperature.             Release the gases formed once a day             for the first month. Make sure it is             re-capped tightly each time after             the gas release. For the 2nd and 3rd             months, only release any gases if             necessary. Sometimes, there is a             white layer on the surface of the             enzyme solution during fermentation.             Should worms appear in your enzyme             solution, don't panic. Add in a             handful of sugar, mix well and cap             the bottle tightly. They will             disappear overnight!
 
These bottles contain kitchen waste with sugar and water. Fermentation            will take place in            the bottles for 3 months. Then after            filtration and removal of the residue,            garbage enzyme is obtained. The residue can            be used again for a new batch of production            by adding fresh garbage. The residue can            also be dried, then blended and buried in            the ground as a fertilizer.
 
These bottles of            garbage enzyme are ready for dilution with           water to be used.
