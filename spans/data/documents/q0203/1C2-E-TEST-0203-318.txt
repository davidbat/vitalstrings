Garbage-- Solid Waste
Solid Waste
Every year, the United States generates approximately 230 million tons of "trash"--about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Less than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or buried in landfills. With a little forethought, we could reuse or recycle more than 70 percent of the landfilled waste, which includes valuable  materials such as glass, metal, and paper. This would reduce the demand on virgin  sources of  these materials and eliminate potentially severe environmental, economic, and public health problems.
Could We Bury It?
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, many of the country's landfills have been closed for one or both of these two reasons:
They were full.
They were contaminating groundwater. The water that flows beneath these deep holes is our drinking water. Once groundwater is contaminated, it is extremely expensive and difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to clean it up.
Could We Burn It?
Yes and no. Incineration does generate energy, but at a cost--it may  release toxins into the air and create ash that requires disposal in  hazardous-waste landfills, and that takes us back to our starting point: Cities are  running out of places to put their trash.
Could We Pay Someone to Take  It?
Not likely. As our population grows, former outlying areas are becoming bedroom communities, and their residents mount stiff  opposition to plans for expanding existing landfills or creating new ones, even in  return for some perks. And as local and state government officials cope with the  costs and  problems of their own waste disposal, they are less willing to import other  communities' waste and the pollution it generates. So where does this leave us?
