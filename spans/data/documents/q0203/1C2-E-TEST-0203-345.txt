You may demonstrate knowledge by writing your answer, using a tape recorder, doing an art project to draw your answer, or any other way you can demonstrate knowledge. Please get prior teacher approval for other methods.
2. You need to create one project using recycled materials. You need to bring it into class and show everybody what materials you used that you recycled. You may get ideas from THE REALM OF RECYCLING link. You may pick one of their art projects or design one of your own.
3. You will be graded on how well you can link to the different sites and use the computer to complete these assignments. You will begin working in small groups on the computer until you can begin to work alone.
