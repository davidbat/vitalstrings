Concise description of theory
The Garbage Can theory, or model, attempts to explain some organizational decision-making anomalies-in particular, decision making by "organized anarchies" where preferences are not clear, technology is not clear, or participation is fluid.
Problems, solutions, and decision makers move from one choice to another depending on the mix of recognized problems, the choices available, the mix of solutions available for problems, and outside influences on the decision makers. In short, problems are uncoupled from choices giving an image of "rummaging around" inside a garbage can. Problems are addressed based on a solution choice, but choices are made based on shifting combinations of problems, solutions, and decision makers. In this sense, decision-making appears "pathological" instead of rational.
The Garbage Can theory allows problems to be addressed and choices to be made, but does not necessarily following a rational process. Poorly understood and addressed problems can drift into and out of the garbage can process, depending on the situation and factors.
