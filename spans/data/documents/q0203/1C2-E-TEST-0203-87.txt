SPOKANE, Wash. -
Christmas has come and gone, it's time to deal with all of those empty gift boxes and crumpled balls of wrapping paper, and Spokane's waste to energy plant workers are ready to take in your holiday garbage.
All of your yuletide trash you take the waste-to-energy plant eventually ends up on the tipping floor of the waste incinerator. The boxes and bows are pushed into a 40-foot deep pit where a crane tosses the garbage like a salad so the plant doesn't choke on its compacted meal.
"It tends to plug up. So what they do is they fluff it up so the garbage is loose and flow through the plant easier," Damon Taam with the Spokane Regional Solid Waste System said.
From there the trash is loaded into the hopper in two-ton bites. Don't worry if you over-cooked your turkey because at the waste-to-energy plant's boiler, along with the other trash, its burned at 2500 degrees.
"We destroy the volatile organics and other hazardous components in the garbage itself," Taam said.
And at the same time the burning garbage super-heats the hot water pipes that surround the boiler and generate steam.
"Steam into the turbine, turbine turns the shaft which turns the generator which makes electricity," Taam said.
Enough electricity to power 13,000 homes and, waste-to-energy officials say, the plant creates no more air pollution than 10 wood stoves each day.
"It is part of our infrastructure and we are not leaving things, polluting our environment; our water and air and also producing a very valuable product ? energy," Taam said.
Because Spokane keeps on growing the 20-year-old plant has reached its capacity and we are now sending a small amount of our overflow trash to a landfill, which means any type of recycling you can do is that much more important.
