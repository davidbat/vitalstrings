Processing Recyclables
Processing Recyclables
GreenTeam of San Jose delivers all of the recyclables  we collect to our Material Recovery Facility (MRF) located in San Jose.
The technology at our state of the art MRF enables  us to efficiently sort your mixed recyclable materials, this reduces the amount  of sorting you have to do. A system of conveyor belts, screens, electromagnets  and blasts of air separate paper from plastics, glass and other materials. Sorted  bales and bins of materials are then taken to processing facilities before being  sold to make new products.
The process of sorting your recyclables at our MRF  is partially automated, GreenTeam employees do handle much of the material. Please  remember do not put any hazardous or bathroom waste in your recycling cart, this  includes hypodermic needles and diapers.
