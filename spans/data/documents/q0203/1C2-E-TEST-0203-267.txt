Summary:Â  The Java language may be the most widely used programming language to rely on garbage collection, but it is by no means the first.  Garbage collection has been an integral part of many programming languages, including Lisp, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Haskell, ML, Scheme, and Modula-3, and has been in use since the early 1960s.  In this installment of Java theory and practice, Brian Goetz describes the most common techniques for garbage collection. Over the next several months, he'll look at the garbage collection strategies employed by the 1.4 JVM, some performance implications of various garbage collection strategies, and how (as well as how not) to assist the garbage collector to yield better performance.
