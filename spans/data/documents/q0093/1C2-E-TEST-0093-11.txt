Oasis after long flight & airport experience!
Travelled Manchester to Atlanta. Had 3hr delay at M'c, then experienced the lengthy arrival process thro Atlanta, which was not pleasant. This hotel very easily & quickly reached via free skytrain from airport. Check in was very fast & efficient. Room spacious & very clean. Beds had lovely linen & were very comfortable. The only negative for the room was that there was no complimentary wi fi in the room, it was available at a cost. It was complimentary in certain public areas of the hotel only. In the 21st century, do not think this acceptable & not in line with many other hotels we have stayed in. There was a Champions bar situated right next door to the hotel & accessed from inside the hotel. Had evening meal there & complimentary breakfast. Evening meal was very good and the breakfast was the best we have had anywhere. Lots of choice on the hot plates. Overall, excellent. Would stay here again, only disappointment lack of free wi fi in room.
