Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport - Airport Of The Future
 
Located 25 miles northwest of Atlanta, Paulding County has been one of the fastest growing counties in the United States over the past ten years. Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport was designed to accommodate the rapid growth in both private and corporate aircraft operations over the next fifty years. The arrival and departure procedures for the airport’s VFR and IFR flights are seamless due to its prime location just outside and underneath Atlanta’s busy, Class Bravo airspace.
Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport is unique in its location, amenities, and services,
but it is most unique in terms of its room for growth and custom business development. The airport provides an ideal logistical location for an aircraft manufacturer, charter operator or MRO seeking to expand its operations for future growth. The 650-acre airport property includes an adjacent, 110-acres of commercial and industrial land parcels that are favorably zoned for immediate development. Parcels of all sizes are available with direct runway and ramp access, as well as off-airport parcels that will accommodate non-aviation related industries.
