Atlanta Airports
It is not really precise to talk about one Atlanta airport alone - in reality, there are actually eight public access Atlanta airports and three private access Atlanta Airports. Still, the Atlanta airport which has a great international reputation to protect would be Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport because it is believed to be the busiest airport in the world. Among the eight known public access Atlanta airports, we can find Mathis Airport, Briscoe Field, and DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. But for scheduled airline service, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is still the most common choice of Atlanta airport. For general aviation, you might opt for DeKalb-Peachtree Airport instead.

Busiest Airport
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is not your common Atlanta airport. Being the busiest airport in the world takes some effort, especially if you are trying to retain that title in the face of heightened competition among global airports. This Atlanta airport presently serves more nonstop flights plus destinations than any other airline hub you can find anywhere - so it comes as no surprise that it is deemed the busiest airport in the world. To top off its the busiest airport image, this Atlanta airport is also a major economic engine for Georgia state too and an important employer for many.
