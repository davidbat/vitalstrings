Atlanta Car Rentals
Atlanta is home to CNN and The Coca-Cola Company, but there’s so much more to the city than big businesses. So snap up an          Atlanta car rental from Thrifty and hit the road! Along the way, don’t miss the chance to see the birthplace of Dr. Martin          Luther King Jr., hit the clubs that made Outkast famous or do some shopping in the toniest neighborhood in town – Buckhead.
 
Best of all, if you’re a frequent renter, you can even sign up for the Blue Chip Express Rental Program® and put your Atlanta          rental car to work for you. Just sign up online and for every 16 days you rent with Thrifty, you’ll get one free day’s rental          at any of the locations we serve.
