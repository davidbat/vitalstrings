 
The Dictionary Project
The benefits and consequences of literacy do not stop at the classroom door, but continue down the
halls, following students out of school and into the rest of their lives. 75% of unemployed adults
have difficulties in reading or writing, 85% of children arrested have reading problems, and 75% of
all food stamp recipients perform in the lowest levels of literacy. Low literacy skills in the Georgia
workplace cost employers $57 billion annually.
 
  
Through the simple gift of a dictionary, a student is   armed with a powerful reference tool. The
spellings,  pronunciations and definitions found within are stepping stones to the   dictionary's arsenal
of  lessons. Problems that arise as a child develops his or her reading,   writing, and creative thinking
abilities  are no longer daunting foes.  Inspired by the maxim "look it up", a child uses this tool to
solve  problems they encounter, and each victory instills a stronger sense of   self-reliance and
resourcefulness  within the child. With consistent access to this tool, the children   expand their
vocabulary  and teachers benefit by knowing that students can complete their   homework and
in-class  explorations--even with correct spelling!
 
This program is an opportunity for children to develop   essential skills and for many, to actually
own a dictionary. Through volunteers and civic organizations,   dictionaries are distributed to third
grade  classrooms. Volunteers visit the classroom for 10-15 minutes giving the  students a
"pep  talk" to use the dictionary and always to "look it up!" when they meet a  new word.
Though this program, over 300,000 students have recieved a dictionary   and access to its valuable lessons.
