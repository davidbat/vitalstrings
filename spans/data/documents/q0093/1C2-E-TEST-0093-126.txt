I'm arriving at Gate A25 and connecting flight is leaving from B32; I have a 35 minute layover. What's my best bet to get to the gate? Run or tram? Thanks in advance for advice.

We were there Saturday June 16th for our 4 hour layover... sat in the Budweiser Bar/Grill and had the best service from our server Kellee.  We were returning from our honeymoon from Cancun at an all inclusive resort and the service Kellee provided was by far the best we had our entire trip!  Thank you Kellee W.
