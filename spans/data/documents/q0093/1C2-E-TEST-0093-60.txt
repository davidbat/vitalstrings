The Arts at Hartsfield-Jackson
Hartsfield-Jackson's Airport Art Program develops and integrates art exhibits and performances into the fabric of the airport environment for the benefit of passengers and employees. The program has three major components including commissioning artists to create site-specific artwork for sites throughout the airport, presenting rotating exhibitions and scheduling performing arts series. All of the program areas are linked to Hartsfield-Jackson's goal to provide unsurpassed levels of customer service and become the world's best airport.
