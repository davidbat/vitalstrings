 Testimonials
"Thank you Style Taxi, This was a first time I've                            ever taken a cab and to be honestly was a little scared                            of being ripped off. I was impressed with how fast I                            was picked up and the comfort of your vehicles. My driver                            was professional and knew the Atlanta area like the                            back of his hand. It was a positive experience and the                            next time I visit Atlanta, Style Taxi will be the only                            Taxi company I'll call to get me around town"

"My whole outlook of Taxi's has changed since                            taking one of your cabs last week. My driver was intelligent                            and actually cared about getting me to the airport fast.                            He took the most direct route and knew and avoided the                            usual traffic delays saving me money. From now on, I'll                            call Style Taxi to get me to the airport. No more parking                            hassles, no more dealing with traffic on Hwy. 400, just                            peace of mind knowing I'm going to make my flight"

Customer's Compliment - TRUE STORY
We would like to commend Sahle, Car #28, for his extreme honesty in returning a wallet that was found in his car on Tuesday March 30, 2010. The customer did not know that he left the wallet in his car until Sahle brought it back to him. The wallet contained $1,000 cash and it was all returned to the customer. Thank You, Sahle for keeping up the company's reputation with your wonderful act of honesty. We encourage all of our drivers to follow in Sahle's same footsteps.
Our Drivers are courteous, prompt and will make your trip comfortable,                safe and fast.
