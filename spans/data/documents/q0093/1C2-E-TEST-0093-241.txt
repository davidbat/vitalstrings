Airport Transportation Service
Whether you drive yourself or rely on someone else, getting to the airport can be a hassle. Below are some key terms worth knowing the next time you need to get to the terminal.
Shuttle Service - Shuttle transportation services offer group car rides to the airport. The driver usually picks you and your luggage up at home, along with other passengers who all share a ride to the airport. Vans are the vehicle of choice for most shuttles, so be prepared to be a little cramped on the way to your flight.
Car Rentals - Once your flight lands, you can always rent a car if you don't want to take a cab, taxi, or bus. Car rental companies usually offer luxury and executive vehicles, as well as family sedans and small passenger cars.
Car Parking Services - If you would rather drive the family sedan to the airport instead of taking a shuttle, you can always park your car at the airport. Airports usually charge an hourly, daily, and/or monthly rate, so be sure to check ahead.
Luxury Ride - If you want to arrive at the international terminal in style, you can always book a limo ahead of time. Limo transportation services often offer a flat rate to get to the airport, so be sure to ask.
Disabled Traveler Service - Many shuttles offer wheelchair lift-equipped vans at no extra charge. Be sure to ask in advance.
Taxi Ride - If you are racing to make a flight to a corporate meeting, you might want to consider calling a cab to make sure you get there on-time. Taxis are often able to respond to your request quickly. However, cab rides can get expensive depending on the amount of ground you are covering - even when driving within city limits.
