Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
Overall the stay was great! Despite the hotel being close to the airport I was not bothered at all by the noise. The free hot breakfast was nice and there was such a great selection! The staff were all friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others!

"Great Place"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
I stayed two nights here at the Hampton Inn and Suites on I-85 North. I will take you from check in to check out. First of all, it was very easy to find. It was pretty much directly off of I-85. It was in a nice looking community. There were shops and restaurants within walking and driving distance. The hotel looks fairly new also. The check in was […] no problem, just presented ID and Card....it was quick. The rooms were very nice and plush looking. The bathroom was clean and everything was set up pretty nicely. Breakfast is free! The waffles are Really GOOD (well to me they are) and overall it was a good variety of foods for breakfast. Everyone was very friendly (although I thought one of the desk clerks was a little pushy...but that could be because I'm used to the people from where I'm from). Check out was a breeze, all I did was turn in the keys and that was it because I reserved my rooms here (hotels.com)....There was one minor issue and that was the noise from the airport. Because of its close proximity and if you are on the front side of the building, as I was, the airplane noise can be a little bothersome. But, with the air-conditioner and the TV on a good volume, you can drown it out. It also wouldn't bother you when you sleep (I am a very light sleeper, so even the slightest noise will wake me up).  Overall, it was a very good stay.  They also have a pool (outdoor) and a fitness room with a treadmill, a exercise bike, and one of those step things (I guess that would be an elliptical??) Read more

"Nice stop for the night"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
This Hampton Inn was a nice place for me and my family to stop for the night on our rowd trip. The location was. It was right off of the freeway & there were new restaurants close by. The neighborhood itself was ok. It's right next to the airport, so it would be great for layovers. Our kids loved watching the planes, but you couldn't hear them which […] is a huge plus. The room was clean and spacious. They brought a crib for us right away. The breakfast was good. Thanks for a good experience! Read more

"Godt hotel tæt på lufthavn."
Reviewed by Claus L: of Børkop
Super hotel, der ligger tæt på lufthavnen uden at det generer. Kanon morgenmad var inkluderet i prisen, og meget venligt personale. Der sker ikke meget i nabolaget, men man kan dog få nogle gode sandwich mm få minutters gang fra hotellet. Der er 15-20 minutter i bil til Coca Cola, CNN og de andre seværdigheder.
