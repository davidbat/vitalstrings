About Atlanta
Atlanta, Georgia, is the family fun destination for the northern half of the state. Six Flags Over Georgia is the area's premier theme park. Stone Mountain Park with its carved rock face illuminated by laser shows is another famous attraction. Atlanta's shopping areas and cultural attractions are also first rate.
One attraction that may delight children of all ages is Grant Park. The park is the home of Zoo Atlanta. Approaching drivers get their first view of zoo animal from the outside when the zoo's giraffes peek over the fence to welcome them. Another Grant Park attraction is the cyclorama, a round building whose interior walls are painted with scenes of the America Civil War.
Those who relish more modern entertainment will enjoy the Atlanta Motor Speedway, whose contests offer the excitement of first-rate stock car racing. Fans of Gone With the Wind, the famous novel that depicts the burning of Atlanta during the Civil War, will love the Margaret Mitchell House, while those interested in the Civil Rights era may prefer the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Site.
