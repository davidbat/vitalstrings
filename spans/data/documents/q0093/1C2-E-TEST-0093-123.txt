ABOUT ATLANTA HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
About seven miles due south of downtown Atlanta, Hartsfield Airport occupies parts of both Clayton and Fulton counties in Georgia. Hartsfield began as a former auto racetrack that was renamed Candler Field in 1925. It was renamed again in honor of former mayor William B. Hartsfield in 1980.
Hartsfield has five concrete runways, all of them at least 9,000 feet in length. This airport has been among the busiest in the United States for several years. There are two terminals at Hartsfield, the domestic terminal is on the west side of the airport plus the new Jackson international terminal is on the east side. Both terminals are connected by an underground, automated people mover called Plane Train.
The domestic terminal is divided into the north and the south terminal. The Atrium is an expansive open area that occupies the middle of the domestic terminal, offering a bank, conference rooms, a chapel plus several shops and restaurants. Within the domestic terminal are concourses A through F. All concourses are connected by moving sidewalks. There is an indoor MARTA light rail station at the middle of the domestic terminal, offering a quick connection to downtown Atlanta.
Domestic flights use concourses A through D, while E and F handle international traffic. Both concourses E and F have their own connection to the international terminal, which opened in 2012. Some gates, taxiways and runways are being modified to accommodate the Airbus A380 SuperJumbo jet, which may begin flying into Hartsfield next year.
Delta Airlines has maintained their headquarters and largest hub at Atlanta Hartsfield for several decades. Air Tran has also had their main hub at the airport for several years, but they are now being gradually absorbed by merger partner Southwest Airlines.
