The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world’s busiest passenger airport with the world’s largest terminal complex spread out over one international and six domestic concourses. More than 11 Astrodome playing fields would fit into the North and South Terminals. The airport’s underground train keeps passengers moving efficiently between the concourses and the terminals. If you decide to hoof it instead of taking the train you’re in for a long walk through drab underground corridors. Not as efficient are the security checkpoint lines, which are straining under the requirements of post-9/11 screenings. Veteran Atlanta passengers recommend arriving at the airport more than two hours before your flight time on busy travel days to accommodate likely security delays. These issues and the airports overall out-dated appearance will hopefully be addressed by a $5.4 billion, 10-year development program that will modernize and expand airport facilities.
