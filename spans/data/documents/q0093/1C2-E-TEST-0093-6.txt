ATL Flight Information Tracking System (ATL Trak-a-FlightSM)
HOW IT WORKS:
Enter your flight information and your email address in the form provided.  After you register for a flight, you will be sent an email every time that flight's status has changed.  If your flight has been delayed, changed gates or been cancelled, you'll know right away via email.  Once the flight has arrived or departed, the email notification will stop.
You can even specify a short or long email message.  The short message is ideal for email-capable cell phones and pagers.  The longer message is better suited to laptop and desktop computers.
Please note that your privacy is very important to us.  Your email address will only be used to send you updates on the flight(s) you've registered for.  We will not sell or distribute your email address to anyone.
Our mission is to provide the Atlanta region a safe, secure and cost-competitive gateway to the
world that drives economic development, operates with the highest level of customer
service and efficiency, and exercises fiscal and environmental responsibility.
