This section of the Atlanta Time Machine is devoted to   examining old photos of the Atlanta airport over the years and exploring a   bit of its history.
Before we get started, though, I have to   give a super-colossal tip of  the cap to the extremely learned and   generous aviation scholar David Henderson.  It's no exaggeration to say   that without David's help this section would not exist.  Not only did   he supply the vast majority of the images, even more importantly he supplied   all of the facts that accompany the photos.  Believe me, you don't want   to get into a trivia contest about the Atlanta airport with this guy.  So thanks a million, David!
A good place to start would   probably be the Google Map that David put together showing the sites of the various   terminals, concourses, and control towers that have been part of the airport   of the years.  Then, after checking that out, just keep hitting the   Next Photo button.
By the way, David's the author of a book   detailing the histories of dozens of small regional southern airlines.  The book is called Sunshine Skies: Historic Commuter Airlines of Florida and   Georgia and is available here .  Is it a good book?  I confess that I have not read it, but it sounds   like absolutely mandatory reading for regional aviation enthusiasts, at   least according to this review .
