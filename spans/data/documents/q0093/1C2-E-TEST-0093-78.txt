Unbelievably great good and service! It's hard to believe this is an airport restaurant. The ambiance is wonderful with beautiful music and the mural on the wall looks like a jungle. I've now been there three times and it's so good I'd practically plan a lay-over in ATL just to ensure enough time to go there. It had been a while since my last visit (probably 2 months) and Sopie immediately recognized me and called me by name - very impressive. The sushi is wonderful. Today I had the cobia. My husband had the pork sliders. It's pretty quick too, but relaxing at the same time. It is not inexpensive, but it is certainly worth the money and the time to go there while in the Atlanta airport!
