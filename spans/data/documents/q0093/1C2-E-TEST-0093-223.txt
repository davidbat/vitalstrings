Atlanta Airport Delays, Flights were essentially frozen in and out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for days because of snow, and the state of emergency was issued in Georgia.
Parts of Atlanta have received up to five inches of snow, which is very rare for the region.
Four of the five runways at Atlanta airport are open Tuesday morning, but the city roads are still bad, and it was difficult for airport employees to go to work.
“We are told that our flight was canceled, there are no other flights because of weather, and the sooner they could come back to the house is in one day,” said Dave Watkins, whose trip home to Hawaii after visiting Walt Disney World includes a connecting flight in Atlanta. “So we will not be home at night” until tomorrow instead of this afternoon. “Wife of Dave, Satoko, was not too concerned when the couple arrived home. “Unlike him, I did not have to work tomorrow,” she said. But there is a glimmer of relief Tuesday.
AirTran said it plans to resume operations, but with a greatly reduced flight schedule. Six of the nine flights AirTran Tuesday from Orlando were still on schedule by 8 pm
Delta said it would receive four flights to Orlando on Tuesday. However, the airline said it still has at least 1,400 cancellations planned nationally.
Flight delays expected to continue through Tuesday and maybe Wednesday.
The winter storm expected to move up the East Coast, creating problems for passengers getting in and out of airports highest on the east coast later in the week.
