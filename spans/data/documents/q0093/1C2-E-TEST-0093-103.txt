About Atlanta International Airport
Atlanta International Airport has been one of the busiest airports in the world for decades, primarily through it's long association with hometown Delta Airlines. AirTran Airways also maintains a major hub in Atlanta, although AirTran's recent buyout by Southwest Airlines may bring changes.
Known as Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, it began as Candler field in 1925 on an abandoned auto racing track covering 287 acres about 7 miles from downtown Atlanta. In 1926 air mail service began to Jacksonville, Florida, followed by Pitcairn Aviation, later renamed Eastern airlines, in 1928 and Delta Air Service in 1930. Candler quickly became the busiest airport in the south. After militarization during World War II it was renamed Atlanta Municipal airport, quickly outgrowing facilities. Both Eastern and Delta maintained large hubs at Atlanta since the war.
In 1977 construction began on the present midfield terminal, opening as the new Hartsfield International Airport in 1980. The name was changed to Hartsfield-Jackson in 2003, a new control tower opened in 2006, and the fifth runway opened in 2009. The new runway is built above Interstate highway 285 and makes Hartsfield one of the rare airports that can handle 3 landings at the same time.
Today Hartsfield-Jackson has 186 gates and employs over 50,000 workers, having progressed from mostly domestic flights to a growing international destination.
