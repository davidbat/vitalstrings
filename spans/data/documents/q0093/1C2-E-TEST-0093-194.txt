Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport
 
Did you know? ...in 1925, Mayor Walter A. Sims signed a five-year lease on an abandoned auto racetrack and commits the City to developing it into an airfield. As part of the agreement, this 287 acres of land is renamed Candler Field after its former owner's family, including Coca-Cola magnate Asa Candler. The infield of the old racetrack had been used as a landing site for many years prior to 1925.  Hartsfield handles over 6 million passengers - per month!
