H. J. Atlanta Int'l Airport Information
Hartsfield-Jackson bears the proud distinction of being "the world's busiest passenger airport." The Airport has long been known as a major connecting hub serving numerous destinations around the globe. However, its vitality of growth is no longer merely a product of its role as a prime-interlining hub. Each year, an increasing number of air travelers start or finish their journeys in the Southeast region of the United States.
Consequently, as the Southeastern portion of the United States continues to grow both in terms of population and economic development, so does Hartsfield-Jackson. This is why the City of Atlanta and the airlines at Hartsfield-Jackson have authorized the Airport to spend an impressive $5.4 billion towards our 10-year development program. The Hartsfield-Jackson Development Program will modernize and expand the current airport facilities to accommodate its current and future traffic demands. This program will assure that Hartsfield-Jackson maintains its global leadership role.
