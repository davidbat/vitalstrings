Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (IATA: ATL, ICAO: KATL, FAA LID: ATL), locally known as Atlanta Airport, Hartsfield Airport, or simply Hartsfield, is located seven miles (11 km) south of the central business district of Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It has been the world’s busiest airport by passenger traffic and landings and take-offs. [2][3]. Additionally, Delta Air Lines operates the world’s largest airline hub from the airport.
Hartsfield held its ranking as the world’s busiest airport in 2006, both in terms of passengers and number of flights, by accommodating 84.8 million passengers and 976,447 flights respectively according to the Geneva-based Airports Council International. Many of these flights are domestic flights from within the United States where Atlanta serves as a major transfer point for flights to and from smaller cities throughout the Southern United States. Fifty-seven percent of Hartsfield-Jackson’s airport passengers do not stay in Atlanta but go on connection flights elsewhere.[citation needed] As an international gateway to the United States, Hartsfield-Jackson ranks seventh; JFK International in New York City is first.[4]
The Atlanta airport has more nonstop flights and destinations than any airline hub in the world. It serves 243 nonstop destinations, including 72 international destinations in 45 countries. [5]

Just went through Atlanta last night and got to try out their WiFi service while waiting for our delayed flight.  The WiFi signal and speed were both excellent.  The power outlets weren’t too hard to locate as they are banks of outlet at about every 2-3 columns that span the terminal.
The only thing was that the terminal gets really busy with a lot of people but that is what you would expect from a busy airport.  Try to look for seat near the ends of the terminal, you will find less people and more available seat to rest or work.
