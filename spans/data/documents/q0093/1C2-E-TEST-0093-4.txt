Atlanta International Airport
Welcome to ATL - Atlanta Hartsfield - Jackson international airport.  Atlanta's airport is the busiest passenger airport in the world today with over 80 Million passengers going through the Atlanta Airport each year. Atlanta is a hub airport for Delta Airlines, the oldest continuous tenant at the Atlanta Airport, having had service from Atlanta to other destinations since 1930, then operating as Delta Air Service.  In 1925 the land that an old racetrack was on, was leased by the city and named Candler Field, the first commercial flight was in September of 1926 with a regularly scheduled mail delivery flight.  In 1971 the airport was named William B. Hartsfield Atlanta Airport in honor of  the mayor that made sure the airport was developed, and in October of 2003 the name was changed again to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in recognition of Mayor Maynard Jackson's contribution to the modernization of the Atlanta Airport.
