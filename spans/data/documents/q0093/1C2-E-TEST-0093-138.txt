Atlanta Airport is the hub for Delta Airlines. I have been through the airport several times on my way from the northeast to such areas as Fort Walton Beach, FL, and Biloxi, MS. This is a huge airport with 5 separate runways and terminals connected by a passenger train. Atlanta is also the world's busiest airport in terms of passengers and takeoffs and landings with some 86 million people transiting the airport each year--that's about 10 million more people than the world's second busiest airport, Chicago O'Hare.

Dreadful Delta Departure Gate!

I had a wonderful trip with Delta in 2008 but 2009 was the opposite. Our incoming flight from Tucson was delayed though landed only 5 minutes late. It took a while longer to find a gate to park up but we legged it from Terminal A to terminal E arriving as they called "5 minutes before gate closes" only to find they had already boarded other passengers in our places. Now it seems it is a fact of life that flights are oversold but we weren't even late. To add insult to injury none of the desk staff would look us in the eye to explain what was happening - there was a general air of panic as I guess they know thay had screwed up. We then were told our hotel and meals would be fully paid for only to find later that this was not the case. As we were led fro the gate they were still boarding other passengers! The booking desk was pretty poor as well and had we not had someone in our party who knew how things should work we would not have been "given" an overnight pack - something that is obviously prepared for just our situation where we had only what we stood up in and our hand luggage to take us through the next 24 hours. Why couldnt they offer it without being asked?
To give credit to Delta, we complained on our return home and they were very prompt in giving us a credit voucher. but how sad it had to come to that.
