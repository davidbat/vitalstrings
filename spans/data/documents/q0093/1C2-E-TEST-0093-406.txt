Restaurants Near Atlanta Airport
I have friends coming into town for a 3 hour layover at the Atlanta airport and want to show them the best that Atlanta has to offer. With check-in times, etc. there is only a 2 hour span so I want to take them somewhere pretty close to the airport. It will be around dinner time on a Saturday evening. Price doesn't  matter but a really authentic, southern restaurant would be ideal. Any suggestions? Thank you!

The Pecan on Main St. in College Park is a good spot, and it's 5 minutes from the airport.
I'm not sure you can do what you want with the time you have (best Atlanta has to offer), but The Pecan is very good southern.
