Atlanta [ATL]
by kelly on June 13, 2010
According to the Atlanta Airport* website, there is actually a US Post Office in the airport . Holy wow!
US Post Office
Hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. – Monday through Saturday.
Noon through 8 p.m. – Sunday.
Location: Southwest area of the Atrium, across from the Delta baggage claim area.
I googled it to find out if this is indeed true and I found the site iFly.com , which touts itself as “The World’s Best Guide to Airports.” I cannot confirm or deny that claim (mostly because I haven’t really looked for any others…) but this seems to be an incredibly useful site for travelers who are interested in more than just “Where is the mailbox at this airport?” (Which seems to be my only real concern.)
From the iFly entry on ATL , I got the following scoop:
Mail Center/US Post Office at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta Airport
U.S. Postal Store is a full-service post office with services including passport applications, photos and processing.
Location: Atrium – Gate SW; Tel: 404-305-0283
U.S. Post Office letter drop and self-service stamp vending are located at:
Concourse B – Gate 17
Concourse C – Gate 17
Concourse D – Gate Centerpoint
Nifty! Full service! Of course, here’s hopin’ you’re not trying to get your passport for the flight you’re about to embark upon.
I have a feeling iFly is going to be verrry helpful as I sniff out mailbox locations in airports. Of course, it does not include photos of the mailboxes and I think we really need those. Don’t you agree?
*Excuse me, the “Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,” which does not at all gracefully shorten to “HJAIA.” They put this little abbreviation at the top of all of their web pages and left me wondering “What the heck?” for awhile before I put it together. Weirdness.
