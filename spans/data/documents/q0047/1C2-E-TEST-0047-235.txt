Paterno's treatment will be remembered
'Why was Paterno excoriated for not doing enough when Corbett's office dragged its feet several years later? There is more to this scandal than people are being told, but thanks to people such as Phil Knight , Anthony Lubrano and Bill Keisling, who found the courage to say publicly what needed to be said, the public is learning more.
I will remember forever, especially when election time comes around.'
