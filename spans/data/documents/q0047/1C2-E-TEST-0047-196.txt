Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Corbett, On Ultrasound Mandate: Just ‘Close Your Eyes’

Some people have eyes in the back of their heads, and women apparently have eyes in the vaginas according to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett. Gov. Corbett took some questions and answers during a discussion of the new mandatory ultrasound Pennsylvania bill that is similar to the now mostly defunct Virginia preemptive-pole-up-your-pooter bill.
According to the Huffington Post , “Corbett reaffirmed his support for the “Women’s Right to Know” Act , which would require doctors to perform an ultrasound on a patient, offer her two personalized copies of the image and play and describe fetal heartbeat in detail before she can have an abortion – ‘as long as it’s not obtrusive.’”
Corbett was asked specifically, “Where do you stand on that ultrasound bill that seemed to sort of stir things up in the House?”
CORBETT: Well we make a statement during the campaign and wouldn’t change it. As long as it’s not obtrusive. But we’re still waiting to see.
QUESTIONER: Making them watch…does that go too far in your mind?”
CORBETT: I’m not making anybody watch, okay. Because you just have to close your eyes. As long as it’s on the exterior and not the interior.
Well, okay. As long as it’s not on the interior.
Oh, wait! It IS on the interior! Again as HuffPo reports, “He did not indicate whether or not he considered a transvaginal ultrasound to be an intrusive procedure, which the bill would require doctors to perform on a woman whose fetus is not developed enough to be visible by a regular, ‘jelly-on-the-belly’ ultrasound.”
So maybe we have to let him off “the clamps” a little. Heck he probably didn’t read the bill he’s supporting. But whatever, who cares, right?
