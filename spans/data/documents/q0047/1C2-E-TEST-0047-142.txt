Gov. Corbett is entering the House for the start of the budget address...

The PA Senate and the Governor are now, literally, in the House

Pa is state that values heroism #pabudget

Pennsylvanians are people who embrace important qualities. We value service. We value bravery. We value compassion. We saw these virtues on display last year when floods hit our state.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 4:59:30 PM
Gov. Corbett is now talking about the service of two men who won the Purple Heart.
Specialist Ryan Petrill, from Luzerne County, was injured fighting in Afghanistan. Sergeant Matthew Keeler, from Delaware County, earned his purple heart in Iraq. We are grateful for their service, and even more grateful to have these winners of the Purple Heart back home in Pennsylvania.

#Corbett asks to honor Paterno, then slashes funding to the school Paterno loved by 30%

Audio has returned...
We did not hear Gov. Corbett talk about the sadness associated with the death of Joe Paterno...
"We began this new year on a note of sadness. Joe Paterno, a legendary coach and an ambassador for Pennsylvania in the world of sports, died. His commitment to Penn State and to the futures of the athletes he guided can never be doubted."
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:04:08 PM
Last year, when I stood before you, I spoke of a grave dilemma. The state had a structural deficit of more than $4 billion.
For the first time in 40 years, we spent less. Our state budget was passed on time for the first time in almost a decade. And we imposed no new taxes on our citizens.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:04:44 PM
Thru our efforts we are showing that PA is open for business #pabudget

After long negotiations, we are close to reaching a consensus on how to address the impacts in the Marcellus Shale regions.
I am pleased with the progress we have made and I applaud the cooperative spirit you and your staffs demonstrated while working to resolve this complex issue. I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
The Senate approved this legislation this morning.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:05:55 PM
Corbett: By keeping taxes in check and spending under control we continued to replace jobs lost in the recession.
In this administration we have decreased overall spending by six percent. We reduced the state automobile fleet by more than 1,200 cars. In the agencies that fall under the supervision of the governor, we have eliminated “per diem” expense accounts. We insist on receipts. In every sense, the message of reform is, “don’t waste.”
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:07:21 PM
Reform also means knowing the difference between a "make-work" project and a "save-jobs" project. It’s the difference between merely propping something up, and building on its real value.

If we had raised taxes it would have cost pa families $1200 that is unacceptable #pabudget

Gov. is now discussing a Port of Philadelphia project - the state is spending $15 million to continue deepening the Delaware River channel.
The hope is to get new ships -- that can now fit through a widened and deepened Panama Canal into port.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:09:26 PM
Corbett: "I worked with our congressional delegation both Democrat and Republican alike, to send a message to the Obama administration: release the additional money to complete this crucial economic development project. Judging from today’s news reports, it looks like we succeeded."
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:10:49 PM
Corbett now talking about the state's energy industry....
"Our energy producing fields continue to generate jobs. A somewhat overlooked side-effect that benefits all Pennsylvanians, in every corner of the state, is the estimated 40 percent average drop in home heating prices for Pennsylvanians who use our clean, abundant supply of natural gas."
Corbett said in the southeast alone, the average utility customer saved almost $700.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:12:09 PM
We remain committed to addressing the closure of Philly refineries #pabudget
by governorcorbett via twitter 2/7/2012 5:12:32 PM
Corbett: "Right now, we are hard at work to bring a major natural gas processing plant to southwestern Pennsylvania. The best argument we can make to the company behind this project is Pennsylvania’s embrace of free markets."
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:12:42 PM
Corbett: "Business creates jobs where it feels welcome. Citizens live best when they are employed and don't live in the constant fear that what they earn will be taxed away."

"We cannot allow the debts of today to crowd out the dreams of tomorrow. If we don’t act to reconfigure government and revamp how it provides services, we will find ourselves trapped in this same box every year."

We will not spend more than we have ; we will not raise taxes #pabudget

Corbett: "Today I bring before you a budget grounded in difficult realities but framed in the optimism that we are solving our problems."
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:16:25 PM
I am submitting to you a budget proposal that is at once lean and demanding. In the coming weeks we will sit down to work out the final details as we map out our course.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:17:52 PM
We will not raise taxes. There is no talking around these limits. Every dollar taken in tax is one less dollar in the hands of a job-holder or a job-creator.

The old way of doing things has produced problems that we will have to deal with for years #pabudget
by governorcorbett via twitter 2/7/2012 5:18:13 PM
I am bringing before you a budget built on the decisions of last year. It is a budget that proposes more in the way of reforms by continuing to change the culture  of government from one of entitlement to one of enterprise.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:18:20 PM
One of the major innovations I propose this year, the use of block grants, will be found in both our Basic Education and our Welfare budgets.

With less to spend than we would like, we need to give more flexibility at the
level where this money will be spent: the county and school district.

We need to train our workforce for the jobs of the 21st century #pabudget
by governorcorbett via twitter 2/7/2012 5:20:04 PM
It is absolutely critical that we repair our unemployment compensation system. We have legislation in the General Assembly and we need to act on it now.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:20:17 PM
TRANSPORTATION: It is also critical that we address our transportation issues. This is not a budget item. It is too large for that. Transportation must be confronted as its own distinct and separate topic. This problem has grown for the past several decades and it will not be solved overnight.
I have spent significant time considering this issue with my transportation team and developed some workable solutions. However, those solutions will only be possible with your input, assistance and support. I look forward to working with you.

We cannot conjure up jobs but we can act as partners with job creators #pabudget
by governorcorbett via twitter 2/7/2012 5:21:15 PM
The demands of a mixed economy, where free enterprise exists alongside government encouragement, teach some hard lessons. We cannot, in government, simply conjure up jobs. We can help businesses get a start, but we can’t carry them. We can help train private sector workers, but we cannot be their employers. We can, at best, act as partners.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:21:52 PM
We are proposing jobs first PA: an aggressive pro jobs agenda #pabudget
by governorcorbett via twitter 2/7/2012 5:22:17 PM
Corbett: I am bringing before you a new and innovative program to create a robust employment market and a vital economy. We call it Jobs First PA. It comprises four programs:
· Pennsylvania Inc.
· The Comprehensive Job Matching System,
· Keystone Works, and
· The Targeted Industry Certificate Program.
We will roll out full details soon.
by Shaun Ganley/Staff2/7/2012 5:22:29 PM
Corbett explains briefly, the new programs....
Pennsylvania Inc. provides a single point of access between job creators and state government to speed the time between an idea and a business.
Keystone Works would allow unemployed workers to continue their benefits while being trained by companies with available jobs.
The idea is to get the recently unemployed back to work as quickly as possible.
The Targeted Industry Certificate program provides increased grants for college and trade school students who are training for high-demand occupations.
In short, we are targeting our workforce toward the jobs. The goal is simple: if there’s a job to fill in a new or existing industry, we are determined to put that career opportunity into the hands of a Pennsylvanian.

One of our core functions is to provide for education at several levels starting with our youngest. We have less money than I would like, so we must adapt.
