While I don’t agree with abortion, I don’t agree with this either.  This is just more tyranny from governments.  Neither side wants to be out done by their attacks on the individual.  This is just one more example of how less government is better government.

I don’t remember if Mediaite wrote about this, but a few months back a couple medical ethicist wrote an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics.  This article was about “after-birth abortion.”  That’s right…they were basically supporting the idea of killing a newborn baby for whatever reason.
http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full
“Abortion is largely accepted even for reasons that do not have anything to do with the fetus’ health. By showing that (1) both fetuses and newborns do not have the same moral status as actual persons, (2) the fact that both are potential persons is morally irrelevant and (3) adoption is not always in the best interest of actual people, the authors argue that what we call ‘after-birth abortion’ (killing a newborn) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled.”
Wow.  Obviously people got upset at the idea of murdering babies, newborn babies.  The editor of the journal was aghast at the response.
http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2012/02/28/liberals-are-disgusting-in-defence-of-the-publication-of-after-birth-abortion/
His outrage wasn’t that two “ethicist” would think that killing a baby, even a healthy baby, was fine, but that readers were upset.
The discourse would have been interesting, but I think a little too educated for the average Mediaite reader.  I could be wrong though.

If Republicans passed a law saying insurance companies didn’t have to cover transvaginal ultrasounds, liberals would be up-in-arms whining that they are “medically necessary” and “essential to womens’ health”.

You have bigger problems if you can’t afford birth control right now.  According to health.costhelper.com, the average cost, per month, for birth control for someone without medical insurance is between $20 and $50.  Those with health insurance have an average cost of $5 to $15.

 Don’t you dare call it “killing” if a woman with cancer faces the difficult and harrowing choice to save her own life with cancer treatments, but must terminate the pregnancy, or if a woman with an ectopic pregnancy must also end the pregnancy to save her life.  Rape and incest victims must not be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, and face medical risks by doing so.  The disgusting statement above would taint any woman who miscarries with a cloud of suspicion, since it would have to be determined if she took every precaution, such as getting enough rest, not drinking caffeinated drinks, not exercising strenuously, etc. 
Save some of the 515,000 children waiting to be adopted, or who are in foster care, or do more to prevent the 1,500+ deaths of children by one or more parent every year before interfering with and discriminating against one gender for the decisions they  make regarding their own health.

You can’t legislate morality..further, you can’t legislate salvation, which is what this really comes down too.  I don’t subscribe to abortion as form of birth control, by any means but I don’t believe in a system that would go to such archaic methods in order to persuade a woman to change her mind.

Cancer patients and women with ectopic pregnancies face death
themselves, so there’s not much of a “choice.”  Rape and incest victims
also had little to no “choice” about getting pregnant, and they
themselves face risks with carrying to term. There’s a long list of
prohibited activities to prevent miscarriages, so if every single one is
not followed, you are saying that the woman is a “killer”  if she
miscarries.
What are the odds you harass soldiers and the police about victims of
bombings, and accidental shootings, or taxpayers for the same, as well
as paying for state mandated capital punishment?  Not very likely.  You
ever attack family members, not to mention doctors and nurses, for
taking relatives or patients off life support machines?  Again, not very
likely. 
Stay out of the private health decisions made by women!

 PLEASE READ or do any research about the “Unborn Victims of Violence Act” – with provisions explicitly excepting abortion.
“Roe v. Wade
said that states are not obligated to treat fetuses as
persons.  It also said that in a conflict with the constitutional liberty of
a pregnant woman seeking an abortion before the fetus is capable of survival
outside the womb, the fetus may not be given the same rights as the woman. 
However, that certainly does not mean that there are no circumstances in
which fetuses can be given legal protection.  Again, it all depends on the
context.”
“so long as respecting the rights
and interests of fetuses does not conflict with the right of a woman to
decide whether to terminate her pregnancythere is no necessary
contradiction between the abortion right established in Roe and
feticide laws.”

You don’t know what you’re talking about with miscarriages at all.
There are some women who are either deliberately or negligently reckless, and may ignore doctors advice about what precautions to take to prevent miscarriages.  You would have to carry out criminal investigations to determine which women who miscarry took every precaution, and which ones didn’t.
Try typing in “caused” and “miscarriage” in Google Search to gain some kind of knowledge.

Nowhere does the article speak of this happening.
Euthanasia in infants has been proposed by philosophers for children with severe abnormalities whose lives can be expected to be not worth living and who are experiencing unbearable
suffering.
His follow up link states
Many people will and have disagreed with these arguments. However, the
goal of the Journal of Medical Ethics is not to present the Truth or
promote some one moral view. It is to present well reasoned argument
based on widely accepted premises. The authors provocatively argue that
there is no moral difference between a fetus and a newborn.

I’m just responding to your first comment and the reason I did was because the article was about this republican jumping on the bandwagon that a few other states are considering but your comment didn’t really appear to address that.  Not picking a fight, just responding to your initial comment, like I said.
I understand where you’re coming from, of course…completely respect your viewpoint, and again, I don’t subscribe to it, but I’m not entitled to tell any woman yes or no.  I hav ea 23 year old daughter with a connective tissue disorder and her having a baby has the potential of being dicey.  Suffice it to say, if it came down to my kid or an unborn who’d grow up without a mother, I choose my kid, hands down.
The issue, though is a state sanctioned method of dissuading a woman from having an abortion which I think it just manipulative and a bad idea….and then this guy has the gall to say “I’m not making anyone watch…”
So, why force the ultrasound?  Can a woman, then, go in with a blindfold so they don’t have to see and listen to an ipod so they dont’ have to hear as well and then decline to view any pictures afterwords?    I think it’s silly…it’s actually very adolescent sounding.  They may as well be saying “okay, abortion’s legal..fine…then we’re going to do this and you cant do a thing about it…neener neener neener.”

As usual, the point is completely missed.  A transvaginal ultrasound can be a medically necessary proceedure.  In the case of a woman seeking an abortion, it’s not medically necessary. 
What these laws say is that, in order to get medical treatment that you want, you have to undergo an unnecessary, invasive medical procedure that you don’t want, for the supposed purpose of saving someone else.  What’s next?  If you want a flu shot, you’re going to have to donate some blood?  Oh you broke your arm?  Sorry, but if you want that set, you’re gonna have to give us a kidney. 
The whole “constitutional right to privacy” thing all started with a case where a woman was injured on a train and the railroad wanted to compel her to undergo an exam to determine the extent of the injury.  She hurt her head and neck, and the Supreme Court said that forcing her to expose those parts of her body to a stranger for an exam was unconstitutional.  You people are talking about forcing a woman to have a dildo of guilt ultrasound wand shoved into her vagina by a stranger.  Are you really that insane?

This is in reply to your question below “what’s to stop a state from investigating all women who miscarry, because some may have deliberately, or negligently caused the termination of the pregnancy?  What’s to stop governments from reducing women to being mere incubators without any rights?”
This is exactly how fetal protection laws are being used in many states.  Hundreds of women have been arrested for murder or other crimes under laws designed to protect fetuses from violence from 3rd parties.  Some have been arrested and charged with murder for taking drugs during pregnancy.  This is also exactly why we have to be very, very careful about changing abortion laws.  The law can be passed with the best intentions (like protecting pregnant women from domestic abuse) and twisted by overzealous prosecutors to persecute people.

This is the line that I thought this was all about. The state is forcing women to allow a object to be inserted into their vagina. That is rape. And telling women to close their eyes  and bear it just makes the rape analogy all the more obvious.

I have had a transvaginal ultrasound.. when I experienced a miscarriage
and had bleeding and cramping so bad that the doctor wanted to rule out
the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.
I can tell you from personal experience that it is incredibly
uncomfortable and invasive, even when the ultrasound technician agreed
to let me insert the device myself. I agreed to this procedure only
because my life was potentially in danger and this test was the only way
to know for sure.
These politicians seem to take this so lightly, as if it were some usual
procedure that we should be used to or can shrug off.  It is an affront
of the worst kind to women to force them to do this when not necessary.
Yes, there are a small number of cases where it should be done.  A
doctor and the patient need to decide for themselves when it is
warranted.  And you need to ask our permission first!

Sex, for lack of a better word, is wonderful. It relaxes both partners and should be enjoyed as the end result is procreation. Granted religions, politicians and numerous others have taken leave of their senses and tried over the years to control sex. Sex occurs normally and no matter how often some have tried to control it, it ain’t gonna happen. America’s politician’s have stepped over the line in requiring women to undergo Ultrasounds/Sonograms when there is no medical reason. I’d like to recommend every politician who voted for this bill to receive a vaginal ultrasound, or like location, to experience the glorious beauty of this invasion of a woman’s body by right-winged TEA-GOP-Republican legislators. To impose a politician’s wet dream onto America’s women smacks of contentious arrogance of the wrong-winged, fringed, TEA-GOP-Republican elitist!

515,000 children were waiting to be adopted or were in foster care on 9/30/10, and according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there were 1,676 child fatalities in 2009 due to abuse, neglect, and murder,  76% of which were committed by at least one parent, not to mention 1.5 million children were the victims of mistreatment (abuse and neglect,) and so there is every reason to question why those opposed to abortion ignore the pain and suffering of children.
As I commented before, you’re only concern is with what happens between conception and birth.
And again it must be asked, your contention appears to be that it’s better that women kill themselves by refusing life saving cancer treatments or refusing to terminate dangerous ectopic pregnancies to save fetuses.  That’s sick.

It is not ‘sugar coating’, its basic science.  If a fetus or embryo isnt viable outside the body, it isnt technically alive.  It has no consciousness, it is simply a group of multiplying cells.  Therefore, it is not ‘killing.’.

That’s just him waffling. Either he is being deliberately evasive or he doesn’t even understand the law or process. Under the proposed law a woman must obtain a clear image of the embryo and the pulse must be audible -  that can only be accomplished during the first seven weeks – when over half of abortions occur – with a transvaginal ultrasound. For women who are overweight or  whose anatomy is quirky, a transvaginal ultrasound may continue to be necessary later in pregnancy.

I wonder how long it will be before someone sues under “unreasonable search and seizure” grounds if the transvaginal ultrasound mandate remains.
