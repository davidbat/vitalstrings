    The contrast could not have been more striking.
    Governor Tom Corbett took a break from his concerns over the sex abuse scandal engulfing the big-time, big-money, big-attendance, big-politic Penn State football program on Saturday by watching his tiny alma mater, Lebanon Valley College, take on Saint Vincent College in the NCAA Division III ECAC South-West Bowl at Arnold Field on the LVC campus.
    Gov. Corbett — a 1971 LVC grad who played lacrosse for the Dutchmen on the same field more than 40 years ago — presented the bowl’s championship plaque to the team following LVC’s 23-15 victory.
    “This is so much fun to do,” Corbett said, attired casually in jeans and a red fleece jacket. “You get to be able to be a little closer to the field here. I try to get down to see a couple of games — football, basketball, and of course, lacrosse games ... it’s nice to come down here, and you can go back 40 years in time real quick. Considering this was the same field I played lacrosse on when I was here, it’s nice to be able to put some of your duties behind you and relax like everybody else does.”
