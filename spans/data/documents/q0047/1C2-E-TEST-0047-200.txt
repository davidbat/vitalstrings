  Minnesota's Famous Half Way Stop!
TOM “BOSTON” CORBETT
It was "Boston"     Corbett who standing outside the blazing Garrett barn, fired the fatal shot     that killed John Wilkes Booth, President Lincoln's assassin. Historical accounts     indicate that Corbett, whose given name was Thomas P. Corbett, achieved considerable     fame after the shooting in 1865.
Several years later, he moved to Kansas where he was chosen as assistant doorkeeper at the     Kansas State Capitol. This job appealed to him and he proudly appeared for     duty with his army cap and .38 "hot leg" strapped to his Civil War belt. He     relished the attention this brought him and, when asked gladly led in prayer     at the beginning of legislative sessions. But on February 15, 1887, when the raucous legislators were embroiled      in an especially boisterous session and one legislator shouted mockingly to Corbett to lead them in prayer,      Corbett was so incensed by the blasphemy he drew his gun and shouted,
"Legislature is adjourned!" He was promptly arrested, tried, pronounced insane and sent to an asylum in Topeka.
On May 26,     1888, he escaped on horseback, taking a horse that had been ridden up to the asylum by a young boy who was visiting the      grounds. Corbett, in company with a number of inmates, saw the horse tied to a post and sprang from the ranks, mounted the      horse and rode away. It is believed he disappeared to the remote forests of Hinckley, Minnesota. There he settled      in a small cabin just east of town, earning a living supplying venison for a logging camp near the      Kettle River. On September 1, 1894, the final chapter of Corbett's eventful life was written as he was found to be included on the certified      list of those that perished in the Great Hinckley Fire.
