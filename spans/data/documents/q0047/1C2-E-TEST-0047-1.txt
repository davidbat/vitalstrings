On March 23, 2010, Corbett, along with 13 other state attorneys general, filed a lawsuit against the mandates in the just-signed federal Healthcare Bill , claiming it is unconstitutional. As of January 2011, a total of 27 states have joined this lawsuit. [11]
[ edit ] Governor of Pennsylvania
Main article: Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2010
On March 17, 2009, it was reported that Corbett had formed an exploratory committee and had begun filing the paperwork necessary to begin a run for Governor of Pennsylvania . On September 15, 2009, Corbett formally declared his candidacy [12] and, on May 18, 2010, won the GOP primary with nearly 70% of the vote. [13]
In May 2010 Corbett filed a criminal subpoena against twitter ordering them to divulge "any and all subscriber information" of the person(s) behind two accounts that were criticizing the Republican candidate. [14] Corbett's office denied that the subpoenas were related to the criticism, but rather to an ongoing grand jury investigation. Corbett's office ultimately withdrew the subpoenas. One of the account owners declined to say whether he was indeed the subject of a grand jury investigation. [15]
In July 2010, Corbett garnered attention for suggesting that some of the unemployed are exploiting the extension of unemployment benefits prior to seeking employment, and later noting the prevalence of "help wanted" ads in the newspapers as evidence of the availability of employment. [16] [17]
In September 2010, at the first gubernatorial debate, Corbett again gained attention for seemingly violating his "no-tax pledge" in suggesting that he would consider raising the payroll contribution tax. [18]
On November 2, 2010, Corbett was elected governor of Pennsylvania, succeeding Democrat Ed Rendell. Corbett assumed the office of governor on January 18, 2011, at 12:29 PM.
[ edit ] Budget
Corbett became governor on January 18, 2011. One of his first actions was the proposal of a new state budget that would decrease spending by 3%. The proposed budget received significant criticism due to its cuts in state-supported higher education by 50%. Under the new budget, funding granted to the 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and state-related universities Penn State , Pittsburgh , Temple , and Lincoln would be cut in half, totaling $625 million. Corbett has said, however, that he will not attempt to limit collective bargaining, as have Republican Governors John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. [19]
[ edit ] Natural gas
As governor, Corbett maintains that Pennsylvania should not tax the natural gas industry. [20] [21] In February 2011, Corbett repealed a four month old policy regulating natural gas drilling (including hydraulic fracturing ) in park land, deeming it "unnecessary and redundant" according to a spokesperson. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party called the repeal a "payoff" to oil and gas interests which donated a million dollars to Corbett's campaign. [22] According to Corbett, "had they not given me a dime, I would still be in this position, saying we need to grow jobs in Pennsylvania". [23]
On February 14, 2012, Corbett signed The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950). [24] The law changes the zoning laws applicable to Marcellus Shale well drilling , which is more commonly known as hydraulic fracturing. Some of its provisions are that all municipalities must allow Marcellus Shale well drilling in all zoning districts, including residential and municipalities may not limit hours of operation. Water and wastewater pits must also be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. Compressor stations must be allowed in industrial and agricultural zoning districts and towns may not limit hours of operation. Gas processing plants are allowed in industrial zoning districts and hours of operation cannot be limited. Gas pipelines must be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. [24] The law helps gain access to land for new pipelines, [25] one of which will transport natural gas from Pennsylvania to export terminals in Maryland, [26] [27] [28] [29] from which it will be shipped to Europe and Asia. [30] [31] Others contend that the pipeline's purpose is to transport the gas to Maryland and D.C. markets. [32] [26] There are also concerns that exporting natural gas will result in more jobs going overseas, leading to increased unemployment in Pennsylvania and other states as gas prices rise globally. [33]
The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950) also contains a provision that allows doctors in Pennsylvania access to the list of chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluid in emergency situations only, but forbids them from discussing this information with their patients. [34] The information can only be used for emergency medical treatment, and the doctor must immediately verbally agree to keep the information confidential and later sign a document to that effect. [35] The bill also reduces the legal responsibility of vendors, service providers, and operators regarding the identity and impact of contents of the hydraulic fracturing fluid they use. [35]
[ edit ] Personal life
Corbett is married; he and his wife Susan have two children, Tom and Katherine. Tom is an interactive gaming producer and Katherine is a prosecutor in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office. [36]
