Obama and Janet Napolitano appointed Arif Alikhan, a devout Muslim, as Assistant Secretary for Policy Development. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano swore-in Kareem Shora, a devout Muslim, who was born in Damascus, Syria, as ADC National Execu...tive Director as a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC).
NOTE: Has anyone ever heard a new government official being identified as a 'devout Catholic," a "devout Jew" or a "devout Protestant"...?
Just wondering.
Devout Muslims being appointed to critical Homeland Security positions? Doesn't this make you feel safer already?? That should make our home land much safer, huh!?

Jonelle Kovtun Barbati It is because he is a Muslim that his religion is being made an issue of, they added the devout for effect.  His religion should not be an issue. We had two wars in Europe, with devout Catholics and devout Protestants and they hold office the this country.
