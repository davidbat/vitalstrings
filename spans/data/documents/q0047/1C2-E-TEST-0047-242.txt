About the Tom Corbett Series
About the Tom Corbett Series
About the Author:  The name Carey Rockwell was a pseudonym used by    Grosset & Dunlap.  It is unknown who wrote the books, or even if there was only one writer.  It is interesting to note, however, that while much of the content was original, a number of scenes and plot points were taken from the television    series of the same name.
Willy Ley, Technical Adviser :  An important    German rocket scientist and advocate of space travel, he worked on the television series as well, and his name on the    books lent an air of credibility to the series.
Louis Glanzman, Illustrator :  Illustrations were    numerous in this series, with more than 20 separate drawings per volume.  There were always several different small 1" x    3½" pictures alternating at the end of chapters, a few partial and full page illustrations, and even some wide ones that    spanned two pages with room for text above or below.  These were all the work of Louis S. Glanzman, a famous    commercial illustrator and artist.
