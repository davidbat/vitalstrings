Chambersburg, Pa. —
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett spelled his administration’s top priority Wednesday with a four-letter word: J-O-B-S.
“We have to live within our means as a government,” he said during a luncheon at the Orchards Restaurant in Chambersburg. “We have to change the culture of how we spend or how we don’t spend. We have to live within that budget, and we hadn’t been doing that until last year. People keep telling me, ‘raise taxes.’ That’s not how you do it. What you do is you make businesses grow, what you do is you create jobs.”
He added people are moving to Pennsylvania from Maryland and other states because of our low tax rate.
The governor spoke to an audience of nearly 250 Franklin County business leaders and officials during the luncheon, which was hosted by state Sen. Richard Alloway II, a Republican who serves Franklin County, the Franklin County Area Development Corp., and the Waynesboro, Greencastle, Chambersburg, Tuscarora and Shippensburg chambers of commerce. Proceeds from Wednesday’s luncheon were donated to the Franklin County 9/11 Memorial at Letterkenny Army Depot.
Corbett touched on the upcoming budget, stressing that he doesn’t “like to be the guy that says, ‘We can’t spend money there.’” He said there is a “Pac-Man” eating away at the state budget that needs to be addressed sooner than later — pensions.
“Pensions account for $1.6 billion out of a $27 billion budget,” he said. “In four years, the contributions to pensions will be over $4 billion.”

Corbett visited Germany and France last month to discuss business opportunities with various delegates overseas. He said foreign companies are interested in moving to the United States, particularly to areas in Franklin and Adams counties.
“With our wind, solar and water power, we’re the second largest energy force in the world,” Corbett said. “When companies want to invest in the U.S., we have good workers, cheap cost of energy and we are truly the Keystone State. Why wouldn’t you come to Pennsylvania? Companies in Europe are looking specifically at Franklin County because of its proximity to Washington, because of its beauty, because of its highways.”
Corbett also said there needs to be a change in the White House in the upcoming election because the current administration is “trying to put Pennsylvania out of business” with new environmental regulations that have forced five coal-fueled power plants to close recently. He said coal and natural gas are part of Pennsylvania’s energy portfolio and are “equal to Pennsylvania, to our jobs.”

Corbett stressed taxing the Marcellus Shale industry for natural gas drilling, or raising taxes for any entity is not the answer to the state’s budget woes. He added controlling taxes and spending, and forcing the Legislature to live within its means are the answers for a bright future.
“I have great expectations for Pennsylvania,” he said. “It just doesn’t happen overnight. It’s going to take a while.”
Reactions
Mike Ross, president of the FCADC, said Corbett confirmed Wednesday that he is very “pro-business.”
“I think many of his policies have been designed to make Pennsylvania more business-friendly,” he said. “I think he clearly recognizes the impact of Marcellus Shale on the state, and how important it can be. I also think he’s a proponent of Franklin County and is actively promoting Franklin County.”
Ross said the FCADC is working on a number of potential projects that could significantly impact the county. The projects are still in various stages of discussion, but Ross is optimistic there could be major announcements within the next 30 to 45 days.
“Franklin County is a good place to be right now,” he added.
Ken Jones of Citizens for Responsible Government said he thinks Corbett’s direction on the Marcellus Shale industry is correct.
“The state, as well as the nation, could certainly use the energy,” he said. “But, he’s going to have a fight on his hands with the environmentalists.”
Larry Funk, vice president of CRG and a Tuscarora School Board member, said certain legislators have to focus more on the public’s interest, and less on their personal interests.
“The country’s in bad shape because we have Republicans who overly support business, and we have too many Democrats eager to hand out money to people who didn’t earn it,” he said. “We should be taxing Marcellus Shale, privatizing liquor and establishing a voucher system for the schools. Our biggest problem is we have too many politicians on the left and right too interested in supporting private interests, not public interests.”
James Wyrick of CRG said in order to bring more businesses to the state, especially foreign businesses, Pennsylvania must have Right to Work laws in place, which are currently pending legislation.
“If Pennsylvania is going to have a realistic chance of bringing foreign business to the state, they have to have Right to Work laws and control on the labor laws,” he added.
Allen Piper, president of CRG, said Corbett gave an excellent presentation. He said he feels the state really needs property tax relief by raising state sales taxes to 7 percent, slightly increasing the real estate transfer tax and increasing a portion of gaming in the state.
Alloway said he believes Franklin County’s future is very bright.
“We have a lot of business growth opportunities,” he said.
