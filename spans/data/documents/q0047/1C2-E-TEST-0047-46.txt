With his state reeling over charges of child sexual abuse against a former assistant football coach at Penn State and allegations of a coverup by two top university officials , Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) expressed confidence Sunday that state lawmakers would soon pass legislation requiring employees and other individuals to report allegations of such abuse directly to law enforcement officials, rather than merely pass them along to superiors at an institution.
Corbett’s statement came in a response to a question on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about whether ousted Penn State head coach Joe Paterno had done enough after being told in 2002 by graduate coaching assistant Mike McQueary that he had allegedly observed Paterno’s former defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky , rape a young boy in a Penn State shower. According to a state report that accompanied the indictment of Sandusky and two university administrators, Paterno communicated McQueary’s story to a superior in the Penn State athletic department but took no further action. Sandusky has been charged with molesting at least eight boys in a 15-year span, beginning in 1994. Sandusky has denied the charges.
