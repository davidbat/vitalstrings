Tom Corbett,Space Cadet was          based on characters in Robert Heinlein's juvenile novel SPACE CADET published in 1948. However, recent material has indicated that SF author          Joseph Greene had contributed to the early development of the Tom Corbett          character. Tom's career covered every media outlet of the 1950's, except          the movies. There were eight hardback books published by Grosset and Dunlap          from 1952 to 1956, fourteen comics published by Dell & Prize comics from          1952 to 1955, a daily and Sunday newspaper strip written by Paul S. Newman          and drawn by Ray Bailey from September 1951 to September 1953 , a six          month run of radio shows in 1952 and the TV series from Oct 1950 to 1956.
The TV series began on CBS (October          2, 1950 - December 29, 1950 ), then moved to ABC from January 1, 1951          to September 26, 1952. While on ABC, there were repeats on NBC (as a summer          replacement for Victor Borge) from July 1951 to September 1951 . Then,          after Kelloggs canceled the series, it returned on alternate Saturdays          for one season on the DuMont network from August 29, 1953 to May 22, 1954.          The last season, for Kraft, ran on NBC from December 11, 1954 to June          25, 1955. The show was broadcast in a Monday, Wed and Friday format with          30 minute shows on Saturday.
