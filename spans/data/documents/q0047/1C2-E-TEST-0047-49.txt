FOR:
PA GOP: Governor Corbett's Fiscally Responsible Budget Puts Pennsylvania Back On Track
Governor Corbett's New Day to Yield Years of Prosperity
Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Rob Gleason issued the following statement regarding Governor Tom Corbett's budget address:
"Governor Tom Corbett has done exactly what the voters of Pennsylvania sent him to Harrisburg to do: reduce the size and cost of government and put Pennsylvania's finances back on the right track," Chairman Gleason said. "Governor Corbett's budget puts forward real solutions to eliminate government waste and jumpstart Pennsylvania's economy, while delivering on his promise to hold the line on taxes.
"This is truly a victory for Pennsylvania taxpayers. Governor Corbett's budget includes no new taxes, 'walking around money' (WAM's) or earmarks. Governor Corbett's budget will get Pennsylvanians back to work by reshaping economic development with job-friendly programs like PA First and Partners for Regional Economic Performance.  The Governor's budget also tackles reforms in education and welfare spending to ensure that Pennsylvania taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and effectively to help our children and most needy citizens.
"I join citizens throughout the Commonwealth who are enthusiastically supporting Governor Corbett and applaud his efforts in making the necessary decisions to chart a new course for Pennsylvania. Taxpayers deserve leaders that have the courage to make tough decisions to secure our Commonwealth's future and Governor Corbett continues to display tremendous leadership."
AGAINST:   
Leach: Governor’s proposed budget plan is not the answer
State Sen. Daylin Leach (D-Delaware/Montgomery) today released a statement about Gov. Corbett’s proposed budget plan for the 2011-2012 fiscal year. Leach said:
"I am extremely disheartened by Gov. Corbett's proposed budget. Yes, Pennsylvania is battling a financial hardship, but making drastic cuts to essential services like basic education and health care while providing tax breaks to corporations and refusing additional revenue sources is not the answer.
When families face hard times, they look for additional ways to increase their incomes and reduce spending where they can. They don't deny their family members access to care and services they need, which is essentially what our governor is proposing for Pennsylvanians. Gov. Corbett said today that we need to balance the scales in order to build a better Commonwealth, but his proposed budget tips the scales in the favor of big business. I pledge to do all that I can to protect the interests of all Pennsylvanians and I aim to work with my fellow lawmakers to hash out a better plan that provides better benefits to all."
The proposed $27.3 billion budget would set basic education funding levels back to those of 2008-09, cutting public school education spending by 8.8 percent and funding for higher education by more than 50 percent. The plan would also eliminate 1,500 state jobs, employees at state hospitals accounting for a third of that number. Medicaid benefits, including dental and pharmaceutical services, would also be reduced under the plan.
Leach added that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees will begin holding public budget hearings next week, running through the end of the month. Under state law, the General Assembly must approve a budget plan by midnight on June 30.
