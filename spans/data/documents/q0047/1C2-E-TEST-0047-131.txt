"I believe the Office of Attorney General did everything they could, moved this case along as quickly as we could with the resources available," said Governor Tom Corbett.
Governor Tom Corbett was on the defensive about his involvement in the investigation of the Penn State sex abuse scandal.  The now governor headed the Attorney General's office back in 2008 when the latest alleged victim, defined as Victim Number 1 in the grand jury presentment, came forward to authorities.
"I have done child predator cases, we move them as quickly as we possibly can," Governor Corbett said.
The Governor is facing questions about the speed of the Jerry Sandusky investigation.  Sandusky is charged with molesting 8 boys over a 15-year period.  Many people fear there will be more victims, dating as far back as the 1970's.  Even with the mounting charges, some question why it took nearly three years and another Attorney General to bring the grand jury's finding to a head.
"There isn't any Governor in recent memory, to me, in this state that has done more to protect children than me so if you think I delayed it for any reasons, you're wrong," Corbett said emphatically.
Today was supposed to be the preliminary hearing for Tim Curley and Gary Schultz , the former Athletic Director and former Vice-President of Business and Finance.  They are both charged with perjury for trying to cover up the allegations of abuse.  That hearing, set for a Harrisburg courtroom was continued until December 6.
The investigation was turned over to the AG's office in 2008 by ex-Centre County District Attorney Michael Madeira.  Madeira was afraid of a conflict of interest if he continued the investigation.  His wife's brother is actually one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children.
