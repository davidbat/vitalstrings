Revive adultBasic health insurance plan, Corbett urged
By Tim Darragh, Of The Morning Call | March 4, 2012
Just about a year ago, Debbie Macquirk of Kunkletown saw things go from bad to worse for her son, Shawn.      He lost his job when the electrician he worked for went bankrupt. His one lifeline at the time was adultBasic, a low-cost health insurance plan started under former Gov. Tom Ridge and funded with money from the state's Tobacco Settlement Act and contributions from Pennsylvania's four "Blues," the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies.      Then that went away last year when the funding agreement with the Blues expired.

State House to begin budget debate
By John L. Micek, Call Harrisburg Bureau | June 27, 2012
— The state House is expected to begin debate Thursday on a $27.7 billion, no-tax-hike budget that spares Pennsylvania's state colleges and universities the deep cuts sought by Gov. Tom Corbett and provides public schools and libraries the same amount of taxpayer support they now receive.      But a program that provides cash assistance to nearly 70,000 of the state's neediest residents would come to an end.      Republican legislative leaders and the Corbett administration spent much of Wednesday engaging in shuttle diplomacy to reach agreement on a host of issues that have been pulled into the spending plan's orbit.

Tom Corbett on Penn State mess

HARRISBURG  -  Gov. Tom Corbett on Wednesday said he was "personally disappointed in the lack of action" by university officials. "And I had to contain that for the last two years. "       Corbett, a former state attorney general, said his office first began investigating accusations against Sandusky in 2009, after receiving a referral from the Centre County District Attorney's Office. Because of his investigatory role, he declined to comment on many of the specifics in the case. "I am aware of many of the details in the investigation that I cannot go into," he said.

Corbett wants human services funding rolled into block grants
By John L. Micek, Call Harrisburg Bureau | June 26, 2012
— Gov. Tom Corbett on Monday pressed the case for an overhaul of the way the state pays for county-run human services programs, arguing it will give local governments more flexibility at a time of increased demand and shrinking state dollars.      "The people in the local communities know their needs better than we in Harrisburg do," Corbett said at a Capitol news conference, where he was joined by county commissioners from across the state.      The GOP administration has proposed taking seven existing human services programs and rolling them into a single block-grant program.

Corbett, legislators reach 'framework' for state budget
By John L. Micek, Call Harrisburg Bureau | June 20, 2012
HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Corbett and legislative Republicans said Wednesday they've built a "framework" for a $27.656 billion state budget for 2012-13 that adds money to some state programs that had originally been targeted for cuts.       The spending plan's bottom line is a $500 million increase from the $27.14 billion budget that Corbett presented to lawmakers in February.       The increase was partly fueled by what are expected to be healthy June tax collections. It also roughly matches the bottom line of an amended version of the spending plan approved by the Senate in the spring.

Tom Corbett, defender of the universe?
-- John Micek | March 28, 2010
So there may be some Capitol Ideas readers who are old enough to remember the great works of serial juvenile fiction from bygone years.        We're talking "The Hardy Boys," "Nancy Drew," and our personal favorite, "Alfred Hitchcock's Three Investigators."        Basically, it's any book series that featured plucky kids, horribly convoluted mysteries and scenes that featured them driving over rural lanes in their roadsters. Parents, if they were involved at all, were enlightened and tolerant of their offspring's madcap adventures showing up local law enforcement.

If Charles Dickens lived in Pennsylvania …

I actually had ideas for two columns last week about Gov. Tom Corbett. What can I say? He's inspiring. One of them ran Saturday. Here's the other:       Gov. Tom Corbett spooned out a bit of gruel. A single candle by his chair provided the only light in the gloomy room.       Suddenly, there was the sound of clanking on the stairs. Alarmed, Corbett squinted through his spectacles at the door.       It was flung open with a crash — and standing there was a portly, ghostly visage draped in chains.

I was reading an article about a college Republican meeting in Philadelphia, and I decided to learn more about Tom Corbett's plan for the future of Pennsylvania. I am in college and the issues that are important to me differ from those in the previous generation. I am concerned that when I graduate I will not be able to find employment in my field and quite frankly, employment in general. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and want to stay here, but I may have to move to another state to find a job.

HARRISBURG -- Six months into his administration, Gov. Tom Corbett is bleeding support among women, with more than four in 10 saying they disapprove of the job the Republican is doing, a new poll shows.       Corbett's proposed cuts to public and higher education are driving the dissatisfaction among female voters in the new Quinnipiac University survey, with 43 percent saying they disapprove of his job performance compared to 30 percent who say they approve.       The freshman governor's $27.3 billion proposal called for 50 percent cuts to higher education and deep reductions in spending for public education.
