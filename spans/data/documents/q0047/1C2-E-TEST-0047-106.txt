The Tom Corbett universe partook of pseudo-science , not equal to the standards of accuracy set by John W. Campbell in the pages of Astounding . And yet, by the standards of the day, it was much more accurate than most media science fiction . Mars was a desert, Venus a jungle, and the asteroids a haunt of space pirates, but at least planets circled suns and there was no air in space. Contrast this with The Twilight Zone , years later, where people could live on asteroids wearing ordinary clothes, or Lost in Space , years after that, where a spaceship could be passing "Jupiter and Andromeda" at the same time. Before Star Trek , Tom Corbett — Space Cadet was the most scientifically accurate series on television, in part due to official science advisor Willy Ley , and later due to Frankie Thomas . Thomas read up on science and everyone on the set turned to him for advice on matters scientific.
 
Joseph Lawrence Greene of Grosset & Dunlap developed Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, inspired by the Robert A. Heinlein novel Space Cadet (1948) but based also on his own prior work: Greene had originally submitted a radio script for "Tom Ranger" and the "Space Cadets" on January 16 , 1946 , but it remained unperformed when Heinlein's novel was published. Greene then reworked his radio script into a script for a daily newspaper adventure strip, which was never produced.
