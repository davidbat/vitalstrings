Here’s a reason to dislike Tom Corbett: He’s a Pittsburgh Penguins fan
By Tim Ronaldson
"I love the Penguins. Screw all the voters in Philly." (or something like that)
Add Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett to the list of people we here in Philadelphia don’t like.
Not because of his Republican affiliation. Or his budget practices. Or his religious beliefs.
If Philadelphians didn’t already dislike their head of state, they certainly will now, after he proclaimed in a radio interview that…wait for it…he’s a fan of the Pittsburgh Penguins!
(That sound you hear is Corbett’s re-election votes from the greater Philadelphia region flushing down the toilet.)
Corbett took his misguided sports mind onto the Bubba Show on 100.7 Star this morning and, when prompted, said he is rooting for the Pittsburgh Penguins to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers in their playoff matchup.
“When I moved to Pittsburgh as a little boy, 6 years old, I started rooting for the Pittsburgh Hornets, before the Penguins were in existence and I’ve been rooting for the Penguins ever since and you don’t change your decisions,” he said on the show.
The Flyers take on the Penguins in Game 5 tonight in Pittsburgh at 7:30 pm. If the Flyers win, the series is over and the Penguins will be eliminated from the playoffs. If the Penguins win, the two teams will travel back to Philly to play Game 6 on Sunday, at a time to be determined.

When I first joined Elauwit, I figured I’d be here for two years, tops, before advancing my career in journalism somewhere else. That was 2005. Great job or lack of motivation? You decide. |  View all posts by Tim Ronaldson →
