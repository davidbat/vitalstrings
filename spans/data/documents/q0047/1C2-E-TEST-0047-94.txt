A Bucks County man who shot three police officers in 2005, killing one, will be put to death this fall.
Gov. Tom Corbett today signed the execution warrant for Robert Anthony Flor, 44, of Bedminster Township, Pa.
While in police custody Sept. 29, 2005, in Bucks County on suspicion of drunken driving, Flor grabbed an officer's weapon and started shooting. He wounded two officers and killed Newtown Borough officer Brian Gregg, 46.
He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in October 2006 and was sentenced to death the next month, according to the governor's office. He is now at the State Correctional Institution at Greene. The lethal injection is scheduled for Sept. 29.
