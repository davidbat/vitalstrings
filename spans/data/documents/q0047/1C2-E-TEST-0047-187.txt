From the editor: An open letter to Gov. Tom Corbett
Update, 11:35 a.m. May 16: This article was revised because the original version that appeared in the May 15 issue of Business Weekly suggested Gov. Corbett visited Tuesday night. His visit and the Greater Reading Chamber’s annual dinner are scheduled for next Monday night.
An open letter to Gov. Tom Corbett
Gov. Corbett, we thank you for coming to the Greater Reading Chamber’s annual dinner. You will meet some of the most successful businesses in Berks County in the past few years. Their successes, like those of businesses in every corner of the Commonwealth, signal that Pennsylvania’s economy is coming back.
We are interested to hear what you have to say, but we also hope that you have come ready to listen. Because the business leaders in this community have some strong opinions about what they would like to see happen in Harrisburg in the months and years ahead.
They have expressed frustration at the slow pace of implementing a solution to transportation funding. They have been puzzled by your position on a reasonable Marcellus shale tax. They are encouraged by efforts to eliminate property taxes.
All of those are secondary, though, compared to concern over education. Time and again, we have heard the same refrain. Our work force doesn’t have all the skills needed to fill good-paying jobs. Baby boomers will retire soon; who will take their place?
During the budget process, please keep this concern at the front of your thoughts. More cuts to public education would worsen the financial plight of districts across the state. More cuts to higher education would further erode the state’s ability to produce a well-trained work force.
Please find a way to restore some measure of fiscal wisdom to education funding this year.
And enjoy your visit.
