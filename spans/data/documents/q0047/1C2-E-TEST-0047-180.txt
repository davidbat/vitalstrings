This series was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's book, Space Cadet.
These seven books follow three cadets at the Space Academy as they train and become members of the elite Solar Guard. By the standards of the day (1950's), the writing was much more accurate than most science fiction: Mars was a desert, Venus a jungle(!), and the asteroids a haunt of space pirates, but at least planets orbited stars and there was no air in space. Also, space travel could be very deadly. Willy Ley was technical advisor to the author which is why these stories stand the the test of time much better than some of the other sci-fi of the 50's.
It's written in a very engaging style that quickly sucks you into their daring adventures. It was also a TV series and comic series in the 50's, but these books hold up much better and have quite a bit more action and character development.
Tom Corbett, Astro, and Roger Manning are the main characters. They start out as unit mates in the academy, but through their many adventures, they come to rely on each other like brothers.
Follow them as they fight for the Mercuryball championship, save the lives of passengers on a radioactive rocket stranded in space and tag along as  the trio crash land on a deserted planet and fight for their lives against space pirates. There's also plenty of trips to Mars and Venus
Spaceman's luck to you!
