DVD!  Tom Corbett Space Cadet Gold Edition, Vol. 1.  Contained on this high quality, shrink wrapped  DVD are 4 half hour Tom Corbett Space Cadet shows that have not been seen in almost 50 years. The episodes on this DVD were made directly from the original kinescopes (transferred to DV Cam to DVD).  They are ordered as follows: episode 2/19/55 (The Grapes of Ganymead) involves a crashed rocket on Ganymede which contaminates grapes being shipped throughout the solar system, episode 7/21/51 (Trial in Space) is believed to be a composite of some 15 minute shows because it features Roger Manning (Jan Merlin) after he is known to have left the series and because it involves an introduction and heavy narration from Tom Corbett (Frankie Thomas), episode 5/28/55 (The Stowaway) is about a young girl stowaway who causes havoc on the Polaris, and episode 6/18/55 (Comet of Danger) features a female photographer who causes trouble when she encourages the crew to get too close to a speeding comet. Original commercials (Kraft Caramels and Kellogg's Raisin Bran) and promos (Space Cadet Membership Kit) included. The cast includes: Frankie Thomas, Jan Merlin, Al Markin and Jack Grimes.
