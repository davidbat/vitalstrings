THE TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET UNIVERSE
by Ed Pippin
TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET website: Introduction, Facts and History
During the first part, of the 5th decade, of the 20th        century, a strange condition overcame the children of the North American        United States. Strange domed shaped objects were wrapped around their        heads and a strange language developed, with such phrases as ..."Blast off        you Space rat!... You're full of space gas!!... Cool your jets!!!...        and...watch out for that Martian sand crawler!!!!!" Was this a strange        illness that gripped the children or a prelude to an invasion? In a way it        was both and neither. A new necessity had entered millions of American        homes-- TELEVISION. This new sensation ushered in hero's from space who        were the protectors of the universe, knights in shining Dura-steel with        smoking atomic blasters, and would be replacing the old standby of the        early television... the Western.

  Tom Corbett-Space Cadet - Vol. 2
Among the many space hero's of the early 1950's Tom Corbett, Space Cadet        was one of the earliest. Tom was a young man of the 24th century entering        the exciting world of Space Academy to experience the thrill of the final        frontier! This popular TV hero was inspired by Robert Heinlein's excellent        juvenile science fiction novel SPACE CADET, published in early 1948. SPACE        CADET was the second of a series of 12 juvenile novels published by        Scribner's, beginning in 1947 with ROCKETSHIP GALILEO and ending in 1958        with HAVE SPACE SUIT WILL TRAVEL.
The Library Journal declared ..." {SPACE CADET} .. A definite contribution        to books on rocketry and outer space. Bound to stand the hard usage." An        excellent prediction since the statement was made in September 1948 and        the book has been reprinted many times in hardback, trade, library        editions and paperback. In fact all of Robert Heinlein's Scribner Science        Fiction Juveniles have been and still are in print, published by such        companies as Dell, Ace and Ballantine. The first U.S. paperback        publication of SPACE CADET was issued by Ace in 1971 followed by        Ballantine' Del Rey series in 1978.
The roots of Tom Corbett in SPACE CADET was confirmed by the Heinlein's in        1977 and by other written sources since that time. When a comparison of        the Tom Corbett series published by Grosset & Dunlap (now out of print)        and Mr. Heinlein's SPACE CADET, the similarities become apparent.
A reoccurring theme in Mr. Heinlein's juveniles deal with young people        coming of age and the problems they face in growing up. In SPACE CADET,        Tom Corbett's counter part is Matt Dodson, Roger Manning is partially        taken from Girard Burke and Astro, the Venus Colonial, in Tom Corbett is        represented by Oscar, a colonial from Venus in SPACE CADET.

  Space Cadet
SPACE CADET follows Matt Dodson and his friends from the beginning of        their training at the Space Academy into an adventure on Venus where some        of the Academy's training and the traditions of the patrol are applied. Of        course the story is rich in background and details as only Robert Heinlein        can provide. If you are familiar with Mr. Heinlein's stories written within        his Future History concept, you may notice some of the information about        the Patrol as it is causally dropped throughout SC. For example, a        reference to Lt Dahlquist's sacrifice "..in the tradition of the        Patrol..as seen in the Academy's exhibit hall", is a direct reference to a        future History story published one year after SPACE CADET in the December        1949 American Legion Magazine. The short story was entitled "Rebellion on        the Moon", later renamed "The Long Watch" and collected in several        anthologies.
Mr. Heinlein was one of the first to use a Future History series as a        backdrop for other stories as yet unwritten at the time. The series        provided many stories independent of one another but based on a common        technological and sociological outline of history. All of the Future        History stories from the late 1930's to 1967 were published in THE PAST        THROUGH TOMORROW. Included in the collection is a chart outlining the        major events and stories within the series. The juveniles are not included        per se, but examples of some of the future history background appear in        the juvenile works as well as some of the juvenile characters cropping up        in later non-juvenile stories.
Characters in Tom Corbett were transplanted from SPACE CADET with certain        changes. Tom, who is from New Chicago, is modeled after Matt Dodson. Matt        is another mid-westerner from Des Moines, Iowa, easy going, hard working and        eager to learn. Astro is a combination of Oscar Jensen, a younger Venus        colonist and a Texan, Bill Jarman. Roger Manning is something else in        SPACE CADET. Roger's caustic attitude is taken from Girard Burke,        affectionately known as "stinky". Burke, a son of a rich spaceship        builder, later resigns from the Academy calling the cadets a bunch of        do-gooders, only to get into trouble on Venus where the cadets have to        save his hide. Burke was too good to lose and was incorporated into Roger        with some redeemable refinements, and a bit of the girl chaser taken from        Bill Jarman. The Commander of the Space Academy in Tom Corbett is the same        as the Commodore in SPACE CADET... commander Arkwright, except in SPACE        CADET Arkwright is Blind. The military ranking in SPACE CADET, as noted        from a fellow fan Hank Heyman, were based on Navy ranks. Arkwright        outranks Capt Strong. That's why he was a commodore, which is a wartime        rank below Rear Admiral but above Navy Captain. The rank of Commander is        below Captain. It is only normal to have Navy ranks in SPACE CADET since        Mr. Heinlein is a graduate of the Naval Academy. In the Tom Corbett series        Commander is a loose term and in a sense means commander over all of the        academy and ranks.
The basic concept of the academy and the Solar Guard of Tom Corbett is the        same as the Guard and the Patrol of SPACE CADET. Both were charged with        the protection of the total Solar Alliance in Tom Corbett. This situation        leads to problems with Matt's parents and is part of his "coming of age".        The Academy in SPACE CADET is located in Colorado at Santa Barbara Field, Near the crater that WAS Denver. The Academy in Tom Corbett is located        somewhere in the mid part of the North American Commonwealth, possibly the        Colorado area.
Many of the same training problems mentioned in the Tom Corbett series are        presented first in SPACE CADET. The bumps used in testing recruits ability        to withstand high acceleration is taken directly from SPACE CADET. A car        is sent down a steep ravine and back up in a series of hills causing the        occupants to experience a high number of G forces alternated with        weightlessness. In Tom Corbett the bumps are mentioned in the first issue        of the Tom Corbett Comic (Dell 4-Color #378). The light test mentioned in        SPACE CADET is pictured in the daily Tom Corbett strip dated 9/18/51. The        cadet is strapped into a chair and told to keep a ball of light centered        on a wall in front of him. Sounds easy until the chair starts to convulse        and the room is filled with smoke and loud explosions.
The first spaceship to leave earth and return with a crew crashed and        killed all on board in both SPACE CADET and Tom Corbett. In SPACE CADET it        was the KILROY WAS HERE landing in 1955 and in Tom Corbett is was either        the TX-1 Pioneer in the daily newspaper strip or the Solar Queen in STAND        BY FOR MARS from the Grosset &n Dunlap TC series. Both Tom Corbett stories        have the ships crash landing on the 7th of March 2025. The Solar Queen        plays an important part in the Tom Corbett series and explains a problem        that arises within the unit.
A major difference with the Tom Corbett series is noted in the Grosset and        Dunlap books where the Commander of Space Academy is Commander Walters.        Arkwright is the head of the Academy in all other references in Tom Corbett.
Some of the reoccurring themes such as the Moon of Tara found in Tom        Corbett may have been influenced by other stories written by Mr. Heinlein.        In Mr. Heinlein's story MISFIT, published in November 1939, we see the        same problem of converting a body in space into a rocket. Once converted        the asteroid would be brought into a different orbit. This was done in the        Tom Corbett radio series (DANGER IN DEEP SPACE) and in the Grosset and        Dunlap series (also titled DANGER IN DEEP SPACE).
Another major difference between SPACE CADET and TC is the absence of        intelligent life on Venus. In Tom Corbett, only prehistoric monsters are        seen, in SPACE CADET Mr. Heinlein creates a most interesting and amusing        amphibian population. Many of Mr. Heinlein's aliens prove to be some of        the most interesting characters in science fiction literature and may have        been an interesting backdrop in TC.
Thanks to Mr. Heinlein's contribution to the Tom Corbett universe for        which there would be no adventures aboard the Polaris and one of the great        1950's heroes would not have been seen.
