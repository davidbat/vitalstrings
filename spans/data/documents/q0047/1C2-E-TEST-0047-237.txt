Video: Davis on real Paterno
Corbett says he and his wife were saddened to learn of Paterno's death Sunday.
Corbett cited Paterno's record of having won more football games than any other major college coach and also his generosity to Penn State ''as an institution and to his players.''
He says Paterno, as both a man and a coach, met adversity ''with grace and forbearance.''
Corbett says, ''His place in our state's history is secure.''
