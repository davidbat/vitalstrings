INTRODUCTION
The SOLAR GUARD ACADEMY site has it's roots in the mid 1960's when I had to pack my collection          for storage and head for college. Found among the treasures, saved since          pre-teen years, were several Grosset & Dunlap TOM CORBETT books. Rereading          the adventures of Tom, Roger and Astro was enjoyable and stimulated memories          of the early TV shows. What started as a fond memory developed into a          30+ year research hobby. As I found other fans of Tom, Commander Corry,          Rocky and the space heroes of the early 1950's, a reoccurring statement          of "I thought I was the only one interested in Tom Corbett and the          1950's Space Heroes!!! was repeated many times. Even in 1997 I receive          e-mail with the same exclamation of wonder!!
What is the attraction of shows over          40 years old and dated by today’s standards? The treatment of the Space          Characters of the 1950's was, at best, passed off as "Juvenile". Most          articles or books written have given the genre a short salute and dismissed          them as just children’s shows. Granted this was the target audience and          judging from the magazine articles of the 1950's, the shows hit their          mark. However, there was magic in the shows.
People like George Gould, who pioneered LIVE TV special effects, took us into space . Many of the rocket          visionaries of that time period acted as science advisors. Willy Ley on          the Tom Corbett Show and Dr Richardson who worked on the Capt Video show          were on hand to bend young minds around the science of space flight. The          time period was alive with space travel. Future NASA technicians may have          been influenced by the adventures conducted in the name of interplanetary          peace and justice. Frankie Thomas Jr., Jan Merlin and Al Markim, who portrayed          the famous Polaris unit of Tom Corbett, were craftsmen and brought the          characters to life. The adventures were about coming of age ... in an          age of marvels. These shows were laying a foundation for future generations          whose eyes and hearts were looking SPACE Just children’s shows? You decide.
We will examine the history, the          drive , the motivation of the shows and strife to bring back that sense          of wonder we all had when we

This page will introduce you to Tom        Corbett, Space Cadet. The show’s roots, the reviews, the history of the        making of the show and just about anything that would shed light on how        the show worked. So pull up a piece of the Solar Guard's Spaceship bulkhead        and get acquainted with Tom, Roger and Astro ... Space Cadets.
THE TOM CORBETT UNIVERSE
The Tom Corbett Universe, as related          in this website, is complied from the radio shows, Grosset & Dunlap books,          daily and Sunday comic strips and the Dell Comics. However, a lot of the          plot and story lines are inspired by the TV show and new material may          be added to this account of the Tom Corbett Universe through a number          of fans who are researching the early shows . The TC Universe page reflects          the TC universe as related in the written media of the 1950's.
JOSEPH        L. GREENE'S CONTRIBUTION TO TOM CORBETT
Joseph L. Greene was a managing editor for Grosset and Dunlap in the 1950's        and 60's with a varied writing career which included science fiction, mystery,        pulp fiction, comics, radio and television scripts of the 1930's, 1940's        and 1950's. He was the author of the Dig Allen Space Explorer series        (1959), where three young men form a unit to explore space together. Sound        familiar? At first glance it would seem this was a copy of the Tom Corbett        series. However, new research indicates a different story. Joseph Greene        was a contributor in the development of the Tom Corbett show.
The following series of pages "From          Tom Ranger to Tom Corbett" will help clear up some misunderstandings          I have had over the years and will explore how a character such as Tom          Corbett can be development from many sources. Click here to begin "The Rest of the Story"

ROBERT HEINLEIN'S INFLUENCE Note: Updated to reflect        new information 6/99
The Tom Corbett universe as seen in the Grosset & Dunlap series books was developed from Robert Heinlein's SPACE CADET. Some of the Tom Corbett        character's are a direct crossover from the novel while others are a hybrid        of several different characters found in SPACE CADET. The background and        time period for Tom's adventures are comparable to SPACE CADET and translate        the feeling of a young man's coming of age. This page draws the parallels between Mr. Heinlein's novel and the 1950's space phenomenon        known as Tom Corbett.
THE          SPACE RECORD:
Historical records and files in the          development of the shows are presented on this page. Did you know before          Tom Corbett there was Tom Ranger? What did reviews of the show say about          the cadets and their travels in space? Geoffrey Tolle has researched the          development of Tom Corbett and has provided us with some excellent information          on the early years. Also located on the SPACE RECORD page is a checklist          of magazine articles and books with information about the 1950's Science          Fiction TV shows and the Space Program of the 1950's as we knew it from          these shows.
