CNN PRODUCER NOTE
   
GOVERNOR TOM CORBETT AND THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT A FEDERAL WITNESS. IN FACT I REPORTED AN ASSAULT WHICH TOOK PLACE AT HIS FORMER PA AG 'S PHILADELPHIA AIRPORT OFFICE.
 
HIS SECURITY PERSONAL ATACKED AND ASSAULTED ME ON 08.06.10 AND HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE! I FAIL TO BE ASSISTED BY POLICE & PA OFFICIALS.
 
I SUFFERED SOME MINOR INJURIES AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY NINE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR AG CORBETT. WHAT WAS MY CRIME - REPORTING CRIME! NO CHARGES WERE FILED, NOR WAS I ALLOWED TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST SECURITY. TRUST ME,  I'M LUCKY MY LEG WASN'T BROKEN IN HALF!
 
THESE WERE "OLD SCHOOL" STRONG ARM TACTICS USED ON ME RESERVED FOR WITNESS INTIMIDATION.
 
I HAD A 3 NIGHT STAY AT A PENN UNIV. HOSPITAL FOLLOWING THE ATTACK. TOM CORBETT WAS NOT PRESENT AT THAT OFFICE ON 08.06.10 BUT HAS FAILED TO REPLY TO MY MANY REPORTS & EMAILS.
PLEASE RE-TWEET MY CORRUPTION
