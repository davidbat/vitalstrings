Tom Corbett's Education Plan
I ended my last post with “while the 2011 Pennsylvania education budget will offer Tom Corbett a very difficult challenge, true educational reform offers Tom Corbett a very unique opportunity for success”. Tom Corbett is on record that he believes Pennsylvania’s economic growth and job creation depend upon one foundation – “a solid education that prepares students to compete in a global economy.   All Pennsylvania children, regardless of zip code, race, education or socioeconomic status, deserve access to a first class education to help them achieve their full potential. ”
Given the Commonwealth’s current financial circumstances pitting Mr. Corbett’s pledge of no tax increase against a massive projected deficit, and Mr. Corbett’s belief in the importance of education, what can we expect from the new administration?  Over the next couple of posts, I’ll be reviewing some of the publicized highlights of the Corbett Education Plan including:
• Promoting Flexible Funding for Schools and Students by giving greater flexibility to districts and schools and linking funding directly to students and the schools they choose to attend and make that funding transferable with the student.
• Enhancing Educational Opportunities by providing better access to great schools and educational opportunities that prepare our children to succeed in the 21st Century.
• Ensuring Effective Teachers and Leaders by creating a more efficient and fair evaluation system for teachers and school leaders that maximizes growth and education in our schools and among other things links student achievement to compensation.
• Embracing Results-Based Accountability by developing a system of accountability based on student performance which will force schools to place students at the center of our educational system.
• Creating Safe Learning Environments in Pennsylvania schools.
Tom Corbett has pledged to create a 2011-12 operating budget without any tax increases, an admirable promise that will require some very difficult decisions in Harrisburg with consequences cascading down throughout the region, Delaware County, its school districts and eventually to its local communities.  Stay tuned…
