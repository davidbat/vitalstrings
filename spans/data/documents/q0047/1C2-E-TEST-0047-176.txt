Harrisburg, PA - After more than a month of taxpayer-funded TV ads, Tom Corbett received a slight approval boost but voters still disapprove of his budget and his policies. Since June 29, taxpayer-funded TV ads featuring Tom Corbett have run in every major media market. Pennsylvanians disapprove of Corbett's policies 43 to 40 percent, and they disapprove of his handling of the budget 45 to 41 percent.
"Tom Corbett is using taxpayer dollars to boost his image after passing an unpopular and harmful budget that will hurt the middle class," said Mark Nicastre, a spokesman with the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. "Even though Tom Corbett spent taxpayer dollars to run over a month of television ads on broadcast news, Pennsylvanians still disapprove of his policies and his budget. It goes to show that Tom Corbett can't even buy much support - even with lots of taxpayer-funded television ads."
