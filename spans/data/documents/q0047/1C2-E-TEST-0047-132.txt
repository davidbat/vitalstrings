We present a recorded and lightly edited broadcast of Martyâ€™s Tuesday interview with Pennsylvania Gov. TOM CORBETT at The Prince Music Theater. Marty asked the governor about cuts he's made to education and public welfare programs, the impact fee for Marcellus Shale natural gas extraction, taxes, gay marriage and gay adoption, among other topics. All the while, a large protest rally and an even larger contingent of Philadelphia police filled the streets of Center City Philadelphia.
