PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Governor Corbett is taking a hit in public approval as protests escalate against him.
Last month, members of One Pittsburgh protested Corbett’s education cuts by rolling out a human red carpet outside the Duquesne Club.
“Every day in Harrisburg the policies that he makes is like walking on regular people,” said Silas Russell, one of the organizers.
A few weeks later, another protest in Pittsburgh called Corbett “missing in action” when it comes to saving public transit.
“Governor Corporate is representing the interests of corporations and not the interests of people,” Calvin Skinner of One Pittsburgh said.
The unhappiness seems to be taking a toll on Corbett’s approval rating.
In December, his job approval was 47 percent approve to 34 percent disapprove — a 13 point difference.
Now, it’s dead even with 41 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving, according to the Quinnipiac poll of 1,265 voters.
The poll found a large portion of Pennsylvanians think Corbett’s stance on education is wrong.
Only 28 percent approve Corbett’s plan to cut state funds for public universities while 65 percent opposed.
KDKA Political Editor Jon Delano went to Market Square in Downtown to ask why some are not happy with the governor’s job performance.
Said one, “With no disrespect, I don’t like what he did to the schools, he cut the budgets, and he’s giving Marcellus Shale people carte blanche.”
But not everyone is unhappy with Corbett.
“As long as he keeps the taxes down, I’m pretty happy,” another responded.
Corbett is used to this roller coaster in poll numbers.  After he presented his first budget a year ago, his numbers plummeted, but they came back up by the end of the year.
