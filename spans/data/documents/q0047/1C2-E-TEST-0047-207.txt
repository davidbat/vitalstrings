Confirmation
I know an attorney who is very angry that Corbett did not follow up on various alleged wrong-doing by a former County DA in York County.

Corbett didn't do anything about the Koon cover up at the  Milton Hershey School . This preditor went on to rape more then 20  or more kids.  After the Koons arrest in April of 2008 the Milton Hershey School paid off the some of the victims in a tune of 3 milliond dollars.
Several boys complained to regular house parents about Koons in the 1980s, according to police documents. The mother of one of those boys sent a sworn statement to the Derry Township Police Department about a molestation in 1998. An investigation was launched in March 1998, and the school was contacted, according to an internal police report of the investigation.
But the case was dropped in April 1999, with a scant reference in the report to a detective and an official at the school planning to set up a meeting.
WORST THEN PENN STATE

I'm not sure, but I believe the MHS payments to the victims came AFTER the whole thing became public and Koons was finally arrested.  Remember this child molester could still be running free and victimizing kids if a sharp detective from Middletown Borough hadn't caught him.  That detective did not have the advantage of knowing about the MHS incidents.  If the earlier MHS incidents had been properly addressed, at an absolute BARE minimum, his name would have shown up in background checks, so the local police forces and other agencies might have known to keep an eye on him.

That's a good question . When was the payoff  before or after the arrest?

Pennsylvania DA Tom Kearney asks FBI to investigate Corbett security contractor with ties to pedophile sex ring
November 16, 2011 -- District Attorney Tom Kearney, of York County, PA, has asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate longstanding allegations that Corbett Administration security provider Russell Wantz, Jr. has ongoing close ties to a prostitution and pedophile ring centered in and around the York County courthouse.
Sex offender Wantz, of York County, was arrested in a Craigslist sting in December 2007, by Swatara Township police. In 2009, Wantz was granted an ARD by Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico. At the time Marsico refused to investigate Wantz further.
Wantz is the owner of the Schaad Detective Agency of York. Schaad holds multi-million dollar security contracts with the administration of Gov. Tom Corbett. Schaad guards sensitive state complexes such as the PennDot headquarters in Harrisburg."
