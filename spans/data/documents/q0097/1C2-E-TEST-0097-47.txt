Fedex Express Team Leader in Memphis, TN:   (Current Employee)
Pros
Overall, the insurance is great and is very helpful when you are sick. Paid vacation is excellent for those much needed days off to relax. The potential for advancement at FedEx is very high. Many people start out in the hub and work their way in to management. The employee benefits and 401(K) are very good. Of course paid holidays are a nice way of saying thank you to the employees. Overall, the pay is competitive with others in the industry and that is an obvious plus.
Cons
The negative environment and attitude of the workers within  the Hub is an obvious downfall of FedEx. Management also lacks committment to the employees. This brings the morale and productivity of the employee down.
Advice to Senior Management
Openly communicate with the employees
