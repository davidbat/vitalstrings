Alright I work at FedEx as a handler during the night and my manager pulled everyone aside during some down time to tell us some news.  He said that the company was looking at implementing two phases in regards to possible layoffs because of the low volume.  Trust me it is low.  He said phase one would be looking at laying off a nice size of IT people, some managers that are in areas which there are to many, and possible firing of some managers that run the lines during the day.  Then he said phase 2, which will probably come, will be looking into the layoffs of pilots. He said that volume is real low and that it is the same volume they had back in the 80's.  He also said they might look into closing a few hubs if it makes sense.  The Indy hub has shut down its Friday sort and all that comes to Memphis now.  Right now they have to many pilots and not that many flights anymore.  Like my co-worker said, "To many chiefs and not enough indians." And please do not freak out and say Memphis is screwed and that it is doomed, because it is not.  Memphis is the main focal point and it will continue to be so.
