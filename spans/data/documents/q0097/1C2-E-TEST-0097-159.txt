FedEx Ground expects to employ about 800 people at its $110 million hub in Kernersville, a facility slated to open in September.
Roughly three years ago, the Triad competed against sites in two other states for a new FedEx Ground     FedEx Ground Latest from The Business Journals FedEx building Minnesota distribution center FedEx building distribution center FedEx Freight to hike shipping rates 6.9% Follow this company distribution hub and won.
That victory will finally bear fruit later this year.
When the new FedEx Ground hub opens in Kernersville in September 2011, the 400,000-square-foot facility at 1544 Old Greensboro Road in the Triad Business Park will not only represent a $110 million investment but also employ approximately 800 people.
Each day, workers will report to the hub and sort thousands of packages. Roughly 100 trucks will pick up and drop off deliveries daily to serve FedEx Ground’s network throughout eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia.
FedEx’s new facility will surely be a boost to the region, which has been targeting transportation and logistics companies as a major catalyst of economic growth.
The opening also will mark a growing number of investments that FedEx has been making in the Triad and North Carolina over the past several years, including the FedEx air cargo hub at the Piedmont Triad International Airport     Piedmont Triad International Airport Latest from The Business Journals Landmark Aviation wins award for fueling operation at PTI Honda selects contractors for M maintenance facility at PTI TIMCO grows with maintenance, repair trends Follow this company .
It will be the 11th FedEx Ground hub that the company has added in the United States since 2003.
“These are major investments,” says John Payne , senior vice president of linehaul, maintenance and safety for FedEx Ground as well as a Thomasville native. “The Piedmont Triad is going to benefit from the success of our very large network.”
The Triad area will be benefitting from that success roughly three years after FedEx selected the area over sites in Tennessee and South Carolina.
Payne says the Triad proved to be an ideal location partly because the region has a strong road infrastructure in place.
“Our operation is a road operation, so we’re dependent on the national highway infrastructure to support our network,” he says.
