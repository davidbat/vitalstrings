My office in PHX is located directly South of both Southern runways so I have great views of the action at Sky Harbor throughout the day. Within a span of maybe 5 mins this morning 2 FedEx DC10s and an A300 took off. While on my walk later, a FedEx Cessna Grand Caravan took off and immediately banked South going over my office. I'm assuming the widebodies were headed to MEM . I'm assuming the Caravan was headed to a much smaller outstation in Arizona. My question is, where?
I know the widebodies land in PHX with their loads, get unloaded, and some of the cargo is transferred to the Caravans to be taken to the smaller cities. I'm sure this same scenario happens all over the US. Is there anyway to see where FedEx flies to? I've been curious about this for a very long time. Thanks for the info.
