actually this is not entirely correct.  Brookly fields is one of the main hubs for Fed Ex located in Mobile, AL.  It could have switched at a hub in Mobile at the airport.   It is possible to go from Memphis to Mobile and back in under 6 hours.  The Fed Ex Ground hub located in Mobile is the actual location for the office complex for Federal Express and is also a hub for FedEx Ground.  They are 2 seperate entities operating out of the same space
