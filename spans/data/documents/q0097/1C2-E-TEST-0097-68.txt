* FedEx Express considers any freight weighing over 150 lbs. to be ‘heavyweight’ freight
* This freight may be containerized or palletized on a metal sheet
* The movement of all heavyweight freight is by forklifts
* The inbound heavyweight pieces receive an initial Hub Inbound Package (HIP) scan as the pieces are unloaded
* The pieces are unloaded from the inbound Unit Loading Device (ULD)
* The items are moved by forklift to staging areas according to their destination
* Outbound containers or pallets are built up
* The pieces of freight are scanned into the containers along with the accompanying Consolidation (CONS) Tag
* Once a container is full, it is weighed and taken directly to the outbound staging area for loading onto the aircraft
SPSS Document Sort
The Small Packaging Sorting System (SPSS) facility was built to replace the labor-intensive Overnight Letter and Courier Pak manual sort. It is a semi-automatic small parcel and document sorting facility. The input, sorting, and outbound operations are all done within the walls of the facility. This facility utilizes 800 to 900 employees for the night-side sorting operation (about one third of what was required for the ‘hand sort’).
* Opened in 1997 (construction started in 1992)
* Cost $175,000,000 to build
* Consists of three floors with each floor occupying 175,000 square feet of space
* Uses the Crisplant Tilt-Tray system that was manufactured in Denmark
* Uses the FedEx specific software developed in collaboration with Northrop Grumman Aerospace Company
* Has the capacity to sort 325,000 documents per hour
* Operates at approximately 99.5% efficiency
Dangerous Goods
The DG facility is also known as the Specialty Sort Building. It is located on the north side of the ramp to the west of Maintenance Hangar 10. Employees in this building have been certified according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) guidelines for the handling of dangerous goods. These specialists sort, scan, and load the dangerous goods for carriage onboard FedEx Express aircraft.
International
The International Clearance Facility (ICF) is the four-story building west of the Heavyweight processing area. In this facility, all cargo entering or leaving the country is sorted and processed. The ICF is a self-contained, secure facility. This means that all input, sorting, output, and inspection of customer freight are done entirely within this facility. It has its own Command Center and its own sorting slide. Visiting this facility requires approval by the International authorities and must demonstrate a business need and is by appointment only. Please indicate the need for this tour in the brief explanation and benefit section of your tour request.
