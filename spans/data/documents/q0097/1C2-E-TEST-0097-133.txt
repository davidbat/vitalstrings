Called and left message regarding my FedEx account number.
I called FedEx and they told me there were no problems with my account and that 901 922-7000 was NOT one of their contact numbers.
Called back 901 922-7000, got an automatic reply message " This FedEx number has been discontinued".
It is probably (99.9%) a scam.

This is not a scam. This is the number that automatically shows up on caller ids when FedEx employees make outbound calls to customers. When the employee calls and leaves a message they leave a number to call them back. Use that number and not the number that shows up on caller id. If you are concerned feel free to call FedEx's 800#s of 1-800-506-7580 or 1-800-463-3339 and ask for the person that left their name and number. Do not be concerned as this is legitimate.

Woman called claiming to be from Fedex. Apparently an invoice for $12 or so has been returned to them and they were looking for an updated address to mail the invoice to.
Seemed legit because they had my name, old (outdated) address from where I lived 2 years ago, the one charge, and the name of the person who I shipped something to. She also knew that my credit card had expired recently (normally they charge right to my credit card rather than send me an invoice.)
I asked if I could update this information on the Fedex website instead of giving it out over the phone and the caller acquiesced saying that it would be fine. She gave me her name and a different number to call (same area code).
Calling the phone number on the Caller ID does result in a man's voice saying quickly that this Fedex number is now discontinued. So that's a little confusing.
Caller ID: 901-922-7000
