Just to give everyone an update of what I've seen and know about...
 
Yes Memphis FedEx was having issues with deliveries due to weather in the Northern states.  I'm sure it had sone effect on the main hub in Memphis but not sure how much. 
 
As for my iPhone, I ordered it at 2:55am, you all know when that was.  Got info that it shipped to FedEx, then was shipped to another location in Memphis and it is currently in Transit to another location for delivery.  My guess is that a lot of these phones were close to Memphis due to the FedEx hub.  As for when it will be delivered, it was supposed to come to my apt on Monbday.  But since like most, I work on Monday, I've told them to hold it at the location right by my work.  This location is where all of my packages from FedEx go onto the trucks in my area and I figured it would be quicker to pick it up there Monday morning vs have them deliver it when I'm not home then I'd have to pick it up there anyways.  The short of it is, it's currently being carried over to this location as we speak I believe and waiting to see where it ends up today to see if I can get it today.  If not, I pick it up on Monday at 9am when they open.
 
The funny thing is that I've waited 4 years for this dang phone and now I have to wait until Monday, more waiting.  Why didn't Verizon start sales Sunday night or Monday night, everyone would have had their packages by this weekend vs everyone waiting until Monday.  Overnight is what mine was shipped but that was pointless...
 
Good luck to everyone and thanks to Verizon and Apple for making us all very happy in the end and of course them all very rich.
