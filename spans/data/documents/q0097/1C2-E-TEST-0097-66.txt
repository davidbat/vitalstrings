Description
This new 162,535 square foot distribution center provides a premier opportunity for an investor to acquire a strategically located industrial property in a strong market for FedEx.  The site was developed with room for a 32,076 square foot expansion, important for the investor as the returns from the improvements are quite attractive as well as the potential for a new lease term.
Built-to-suit for FedEx Ground on 25.17 acres, the property is located along the Tennessee-Georgia border.  FedEx recognizes the property and location as a key to sustaining their long-term growth in the region with this semi-automated facility just a two hour drive to the FedEx Ground hub in Nashville, TN.  Situated in the six county Chattanooga MSA with a population of over 50,000, this is a primary sorting operation for FedEx in the area, with shipments arriving via ground transportation that are then disbursed to the market.  Chatanooga is at the junction of three major freeways, I-24, I-59 and I-75, and is within a one-day drive to 1/3 of the U.S. population.
