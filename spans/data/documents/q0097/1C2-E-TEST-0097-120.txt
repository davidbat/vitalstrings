FedEx World Hub tour in MEM
Has anyone here done the FedEx overnight sort tour in MEM?  I've been wanting to do it for years and would really like to get some information about what's involved in getting a tour and any other specifics.
My understanding is that you manage your own travel to/from MEM such that you arrive late at night and depart early in the morning so that you have overnight to watch the "sort" at the FedEx world hub, which is supposed to be incredible.
It's almost hard to believe that you could see all that there is to see in just one night.
Thoughts?  Experiences?  Any ITYTers interested in trying to plan a group event in MEM for a tour?
