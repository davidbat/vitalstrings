The dropout dilemma: One in four college freshmen drop out. What is going on here? What does it take to stay in?
PITTSBURGH -- FedEx Ground, a leading small-package ground carrier and an operating company of FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX), has opened a new 325,000-square-foot distribution hub near Dallas in Hutchins, Texas.
Today, customers will join T. Michael Glenn, executive vice president of Market Development and Corporate Communications, FedEx Corp. and John Wiley Price, Dallas County Commissioner, to celebrate the facility opening.
The Dallas hub is one of nine hubs to open as part of a network expansion plan that will include the relocation or expansion of more than 290 pickup and delivery terminals through 2010. The nationwide expansion will boost the company's current average daily pickup capacity by nearly 70 percent over the next five years. This summer, FedEx Ground also opened hubs in Cincinnati, Ohio and Hagerstown, Maryland. A fourth new hub, under construction near Memphis, Tennessee will begin operations in 2006.
The $34-million hub is capable of processing up to 22,500 packages per hour and is equipped with the most advanced package-sortation technology, including high speed conveyors and camera-based scan tunnels to maximize package sorting rates. The new Dallas hub has a workforce of more than 700 employees and independent contractors. FedEx currently has nearly 5,500 FedEx employees and contractors working in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
"At FedEx Ground, we are committed to providing the highest level of customer service in small-package ground shipping," said Daniel J. Sullivan, president and CEO, FedEx Ground. "The opening of the Dallas hub is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance service and meet customer demand by increasing the size, speed and reliability of our network."
Situated on 102 acres, the Dallas hub is one of 29 centralized distribution centers in the company's network and the third major FedEx Ground facility in the Dallas metroplex. FedEx Ground also operates a hub in Fort Worth and an automated terminal in Irving.
Rogers-O'Brien Construction Co. of Dallas was the construction manager for the facility and Bucon, Inc., based in Kansas City, Missouri, provided construction services for the metal building components. Rodman Excavation of Frisco, Texas, was responsible for site excavation and HK Systems of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, installed the material handling systems. Pickering Firm, Inc. served as the architect.
