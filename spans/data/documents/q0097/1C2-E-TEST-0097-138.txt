Hubs of Major Air Freight Integrators
Four major air freight integrators account for the bulk of the global     air cargo; DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS. Each has a hub-and-spoke organization     of their network with hubs clustered around the world's three major     zones of economic activity; North America, Europe and Pacific Asia.     The choice of the main consolidation hub is based upon an airport that     is well located, has good infrastructure, but that does not     necessarily service     a very large local passenger market. The integrator is thus the airport's     main customer and gets a privileged access to the runways. Louisville,     Kentucky is the major air hub of UPS, while Memphis, Tennessee performs     the same role for FedEx. One the above map, there is a high level of     concentration of hubs in the Eastern Part of the United States, which     roughly corresponds to its demographic centroid. Other hubs in North     America are regionally oriented (with Toronto and Hamilton servicing     the Canadian market for FedEx and UPS respectively), except Miami that     services Latin America and the only airport with Hong Kong where three     integrators are using the facility as a hub. In Europe, DHL and TNT     have followed a similar strategy than their North American counterparts     by selecting smaller airports to be their main hubs (Leipzig and Liege     respectively). Hubs have also been established at intermediate locations     such as Anchorage, Dubai and Bahrain. Although their initial use was     for refueling, they became hubs in their own right.
