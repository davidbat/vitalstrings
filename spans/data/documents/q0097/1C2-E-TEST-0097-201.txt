Hi All,
Anyone know whats going on in Memphis? FedEx is having ***HUGE*** Delays.
I know they got hit by a pretty rough storm last night... But still, that was last night... All the FedEx flights bound for MEM made it in basically on time, so arriving wasnt an issue. Their IND hub appears to be running on schedule, maybe with a 1-2 hour delay per FedEx aircraft departure.
It appears all passenger operations are on-time with no problems... but its FedEx with the huge delays.
For instance:
No MEM - DTW MD -11 flight ( scheduled Daily )
1x MEM - LAX A300 flight ( 5x Flights Scheduled Daily )... Actually just double checked and its now 2x.
No MEM - EWR Flight ( 2x+ Scheduled Daily )
I have 3 packages i sent out Fedex Express yesterday, 2 went to the MEM hub. One is going to PIT and just landed in an A310 about 5 minutes ago ( Very late arrival for Fedex, 9:30 AM is probably about 2-3 hours late )
Another package i have is supposed to go to HRL ( Checked arrivals into HRL, Fedex isnt even in the list ).
Yesterday our hub here in FNT, my driver told me they were overloaded with packages ( He said 60,000 but i believe that was an exaggeration )... with a staggering 158 pickups scheduled for the FNT hub ( Typical pickups in FNT area is around 20-40, holiday times maybe around 60 max ). He said that he's never seen it that crazy before since he's worked for FedEx.
Is FedEx overloaded or something? Whats going on in Memphis?
Just concerned because im hoping my packages make it on time...and curious too.
If anyone could post some information regarding MEM and the FedEx operations there today, please post it!
thanks!
