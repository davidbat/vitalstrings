In December 2007, the generous people of FedEx Corp. gave me an outstanding tour of their facilities in and around the Memphis, Tennessee headquarters.
The first tour was a visit to a local Memphis sort facility, where the couriers load their vans for deliveries. This took place during the morning sort, the hour or so before dawn when packages are offloaded from air cargo containers, sorted, and loaded on to the vans and stepvans that are ubiquitous in cities around the world.
The second tour was of FedEx's world hub at the Memphis airport. The "Hub" is an amazing city in and of itself, with thousands of people using the latest technology to efficiently move millions of packages from and to locations all over the globe.
The week before Christmas is FedEx's busiest of the year, so the staff there really went out of their way to make time for my tours. I took a lot of photos, many of which I'll be posting here. Many thanks to the people of FedEx for their hospitality and time.
