Federal Express
Regional Hub Facility
Federal Express Corporation, one of the world's largest state                 of the art package delivery companies required a new, modern                 facility that would serve as their western Texas Regional HUB,                 providing routing for North and central Texas, eastern New                 Mexico, and western Oklahoma with direct connection to Memphis,                 Tennessee which is FedEx's home base.  The new HUB serves as the initial receipt and sorting                 facility eliminating the need for  regional packaging to be shipped directly to Memphis.
