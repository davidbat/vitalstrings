This FedEx truck is backing into one of the global shipping company's New York facilities.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The fate of five FedEx shipping hubs in Northeast Ohio was unknown Thursday after the delivery company said it plans to merge two of its divisions, close 100 hubs nationwide and cut 1,700 jobs.
A FedEx spokesman said the Memphis-based company was not ready to release a list of the hubs that it plans to close in January when it merges its FedEx Freight and National LTL, or less-than-truckload, divisions. The closures represent 21 percent of the company's freight hubs.
In Northeast Ohio, the company has FedEx Freight hubs in Richfield, Mentor and Akron and National LTL hubs in Valley View and Ravenna.
Unaffected by the planned closures is FedEx Custom Critical, the division based in Green that handles specialty transportation work for the shipping giant.
"It's business as usual over here," said FedEx Custom Critical spokesman Ryan Henry.

FedEx profit doubles, but company will cut 1,700 jobs
FedEx expects to spend as much as $200 million to pay severance and break leases as part of the merger.
FedEx announced its plans to close freight hubs in releasing its first quarter earnings statement. The company said it made $380 million during the three months that ended Aug. 31.
Though sales were up during the quarter, the freight division was on the only FedEx unit to report a loss during its first fiscal quarter. Even during the worst of last year's economic decline, all of FedEx's divisions made money.
Lower prices for freight services drew in more customers, pushing the division's revenues up 28 percent, to $1.3 billion. But the company said it was losing money on the lower-priced contracts, and it lost $16 million on freight services during the quarter. Last year, FedEx freight made $2 million during the first quarter of the fiscal year.
FedEx's ground shipments and express delivery business both experienced big sales and profit gains during the quarter, something the company attributed to an improving economy.
The $380 million profit was more than twice the $113 million the company made in the same quarter last year.
