[ edit ] History
Memphis Municipal Airport opened on a 200-acre (81 ha) plot of farmland just over seven miles (10 km) from downtown Memphis. During its early years the airport had three hangars and an unpaved runway; passenger and air mail service was provided by American Airlines and Chicago and Southern Air Lines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1953). In 1939 Eastern Air Lines arrived; that March Eastern had one departure a day to Muscle Shoals and beyond, American had four east/west and C&S had four north/south.
During World War II the United States Army Air Force Air Transport Command 4th Ferrying Group used Memphis while sending new aircraft overseas. In April 1951 the runways were 6000-ft 2/20, 6530-ft 9/27, 4370-ft 14/32 and 4950-ft 17/35 (the airport was all north of Winchester Rd during the 1950s).
The April 1957 OAG shows 64 weekday departures: 25 on Delta, 18 American, 7 Southern, 5 Eastern, 4 Braniff, 3 Trans-Texas and 2 Capital. The first scheduled jet flights were Delta 880s ORD-MEM-MSY and back, starting in July-August 1960.

The current terminal was designed by Mann & Harrover and cost $ 6.5 million. It opened on June 7, 1963 and Memphis Municipal changed its name to Memphis International in 1969, but the airport had no non-stop international routes until 1985-86 when Republic Airlines began service to Mexico. The terminal was expanded for $ 31.6 million in 1974, adding two new concourses and extending the others, which were designed by Roy P. Harrover & Associates [8] . The airport had no non-stop inter-continental routes until 1995 when KLM began service to Amsterdam . Flights to Amsterdam are now Delta .
Southern Airways became an important regional carrier at Memphis in the 1960s; it merged into Republic Airlines in 1979. Republic established Memphis as a network hub in 1985 before merging into Northwest Airlines in 1986. [9] In 2008, Delta Air Lines bought Northwest and rebranded the Memphis operation under the Delta name.
Federal Express (now FedEx Express ) began operations in Memphis in 1973. It opened its current "SuperHub" facility on the north side of the airport in 1981.
Since 2009 the airport has been a hub for small regional airline, SeaPort Airlines which provides single-engine plane service to a number of communities in Arkansas through the Essential Air Service program. SeaPort Airlines is based out of the private aviation terminal not the main passenger terminal.[ citation needed ]
