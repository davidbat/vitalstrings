Most of the point is that if it’s already two days late, it’s grossly specious to claim that being late-r due to weather brings them into TOS compliance.
But if the reason a flight out of Memphis is delayed is because the plane making that flight was scheduled to make stops in Baltimore, Charlotte, and Atlanta and there was heavy rain in Charlotte… that’s a scheduling issue, not a weather issue. By that butterfly-effect-esque reasoning, any delay anywhere in the world could be claimed to excuse lateness. “Well, your package from Portland to Seattle was two days late, but it’s not our fault because we routed it through Memphis and it took an extra hour for the plane to take off because all airplanes out of Memphis were delayed by an hour because they had to bring in some passenger flights later than expected because they held connecting flights at JFK for people arriving from London, who had been delayed because they were waiting on passengers who were held up in Rome because they had to switch out a flight crew who had been on the ground too long in Madrid because the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
Not that they wouldn’t try to use this reasoning, just that it doesn’t hold water. And perhaps most to the point… if they train customer service people to pretend it’s never ever their fault, they set off a cascade effect of never holding people accountable -> more delayed and destroyed packages -> more complaints -> more infuriating excuses -> more customers who are so livid over their mistreatment that they recant their stories on boards like this one. Good way to drive a company into the ground… but then again, this is the era of “Long-term reputation and viability means nothing, making one more dollar right now means everything.”
