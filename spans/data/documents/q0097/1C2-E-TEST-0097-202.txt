I normally do not ship much and try to either use UPS or USPS to send my packages. I have also used FedEx in the past with relative success. However, now the big names have come up with a way to be completely irresponsible for their service and in the process make it “cheaper” for its users. Announcing Fedex Smartpost. I really wonder how executives at these shipping companies can come up with this horseshit and put it into production without performing a reality check. I see Fedex Smartpost as a way for Fedex and USPS to completely deny any accountability for a package shipped through this service, thus reducing overhead normally associated with extra checks and balances to control loss and/or mistakes. This makes everyone concerned look really, really bad. They need to hire better marketing and managerial folks.
I was shipped a small package through this service and somehow it got lost in the shuffle. However, now Fedex has no way of tracking it, nor does USPS. They both asked me to visit the others’ website/phone support to get it resolved. I shudder to think what would have happened if this package was expensive or had an insurance claim of some kind. Needless to say, I will never ship anything again (or have anything shipped to me) with any “Smartpost” type service. I really like accountability and would like to think that my carriers are responsible enough and reliable enough to want be accountable since they sell reliability and their business models are based on reliability of service. If anyone reading this was thinking about using Fedex Smartpost, I would strongly suggest against it. Save yourself the hassle and the line of flaming dog poop that these people are offering and pay a few bucks extra to use a better service.
