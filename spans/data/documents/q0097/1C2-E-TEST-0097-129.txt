Serving Europe for more than 25 years, the European FedEx network offers next-day service to hundreds of cities in Europe with late collections and early deliveries, linking hundreds of European cities, and covering approximately 75,000 post codes.
 
Over the last five years, FedEx has made a number of significant strategic investments to its network and provides customers a competitive advantage via unmatched access and connections to next-day service to the U.S. and Asia Pacific. FedEx has introduced an International Economy Service from 27 of the EMEA countries to more than 215 countries and territories worldwide, an East Coast Special Service allowing later drop off times in Europe with next day delivery to the US East Coast and a direct roundtrip flight between Paris and Hong Kong allowing customers in many European markets to benefit from next day service from Asia.
 
The FedEx Express hub at Roissy-Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris, France, is the largest FedEx hub outside the US and the primary European gateway for packages sent by FedEx customers throughout the world. The airport boasts a multi-modal logistics center with good highway linkages. To minimize its impact on the environment, more than 230 Liquefied Petroleum Gas-powered and electric-powered ground support vehicles are housed at the Roissy-CDG hub – accounting for almost 60% of its ground fleet.
 
In 2010 FedEx Express in Germany relocated its Central & Eastern European hub from Frankfurt to Cologne. The new hub is a vital link in the FedEx worldwide network, acting as a central gateway for packages arriving by ground or air from Central and Eastern Europe and providing fast connectivity within Europe, to the U.S. and Asia. The state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly facility features a 1.4 megawatt solar power system with the capacity to produce approximately 800,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year – equal to the power required for roughly 230 three-person households for an entire year. 
 
Always seeking to broaden its access within as well as between countries, in 2006 FedEx acquired ANC, a domestic express company in the United Kingdom. The company, now rebranded as FedEx UK, enables FedEx to serve the entire UK domestic market. FedEx also continues to invest in long-term growth and prosperity in India. Following the acquisition of PAFEX in 2006, one of the country’s largest domestic express companies, FedEx continues to expand its reach in India. In November 2010 FedEx Express announced that it will acquire the logistics, distribution and express businesses of AFL Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliate, Unifreight India Pvt. Ltd. This acquisition will give FedEx a more robust domestic ground network and added capabilities in India. Further opportunities for growth also lie in the accession of Eastern European countries to the EU. With border restrictions removed, shipping traffic is expected to grow tremendously over the next five years as trade opportunities proliferate.  FedEx for example has introduced faster inbound and outbound transit times for Bulgaria and Romania including next day delivery in key European markets.
With increased channels and capabilities for timely transportation around the world and within the EMEA, FedEx continues to record the best customer satisfaction scores in the industry.
