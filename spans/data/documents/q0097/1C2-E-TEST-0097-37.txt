He called a friend he has at Fed Ex and everything is normal. BUT here's what "normal" means. 2 day shipping is exactly like overnight, except they hold onto the packages an extra day. His friend said our packages are in the 2 day can. So in essence a holding pen. Sooooo, tonight we should see the package move on a route as if it were an overnight package, ending in delivery to our houses tomorrow as scheduled.
