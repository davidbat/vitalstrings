Glen Campbell's New Music Video Premieres
Glen is a dear friend of Ellen's as well as the show. That's why he was here to tell Ellen about his recent struggle with Alzheimer's and to perform one of Ellen's favorite songs, "Wichita Lineman" just for her. It's also why he's premiering the brand new music video of the title track for his new CD, "Ghost on the Canvas," directed Kii Arens and Jason Trucco. You can watch the video here , and you can buy the song on iTunes and Amazon.com .
