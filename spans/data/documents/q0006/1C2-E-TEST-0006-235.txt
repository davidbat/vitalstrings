JOLIET, Ill. (CBS) — Sitting on a couch at the Joliet Harrah’s hotel and casino, Glen Campbell is in good spirits.
“Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin’ town, I love Chicago,” he said.

At 75 years old, Campbell reflects on a life of singing, songwriting,  and acting.
“I just love to sing and play,” he said. “I’m very blessed.”
In the last several months, Campbell has had a new battle to fight. In June, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease but the singer doesn’t seem to even realize his fate.
“They say I have Alzheimer’s disease. I guess it’s something with my brain?” he said. “It’s like having the croup every once in awhile. I haven’t noticed it in my life.”
His wife of 30 years, Kim, travels everywhere with him and is there when he forgets details, names and faces.
The country legend says his “Goodbye Tour” is something he says he’s doing for his fans.
“I don’t worry about how I’m going to play,” he said.
Unlike Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston before him, Campbell decided not to exit the public stage and share his experiences with his fans.
“People say: keep your chin up,” he said.
He plays with his family — his daughter and two sons.
The eight-time Grammy winner released his new album “Ghost on the Canvas” in August. He will receive the industry’s lifetime achievement award on February 11th.
“I haven’t been around a lifetime yet,” he laughed.
Some of his hits include “Rhinestone Cowboy,” “Southern Nights”, “By the Time I Get to Phoenix”, and he even starred with John Wayne in the movie “True Grit.” He also hosted a variety show on CBS called “The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.”
Campbell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame  in 2005.
He is playing at the  at the Rialto Square Theater in Joliet Thursday and Friday.
