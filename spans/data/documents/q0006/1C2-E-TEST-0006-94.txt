Glen Campbell Discusses Alzheimer's …
Country singer Glen Campbell is in the public eye again for the first time since going public earlier this year about being diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's disease.
Campbell sat down with ABC News' Terry Moran for an interview airing Tuesday night on World News With Diane Sawyer and Nightline, and again during Good Morning America Wednesday. They discuss Campbell’s long career and how the star is dealing with the realities of the degenerative disease while preparing to embark on a final tour to say thank you to his fans.
The "Rhinestone Cowboy" and "Galveston" singer releases his final studio album, Ghost on the Canvas, on Aug. 30. The international "The Glen Campbell Goodbye Tour" starts in New Brunswick Canada on Sept. 2, and hits cities like Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Reno before crossing the Atlantic in Oct. for numerous dates in the U.K., Scotland and Ireland.
Campbell says part of the reason for being interviewed by ABC News is because his family wants the public to know his condition in case he has trouble on stage.
Campbell won eight Grammys, had a TV show (The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour) and had 81 songs on the charts during his 50-year-career.
