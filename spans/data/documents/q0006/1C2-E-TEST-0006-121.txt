Glen Campbell
Perhaps you’ve heard the very sad news that Glen Campbell — singer, guitarist, session heavyweight, actor, stone-cold legend and native of Delight, Ark. — has Alzheimer’s. The 75-year old recently went public with his condition, and he’s since announced “The Glen Campbell Goodbye Tour” as a way to cap a career that’s spanned five decades, multiple No. 1 hits and millions upon millions of albums sold.
Like its predecessor, 2008’s “Meet Glen Campbell,” the singer’s upcoming album, “Ghost on the Canvas,” features a slew of high-profile musicians. It includes tunes written specifically for him by songwriters as disparate as Jakob Dylan, Robert Pollard, Teddy Thompson and Paul Westerberg. Backing musicians on the album include Dick Dale, Billy Corgan, Brian Setzer, The Dandy Warhols and others.
The album is out Aug. 30, but a full listing of dates has yet to be released.
“I still love making music,” Campbell recently told People . “And I still love performing for my fans. I’d like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin.”
