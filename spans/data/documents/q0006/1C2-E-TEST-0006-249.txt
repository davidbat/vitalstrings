Like the rhinestone cowboy that he is, country singer Glen Campbell is riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo. OK, maybe more like a BMW than a horse, and I don't think Malibu. Calif., has ever actually held a real rodeo. But Campbell's house was just listed for sale at $5,950,000, and it sure is star-spangled.
He's owned the 6,540-square-foot Mediterranean home since 2006. Title records don't indicate what he paid for it. The home has outdoor dining, garden and pool areas and views of the Santa Monica Bay and Catalina Island. It has four bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms with lots of high-end craftsmanship. There's a home theater and a great kitchen with a center island.
Campbell, described as a living legend and with enough ex-wives to prove it, broke records in 1975 with his recording of "Rhinestone Cowboy." In his 50 years as an entertainer, Campbell has released more than 70 albums and sold more than 45 million records. He made history in 1967 when he won four Grammys in both the country music and pop categories. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2005.
His signature "Rhinestone Cowboy" continues to be heard on movie soundtracks and on TV, including "Desperate Housewives."
In fact, we suspect that listing agent Bryan Harper of Coldwell Banker Malibu is humming these lines right now:
"Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone . . ."
