Glen Campbell
Campbell guest-starred on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , and later hosted a series of his own, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.
His hits include "Galveston", "By The Time I Get to Phoenix", "Wichita Lineman", "Try a Little Kindness", "Gentle On My Mind", "Sunflower", and "Hey Little One". Many of his hits were written by Jimmy Webb , a talented young songwriter . In 1975 , Campbell had his biggest hit, "Rhinestone Cowboy". The song became a phenomenon , and rhinestone -covered clothing became a fad .
Campbell had more hits, including "Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L. A. )" and "Can You Fool?" but his career hit a dry spell in the late 1970s. He seemed to suffer from public overexposure . His romance with Tanya Tucker , a much-younger country singer, did not help the way many people saw Campbell. He stopped recording, and cut back on his public appearances.
Years later, Campbell returned to recording and appearing on television . In the 1990s , people were again interested in his music and career. Personal problems, though, seemed to get as much attention as the highlights of his career, such as when Campbell was arrested for drunk driving . His music is still popular with fans, and is part of popular culture .
Campbell discovered in late 2010 that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease , and announced the diagnosis in June 2011. He released his final album that year, and will complete his last concert tour in 2012.
