Glenn Campbell, the country singer, actor, age 75, and his wife, Kim, told People magazine that Campbell has Alzheimer's disease.
Glenn is currently planning a series of live performances.
Glenn's wife Kim said,
"Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer, but if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn't want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?' "
I think Kim might be surprised by the wonderful outpouring of love and kindness Glenn is likely to receive from the Alzheimer's community.

Here is what David Lindquist had to say about Glenn's latest performance.
He mangled lyrics (despite unabashed use of video prompts on three onstage monitors), clanged countless off-key guitar notes and generated zero rapport with the crowd.
He might consider writing another article.
"I still love making music," said Campbell. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."
