Photographic tours and landscape workshops
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Welcome, I'm an professional photographer based in the Highlands of Scotland with a passion for exploring & photographing dramatic landscapes in both Australia, my native Scotland and other adventurous locations around the world.
For the last seven years I've co lead and operated photographic workshops both in Scotland and Australia and I'm set to expand my portfolio of locations to Croatia, Iceland and other wonderful destinations in 2013.
I enjoy sharing my photographic skills, knowledge of locations and hopefully good humour with like minded individuals. So if you'd like to expand your skill set, get creative and explore any of the locations featured then please just get in touch.
