Glen Campbell Diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease

Glen Campbell has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, he reveals in the new issue of People magazine.
 
The Grammy winner, 75, and his wife, Kim, say they are sharing the news because he hopes to give a series of goodbye concerts this fall -- in conjunction with a final album, "Ghost on the Canvas," to be released Aug. 30 -- and they want fans to know his condition.
 
"Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer," says Kim. "But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn't want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?' "
 
The singer, whose "Rhinestone Cowboy" topped the charts in 1975, has been suffering from short-term memory loss in recent years. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease six months ago.
 
He says the lyrics to his new song, "A Better Place" -- which include, "I need the ones I love Lord/More and more each day" -- are very personal given his diagnosis.
 
"I still love making music," says Campbell. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."
