Glen Campbell, a legend not to be missed at Penn’s Peak!!
After 50 years in show business and 70 plus albums later, Glen is touring one last time as Glen Campbell - The Goodbye Tour. He has sold 45 million records, been on the country charts 74 times and garnered 27 Top 10 hits throughout his career.  He made history in 1967 by winning four Grammys in both country and pop categories.  Along with all the musical accolades, Glen also received a Golden Globe nomination when he played alongside John Wayne in True Grit.  Finally, in 2005, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
Glen’s latest release is the 2011 album, Ghost On The Canvas.  This set of songs traces Campbell’s 75 years; from being dirt poor in Arkansas all the way up to living the good life in Hollywood.  Glen has said this will be his final album so it aptly ends with a glorious guitar jam featuring him alongside some great colleagues.  The collaborations on this album include acts such as The Wallflower’s singer Jakob Dylan, Chris Isaak and Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins.  
This may be your last chance to see a legend, don’t miss out on Glen Campbell at Penn’s Peak!!
