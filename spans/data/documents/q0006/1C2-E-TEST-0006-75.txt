George Jones and Glen Campbell will be honored with lifetime achievement awards next year. During a special ceremony on Feb. 11 — one day before the 2012 Grammy Awards, which will air on CBS — their contributions will be acknowledged by the Recording Academy in front of five other honorees and an invitation only crowd.
Between them, Jones and Campbell have won seven Grammy Awards and have five recordings in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Campbell has released over 70 albums during his five-decade long career, including multi-award winning hits ‘By the Time I Get to Phoenix’ and ‘Gentle on My Mind’ in 1967. He was also honored at the 2011 CMA Awards in Nashville. It was a touching tribute to the Country Music Hall of Famer, who is showing early signs of Alzheimer’s.
Jones is still touring at 80-years-old. His hit list is too long for one article, but fans at every show wait to hear a few of the all time greatest country songs, like ‘White Lightning’ and ‘He Stopped Loving Her Today.’ The “possum” is also a Country Music Hall of Fame inductee, in addition to a Kennedy Center Honors recipient.
A press release states that the Allman Brothers Band , Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Memphis Horns, Diana Ross and Gil Scott-Heron will also receive the Lifetime Achievment award. Additional merit awards will be handed out to Dave Bartholomew, Steve Jobs, Rudy Van Gelder, Celemony and Roger Nichols.
