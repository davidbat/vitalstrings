Well said, though I'd say "Gentle on My Mind" is one of the great recordings of any era. It will outlast all the other Campbell songs combined.

I too have fond memories of his early recordings....... Galveston, Witchita Lineman and By the Time I Get to Phoenix. Good luck Glen.

Sad news, I wish him the best. I really, really like Glen Campbell, glad to hear he is on the right side, even though very sorry to hear he is sick.

Long before Glen Campbell became a successful recording artist, millions of people listened to his work and loved it without even knowing it.
Glen was a steady member of "The Wrecking Crew," a team of session musicians who appeared on countless records in every musical genre, in the early to mid Sixties.
When you listened to a Beach Boys record, most likely you weren't hearing Mie Love or the Wilson brothers. You were probably hearing Glen Campbell on guitar, Carol Kaye on bass, Leon Russell on piano and Hal Blaine on drums.
Glen and the Wrecking Crew were also the real Monkees, sometimes the real Byrds. They also backed up everyone from Elvis to Dean Martin to Simon and garfunkel. If you have any records from the early Sixties, there's a decent chance Glen Campbell and the Wrecking Crew appeared on them.

Great points, Astorian.
Glen has always been the real deal; I even kinda liked his TV show.
His hits are forever entwined with my childhood, and whenver I hear Wichita Lineman, By the Time I Get to Phoenix or Galveston, I'm a kid again: The smell of clover, the sound of cicadas, the joy of endless summer days and my trusty bike await.

I sat in the now abandoned Rosenblatt Stadium (college world series) in a sport coat and knit tie to watch the Beach Boys in Campbell’s tour days. It was the first concert I had ever attended. I had a pair of Bushnell binoculars (how is that for high tech) and we (double date) took turns watching and were wondering who he was since we could not recognize him from our album covers. I remember being kind of mad because he was not a “real” beach boy. Silly me.

You know, I even thought he did a credible job as LeBeouf in the original True Grit. For a fellow with no acting training, anyway.

I remember seeing Glenn on his uncle's (Dick Bills) afternoon kiddie show on KOB in Albuquerque, NM.
Ridding down the trail to Albuquerque,
Saddle bags all filled with beans and jerky.
Heading for K circle B,
TV land for you and me,
K circle B in Albuquerque!

I liked his stuff. He was touring in New Zealand a few years ago. Of course, the funniest thing about the song "Galveston," is that, other than the city's name, there is NO description of the city at all. There's a reason for that---the city is a cesspool, with all the crime of a large city per capita and all of the culture of a small town. Let's see, whose Congressional district is it in again? I know he accepts a LOT of Pork for his District....

Always liked his music even though it was a bit before my time. My Mom used to be a big fan. All the best to him.

I sometimes wonder, if all the time and resources--both money and brains--that were invested in finding a cure for AIDS had been invested in finding cures for cancer and Alzheimer's, where we would be today in the fight against those diseases. God bless Glen Campbell.

I remember riding in the back of a station wagon to Daytona Beach in the late sixties, with my parents and 5 siblings. At the time, my Dad had several 8-track tapes, but he chose to play exactly 3 on the long drive there and back. The artists were Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn and Glen Campbell. I'm 51 now, and I still listen to all 3, and my brothers are still fans as well. Although, at the time, the musical choices were a little painful for a 16 hour drive, in later years, I was drawn back to the music of my roots. I wish Glen the best, and thanks for all the great memories.

Here's a link to a TV performance of Glenn Campbell performing a song called "Guess I'm Dumb" that was written & produced by Brian Wilson for him in 1965:
I remember watching his TV show when I was a kid & appreciated his talent. The best to him.
