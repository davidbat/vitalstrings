“Rhinestone Cowboy” singer Glen Campbell tells People magazine that he has Alzheimer’s disease. The 75-year-old singer and his wife, Kim, decided to go public with his illness so he could say goodbye to his fans when he performs this fall and so his fans can understand his condition. “Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer,” Kim told the magazine. “But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn’t want people to think, ‘What’s the matter with him? Is he drunk?’”
“I still love making music,” said Campbell, who learned of his diagnosis six months ago. “And I still love performing for my fans. I’d like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin.”
