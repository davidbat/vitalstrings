Glen Campbell
Though country music was originally performed on a local level or in family or town settings, it eventually found its way into the radio, television, and concert tour businesses. Today, performers like Glen Campbell, Tim McGraw , and Carrie Underwood have huge fan bases and manage to sell out concert halls around the world. These performers use guitars, bass, drums, and even harmonicas or banjos to create a distinctive, twangy, and down-to-earth sound.
Folk music is a traditional form of music that was revived when popular mainstream artists brought back old folk songs. Bob Dylan is one of the performers who is widely credited with reviving the art. Other popular artists include Lynyrd Skynyrd and K.D. Lang . Usually, folk music is rooted deeply into a country's culture and heritage and is passed down from generation to generation.
