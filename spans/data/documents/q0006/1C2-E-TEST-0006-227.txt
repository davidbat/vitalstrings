This guitar is my "dream" instrument.  My 60th birthday present from a very thoughtful and generous wife.Either you love Ovations or hate them.  If you love them, read on ... the Ovation 40th Anniversary Glen Campbell replica, made in Connecticut, USA, has the wonderful tone for which Ovation guitars are famous. Without an amp, it has plenty of power and projection; amplified it can only be described as "Sweet." "Glen" has the famous "jangle" of a GREAT 12 string.  Sounds like a whole band is playing and not just one instrument.  I have tried equivalent Taylors and Gibsons.  To my ears. I like the Ovation sound the best.  I also love the feel of an Ovation guitar, but you DO need a strap to hold them.Since this is a replica of a guitar made 40 years ago, it features a replica of the original pickup and preamp.  The controls are a volume knob and a single tone ring (dial to high or low, or in between).  That's it.  Nothing fancy.  I would rather it at least had an on board tuner as do the other current Ovation models.  Ovation is now supplying their guitars with coated D'Addario strings; very similar to Elixir strings.  GREAT!One major complaint is the location of the battery.  As in the original, the battery compartment is inside and ONLY accessible through the sound hole!  Another major complaint is the location of the volume/tone controls such that they are easily moved by a strap on the guitar.  My third major complaint is the way the headstock is slotted and how the strings run into it.  Several of the strings rub the wood in the center of the headstock.  I see no way to avoid this.  Sooner or later, with multiple string changes, this WILL damage the headstock.  A "normal" sign of wear and age for this model?  I accepted these "defects" in order to own a piece of history.  BUT, these are my reasons for a "7" under features and value.
