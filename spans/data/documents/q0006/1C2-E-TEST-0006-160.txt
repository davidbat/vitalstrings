The          Glen Campbell
Goodtime Hour
The          Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour started out life as The Summer Brothers          Smothers Show, the 1968 summer replacement series for The Smothers          Brothers Comedy Hour. That series utilized the Smothers show's writers,          orchestra and regulars like Pat Paulsen, Leigh French and Bluegrass legend          John Hartford.
Campbell          connected with the TV audience right away, his musical variety hour proved          so popular the series returned mid-season as The Glen Campbell Goodtime          Hour in January of 1969. Originally produced by Tom Smothers, the          show often featured his summer show regular Pat Paulsen.but mostly focused          on music with some of the greatest talents of all time appearing with          Glen - superstars like Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Cher, Rick Nelson, John          Wayne, and so many others. The series ran until the summer of 1972.
Here          are some video clips of this remarkable show and performer via You Tube:          First a clip from The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour featuring guest          Jerry Reed.
The Monkees          were a guest on the Campbell show as well.

Johnny          Cash welcomed Glen to his musical variety show in 1969. In this clip the          duo manage to barely get through a medley of their hits including 'I've          Been Everywhere,' 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix,' 'Galveston,' 'Folsom          Prison Blues' and 'Abilene.' The good news is that there's an incredible          'Best Of' DVD set of The Johnny Cash Show, a musical masterpiece.
For          some reason I liked one of Glen's lesser songs, 'Where's the Playground          Suzie,' it's one of those cake-out-in-the-rain tunes but it demonstrates          what a great vocalist Glen Campbell is.
Another          titanic talent was Bluegrass and pop song writer John Hartford ('Gentle          on My Mind') who passed away some time ago. Here Glen and John team up          on The Smothers Brothers 1988 reunion special. I'm thrilled someone has          loaded a bunch of clips from Hartford's too few TV appearances.
