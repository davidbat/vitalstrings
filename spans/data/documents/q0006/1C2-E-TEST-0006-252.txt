Glen Campbell
From: "Glen Campbell" (biographical sketch) on GATVC website (country music station), (http://www.gactv.com/legends/bios/campbell_g.html; viewed 22 September 2005):
Glen (b. Billstown, Arkansas, April 22, '36) has deep country roots and extraordinary talents that appeared early. Raised in Delight, Arkansas one of 11 children in a family where everybody picked and sang, Glen was handed his first guitar when he was just four. He learned from siblings and relatives at first. Later he learned by listening to masters such as Django Reignhardt and Barney Kessel, while his vocal ability developed by singing in the local Church of Christ.
