Glen  Campbell's Summary
Writing my book has become a major focus in my life.  The world I imagine on a daily basis, Corron World, is full of interesting and intriguing characters.  One huge wall in my home features the map of Corron World, including topography.
The characters have become friends and as other authors do, I have conversations with them that turn into dialogue for the book.
Goal:  Publish the Book
BIO
Glen Campbell was five years into gardening and landscaping career when friends remarked that he had a flair for writing and suggested he write a book in his favorite genre, Fantasy.
Glen, a voracious reader in that field, had tried his hand at writing when he was 21 and in college.  Life’s other pursuits lured him away from his love of writing, but he always knew that he wanted to be an author.
With a love for fantasy books and a background in the family public relations business, Glen began penning the dark fantasy novel, "Secrets of Infinity", in his spare time in 2009. The novel features a new world in which magic is called the Flow, and hero, Jagis MarKlessan, and his best friend -- a half- black ogre/half human named Bodac -- must save the planet from the twisted High Manipulator of Ancient Evil, Haniq’ Tel Lor Falla’Cel.
Glen lives in central California and can be reached via e-mail for an interview or discussion.
