Finally! Congrats to Miss Ross.

It’s about Diana.
Tivoli Eclipse
It is about time! What a monumental oversight! The incomparable Ms. Diana Ross is the Boss — period! Her iconography, and her status in the Ballroom (or the Big Room — where exit signs are clearly marked) does not require apologies, explanations, or justification. She is it. She ‘got’ legs — long legs!
That the music industry did not ‘grace’ her with Grammys was not about talent, or competition, genre, category, money, or pay-offs. It was un-pure politics!
Alas, Ms. Ross is too much of a lady to tell the Grammys where to shove that award! She was slighted, but that does not define who she is and what she’s done for the industry and her poly-psycho-macro-micro-sociological impact on the 20th Century. Comparing ‘talent’ to The Boss is ridiculous. Not ridiculous in a dull sense, ridiculous like irrational, uninspired and frankly uninformed.
PS: When she’s gone — work will cease, hearts will stop and tears will tilt the earth — so savor the tribute (and there better be a tribute). You don’t reach out to Diana Ross — The Boss unless you plan on showing love — on a grand scale.
