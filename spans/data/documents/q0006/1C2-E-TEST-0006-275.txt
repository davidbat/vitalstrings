Hi fashion lovers,
Celeb style
If you are a big fan of soaps then I'm pretty sure you tuned in on Wednesday to watch the British Soap Awards on ITV or at least checked the papers or internet to see how your favourite stars were turned out. It was a mixed bag, some going for full-on glamour whilst others played it simple and opted for clean lines.
For example Katherine Kelly opted for a 50â€™s inspired smoky rose long gown with black belted bow detail on the waist - very dramatic in a vintage way.
Jessie Metcalfe opted to go short and sparkly in an antique gold mini dress, I feel it was a little too brave and bold. Helen Worth wore a peachy cream lace dress with 3/4 length sleeves cut just below the knee, with a high neckline. She added gold accessories with a touch of sparkle on her wrist - very age appropriate - think classic elegant mother of the bride.

Love is in the air...
Hi fashion lovers
The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William celebrated their first anniversary yesterday, a fairly quiet affair compared with the world-stopping beautiful event we saw last year. They started the build up to their Anniversary weekend by attending a movie premiere.
Kate looked as elegant as ever, she is one young lady who really is embracing simple, chic sophisticated dressing, I loved her dress with its neutral taupe colour and bejewelled collar and cuffs. The dress was beautifully tailored allowing Kate to show off her slender frame
