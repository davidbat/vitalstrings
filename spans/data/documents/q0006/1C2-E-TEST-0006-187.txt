Glen’s accolades as a musician and singer are as impressive as his talent. He made history by winning a Grammy in both country and pop categories in 1967:     “Gentle On My Mind” snatched the country honors, and “By The Time I Get To Phoenix” won in pop. He owns trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year from both the CMA and the ACM, and took the CMA’s top honor as Entertainer of the Year.   In 2005 Glen was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by the Country Music Association of America.   In 1999 he won the coveted AMC Pioneer Award for “outstanding and unprecedented achievements in the field of country music.”   During his 50 plus years in show business, Glen has released more than 70 albums. He has sold 45 million records and racked up 12 RIAA Gold albums, 4  Platinum albums and 1 Double-Platinum album.   Of his 75 trips up the charts, 27 landed in the Top 10.
