Chuck Norris: Obama wants 'pro-gay' Boy Scouts
"Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer," Kim told the magazine. "But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn't want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?' "
Before he rides off into the sunset of a remarkable career that has seen him sell 45 million albums, win four Grammys and host his own variety show, "The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour" on CBS, Campbell said he wanted to perform live while his mind's still intact as a farewell to all those who've supported him over the years.
"I still love making music," said Campbell. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."
Godspeed, Glen.
