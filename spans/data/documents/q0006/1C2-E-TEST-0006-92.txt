Six months ago the famous country singer Glen Travis Campbell received an awful diagnosis, having been found to be suffering of Alzheimer. The singer decided to go public just before his farewell concert scheduled to take place this fall. For years the singer has complained of suffering short-term memory loss, however the final diagnosis came back six months ago: Alzheimer. Luckily the illness is still in its early stages.
"I still love making music," he was said in an interview for People magazine. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."
Campbell is planning a whole series of concerts that will start on August 30 and continue throughout the fall in order to promote his album Ghost on the Canvas. When the album will be released the singer plans to start his Glen Campbell Goodbye Tour whose itinerary is yet to be revealed.
"Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer. But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn't want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?" said Campbell’s wife Kimberly Woolen.
The album will be available on Amazon at $13.12 thus entitling the customer to receive the FreeSuper Saver Shipping on orders over $25. During his 50 years spent in show business the singer released 70 albums.
“Ghost On The Canvas is his 'farewell album,' a deep, meaningful look back at his career/life with contributions by the artists he continues to inspire. We're proud to be an integral part of the legendary Glen Campbell s final studio album featuring collaborations with Jakob Dylan, Paul Westerberg, Chris Isaak, Bob Pollard (Guided by Voices), Dick Dale, and Billy Corgan, among others," said an editorial from Amazon.com.
