Country music star Glen Campbell has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease . According to the 75-year-old singer's wife Kim, he is "still an awesome guitar player and singer," and will make the most of his time while his memory is largely intact by recording a final album and heading out on a farewell tour .
Campbell's last album, titled Ghost on the Canvas, is in the works now with producer Julian Raymond, who worked with the singer on his 2008 collection Meet Glen Campbell, which included covers of songs by Green Day , Tom Petty , the Velvet Underground and the Replacements . Ghost in the Canvas will include another song penned by the Replacements' Paul Westerberg, as well as original material and tunes by Guided By Voices mastermind Robert Pollard and the Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan. Billy Corgan , Chris Isaak, Dick Dale , Brian Setzer, the Dandy Warhols and Cheap Trick 's Rick Nielsen will all contribute guest performances to the album.
