I absolutely love this wonderful song by Mr. Campbell. I have been looking for a song for my son to play as he dumps my ashes. This is it. I have love your music as long as I can remember and will keep listening until I take my last breath. Thank you Mr. Campbell and your family for all your wonderful music.
A note to people who judge, Your better open your own closet before opening your mouth. I don't care how much you love God, we all have done thingsï»¿ we would not like to remember.
