The best of Glen Campbell
Rhinestone Cowboy lyrics:
Southern Nights   Have You Ever Felt  A
Southern Night   Free As A Breeze
Not To Mention The Trees
Whistling Tunes That You Know And Love So
Southern Nights   Just As Good Even When
Closed Your Eyes   I Apologize
To Any One Who Can Truly Say
He Has Found A Better Way
Feel So Good   Feel So Good It's Frightening
Wish I Could   Stop This World From Fighting
La Da Da Da  Da Da  La Da Da Da  Da  Da
Da Da Da  Da Da  Da Da Da  Da Da Da
Mysteries  Like This And Many Others
In The Trees  Blow In The Night
In The Southern Skies
