Lives in Phoenix and has       a home in Flagstaff
By the time Glenn Campbell got to Phoenix, he was an       established recording star (By the Time I Get to Phoenix, 1967; Gentle on       My Mind, 1967; Wichita Lineman, 1968; Galveston, 1969; Rhinestone Cowboy,       1975), a veteran television star (The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, 1969-1972; The Glen Campbell Music Show, 1982-1983), a co-star with       sometime Arizona resident John Wayne in True Grit (1969), and a star in a less than memorable movie (Norwood, 1970).

He also had, according to People magazine, "descended into a hedonistic world of whiskey, cocaine and       women."  He had an affair with and later married singer Mac       Davis' wife, Sarah.  When he was in his mid 40's he met the 21 year       old Tanya Tucker .  They       shared a year long volatile, cocaine-enriched affair.
Salvation came in the form of a Radio City Music Hall dancer       he met on a blind date in 1981.  He married Kimberly Woollen the next       year.  In a remarkable evolution during the 90's--sparked by an       ultimatum from Kimberly--Campbell reportedly gave up drugs and       booze.  He was more likely to be sniffing the fresh desert air on the       golf course with friends like Alice Cooper than snorting white powder.
In 1996, Glen built a 8,300 square foot home on the golf       course in the Biltmore Estates community, where he was living with       Kimberly as of 2003.  In 2005, he sold the Biltmore Estate home for       $6,475.000.  He also owns a home in the tony Forest Highlands golfing       development just outside Flagstaff.
