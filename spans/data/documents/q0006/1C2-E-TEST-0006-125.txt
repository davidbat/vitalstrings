Glen Campbell, currently on a farewell tour after his recent announcement that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, will perform at the Grammy Awards with contemporary country stars Blake Shelton and The Band Perry. The Grammys will take place February 12th in Los Angeles.
Campbell, a Country Music Hall of Famer, made history in 1967 when he won Grammys in both the country and pop categories â€“ two country & western awards for the song "Gentle on My Mind" and two pop for "By the Time I get to Phoenix." Shelton is up for two awards at this year's Grammys, including Best Country Album for Red River Blue. The Band Perry is nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy.
