Legendary country star Glen Campbell has apparently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease .
The 75-year-old singer and his wife, Kim, disclosed the condition to People in an exclusive interview. The couple chose to disclose the diagnosis as Campbell nears the end of his last slated live performances. They chose to clear the air before he began to get on stage in order to avoid controversy.
From People :
"Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer," says Kim. "But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldnâ€™t want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?' "
According to the Los Angeles Times , the singer of Rhinestone Cowboy fame plans to release one final album before calling it quits.
However, despite the degenerative disease, Campbell told People he still enjoys making music and appreciates the support his fans have shown him.
I still love making music," Campbell told the magazine. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."
