I've been walkin' these streets so long Singin' the same old song I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway Where hustle's the name of the game And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain  There's been a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me  Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone  Well, I really don't mind the rain And a smile can hide all the pain But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way And I dream of the things I'll do With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe  There'll be a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me  Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Rhinestone cowboy Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone

Glen Campbell "Good Times Again DVD"
Jul 27, 2007 3:33 AM
In the late '60s, Glen Campbell had the world on a string—or better yet, strings. As a hotshot session guitarist, he worked with artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to Merle Haggard, and did a stint with the Beach Boys, replacing Brian Wilson on tour dates. "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" and "Wichita Lineman" made Glen a star. America witnessed the full range of his talent in early 1969 when The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour joined the CBS prime-time lineup. Glen Campbell Good Times Again collects the show's greatest moments, with the genial host reminiscing about his famous guest artists. You'll take a surreal truck ride with Glen and Roger "King of the Road" Miller, catch Ray Charles at "Crying Time," and wonder why Tom Smothers is astride the fattest "hoss" this side of Botswana. Good times, indeed.

The footage is from his old TV show, and was edited together with some clips from a Gene Autrey movie.  Look for a quick cameo from Lone Ranger kimosabe Jay Silverheels.

Oct 30, 2006 10:29 PM
Footage of Glen waiting to shoot his video, "Living in a House Full of Love," in Phoenix. He would stand around with the gutiar and run scales, sing songs- whatever came to his head. This song was off the cuff.  I had a hard time understanding the lyrics.  I googled a phrase, and found that the song is "Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives To Me."  He probably hadn't sung the song in years, but was spot on with the lyrics.  The best playing I've ever seen is Glen Campbell with guitar, waiting around for things to be set up.

This was my first foray into the broadcasting world with an interview I had with Glen Campbell.  (Evidently my last too!) The intent is certainly not to bring any embarrassment to Mr. Campbell regarding the issue of "fallen and secrets of binge drinking.  My plan of attack was coming more from a musicians point of view . . . wanting to get as much as I could about his days as a session player in Los Angeles during what I call now, "the golden years."  Incidently, the opening intro track is Bruce Bishop on guitar from his first solo venture called "Real Life."  Bruce can be seen in the Hot Pecans video "Flip, Flop, Fly" doing a masterful work on both lead guitar and vocals.
