[ edit ] 1950s–mid 1960s: Sandia Mountain Boys, session musician, Beach Boys
Glen Campbell was born in Billstown, a tiny community near Delight in Pike County, Arkansas . He was the seventh son of 12 children. His father was a sharecropper of Scottish descent. [3] [4] He started playing guitar as a youth without learning to read music. He credits his uncle Boo for teaching him the guitar. [5]
In 1954 Campbell moved to Albuquerque to join his uncle’s band known as Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys. [6] There he also appeared on his uncle’s radio show [5] and on K Circle B Time, the local children's program on KOB television. [7] In 1958 Campbell formed his own band, the Western Wranglers. [6]
In 1960, Campbell moved to Los Angeles to become a session musician . [8] Around that time he was part of the group the Champs , famous for their instrumental "Tequila". Soon Campbell was in great demand as a session musician. He was part of a group of studio musicians that became known as " the Wrecking Crew ". [9] During this period he played on recordings by Bobby Darin, Rick Nelson, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, The Monkees, Nancy Sinatra, Merle Haggard, Jan and Dean [8] , Elvis Presley [10] , Frank Sinatra and Phil Spector. [9]
From December 1964 to early March 1965, Campbell was a touring member of the Beach Boys , filling in for Brian Wilson . [11] He also played guitar on the group's Pet Sounds album, among other recordings. On tour, he played bass guitar and sang falsetto harmonies.
In 1967 Campbell was the uncredited lead vocalist on "My World Fell Down" by Sagittarius , a studio group. The song reached #70 on the Billboard Hot 100 . [12]
[ edit ] 1961-1966: Early solo career
By January 1961 [13] Campbell had found a daytime job at publishing company American Music, writing songs and recording demos. [5] In May 1961 he left The Champs [14] and subsequently got signed by Crest Records, a subsidiary of American Music. His first release, "Turn Around Look At Me", was a moderate success, peaking at number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. [15] He also formed The Gee Cees with former bandmembers from The Champs, performing at The Crossbow Inn in Van Nuys, a Los Angeles suburb. [16] The Cee Gees too released a single on Crest, the instrumental "Buzzsaw", which did not chart.
In 1962 Campbell signed with Capitol records. [17] After minor initial success with "Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry", his first single for the label, and "Kentucky Means Paradise", released by The Green River Boys featuring Glen Campbell, a string of unsuccesful singles and albums followed.
From 1964 on Campbell began to appear on television as a regular on Star Route, a syndicated c&w tv show hosted by Rod Cameron [18] , ABC's Shindig! and Hollywood Jamboree. [19]
In 1965 he had his biggest hit yet, reaching number 45 on the Hot 100 with a version of Buffy Sainte-Marie 's Universal Soldier . However, when asked about the pacifist message of the song, he stated that "people who are advocating burning draft cards should be hung." [20]
The follow-up singles didn't do well though and Capitol was considering dropping Campbell from the label in 1966 when he was teamed with producer Al DeLory. [21] Together they first collaborated on "Burning Bridges" which became a top 20 country hit in early 1967 [22] , and the album of the same name.
Campbell and De Lory collaborated again on 1967's Dylanesque " Gentle on My Mind ", written by John Hartford .
"Gentle on My Mind" was an overnight success. It was followed by the even bigger triumph of " By the Time I Get to Phoenix " later in 1967, and " I Wanna Live " and " Wichita Lineman " in 1968. The 1969 song “True Grit” by composer Elmer Bernstein and lyricist Don Black, and sung by Campbell, who co-starred in the movie, received nominations for both the Academy Award for Best Song and the Golden Globe.
Campbell won four Grammy Awards for his performances on "Gentle on My Mind" and "By the Time I Get to Phoenix".
His biggest hits in the late 1960s were the songs written by Jimmy Webb : "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," " Wichita Lineman ", " Galveston ", and "Where's the Playground, Susie?" An album of mainly Webb-penned compositions, Reunion: The Songs of Jimmy Webb , was released in 1974, but it produced no hit single records.
"Wichita Lineman" was selected as one of the greatest songs of the 20th century by Mojo magazine in 1997 and by Blender in 2001.

With Campbell's session-work connections, he hosted major names in music on his show including: the Beatles (on film), David Gates and Bread , the Monkees , Neil Diamond , Linda Ronstadt , Johnny Cash , Merle Haggard , Willie Nelson , Waylon Jennings , Roger Miller and helped launch the careers of Anne Murray , Mel Tillis and Jerry Reed who were regulars on his Goodtime Hour program.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Campbell released a long series of singles and appeared in the movies True Grit (1969) with John Wayne and Kim Darby and Norwood (1970) with Kim Darby and Joe Namath .
After the cancellation of his CBS series in 1972, Campbell remained a regular on network television. He co-starred in a made-for-television movie , Strange Homecoming , with Robert Culp and up-and-coming teen idol, Leif Garrett . He hosted a number of television specials, including 1976's Down Home, Down Under with Olivia Newton-John . He co-hosted the American Music Awards from 1976–78 and headlined the 1979 NBC special, Glen Campbell: Back To Basics with guest-stars Seals and Crofts and Brenda Lee . He was a guest on many network talk and variety shows, including: Donny & Marie , the Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , Cher , the Redd Foxx Comedy Hour, Merv Griffin , The Midnight Special with Wolfman Jack , DINAH! , Evening at Pops with Arthur Fiedler and the Mike Douglas Show . From 1982–83 he hosted a 30-minute syndicated music show on NBC, the Glen Campbell Music Show .
In the mid-1970s, he had more big hits with " Rhinestone Cowboy ", " Southern Nights " (both U.S. #1 hits), "Sunflower" (U.S. #39) (written by Neil Diamond ), and " Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.)." (U.S. #11).
"Rhinestone Cowboy" was Campbell's largest-selling single, initially with over 2 million copies sold in a matter of months. Campbell had heard the songwriter Larry Weiss' version while on tour of Australia in 1974 and felt it was the perfect song for him to record. It was included in the Jaws movie parody song "Mr. Jaws", which also reached the top 10 in 1975. "Rhinestone Cowboy" continues to be used in movie soundtracks and TV shows, including " Desperate Housewives ", Daddy Day Care , and High School High . It was the inspiration for the 1984 Dolly Parton / Sylvester Stallone movie Rhinestone .
Campbell made a techno/pop version of the song in 2002 with UK artists Rikki & Daz and went to the top 10 in the UK with the dance version and related music video.
"Southern Nights," by Allen Toussaint , his other #1 pop-rock-country crossover hit, was generated with the help of Jimmy Webb , who turned Campbell onto the song, and Jerry Reed , who inspired the famous guitar lick introduction to the song, which was the most-played jukebox number of 1977.
From 1971 to 1983 , Campbell was the celebrity host of the Los Angeles Open , an annual professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour .
