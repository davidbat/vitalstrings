Brad Paisley , Vince Gill and Keith Urban will pay special tribute to Glen Campbell during the 2011 CMA Awards. The tribute comes as Campbell supports his last album, ‘Ghost in the Canvas.’ Campbell recorded such classics as ‘Rhinestone Cowboy’ and ‘Galveston,’ but says that ‘Ghost in the Canvas’ has very special significance for him as he takes his final bows as a performer.
“The songs actually speak for themselves,” Campbell says in an interview with The Boot about the album. “All I thought about was ‘sing it in tune with feeling.’ I don’t want it loud, I don’t want it soft, I just want it nice and comfortable because if you get the feeling out of a song, you’ve won the war. I’ve had that happen on occasions where it all just fell in place. Amazing. Everything sounds so good. It’s just like you’re in a room with somebody.”
The personal sentiments on the album are reflected by those that have and will honor Campbell and his career. At an intimate performance last month at the Nashville studios of Sirius XM satellite radio, Campbell’s old flame Tanya Tucker was in attendance . The two had a turbulent relationship and hadn’t seen each other for more than 20 years before that show.
“There’s nothing bitter about it,” Tucker said when asked if the reunion was bittersweet. “It’s all sweet. He was funny as usual and always on pitch. He’s a great singer and he’s funny.”
Tucker didn’t speak to Campbell at the performance or at any time since his diagnosis, but she said it was vital she see him perform.
“He’s just so great,” she noted. “We want him to be a long time going. Because he’s such a wonderful … legend, really. He’s always been so great. He’s still got it. I’ve loved him since I was about 8 years old. I still do. That never will go away.”
The 2011 CMA Awards, which will air on Nov. 9 on ABC, will be hosted by Paisley and Carrie Underwood .
