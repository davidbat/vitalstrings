Glen performed on recording sessions, as many as 500 date a year from 1962-1968.  Artists included Elvis, Rick Nelson, Frank Sinatra, Jan & Dean, Beach Boys, Dean Martin, Nancy Sinatra, Ray Charles, and hundreds more.  He was a member of The Beach Boys for six months and also was a member of The Champs.

Glen Campbell earned his right to be inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame long before his own career as a feature artist ever took off.  From approx 1960 to 1967 he was one of THE most in-demand guitarists of the LA music sceen; everyone wanted him to play on their records.  In addition to playing on records by such luminaries as Elvis Presley, The Monkees, Mammas and the Papas, Dean Martin, Frank and Nancy Sinatra, Jan & Dean, the Righteous Brothers and a host of others (not to mention a number of world famous records produced by Phil Spector), he was also a member of the Beach Boys.  He played as a session guitarist on most of the Beach Boys' biggest hits, and when Brian Wilson fell ill in 1965, they invited Glen to take his place in the group, which he did for about a year.  They offered him a permanent position in the band, but Glen had other career aspirations and the rest, as they say, is history.
So: will Glen Campbell ever be inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame?  Probably not.  Is he deserving of the honor?  Absolutely and without question, yes!

Glen should be considered for induction for "Wichita Lineman" alone if nothing else. So many artists have stated that this is there favorite song of all time. And Glen has been named as a major influence on there music career.
Glen still has the ability to attract a large following of loyal fans,even 40 years on

AS others here have stated, Glen Campbell was a session LEGEND in the 60s. That's his guitar work on the First Editions psych-drenched 'What Condition My Condition Was In' and the 12 string intro to The Beach Boys classic 'Dance Dance Dance', and yeah, that him playing on Sinatra's 'Strangers In The Night'. WE could go on for hours on his work on chart hits alone.Glen was probably the most sought after west coast session guitarist in the mid 60s. He belongs in the R&R HOF.

Glen Campbell going in as a sideman...that does make some sense. He really is a great guitar player!

For years I could never admit to my buddies that I thought "Wichita Lineman" ruled totally.  Then one day, driving along w/ these same friends, that song came on, and when I went to change it (thinking someone else would do so if I opted not to), I was challenged on it.  After that, everything was cool.  I thought a car full of die-hard Metallica fans would never concede to Glen Campbell, but...

Besides  his own stuff. He was a great sideman studio player in the "GOLD STAR STUDIO" DAYS FROM THE BEACH BOYS, BYRDS ,TO THE MONKEYS ....

Here's one for ya, mrxyz...I think Campbell should definitely get some consideration, especially as a sideman. Besides having a decent solo career, he was at one time a member of the Wrecking Crew, played with the Beach Boys, and was at one time probably THE most sought after session guitarist around.
To me, he was to guitar what Hal Blaine was to drums... He does take a really bad mug shot, though...LOL!!!!!

Yes as Sideman or Act a true surf guitar guy
From Beach boy to country boy
Surfs UP!

If his solo career had been more sporadic and less prolific, he'd probably already be in as a Side-Man by now.  His career as a musician, especially in the field of country music, inhibits his chances of Side-Man induction more than anything else, imo.

Yes to the Wichita Lineman.

The football team I played on when I was a teen changed the words of Wichita Lineman to Warlord Lineman. Great song; both versions ;-)
We used to play Ironman before each game. Then we started playing W.L. as well.
Great musician.

Very deserving.  Just for Galveston and Wichita Lineman alone (although pennned by Jimmy Webb - is he in yet?)

From artist, writer to sideman  Heck he even had his own TV show..  YES

Glen Campbell would fit in the RRHOF perfectly as a sideman for his session work with the Wrecking Crew

Well if I had bothered to read the comments before I posted I would have seen what I said had already been said (and more than once too!!). Oh well, guess that's what happens when one misses the initial wave of discussions on some of these pages.

I hear Glen Campbell is ill; it would be great if he could be inducted sooner rather than later.
Wichita Lineman is one of those perfect songs, along with all of his other great vocals.
