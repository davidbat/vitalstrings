Singer, guitarist, TV host and actor Glen Campbell, born in Delight, Arkansas, is an inspiration to musicians in how to climb the ladder of success one step at a time. Campbell started out as a sessions musician whose job was to be ready at a moments notice to back up artists during live-on-stage performances. Having the versatility of singing and playing gospel, country, folk, pop and rock music, coupled with being taught how to read music by his uncle, made Campbell quite successful as a sessions member.
Glen Campbell holds several interesting records. He holds trophies from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Campbell also holds a record for having 4 Grammys in both country and pop music.
When the opportunity to appear during the summer hiatus for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Campbell debuted his own show The Glen Campbell Good Time Hour. Drawing from his time in the sessions member circuit, Campbell was able to land such big names as The Beatles, The Monkees, and Johnny Cash as guests.
Without the help of producer Al DeLoy, working with Campbell on 'Guitar On My Mind', he might never have been successful as a solo artist and the world would never have heard his rendition of 'Rhinestone Cowboy' which Campbell picked up while on tour in Australia.
Campbell is among the very few who have had a festival performed in their honor, a concert DVD and a videoclip library including ones from his TV show.
