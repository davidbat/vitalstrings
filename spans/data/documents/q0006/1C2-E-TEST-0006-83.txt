Country singer Glen Campbell was arrested in November 2003 on drunk driving and hit and run charges. According to Arizona cops, the 67-year-old performer was nabbed shortly after plowing his BMW into another auto at a Phoenix intersection. He left the accident scene, but was arrested at his nearby home, where cops smelled booze on his breath and noted that Campbell looked smashed. After he was booked into a Maricopa County lockup, Campbell kneed a sergeant in the thigh--for which the country star was hit with an aggravated assault on a police officer charge. Campbell posed for the bottom mug shot in July 2004 after checking into a Phoenix lockup to serve the first of ten nights in jail. The singer, now 68, pleaded guilty in May to extreme DUI and leaving the scene of an accident.
