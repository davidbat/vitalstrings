Glen Campbell
( Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times )
Glen Campbell's career stretches over five decades, from his early years as a session guitarist in Los Angeles when he played on recordings by Phil Spector, the Beach Boys, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and many others, to his success as a solo artist with such hits as "Gentle on My Mind," "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "Galveston" and "Rhinestone Cowboy."
He spent years hosting the CBS TV show "The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour" and enjoyed a side career as an actor in the original film version of "True Grit," in which he appeared alongside star John Wayne.
But along with the ups, there have been many downs.
