Animator Don Bluth renders the rousing musical tale of Chanticleer (voiced by country singer Glen Campbell), a foolhardy farm rooster who believes his crows can actually make the sun come up and shine. When the sun rises one morning without Chanticleer's crow, he leaves the farm in disgrace and runs off to become a rock 'n' roll singer. But in his absence, a sinister, sunshine-hating owl (Christopher Plummer) prepares to take over.
