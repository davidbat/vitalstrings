I wish God's greatest blessings of peace and comfort on Glen and his wife as they go through this experience. He's been a wonderful talent for many years...I hope he can enjoy this last tour and project without too many struggles.

How sad.  Some of my best memories are while listening to Glen sing while riding in the car with the boyfriend.  Still remember those warm Summer nights.
God Bless Glen and God speed.

glen campbell has had a good career in the music business, i know he did a lot in the seventies, he is 75 years old and singers do carry on as long as they can, but this age is no surprise, as we get older we do have a little memory loss, some people are worse than others, i thought he had retired, the fans obviously love hm, sorry to hear that he has been diagnosed with alzheimers, i know he will be sad in doing his farewell concerts and putting everything in order before his memory goes altogether, he will be retiring from the limelight, best wishes to you.

Best wishes to Glen and his family. I have been a fan for a very long time. This is sad to hear. I wish Glen all the strength and God's blessings in coping with this disease.

Very sad!  I think this is best for Glenn to save embarrassment for him and his family and to the people worldwide who are his fans.
Enjoy your time and take each day as it comes!
