One of 12 children.  Received his first guitar at age 4.  Began playing in country bands at 14.  Left school at 16 to pursue music full-time.  Formed his own band, the Western Wranglers, at age 18.  Moved to L.A. in the late 1950s to become a studio musician.  Briefly joined the Champs, best known for their hit "Tequila."  Became part of the famed "Wrecking Crew"--a group of session musicians who played on many Phil Spector sessions.  Released his first single, "Turn Around, Look at Me," in 1961. One of the people who heard it on the radio: a 14-year-old Jimmy Webb, who would go on to write many of Campbell's classic hits.  Became a touring member of the Beach Boys after Brian Wilson retired from the road in 1965, but decided against joining them full-time.  Had his big breakthrough in 1967 with "Gentle on My Mind" and the Webb-penned "By the Time I Get to Phoenix."  Scored five No. 1 country hits ("I Wanna Live," "Wichita Lineman," "Galveston," "Rhinestone Cowboy" and "Southern Nights") and two No. 1 pop hits ("Rhinestone Cowboy," "Southern Nights") during his career.  Published his autobiography,  Rhinestone Cowboy , in 1994.  Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2005.  Has his own theater in Branson, MO.  Announced in 2011 that he has Alzheimer's disease.   ~ Rovi
