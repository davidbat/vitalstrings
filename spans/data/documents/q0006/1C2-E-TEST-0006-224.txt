Biography of Glen Campbell
In 1960 this son of Delight, AR, went to Hollywood and became a session man supreme. As a sideman he played with Ricky Nelson, Elvis, the Beach Boys, and many other famous performers. His big hit came in 1967, when he took the John Hartford composition "Gentle on My Mind" to the top, winning two Grammys along the way. Jimmy Webb's "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" was an even bigger smash and yielded two more Grammys. Then came TV fame (The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour), and the movies (True Grit, with John Wayne). His country-pop style found an eager audience, and Glen had great success with "Galveston," "Wichita Lineman," "Oklahoma Sunday Morning," "It's Only Make-Believe," "Rhinestone Cowboy," and "Southern Nights." Over the years he's recorded more than 40 albums, 12 of them going gold and 7 platinum. His country charm, good looks, and considerable talent have kept him at the top for more than a quarter-century. ~ David Vinopal
