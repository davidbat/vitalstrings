The fact that the sky is blue is all due to the physical phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which causes the light from the sun to scatter all around when it passes through some particles in the atmosphere that have a diameter that is actually one-tenth of the wavelength of the sunlight. Sunlight is actually make up of different colors of light, ranging from red, violet, blue, green and orange, each having its own wavelength, and blue is scattered much more efficiently, due to the elements of the atmosphere and blue light having the least wavelength. All the blue light that you seen coming from the sky is actually your naked eyes deceiving you. It is actually the atoms in the atmosphere that is dispersing blue light towards you, while the rest of the lights aren't scattered that well, so blue light is more prominent amongst the lights dispersed throughout the sky.
Light always passes through space from the Sun in a straight line, unscattered and untouched. As it passes through the atmosphere, it would bounce off a occasional dust and water molecule along the way, so it will get bounced off and ricocheted off in different directions, all the different colors of the light get reflected the same way. Whatever you look at the sky, some of the blue light get radiated to your own eyes from overhead, and it appears blue in the end.
But, if you try to look closer and forward enough, you will see the sky appears to be paler than before, as it has to pass through more clouds to reach you far below, so some of the blue light would get scattered away in different directions again, so the color of the sky of the horizon appears to become white when you get closer enough.
Of course, if you were in the moon or some distant and forgotten planets, you will realize that the scenario that you seen on Earth would be completely different from what you see at the moon. The sky would actually turn black as there is no atmosphere, so no molecules to reflect any light towards your eyes, so it would turn dark. Anonymous

Well Texas,that's a difficult one. Mostly has to do with our Atmosphere,that is made up of 78% Nitrogen,21% Oxygen and whats left over are traces gas ,dust and other particles.Now how light reacts to these elements is how we get the color blue.Light is an energy that Radiates or travels in Waves.Light is a Wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields.It is a small part of a larger vibrating electromagnetic field that we call the Electromagnetic Field.Visible light is part of the Spectrum that we can see.Like when we see a Rainbow in the sky.At one end we can see Reds & Oranges and gradually shade into Yellow,Green,Blue,Indigo & Violet.Now Red has the longest Wavelength and Violet has the Shortest.Light travels thru space in a straight line as long as it is not disturbed.As it passes thru our Atmosphere it travels in a straight line until it runs into Gases and Dust.
What happens next depends on the lights wavelength and the size of the object it hits.
As the light passes thru our atmosphere the longer wavelengths(the strongest,Reds & Oranges) pass right thru.They are just to stronge to be effected by whats in our Atmosphere.The shorter Wavelengths(the weakest,Blue,Indigo & Violet) are absorbed by
the Gases and Molecules.The absorbed Blue lights are Radiated into different directions.
It gets scattered all over the sky.Wherever you look some of the scattered light reaches
you.Since you see the Blue light overhead,that is why the Sky is Blue. Anonymous

The atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans.
The composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot.
The atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space.

Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The gas molecules in the atmosphere interact with the sunlight before the light reaches our eyes.The gas molecules in the atmosphere scatter the higher-energy (high frequency) blue portion of the sunlight more than they scatter the lower-energy redportion of the sunlight (this is called Rayleigh scattering, named for the physicist Lord John Rayleigh). The Sun appears reddish-yellow and the sky surrounding the Sun is colored by the scattered blue waves.
When the Sun is lower in the horizon (near sunrise or sunset), the sunlight must travel through a greater thickness of atmosphere than it does when it is overhead, and even more light is scattered (not just blue, but also green, yellow, and orange) before the light reaches your eyes. This makes the sun look much redder. Anonymous

The sunlight interacting with the Earth's atmosphere makes the sky blue. He minute particles of matter and molecules of air in the atmosphere
intercept and scatter the white light of the sun. A larger portion of
the blue color in white light is scattered, more so than any other
color because the blue wavelengths are the shortest. When the size of
atmospheric particles are smaller than the wavelengths of the colors,
selective scattering occurs-the particles only scatter one color and
the atmosphere will appear to be that color. Blue wavelengths
especially are affected, bouncing off the air particles to become
visible. Anonymous

Not all time, here's my two simple answers on this.
First, the sky is blue because it is in the day time. The sunlight is more what can you see that governs the appearance of the outer space that came to be a light blue one.
Second, in the night, the sky seems to be dark because the is no sunlight except the moonlight but it seems that the moonlight can lighten the sky as the sun can. Anonymous

The sky seems blue for the reason that after sunlight filters through the oxygen in the atmosphere, all other colors except blue are absorbed by the oxygen. This is the fact that color of the sky is not so blue but it is black though, is because just twenty percent of the atmosphere is oxygen. Anonymous
