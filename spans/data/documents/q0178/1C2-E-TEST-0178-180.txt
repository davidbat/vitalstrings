Water absorbs radiant energy ("light").  Water will more quickly absorb light with longer wavelengths.  Water absorbs microwave and infra red wavelengths almost immediately, and visible red relatively quickly.  If the red part of the spectrum is absorbed, then the gree/blue colors remain.
gree-to-blue light is going to be scattered in the upper layers of water, so when viewed from above, water appers to be green-blue.
The sky is blue due to scattering entirely.  The blue light from the sun hits air molecules and is absorbed mometarily, then re-emitted in a random direction.  REd light does not get so easily absorbed/re-emitted and thus maintains more of a straight line path, hence orange-red sunsets.
The notion of water reflecting the sky is an oft-quoted misconception that is unfortunately still taught in grade-school "science" textbooks.
