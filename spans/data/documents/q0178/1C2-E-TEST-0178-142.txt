A simple answer is that the air filters out some of the blue light, and lets the red and yellow part of the spectrum pass straight through.  The blue light that is filtered out gets bounced around from air molecule to air molecule, before it finally reaches us on the ground. So to us, the blue light seems to be coming from everywhere; so the sky seems blue.
The scientific term for this is 'Rayleigh scattering', and is actually a quite complicated process. What happens is that the blue light tends to interact with the air molecules, gets absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule; then absorbed and re-emitted by another molecule. This happens many times, before the blue light reaches us on the ground.  However, the effect is as if the blue light gets 'bounced around' from molecule to molecule.
