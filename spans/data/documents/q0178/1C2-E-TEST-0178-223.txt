I think the sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.

From the Wikipedia article I referenced above:
The sky appears blue because air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. When we look toward a part of the sky not near the sun, the blue color we see is blue light waves scattered down toward us from the white sunlight passing through the air overhead. Near sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even yellow light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red.

Or its because of the particles in the atmostphere and how light reflects off of them. Not the ocean, or any other stuff. A blue sky reflects the color blue back to our eyes.

The light reflects the colour of the sea causing the sky to look blue. :D

because of a process called scaterring in which the sun rays are refracted through air particles. but blue colour deviates the maximum. so sky appears blue.

the sky is not really blue.its color violet.Violet has the longest wavelength among the 8 colors but our eyes is sensitive to this color that's why we see the sky blue which has the 2nd longest wavelength.
