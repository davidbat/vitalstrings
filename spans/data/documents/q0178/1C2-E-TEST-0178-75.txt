Initial Cloud Formation
Why is the Sky Blue?
If you were to travel 20 miles or so above the Earth's surface, the     sky would appear black. What happens during light's descent to Earth that     makes the sky take on a wonderful azure hue?
"White" sunlight passes through our atmosphere, and molecules     in the air, primarily nitrogen, are just the right size to scatter light     from the blue end of the visible spectrum. The other colors travel to the     ground with little interference.The blue light is scattered from molecule     to molecule in the sky, until the light seems to be coming from every direction.
 
And Clouds are White Because...?
...the water droplets that make up clouds are much larger than the molecules     that scatter blue light. The clouds scatter and reflect all the visible     colors of light that strike them. Hence, we have white clouds.
 
But if the cloud is thick enough, light does not penetrate completely     through the cloud, resulting in dark, heavy-looking cloud bottoms.
 
Why do clouds form?
Clouds are nothing more than water vapor that condenses and accretes into a visible form.     The usual mechanism is for moisture-laden air near the Earth's surface     to be raised higher into the atmosphere either by an encroaching air mass     or the heat of the sun. As the air is lifted, the pressure drops and the     air is subsequently cooled. The combination of the two causes water vapor     to condense.
