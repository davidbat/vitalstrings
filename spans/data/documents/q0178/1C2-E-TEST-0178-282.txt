Heeheee, you bitch !!  You know how to get a guys attention, damn women. >:)))
Pyramid water, these guys would freak out.
To start off, in what stream should I piss in the corner... Haa haa, couldn't even talk about "push" verus "pull" without cries of foul !!

It is the oxygen that is doing this, pure oxygen does this as well, in fact even better !!You're wrong about this. It is not the oxygen its self that makes water blue, but vibrations within the molecule along the bond between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
Proof: D2O (water that has deuterium instead of hydrogen, also called heavy water) is not blue because the heavier mass of deuterium causes the molecule to vibrate differently and absorb light in the infrared region, rather than red. D2O is not blue, even though it has the same oxygen content as normal water.

You are convincing Nasor.  Good work.
What  do you consider Rayleigh scattering to be due to ?

Raleigh scatering is due to diffraction. A light wave interacting with the edge of a particle is bent. After a number of interactions its direction is basically random.
Now for your claim that oxygen colors the sky:
Go out on a sunny day and stand in a shadow (with the sky visible). Is it dark there? No, because there is a lot of light coming from the blue sky. What is the source of that light? It is the sun. If the light from the sun is gone, like at night or during a solar eclipse, the sky is black.
How can light from the sun reach you from other parts of the sky? Because it is being scattered. But the blue color, can't it come from filtering through oxygen? No, because the color would depend on how far the light travelled through air, thus the sky would be less blue directly overhead. This is not what we observe.

I have to admit that when I saw liquid oxygen in the lab, (it is blue, by the way)  the same thought crossed my mind; perhaps the sky is blue because oxygen is blue.
However, I believe the Rayleigh scattering explanation is correct,
and the blue colour of LOX is a coincidence.
Look at blue Neptune, for instance; no oxygen to speak of, but a pretty colour none-the-less.

I do agree with mie scattering, this is occurring everywhere..
As for H20 and O2 being blue and D20 not being blue, I don't know.. That is an interest !!

Come on! Stop trolling and show your colors (pun intended). Explain your thesis and show how it fits observations. So far, your explanation is contradicted by what anybody can observe on a clear day.

The Aurora is due to charged particles from the Sun being accelerated by the Earths Magnetic field, by synchrotron acceleration, and giving off photons. The different colours are then given by O, N and other gases being excited by the charged particles. At least, if memory serves.

A valid criticism, but the intensity of the blue varies from day to day...
The Sun's rays would be reasonably constant.....
Therefore the process is somewhat independant of the Sun.
The pale sky could be O2 or background Rayleigh scattering ?
The intensification maybe due to water content ?
OR one may conclude that the level of O2 in the atmosphere varies ??
The truth usually lies in the compromise.

Because there is also scattering from water mist and dust particles. This has a different frequency characteristic than Raleigh scattering and varies with time and meteorological conditions. The resultant mix of scattered frequencies (color) may thus change.

Yes, such variations as exist in the radiation from the Sun are imperceptible to our eyes.
Therefore the process is somewhat independant of the Sun.
As mentioned above, various atmospheric conditions contribute to the color of the sky.

See above.
OR one may conclude that the level of O2 in the atmosphere varies ??
No. That has been researched, any variations are minute.
The truth usually lies in the compromise.
In this case in a combination: Blue from Raleigh Scattering, white, gray, and other colors from mist, dust, etc.
