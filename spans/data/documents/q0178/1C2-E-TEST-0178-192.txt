Why is the sky blue?
As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. This causes the sky to seem blue in colour.
