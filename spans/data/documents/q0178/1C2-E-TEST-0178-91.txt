When light hits our atmosphere it refracts off all the atoms in the atmosphere making it look that colure and btw you asked why grass was green its green becuase green is the weakist colour in the order of colours so the closer to the sun you are the more green plants youll see like blue is the strongest colour so if you go deep deep in the ocean were only strong rays of light can make it you will see blue plants only while on land they dislike green light so it just reflects off that plant overall the colour you see a plant is the colour they dislike so grass is green becuase they do not like the colour green red algie is red becuase they dont like the colour green ^^ hope this helpd guys.
