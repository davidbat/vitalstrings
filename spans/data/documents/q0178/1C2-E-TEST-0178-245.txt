Why is the sky blue?
A question oft asked but rarely answered correctly.
Many have restorted to “because it is” or “it’s the sea reflecting back” but the correct answer is simple, though at first it sounds complicated.
 
The sky is blue because colours have different wavelengths.
Air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths.
Blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, as the diagram below shows.
The blue light is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light.
More blue light reaches the observer’s eyes than other colours.
 
There you go, take that you pesky kids.
Have a bit of science now on to the swings…
