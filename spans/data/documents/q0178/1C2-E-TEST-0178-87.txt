THAT HAVE BEEN DISTURBED BY LIGHT PASSING NEARBY
AND IS NOW RADIATED BY THE ELECTRONS
WE CALL THE RADIATED LIGHT
SCATTERED LIGHT!
4. This is called RAYLEIGH SCATTERING after John William Strutt Rayleigh (Lord Rayleigh).
Sunlight is scattered in all directions in the atmosphere by Oxygen and Nitrogen molecules, which are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Because the O2 and N2 molecules are small all the electrons experience the same force at the same time making this a fairly straightforward situation. In bigger molecules electrons may be moving in different directions and scattering in much more complex ways.
BUT STEVE! (you exclaim with great anticipation)...
that explains why the sky is lighted....you still have not explained why it is blue!
(I reply...eager to satisfy your curiosity)...
I was just about to get to that!....take  a look at the diagram below.
Because red light has a longer wavelength than blue light (recall that white light from the sun is the sum of Red-Orange-Yellow-Green-Blue-Violet) the electrons are accelerated (jiggled) back and forth faster by blue light than by red light AND THEREFORE more blue light is scattered than red light (It may not be obvious from this but blue light jiggles the electrons faster than red, orange, yellow or green light so they radiate - that is scatter - blue light). As a matter of fact if you look into the mathematics that describes this (I will not do that here) we find that 4.92 times more blue light (wavelength 470 nanometers) is scattered than red light (700 nanometers).
This is what Lord Rayleigh discovered:
THE SHORTER THE  WAVELENGTH OF INCIDENT LIGHT...
THE MORE THE LIGHT IS SCATTERED
