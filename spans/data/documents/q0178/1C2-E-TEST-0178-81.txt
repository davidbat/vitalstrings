Why is the Sky Blue?
A myth submitted to the site by ISSA
world, england
You wonder why the sky is blue.. you I know the answers
In Europe, well they only do europe because they only got a couple of hours till people start wake up and get ready for work,Mickey Mouse and Minnie mouse paint the black sky blue! Now you must wonder how many buckets of blue paint they use… lets say about.. 234567 buckets… the sky is endless.
Usa and canda have it all different..  you see there are blue diamonds scattered all around there… how many you ask? Well I don’t really now…but there’s one in new York.. la… new jersey in a town called Wyckoff, where exactly? I don’t know.. opps and theres many more out there
In asian, the sky id simply blue because, well the ocean reflects on it… that was simple.
Last and most exciting is… Australia! There are 4 big giants, their name are north, south, east and west. Do u see where this is going? Bet you don’t. the reason why you cant see them is because they’re invisible. So I guess you could say that the sky there is a cloth and clouds were just printed there. And they spend the day holding the “sky” up.
So, now I guess leaves us with one question.. are they all the same shade of blue? Yes they are.. and how they are is a mystery………..
