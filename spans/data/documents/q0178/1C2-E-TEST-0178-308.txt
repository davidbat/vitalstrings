There are two reasons for the color of the sea; both of them contribute to  the answer.
A.  The sea reflects the sky.
You have probably noticed that the sea is not very blue-looking  when the sky is overcast.  Water reflects and scatters the light that  strikes it; this is shown by the fact that you can see your reflection in  puddles.  When the sky is brilliant blue, the sea is also, because it  reflects the blue of the sky.  A good answer to why the sky is blue has already been posted at MADSci.
B.  The sea refracts light just as the sky does .
Blue light is more easily bent, or refracted, than red light;  thus, light refracted back from the surface of the sea appears blue.   Furthermore, when you are underwater the water around you appears blue  because more blue light is scattered back to your eye than red light.  Here  are some professional  shots to show what I mean.
The scattering of light by the air, or by water, is called Rayleigh scattering .
