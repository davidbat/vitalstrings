OkieKnight: The sky is blue because as the light from the Sun travels through the Earths atmosphere it is broken down into its spectrum of light much like a prism or a rainbow.  More blue light is reflected towards the surface of the earth than any other part of the light spectrum.  This makes the sky appear to be blue.

jewls1_99: To do the why is the sky blue science project you will have to prove what causes the sky to be blue. Blue light is visible on the color spectrum, and is scattered through the atmosphere so our eyes see the blue.  For the project and ideas on what you will want to prove you can go to: http://parentingteens.about.com/od/scien... .
