Mis-information is at the heart of all of scientific inquiry.                  Plausible and implausible explanations need to be ruled out in                  order to understand what is really going on. Double-blind studies                  and other methods are good techniques that rule out mis-information.                  Once an explanation is ruled out it becomes fair game and fodder                  for sites like this to propound this information as if it were                  scientific fact. This site makes no apologies for dissemination                  of bogus facts, half-truths, shaky hypotheses and downright malicious                  lies, innuendo, tomfoolery and even shenanigans.
Science is not an exact science, someone once said. Okay, it                  was me. I said it. Be that as it may, the inexactness of science                  is what this website finds entertaining. Science can be art, you                  know. This is an earthy earth science site that contains little                  or no factual content whatsoever. What is informative about this?                  Whatsoever is the value in this, you ask?
What is noteworthy is that science and those who participate                  in scientific endeavors many times take themselves way too seriously.                  Under the Shenanigan Theory of Relativity, science itself cannot                  be analyzed and taken apart and put underneath a microscope. Smirks                  cannot be synthesized into something useful. When is the last                  time you took a bunch of scientific ribaldry and analyzed the                  similarities in their DNA markers? A tumor has no humor. But we                  do, so read on and take whatever we say with a grain of salt because                  by the time you're done we will taste as salty as the ocean is                  blue.
And that's a fact, Jacques! Or Jacqueline as the case may be.                  But I am babbling, so goodbye.
Okay, it's not goodbye as I have something more to say. Why Is                  The Sky Blue is not affiliated with any legitimate scientific                  organization whatsoever.
