Rayleigh Scattering in the atmosphere - why the sky is blue
Rayleigh Scattering
Scattering,                 continued:
Why is the sky blue?
It's because of Rayleigh scattering - the selective scattering of the                 shorter wavelengths of visible light (violet and                 blue) by atmospheric gases.
Note that Rayleigh scattering                 involves much smaller scattering particles than                 Mie scattering
if there were no atmosphere, what                 color would the sun look like?
