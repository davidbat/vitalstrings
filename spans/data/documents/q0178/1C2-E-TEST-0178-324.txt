Why The Sky Is Blue?  The Answer To One Of The Fundamental Questions Of Optics
Why the sky is blue is a fundamental question asked of people with knowledge in light and optics.
Sunlight entering the earthâ€™s atmosphere interacts with air molecules. Energy from the electromagnetic wave that is light, is transferred to the air molecules. This causes the charged particles within the air molecules to vibrate with the same frequency as the incident light.
The particles then throw the absorbed energy back out as scattered light. The electromagnetic field developed is proportional to the square of the frequency. From there, the energy of the field is proportional to the square of the field. As blue light has about twice the frequency of red light, the scattering is therefore around 16 times as strong for blue light. This makes the sky appear blue.
Sunsets appear red and orange because the lightwaves have to pass throught a greater amount of the atmosphere to reach the viewer. This means that almost the entire amount of blue light is scattered away leaving only the red end of the visual spectrum.
