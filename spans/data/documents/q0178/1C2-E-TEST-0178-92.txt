Why is the sky blue
Question: Why Is The Sky Blue?
Answer: The reason why the sky is blue to molecules 
in the air... due to Rayleigh scattering.
The white sunlight is made up of lots of different colours and as light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. 
When the blue light of sunlight passes through the sky it bounces off 
partials like oxygen and atoms which are floating in the air. It gets
scattered all around the sky.  Some colours of light travel through the air 
better than others so because violet and blue colours have the shortest 
wavelengths they get bounced around the most making the sky blue/violet.  
                                                                      
Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches us. Since we see the blue light from everywhere
overhead, this is why we perceive the sky as blue.
As we look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in colour. To reach us, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. But less blue light reaches our eyes. The colour of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.

Electromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec
(186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light.
