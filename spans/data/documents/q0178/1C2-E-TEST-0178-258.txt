When I found your website I chose your experiment on how to explain why
the sky is blue for a school project. But your experiment failed on me,
even though I followed your directions word for word. For some reason,
the experiment failed when I got to the part where I add powered milk to
the water in the aquarium. No light went through the aquarium when I
placed the flashlight to shine the light through the tank. Where did I go
wrong? Can you help me?
Please send back asap
