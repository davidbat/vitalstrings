Why is the Sky Blue?
According to Paul Doherty, of Scientific Explorations and Adventures the sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light to your eyes more strongly than red light, and that both blue components and red components are in the sun. Doherty states that the blue components scatter to the side whereas the red components of the sun travel in a straight pattern.
According to Little Shop of Physics at the Colorado State University, the sky is purple, not blue. Again, it has to do with the wave lengths of color and how they are scattered. According to English physicist Lord John Rayleigh, from the 1800's, the atmosphere doesn't absorb light, but the molecules redirect it.
It goes on to say that because air moledules are much smaller than the wave lengths of light, the interaction is much stronger for shorter wave lengths. Out of the spectrum, violet light has the shortest wave length, and by all accounts the sky should be purple. It says that our eyes seeing blue instead of purple is only due to limitations of our eyes.

Why is the sky red?
The sky is sometimes red during the sunset and/or the sunrise. But from what I've noticed, it's not always the case. Sometimes it's different colors. But here is the short of it on being red:
On Scientific Explorations and Adventures it said that the sunset being red is due to the blue being scattered to the sides more and the eye seeing more of the sun beam.
On Everyday Mysteriess from the Library of Congress site, it went on to say that the sunrise or sunset being red is because the sun is sitting low in the sky and that the "red sky suggests an atmosphere loaded with dust and moisture particles." So basically, the sun particles, being red and blue, are traveling through the thickest part of the atmosphere when the sun is on the horizon. The red wavelengths are longer and make it through, whereas the blue wavelengths are shorter and get scattered.
The Everyday Mysteriess from the Library of Congress site went on to explain that since the weather patterns normally travel from west to east, then the red sky in the evening is due to the sun sending its light through a high concentration of dust particles, which usually indicates high pressure and stable air coming in from the west. This means that good weather is to follow.
The Everyday Mysteriess from the Library of Congress site also explained that a red sunrise reflects the dust particles of a system that has just passed from the west, which indicates that a storm system may be moving to the east. Also, if the morning sky is a deep fiery red, it also means a high water content in the atmosphere, which indicates that rain is on the way.
Reading the sky has been around for a long time.
Jesus mentioned about the reading of the Sky in Mathew: 16: 2-3
He answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.' And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.'"
Red Sky in Morning
is associated with harsher weather.

Have you ever talked to the sky or Spirit and have the weather change?
Yes, I have, and I'm glad I did.
Are you kidding?
