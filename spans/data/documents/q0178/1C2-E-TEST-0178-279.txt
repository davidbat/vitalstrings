have you ever wandererd why the sky is blue? well this is a story why.
In a kingdom far, far away there was a king, the king was very nasty and foolish his name was Amzana. He owned a country, the country was called Pazamna. There was a blue bright crystal in a strong clear glass which kept the colours going.
One day the king had a plan he decided to hide the crystl in a fierce dragons cave. When the people found out it was not there, their colours began to fade and they surrounded the kingdom shouting "We want the crystal" over and over again. But the king would not reply.
Only one person new where it was the princess. So one dark gloomy day she went out for it but she did not know what creatures lived there.
As she entered the dark cave there was terrible noises, she crouched to the wall with fear, but it was not the wall it was all scaly as soon as she looked up she found herself in front of the black dragon, she thought it did not exist but it did......
In a wink of an eye the dragon woke up as it bumped her to the wall she saw the crystl, she crept to it and the dragon was in circles. Because it was to dizzy she chucked some rope to either side of the black dragon, and reached for the crystal and safely brought it back and placed it in the strong glass.
When they woke up the crystl was back and they all were glad. But the king was not but he thought to himself that his plans had never worked and that was the end of the crystal. Thats why we have a blue sky and the crystal is berried deep in the ground.
