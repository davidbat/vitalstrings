The sky is blue because the air scatters blue light more than other colours causing the sun to look yellow and the sky to look blue. This site has a great animation that is great for showing kids why the sky is blue.  It can explain it far better than words can: http://blogsworth.com/articles/why-is-the-sky-blue
