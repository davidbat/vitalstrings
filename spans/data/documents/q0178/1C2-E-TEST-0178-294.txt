The Lovereading comment:
This is our personal favourite in terms of Sally Grindley’s picture books here at Lovereading4kids.  It tells the story of rabbit and donkey.  Rabbit is very inquisitive and is always asking questions about everything! He wants to know why the sky is blue and his old friend, Donkey, knows a lot of things, and promises to teach him but doesn’t always quite get round to it. In fact, in the end their roles are reversed in this wonderfully uplifting tale of friendship.
