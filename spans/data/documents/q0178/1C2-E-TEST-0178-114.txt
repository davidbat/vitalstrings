Q:
Why is the sky blue?
A:
White sunlight is really a lot of different colors of light mixed together.
Some colors of light travel through air and dust better than others. Red goes a long, long way.
But blue light gets bounced around a lot. Our blue sky is blue light that has been bounced out of sunlight by gazillions of molecules of air.
