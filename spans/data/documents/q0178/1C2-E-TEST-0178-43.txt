Stars [like our sun] don'tï»¿ always explode and turn into black holes. Sometimes they turn into red giants and 1-get sucked up by a black hole, 2- run out of fuel and shrink down to small size + keep on burning for few billion years or 3- fall apart due to the lack of fuel + stop burning; other gravity sources become stronger and the star gets pulled apart to clouds of gases.
