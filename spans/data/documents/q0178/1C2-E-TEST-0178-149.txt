Question:
Why is the sky blue?
Replies:
Something called "Raleigh scattering".  Wavelengths of sunlight  that stimulate our eyes to see blue are reaching our eyeballs.  Air molecules  are even smaller than the wavelength of light and so they scatter (reflect in  all directions) the rays of light that come from the sun.  The air (oxygen and  nitrogen) molecules scatter the shorter wavelengths of light (violet, blue,  and green) much more effectively than the longer, redder wavelengths.  So our  eyes are bombarded from all directions by scattered blue light.  Dust scatters  all light equally so if the sky is real dusty it will look milky white.  I saw  this once during a wind storm and it was really excellent looking!!  Also that  is why the sky looks bluer in clean places like mountains.  Sunsets are  reddish because the light has to pass through more sky than during the day so  the bluer wavelengths are "scattered away" from our eye and the redder  wavelengths move on a more direct path to our eyes.
