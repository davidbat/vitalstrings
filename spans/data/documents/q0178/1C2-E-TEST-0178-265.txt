There is a four-year course at British Columbia Institution of Technology (BCIT) for marine engineer as well. After all, who needs to have a second language to be a marine engineer. The course is a co-op course which means you are in school six months and then on the water for six months, on training. You continue this for four years. The tuition fees are fairly minimal as well I believe.

Great.....So why is the federal government - unions all claiming that there is shortage of seafarers to the tune of 44,000 people per year. Why aren't people interested in a job on the water, or working in and around it....either in engineering or design, or even ship repair / building? Why are so many people so negative about it?
1. Not many hours avaialble to new people
2. Archais union structure for a lot of private marine jobs
3. Lack of education facilities available
4. Canada lacks trade people for many hundreds of jobs

Doug,
Does BCIT also provide you with work experience within the course - or is it up to you to find a company that will train you along with your course. Do you also get paid while doing the practical experience?
I have noticed that on a few of these course run by BCIT - that students are been employed on the Cruise ship end of the shipping business. How many have gone directly into BC Ferries. Do BC Ferries have any sort of Management training program - shore base and operational based?
Does BC Ferries have any tie in with BCIT on getting there employees...retrained or even trained.
I also know that BCIT have funding issue problems and could be dropping some of these courses - due to lack of take up from students..
So Doug...have you signed up?
I guess it's a bit late to add to this...but I was down at BCIT today.
If one signs up for the Nautical Sciences, or Marine Engineering Program, BCIT will set you up with work experience. One could get sent to the Great Lakes, Princess Cruise Lines, or some sort of high end Freight business. One is also paid during their work experience. How much? $500 a month. Doesn't sound like much, but if you don't have any finanncial issues at home, you'll be fine. The company that one does work experience with, has all expenses paid, meaning they will fly you across the world to get to the ship you're supposed to be on, and they will also pay for all of the food associated with it all. There is three, four month terms of work experience associated with the three year program.
The Nautical Sciences program has all of the required courses to operate a ship, including the fire fighting certificates. It is also said that 8 years after the day you started the program, one could also be able to operate any deep sea ship in the world.
If one were to take the courses individually, they would be on their own for finding work experience, and would most likely have to pay for everything themselves.
BCIT also carefully selects 16 people who have registered for the program. Each are ranked by their Grades, and courses they have taken.
It actually looks like I'm going to go to Capilano College for a year to get my Math and Physics 12, and a better English course to have a better chance of being accepted.

Stewie talks on Telephone: "Get me through to the Pentagon!! I've got three armed men surrounding Big Bird's nest. And- what's that?
Phone (Ernie): "Can you count to three?"
*Stewie shoots phone three times with machine gun*
Stewie: "Can I count to three. I'm already shooting at a fifth grade level."
Show Intro
Lois: "Stewie, you have to eat your broccoli sometime."
Stewie: "Never!"
Lois: "Open up for the airplane! bbbbbbbrrrggg!!"
*Stewie hits fork out of Lois' hand*
Stewie: D@MN YOU, D@MN THE BROCCOLI, AND D@MN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS!!
*Lois shoves broccoli in Stewie's mouth*
*Stewie spits out broccoli*
Stewie: "What the h#ll do you think your doing mother!!??
Later in the show
Stewie: "Well broccoli: Mother says you are good for me. Well I'm afraid I AM NO GOOD FOR YOU!! Won't talk, eh? Well there is one simple solution: the broccoli must die."

I need the hockey fans out there to clear something up for me.
Let's say you're watching both the Stanley Cup, and the World Cup.
Watching soccer, you'll notice that, generally, the more severe and intentional the collision, the more likely it is for a foul to be called. Watching hockey, you can be penalized for a very innocuous two handed shove with the hockey stick; a very naughty act refered to as cross checking. However, if you take a run at someone who has the puck along the boards, and hit him hard enough to shake the glass loose, it's fine, as long as he's not facing the boards with his head down. In fact, the harder the collision, (as long as it's a home town hero doing the damage), the more likely that all the knuckle-draggers in the crowd will be up on their hind legs, braying their approval. A teeny hook, penalty. Disc compressing assault, a-ok, as long as you keep your elbows down. Where's the logic in this? And why do hockey fans elevate collisions and violence into some admirable expression of macho gamesmanship?
As well, I suspect that if, in a hockey game, a player helped someone on the opposing team to his feet, the crowd would immediately start shouting slurs to his sexual orientation. Both games are great in their own way, and both can bring out the good and bad in fan and player alike, but I think soccer expresses a slightly higher level of civility, not to mention the undertanding that violence in itself isn't a praise worthy expression of game 'spirit'.

I did 26km of walking this morning, and a highlight was watching the Queen of Cowichan on her first run this morning, as she went past 5-fingers off of Piper's Lagoon near Nanaimo (just outside of Departure Bay).    A nice chance to pause, take a drink, and watch the ferry go into the misty, grey of today's overcast weather.
I also got rained on, for the first time in months!......at 5:30 this morning, it sure felt nice, and the fresh rain smelled great!   Another highlight was walking past a group of a dozen Quail birds.

I participated in my 4th "Great Lake Walk" event, at Cowichan Lake, yesterday.
This is a 56-km ultra-marathon walking event, that attracts runners as well as walkers.
I finished somewhere around 350 out of 500 participants, with a time of 11:19:40, or so (official results not yet posted on their website).
It was the usual mix of hope, agony, elation, weariness, invincibility, humility, bravado, injury, happiness, dread.     That's probably what I like about the event the most: the range of emotions and feelings for the day, which I suppose is normal for any sort of long endurance event.
I met all sorts of interesting people along the way; many from Vancouver Island, but others from lower mainland too.
Cowichan Lake is a beautiful lake in a mountain valley.   The 2nd largest lake on Vancouver Island (or so the brochure says).  At one time, there were maybe 5 sawmill towns around the lake, and now all the mills are closed.   Funny though, there's still many many truckload of raw logs being taken from the valley every day.........
Blister report:  2 big heel blisters (one of which broke, with 4 km to go......so I just continued on).  Dr. Scholl's Moleskin did the job on protecting the other areas of my feet (although not the heels, apparantly).    IBuprofen was my friend too, along the way.   Right now, I am very aware of my shin muscles, calves, and hamstrings.......it's a challenge to stand up!
Hydration was good with lots of Gatorade at each reststop, as well as using some Nuun tablets that replenished my sodium & electrolyte levels. http://www.nuun.com/
I was thinking that having an inland-ferry at Cowichan Lake would have been a good idea.......but walking around the lake seemed to be a "better way" to travel for the 500 of us who registered (and paid money) for the experience of the walk.
No idea how many calories I burned yesterday, but I did realize this morning that right-now is probably my lowest body-fat-index of the year.

from George Carlin:
"Irony deals with opposites, it has nothing to do with coincidence. If two baseball players from the same home-town, on different teams, receive the same uniform number, it is not ironic. It is coincidence ... If a diabetic, on his way to buy insulin, is killed by a truck, he is a victim of an accident. If the truck was delivering sugar, he is the victim of an oddly poetic coincidence. But if the truck was delivering insulin, ah! Then he is the victim of irony".

Bob Fortune
Post by brianwilliams on Sept 26, 2006, 3:13am
Oh yeah, OH YEAH!
Bob Fortune was an educator to folks young and old. His chalkboards (remember, there were several - that outlined our south coast, the west coast of BC and the larger Pacific coast of North America).
Fortune taught me well, when he diagrammed a Pacific winter series of high and low pressures.
The weather comes from the NW, but the effects are felt from the SE. Why? Let me show you, said Bob.
Bob Fortune, in a few chalk stokes, showed us why it was raining in Vancouver city, sunny in Delta, and blowing a howling gale in Victoria. And why Victoria's wind would turn to drizzle, while Vancouver would -- drizzle a bit longer.
The man was swift and accurate with his chalk. Fortune could draw a standard map of weather on the big board, then switch to a sea-level view on a blank slate.
"Vancouver Island" scribble-scribble "catches the brunt of today's Pacific storm" scribble-scribble "See how Nanaimo-Ladysmith-Qualicum are sheltered, but the temperatures will be lower because" scribble-scribble "the descending Pacific air gets colder as it drops" Expect frost at sea level on east Vancouver Island, while Vancouver will be warmer with rain"
Bob Fortune was not a scientist, but he was a superlative interpreter. I was 8 years old when I first learned from Bob Fortune on CBUT. And - as y'all see, I've not forgotten.

Definition of "klutz":   klutz is a person who is clumsy, foolish, inept, or accident-prone. The term is perhaps derived from the Yiddish ÷ìàÈõ klots ('wooden beam'), cognate with the German klotz, meaning a "block" or "lump".   The term has largely permeated into the English language, even amongst speakers of English with no Yiddish or indeed Jewish heritage.
Consider:  Glen Clark was premier for years 1995-1999. The member making this statement was likey the ages of 3-7 years old during Clark's Premier term.
I call the question:  Was/Is Glen Clark a "klutz"?

For students of irony, an ugly example.
An American TV crime drama recently featured a plotline that was a blatant ripoff of the killing of Tammy Homolka by Paul Bernardo, and his accomplice, Tammy's sister Karla. Note for note, the show retold the sordid real life account- the smooth sociopathic husband, the acquiescent blonde wife who relished his sadism, her 'present' to her husband of her sister, fatally drugged, for his entertainment.
As the plot unfolded, the police found, as with the real case, videotapes of the horrors being committed, which sealed the case against the perpetrators. In the show, a female detective gives assurance that the videos, where you see the Karla character beginning to sensually caress her sister, will never be seen outside the courtroom; obviously, to protect the sensitivities of the family involved.
The irony here, of course, is that it is entirely possible that, in real life, the parents of Tammy Homolka might have been sitting down to an evening of television, only to become gradually aware that the drama being played out in front of their eyes was the unspeakably dreadful death of their daughter at the hands of their other daughter and her husband, while the TV detective character earnestly assured the make believe family that their grief would not be displayed for public edification.
In Canada, the Bernardo/Homolka madness was not regarded as a thing for public titillation, and the one movie produced died a deservedly quick death. American producers like Jerry Bruckheimer obviously have no such scruples when they have an hour of TV time to fill.
Sorry for such a dark post, but this show really bothered me when I saw it, and I thought the ironic aspect of the detective character's assurance was about as grim as you can get.
Now, back to our regular programming. Was Glen Clark a 'klutz'? Personally, I'd like a bit more input from a few more fourteen year old American kids before I make up my mind.

Re the Homolka case:
Sometime in the late 1990's, I made the mistake of buying one of those "true crime" paperback books, that gave a detailed account of a real life criminal....in this case, it was re Paul Bernardo and his wife.     I think the book was written by someone who had seen the infamous videotapes, maybe as a legal insider?   But the book was for sale at Coles Bookstore, so it must be ok, right (no!)
The details were horrible, and I realised that I probably shouldn't have purchased that book.    I'm not sure if that book is still available for sale, or if it was "banned", or if it just went out of printing.

Great photo, TsawwassenTerminal!
Re: the Holmolka tragedy ... during the trial, a friend's wife engaged me in heated debate. "Why?" she demanded, "can't we read all the pre-trial reports. Why can't we read about the all the evidence? They're printing it in the US papers, and some of it's on 'Hard Copy' and other TV shows?"
Pardon a little length in this ... the woman I quoted is a tabloid-news junkie, and my arguments had little traction with her.
I said -in milder terms- "It's none of your G*D business."
The families of the victims, and even of the accused, did not need to be terrorized by repeating the horrible details over and over. The Ontario judge, quite rightly, clamped a lid on publishing every sordid event.
Reporters, from CBC down to the most-prurient Canadian publishers appealed the ban and lost in court. They fulfilled their responsibility to try to ensure a free press, but the Charter right to a fair trial succeeded as the greater good.
Paul Bernardo had a fair trial. He and his defenders faced all the evidence in court, as would Karla Homolka, had she not copped a plea.
We did not try the case in the court of *shock-horror* TV shows, thank goodness. American tabloid reporters illegally reported some of the details, but their interest fizzled out quickly, mostly 'cause it wasn't a USA event.
Look for more of this when the Pickton trial finally gets underway soon. I expect, and will support, a ban on publishing detailed evidence in that trial - just as preliminary evidence has been suppressed for general consumption.
Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka and Willie Pickton (if he's found guilty) are some of the most evil people we've ever known.
Our safety is not enhanced by knowing every twisted detail of their crimes. The charges against 'em, with the names of their victims, how they died, where, and when are enough to inform us.
Olson did everyone a favour in that controversial "bodies for money" deal in 1981. We saved months or even years more of evidence-gathering; and a multi-million dollar trial with excruciating pain for the childrens' families.
The two books on the Olson affair that are still in print focus -correctly- on his shabby past, his psychopathic personality, and the painstaking investigation that caught him.
Because the forensic evidence is sealed, the minute details of the torture he inflicted on 11 children is not available for gawkers to read.
PS: An old friend of ours was an RCMP investigator who followed Olson in the summer of 1981. She was at the scene when Olson was arrested in August. The take-down was unplanned, but two more girls were at risk, so the cops had to act.
Our police still didn't have enough direct evidence to convict him, but blowhard Olson gave up his stories for that small bribe. Thank goodness.

Post by flugelhorn on Oct 16, 2006, 10:00pm
I recently read some of the details of Olson's arrest, during the publicity around his latest parole hearing.    I was surprised that he was arrested near Hydro Hill, on the Tofino highway.
Naively surprised, I guess, because that's my back-yard.    I guess that's part of the shock of that early '80's story, as it happened in our BC Backyard, instead of far-off in the USA somewhere.
I'm still troubled by the newscast images of Simon Partington's mother desperately asking for the killer to let him go, not knowing that it was too late.

Sorry, pals, can't leave this "tabloid" cr*p without another comment.
On another forum I visit, a USA group, there is now a lot of weeping over the Pennsylvania school murders - hundreds of posts. Rightly so, but I added a mention of École Polytéchnique (1989, 14 women killed) and Dawson College (4 weeks ago, 1 killed).
Huh? Not a single vocal member had heard of either one.
I love Americans, by the each, and I respect their country; but I am SO dismayed by the USA's total lack of interest, and their refusal to learn from what happens outside - unless there's oil and/or Islamic folks.
THAT'S how tabloid news will destroy a nation. From OJ to Jon-Benet to "wardrobe malfunctions", sensationalism will dull the people.
We must avoid that in Canada. We're not much smarter than Americans, but we can resist some of the mindless B*S that clogs popular culture.

HMCS Nanaimo:
If you haven't read it, you might like Holmes and Northrup's "Where Shadows Linger" (2000)
Bruce Northrup was the RCMP officer in charge of the Olson case, from before they identified the bad b*stard, through to his arrest and the confession.
Northrup was the leader who committed more resources than Vancouver RCMP wanted to spend on "just some missing kids". He diverted our pal and a few colleagues, who had been working on two-bit drug dealers.
Their diversion to the "missing kids" case was hard to support in management meetings, but Northrup persisted.
Dammit, he caught too much flak when Olson confessed. Instead of a hero badge, he earned stupid condemnation from the press for paying off Olson.
Read the book. It's in all our libraries, and is still in print.

Still on the subject of crime, though slightly lighter...
I hope we're all feeling very sympathetic to the plight of Rick Ciarniello, who is feeling very hurt that, since his Hell's Angels were declared a criminal organization,  he can't wear his 'colours' without being shunned at the Safeway, and he has mothers averting their children's eyes on the street.
Big Rick, who's so bloated from clubhouse beer that he looks like he'd go pfffft! and frizzle away like a balloon if you stuck a pin in him, is being stereotyped, just because a few, ummm, 'wayward' Angels have been known in the past to indulge in minor crime, such as selling heroin and killing people (all outside of the auspices of the club, of course).
I'm waiting now for some white power skinheads to claim they're being discriminated against just because they walk around with swastikas carved in their foreheads. Seems like a guy just can't catch a break in today's P.C.-run amok world.

What, you may have been wondering, is the point on this planet that's farthest away from Vancouver? What is, more than anything else, on the 'other side' of the world?
This pondering was prompted by a remark from Cascade. You find inspiration in the wierdest places.
Near as I can tell, there's no land exactly half a world away, only the southern Indian Ocean. But nearby, at 49'S., 70'E, are the Kerguelen Islands, a rather desolate (in terms of human population) French possession waaay out from southern Africa and southern Australia.
It would be really intriguing to visit this incredibly remote spot, but I don't imagine scheduled airlines make any calls. And, darn it, there's no ferry from Australia.

Hornbyguy:
Thanks for that re those southern Islands.
I'm a map/globe nerd, and so I like studying that kind of thing.   But I must have a northern-hemisphere bias, because I'm sure a lot more familiar with remote-Northern islands (such as the ones above Norway, and north of Archangel/Murmansk.
I don't know too much about the southern oceans....other than the islands off of Southern South America (because of Falkland wars history, and the HMS-Beagle, etc).
April-June 2007 will be the 25th anniversary of the Falklands war (the Thatcher war, not the WWI naval battle !).
During the 1982 Falkland war, the UK Task Force featured the QE-II and the Canberra ocean-liners, as support/hospital/transport ships.

Don't know if it means anything, but there are to small vertical bars on 'register'. Any ideas?

Also, a shiny new case of Dorito's to whomever can explain the meaning of the following quote that I found on someone's blog site:
Speechless it's all I can say after for the first time in I went up to the second floor. WOW it's so alien up there. I spoke to Jamie who was working on the computer and guess what? They have a 15" LCD! OMG, and they aren't computer users!!! I am so speechless. It's not fair. I really need to get with the times and upgrade my 10-year old monitor
Can anyone explain the mystery of what the "second floor" is?  I believe that this mystery will lead us to the fountain of eternal youth.  Let us unite and embrace the words of the prophet which were written on the studio wall, of the concert hall.  They also echo with the sounds of salesmen.
