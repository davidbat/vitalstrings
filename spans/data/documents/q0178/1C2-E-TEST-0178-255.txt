It is blue due to the chemical composition of our atmosphere and the particulate you see in the sky reflecting the light rays.  It is also part of how our eyes perceive or process light here on earth.
Our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen too which affects how the light waves travel through our atmosphere as well as the other chemicals and particulate, causing the light to be filtered or scattered before reaching us on earth.
The link Why is the sky Blue?  is a very good, basic link that just gives fundamental information on this.
Hope this helps.

The sun used to be the hottest thing in the sky, which was why it used to have blue flames (jk), but it cooled down.
The blue flame the sun used to sport escaped and surrounded earth, because it was the next "new and hip" thing around town.
The sun cooled down and became orange, a cooler color for fire.

the sky is blue most of the time but mainly so because it reflects the oceans in the hemispheres above it.
