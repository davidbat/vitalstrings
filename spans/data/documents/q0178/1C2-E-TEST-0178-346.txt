Why is the Color of Sky Blue in Day and Red at Sunrise Sunset
The color of sky is blue due to the Rayleigh scattering (British  physicist Lord Rayleigh). The color of sky is blue due to the Rayleigh scattering (British  physicist Lord Rayleigh).
According to his law, the sunlit sky appears blue because air scatters  short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the  short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in  the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye  perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the  sun.
Near sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to  the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long  that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun  rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset  and sunrise, you will see the color red more than any of the other  colors.
In night there is no light so scattering so as a result black in  colour.
