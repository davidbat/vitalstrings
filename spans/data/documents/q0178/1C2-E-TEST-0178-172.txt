The sky is blue on a clear, sunny day because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. The scattered light is what we can see with our eyes – which in simple terms is why the sky is blue.
The light from the sun is white light and is made up of all different colors of the spectrum. When this white light is projected through a prism, you can see all of the different colors. Each color of visible light also travels in different waves: blue light waves are short and choppy, while red light waves are long. All light travels in straight lines unless something gets in its way.
When the sunlight reaches the earth’s atmosphere it is scattered in all directions by gases and particles. The blue light is scattered in all directions. It is also scattered more because it travels in shorter, smaller waves.
