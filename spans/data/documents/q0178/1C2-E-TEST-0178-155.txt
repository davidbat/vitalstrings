Why the Sky is Blue?
Glad you asked...
The blue sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. Basically, all the other colors of light get reflected away and blue is the color of the light that gets through the most and to our eyes. That is why we see blue sky.  You can find more information here: http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blu...

Then again, this answer might help you...
The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through.
