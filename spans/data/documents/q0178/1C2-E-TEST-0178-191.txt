As a result, when you look at the sky, you see blue everywhere. Read on for a more detailed explanation.
Fact 1. Light travels in waves. The
light's wavelength determines its
color. Short wavelength light, for
example, appears blue, and long
wavelength light appears red.
Fact 2. When light strikes particles
that are larger than its wavelength,
the light's path may be altered.
When light strikes particles that are
smaller than its wavelength, the
light continues to travel unaffected.
Fact 3. The atmosphere contains
many particles and gases, mainly
nitrogen and oxygen.
Sunlight is composed of light of many different wavelengths. Longer wavelength light appears red, orange, and yellow, while shorter wavelength light appears blue, indigo and violet. The gas molecules in the atmosphere scatter, in all directions, shorter wavelength light (e.g., blue). The longer wavelegnth light (e.g., red) is largely unaffected by the atmosphere. As a result, when you look at the sky, you see the blue portion of the sun's light being scattered by the atmosphere. If you were to look at the sky while standing on the moon, you would see a very bright star surrounded by complete darkness. This is because the moon has no atmosphere and so sunlight is not scattered.
You might wonder why the sky is not the color of the even shorter wavelength violet. The primary reason for this is that our eyes are better at detecting blue light than they are at detecting violet light.
