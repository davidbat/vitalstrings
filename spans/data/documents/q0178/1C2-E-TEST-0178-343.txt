Why do we see the sky as blue and not violet?
I understand why the sky is blue, but if it is because of the shorter wave lengths of blue light, then why do we not see the sky as violet? Is it a physiological thing (where the human eye cannot detect the violet??) or is it psychological (where we think the sky is blue, so it is.) or does the sky NOT have any violet light being "scattered" in the atmosphere?
