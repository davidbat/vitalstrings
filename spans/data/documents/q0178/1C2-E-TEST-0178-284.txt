Why is the sky blue?
by sandrab » Tue Nov 30, 2010 12:50 am
Dear Sir,   How can we ask this question "Why is the sky blue?" in measurable terms?  What can we properly measure and how do we properly record the results?  My fifth grader came up with this topic, but we are having trouble making it measurable to go with the steps of the scientific method.  We are not sure about it.  Please help.  Thank you.  We will be staying up to redo or complete the project.  We asked the question, "Does more particles in the air cause the sky to be bluer or redder." We did the sky in a bottle experiment with water, milk, a 2 liter container, and a flashlight.  We added 2,4,6,8,and 10 centemeters of milk to the 4 cups of water.  We need some advice if this is correct or if there is a better way to handle this topic.  We appreciate your time.  Sincerely Yours, Concerned parent and Greg
