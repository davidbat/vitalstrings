I say reason that the sky is not blue. Blue is simply a label. If a person has been blind all his life he cannot have an idea of what color the sky is, therefore, to him the sky is not blue because blue does not exist.
I propose that the sky is not blue because there is no evidence to support it. In fact, the sky is black. The only reason the sky appears to be blue is because the light of the sun engulfs our atmosphere.
Good luck Pro.

I LOL'd I come back to this with this arguement for the last one.

Sky is blue for the Asians. Call a asian and tell him/her to go outside and look up and say "What is the color of the sky?"
--In fact, the sky is black.
But black to blind people doesnt exist.

But then why isnt the sky white?
