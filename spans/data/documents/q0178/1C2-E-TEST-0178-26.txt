Wow! This wonder was amazing, Wonderopolis!  I never knew that the sky was blue because of the white light from the sun (that is actually full of many colors) and the blue wavelengths passing through the air cause the sky to turn blue!  I always thought that the sky was blue because it was just blue!  Now I know the real scientific reason!  Also, it is so cool how a rainbow can be formed when you shine white light through a prism which separates the white light into seven sections! (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).  This wonder was so cool! It really made me wonder!

I never knew that sunlight is also called white light. I didn’t know that at sun rise and sun set the waves had to go farther to reach your eyes. I didn’t know that each color was made of different wavelengths. I never knew that red had the longest wavelength and purple had the shortest. Do you know what types of gas molecules are in the air to filter the waves?
