Hi,
To answer ur query in simple terms, 
Sun Light consists of VIBGYOR(ie Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,Yellow, Orange and Red colours) in the visible range.
In this range, violet is having the shortest wavelength, hence it scatters a lot in the atmosphere. The gas molecules present in the air absorbs the short wavelenth rays and they start radiating these in all different directions. (ie they scatter in all directions). This combination of Violet,Indigo and Blue coloured rays  gets scattered all over the sky. Hence the sky looks blue.
And this is also one of the reasons why "Red" colour in Traffic signals is used to signify "STOP". Red can easily travel long distance without any scatterring. This means vehicles from very faar distance can also see the "RED light".  But its a different matter that some dont care about it.
