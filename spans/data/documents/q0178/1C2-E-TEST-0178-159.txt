Is the sky really blue because it reflects the color of the ocean?
In: Science , Physics [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
No. The physics is based in the way light is scattered in the air, and it is discussed in the question, "Why is the sky blue?" That question is linked below.
Answer
If that were true, there wouldn't be any blue skies in Kansas. And there are!
Actually, the coloring in the sky that you observe is a result of light rays being scattered by air and anything in it. The rays of light with the longer wavelengths, such as reds and yellows, tend to travel more easily through the atmosphere, while the rays with the shorter wavelengths, like blues and indigos, tend to be dispersed more easily. These more easily dispersed shorter light rays are what give the sky its blue color.
The color emitted by the refraction of gasses in the atmosphere is what causes the sky to be the color it appears. The protective ozone layer which is thicker in some places than it is in others, reflects blue when exposed to the suns radiation. So ozone gas expressed as O3 is responsible in large part to the blue sky. The dust particles mentioned in the previous paragraph are responsible for the various hues and colors we see such as the red sunsets.

This effect is known as Rayleigh scattering named after the scientist who discovered it , Lord Rayleigh
