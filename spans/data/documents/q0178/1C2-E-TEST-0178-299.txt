Why The Sky Is Blue?
The sky usually looks blue not pink red yellow.
It gets its blue color from the sunlight thet shines through the air.
Sunlight contains all the colors of the rainbow, but these colors are scaterred as they pass through the air. Some colors are scaterred more than others, and the color you see-blue.
The sky usually looks light blue, but if you went to the top of the highest mountain, where there is less or between you and the sun to scatter the sunlight, the sky would be a deep, dark blue.
And if you rode in a rocket high above the earth, where there is no air at all to scatter the sunlight, the sky would be so dark that it would look black.
Sometimes the sky doesn't look blue. At sunrise and sunset, the light from the sun sometimes is scaterred in such away, that you see, orange, and other colors in the sky.
