Activity: Why the Sky is Blue
LEVEL
Ages 5-85
RATIONALE
An intuitive demonstration of how the atmosphere affects sunlight to create the sky colors we see.
LENGTH
10-15 minutes. (Preparation: 15-20 minutes, can be done well in advance.)
OBJECTIVES
Describe how the atmosphere causes a blue sky and a yellow Sun when the Sun is high in the sky, but a reddish Sun and sky when the Sun is near the horizon.
Make and use a Blue Sky model.
MATERIALS and PREPARATION
Glue stick for a hot glue gun (see sources ,         below). You don't need the glue gun, just the glue stick.
Cardboard for backing.
Rubber cement or other glue.
White playdoh for house (also see alternatives ,         below).
Mini-mag light flashlights (also see alternatives ,         below).
Exacto knife.
MAKE A BLUE SKY MODEL:
Cut two pieces of gluestick: one 1.3 cm and one 8.3 cm.         Try to make a smooth, straight cut.
Glue the paper
Blue         Sky template to the cardboard.
Find the marked points to set the hot glue stick. Use the         rubber cement to glue the hot glue sticks in place. If         there is writing on your pieces of glue stick, glue the         writing side to the paper.
Use a small piece of playdoh to form a house where marked         on the pattern.
If not using a mini-maglight, trim the cardboard so it is         flush with the ends of the gluesticks, and prepare the flashlight as         described below.
PROCEDURE
Show an example of the blue sky model, pointing out the         curve of the Earth and sky. (Note that the thickness of         the atmosphere is greatly exaggerated. The atmosphere,         compared to the whole earth, is about as thick as an         apple's skin compared to the whole apple.)
Explain/ask/discuss how white light is a mix of colors.         Discuss the color of the sky during the day and near         sunrise or sunset. ( Notes .)
If using mini-maglight, focus it so the light spot is         about the same size as the end of the glue stick.
Darken the room.
Shine the flashlight straight at the house. Ask what         color the light looks. Explain that the flashlight is         simply white light, just like the light coming from our         Sun.
Shine the light through the short, vertical glue stick.         (Make sure the light shines through the stick, not just         on it.) What color is the glue stick? What color is the         light on the "house"?. ( Notes .)
Shine the light through the long, horizontal stick. Now         what colors do you see for the glue stick and "house"? ( Notes .)
Sources, alternatives, and other details :
Glue sticks:
The ones I like best are available at Michaels floral & craft stores. I use the ones labeled HI & LO MELT; get the wider (approx 1/2 inch) glue sticks. A 4-inch glue stick is enough for one model, but if you're making many, you may wish to get the longer glue sticks. (Other brands can be used but you'll have to experiment with the lengths and modify the template accordingly.)
Template:
The template is provided above. (If you use another brand of glue stick, you'll need to adjust the template.) Note that we've exaggerated the thickness of the atmosphere compared to the Earth -- Earth's true atmosphere is more like the thickness of an apple's skin compared to the whole apple.
Mini-maglite/flashlight :
Mini-maglites are the perfect size and provide a bright white light. You can usually find them in hardware or variety stores. You can also use a regular flashlight. Take aluminum foil and cut a small hole slightly smaller than the end of the glue stick. Wrap this around the end of the flashlight so the hole is about in the middle. If using this with students, you may wish to secure the foil with tape or an elastic band. Fresh batteries will generally give you a whiter light.
Glue:
A glue-paste stick works well for attaching the template to the cardboard, but use any kind of glue that works for you. To attach the hot-glue sticks to the template, rubber cement or superglue work particularly well, but other kinds of glue will also work.
House:
White playdoh works well and is widely available. A piece of packing styrofoam, cut to an angle, also works quite well. We've also used Uhu Holdit (removable plastic poster-holder) or a small cone of white paper. Try to keep the house as white as possible so the colors will be more obvious.
