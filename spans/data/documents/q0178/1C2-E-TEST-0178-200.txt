The blue color of the sky is due to nitrogen.  Nitrogen molecules (N2) have an atomic structure that allows them to selectively absorb the blue light coming into the atmosphere from the Sun.  The absorption of the blue light is done by the electrons in the nitrogen jumping to higher energy levels.  When the electrons fall back down to their lower energy levels they emit light.  This light is blue.  This blue light is emitted in all directions (scattered).  The result is that the sky is given a blue color.
Oxygen also absorbs and re-emitts light but because there is much less oxygen than nitrogen it does not color the sky as much.  Oxygen absorbs and emits a more green color than nitrogen.
