Question ID: 787006
Hello all researchers and commentors!  Well, the day is finally upon us.  I know there have been questions that asked for your favorite answers, your favorite customers and your areas of expertise.  So I won't ask that again.  But there is one question I have, a little birdy once told me but I forgot:  Why is the sky blue?

It seems the little "birdie" who told you may have learned it here first - and I mean that literally. "Why is the sky blue?" was the first question posted here on April 9, 2002. I'd answer it for you but someone had obviously beaten me to it so I cannot, in good form, take your fee. http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&id=2 tutuzdad-ga

Tutuzdad,  Yes, it was the first question and I am symbolically offering it as the last question.  If you don't want to answer that exact question then you may substitute "GA community" for the word sky.  Bowler-ga

I am honored if you feel compelled to present your last $2 to me as a parting favor. As for your question, let me quote Thoreau: "I have learned this at least by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." Like the sky, perhaps were are not really as blue as we seem. It only appears that way to the naked eye.  If we're on the same page I will gladly post and claim.   Dad

Tutuzdad,  Please, go ahead and answer the question however you wish.  It's been a joy to read your many answers over the years.  I'd be honored if you answered my last question.  Bowler-ga

Dearest Bowler:  The honor is all mine, I assure you. You have been a fastastic customer and a generous rater. Likewise I shall miss you all and sincerely wish you the very best the world has to offer. "It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power." -- Alan Cohen, author: "Chicken Soup for the Soul" Farewell my friend, Dad
