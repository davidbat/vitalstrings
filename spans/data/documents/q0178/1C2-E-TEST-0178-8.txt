Why Is The Sky Blue
Why is the sky blue: Discussion
Transmitted light (from the sun, light bulbs, fire, etc) is made                up of a spectrum of colors. The longest wavelengths of light are                on the red end of the spectrum and the shortest wavelengths are                on the blue/violet end of the spectrum.
 
 
 
When transmitted light such as sunlight enters our atmosphere it                collides with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The color with the                shorter wavelength is scattered more by this collision. Because                violet and blue are the shortest wavelengths the sky appears to                be violet / blue. But because our eyes are more sensitive to blue                light than they are violet light, we perceive the sky as blue.
Our eyes contain thousand of rods and cones, which are the receptors                for light. Whenever one of the 3 Stooges pokes you in the eye you                see a giant blue spot. This is because the blue receptors have been                activated. Blue is one of the primary colors and thus more easily                activated and seen by our eyes.
Blue is also how I feel when my baby leaves and my hound dog dies.                Also, how I feel when the cops pull me over and I see their blue                lights flashing in my rear view mirror. Then, again, blue is the                color of the K-mart special, so this color isn't all bad.
Why is the sky blue: Summary
So, why is the sky blue? It is because blue light from the sun                strikes the air molecules and scatters and our eyes perceive it                as blue.
Why is the sky blue: Short Summary
Why is the sky blue, you ask? Blue in sunlight collides with air                molecules and our eyes see it as blue.
 
Why is the sky blue: Condensed
