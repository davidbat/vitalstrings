Susan Meissner is a new author (to me anyway) whom I stumbled upon while perusing the Chapters.Indigo website one day. Deciding to take a chance, I ordered two of her novels and loved them! Ms. Meissner is a Christian woman's writer but her books are not preachy and don't try to convince you in any way about religion, but rather stories about real life situations minus all the vulgar and inappropriate language that a lot of books seems to contain today.

Claire Holland is a happily married woman with two children and an ideal life when her world is suddenly turned upside down when she is brutally raped by a stranger and becomes pregnant. Facing such a heartrendering and painful situation, Claire isn't sure what do. She does know that being a Christian woman means she could never have an abortion but what will her husband, Dan, have to say about that? And what about her 12-year-old daughter Katie who is at a very tenuous and fragile age?
This is a story of journeys; family, personal, and spiritual. When Dan finally tells Claire that he could not possibly father a child conceived by rape, Claire puts the baby up for adoption never expecting that 16 years later the child would re-enter her world with unforeseen consequences. A great story about life, the hardships we sometimes must endure and tough decisions we are forced to make under tragic circumstances.
