BJ Reed Why is the Sky Blue: The Fourth Day
The Fourth
This quilt was made for a challenge
"Why Is The sky Blue?".
My answer is "The Fourth Day".
The quilt background is made from hand dyed, discharged and hand painted cottons. The blooming embroidered nine patches represent the fourth day, night into light. Foiling on polyester was hand quilted to the top. Embellishments include beading, Shiva paint stick markings, and piping. "The Fourth Day" measures 43" by 43" and is mostly free motion quilted.
