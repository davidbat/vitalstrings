Re: why is the sky blue??????????????????
I don't know if I'm perfectly right, but I present here the info I read somewhere.
The sun rays pass through the atmosphere. The light is dispersed by the particles in the atmosphere and the waves reflected are within the spectrum of short visible light waves. Off course blue colour is the overall result of dispersion and reflection of all the waves in the sun light spectrum.
When the sun sets it is lower in the horizon, so the rays have longer way to pass untill they reach our eyes. Therefore the rays have to pass through thicker layer of atmosphere. The light waves are dispersed and reflected by the particles present in the atmosphere, but due to thicker layer the resulting lightwaves are longer and we see orange or reddish sunset.
Different colour of the sky, that we can sometimes observe, are caused by the particles in the atmosphere (dust, water forming clouds) and their density, and also how high is the sun in the sky. I think there may be other factors as well, but I'm not aware of them.
