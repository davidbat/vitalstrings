I was taken by a friend’s artistic rendition of a                           stormy sea and a lighthouse shining through the dark                      blue sky. He gave me permission to reproduce a                      likeness of his image in fabric and thus, A Beacon                      of Light was born. I enjoy making machine appliquéd                      landscape quilts and love the challenge of searching                     for just the right fabric to simulate reality.
I believe this image struck me because of the                      symbolism in having a light shine through the                          darkness in my life as in many others. As I was                          making this quilt, another friend was undergoing                          treatment for cancer and looking for the light at                          the end of a very dark and tumultuous path. Blue                          skies indicate hope and positive outlooks to me.

Statement: It has always intrigued me how well                   complementary colours are used in nature and so the                                natural choice for me was the complement between the                                Blue Sky and Orange Sun, simple.

"Why is the Sky Blue? Look; sometimes                 it isn't blue,sometimes it hasa lot of colors, sometimes it has                 a mood."

"Storm" was                     inspired by an incoming storm viewed from a beach in                 Alaska. It was difficult to see where the sky ended                                 and the ocean                     began. It was hard to determine whether I was                                  walking on the beach, or in the ocean. The sky, sea and beach                     merged                   into one powerful force. As I looked, I could see bits of color                   here and there,                     sparkling with shafts of light and the wetness from                      the sea and sky.                      The shapes were fluid, ever changing, twisting in                     the storm. The sky                      was gray, blue, magenta, green and a scary yellow                      green. Mother                       nature has many moods.
This piece is created from one piece of hand marbled                       fabric, with                       quilting and stitching used to illustrate the power                      of nature. This                       is not the placid blue sky one hopes for, but the                      turmoil created by                      stormy weather, with the colors of the sky mixed and                swirling around.

I                   have tried several times to clean and organize my hand dyed                   fabrics.                    Every              time, the blues and oranges refused to be separated.                  This challenge                   came around at the same time I decided to give in,                                and use them together in a quilt. I feel that orange gives                     a spark                 of              light when ever it is                   used, but the spark is brighter when combined with                                blue. The curves give a natural, organic feel to the quilt.                     I enjoy            working with them.                   The spot in the upper right corner, and the loose                             fibers along the edge are Angelina Fibers. They were added to                 provide some more softness and
texture to the piece. To continue the curve theme,              I                 found some little rocks that had been drilled, and beaded them                 onto                  the quilt.
This is my first challenge, it was an enjoyable                              experience. I learned a lot, and had lots of fun playing with my ideas until                                      this quilt                                       resulted. The combination of blue and orange has            continued in other                   projects.

This challenge grabbed                 my interest with both hands! I am a scientist in                   my other life, so the answer jumped at me-- "Why is                   the sky blue? - "Only to the naked eye"! But why? The answer is                   given by two scientist  - Lord Rayleigh and Mie.These men both produced  theories       to explain.        Rayleigh's equation - the one on the quilt - used  his theory of light         scattering to explain why the sky is blue and not any other colour of         the rainbow.         Mie scattering explains why the sky is lighter around the
sun and increases in intensity the further away from  the sun you get.
(The equation is huge - I'd still be sewing if I'd  put that one on the         quilt and there wouldn't have been room for the birds!). The Term "Only       to the naked Eye" is used frequently but I don't  think people really      think about what they are saying! How scarey, ugly,  fascinating and  beautiful       is a naked eye?!
I guess what I've really tried to do is take the  cold hard facts             of science and turn them into art but really science is art in its'             purest form. Mother Nature is the ultimate artist!
