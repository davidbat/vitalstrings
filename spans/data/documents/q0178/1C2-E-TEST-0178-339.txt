The topic sky is discussed in the following articles:
blue colour
TITLE: sunlight (solar radiation)
...by air molecules and dust particles. Short wavelengths of light, such as blue, scatter more easily than do the longer red wavelengths. This phenomenon is responsible for the varying colour of the sky at different times of day. When the sun is high overhead, its rays pass through the intervening atmosphere almost vertically. The light thus encounters less dust and fewer air molecules than it...
TITLE: electromagnetic radiation (physics)
SECTION: Scattering, reflection, and refraction
This rapid increase in scattering with the frequency of electromagnetic radiation can be seen on any sunny day: it is the reason the sky is blue and the setting Sun is red. The higher-frequency blue light from the Sun is scattered much more by the atoms and molecules of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere than is the lower-frequency red light. Hence the light of the setting Sun, which passes through a thick...
Rayleigh scattering law
TITLE: John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh (British scientist)
...His early papers deal with such subjects as electromagnetism, colour, acoustics, and diffraction gratings. Perhaps his most significant early work was his theory explaining the blue colour of the sky as the result of scattering of sunlight by small particles in the atmosphere. The Rayleigh scattering law, which evolved from this theory, has since become classic in the study of all kinds of...
