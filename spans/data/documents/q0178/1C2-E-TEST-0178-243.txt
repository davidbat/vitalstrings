By Something Wicked This Way Comes
Format:Hardcover
This a beautifully designed book, with gorgeous artwork and has a very "eco" feel to it - even printed on recycled paper.
I bought this for my 3.5yr old as she's at "that" stage - you know the one - "why is the sky blue? Why does sea water taste horrible? Why is Daddy grumpy :) ? It answers all these questions and more (apart from addressing Daddy's grumpiness), with the answers hidden behind flaps and pop-ups. Some of the answers were a little beyond my daughter, but she understood most of it and the book is presented in such a graphically stunning way. For once I didn't have to answer "I don't know!"
