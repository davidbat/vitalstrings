Light from the Sun (white light) is made up of many colours - red, green, blue,  and so on. Each of these colours has a different wavelength and frequency. When  light reaches the atmosphere it hits gas molecules which scatter the light in  all directions. This scattering is called Rayleigh scattering after Lord  Rayleigh who worked out the mathematical equations to describe it.   So how does Rayleigh scattering work? Rayleigh scattering only happens when the  molecules of gas encountered by the light waves are small compared to the  wavelength of the light. Whats strange about Rayleigh scattering is that not  all of the light is scattered evenly. Some wavelengths are scattered more. With  white light, mostly the light of shorter wavelengths (the blue end of the  visible range) is scattered whilst the longer wavelengths (the red end) are  mostly uneffected. This means the blue light is scattered more than the red.   But violet light has the shortest wavelength so why isnt the sky violet? Well  its true that the violet light is scattered more than the blue light, but our  eyes arent so good at picking up violet light. This means we see the sky as  being blue even though there is some violet light there too.
