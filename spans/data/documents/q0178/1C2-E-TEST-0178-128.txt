Scattered light brings blue skies
On a bright, sunny day, you may wonder why the sky appears    blue rather than other colors.
The secret is the size of air molecules. They are the    perfect size for scattering blue light out of the incoming sunlight.
The sun appears yellow because the other colors of the    incoming sunlight usually pass through the air uninhibited.
If you were to look at the sun in outer space, it would    appear white because its light contains all of the other colors.
But, except for light from the sun, stars and bodies that    reflect light such as planets and moons, space itself looks black. This is because    it doesn't contain enough particles to scatter light back to your eyes.
In the Earth's atmosphere, various kinds of particles in    the atmosphere such as dust and cloud droplets can team up to create beautiful    sunrises and sunsets.
The Hyperphysics Web site's Blue    sky page has a much more detailed, scientific look at why the sky is blue.
