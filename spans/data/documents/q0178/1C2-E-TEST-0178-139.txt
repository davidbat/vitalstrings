It's really pretty simple.  White light from the Sun comes straight to your eye, making the Sun appear to be a white circle, too bright to look at directly, but it also shines THROUGH the atmosphere in all other directions being scattered by air.  If the air scattered ALL the components of the white light equally, the sky would be white, but it doesn't.  The color BLUE is scattered much more than all the other colors.
It has NOTHING to do with reflections from the ocean.
