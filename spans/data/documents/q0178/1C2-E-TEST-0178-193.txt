You're lying on the green grass,
On a sunny day with nothing to do,
You look up at the sky and wonder,
Why the sky blue?
Someone's asks you why the sky is blue,
Will you start being specific?
It' a summer day and school is done,
You hate science but will you go all scientific?
You're on the computer at night till dawn,
Just searching on Google on why the sky is blue,
You're getting different answers,
Which ones are false and which ones are true?
You have your science book and your pencil by your side,
Your old science books and laptop and you sit under a tree,
You're drawing the sky and writing some notes,
Then you just run and flee,
Days have passed as you blew off all your plans,
Just to study and want to know why the sky is blue,
You're spending your summer studying science,
That's the only thing that you want to do,
Weeks went on and your science book is filled,
You're running out of pencils to write,
The elements of the atmosphere has more of the color blue,
Because the sun is made up of colors of light,
1 month went passed and you're finished a book,
You're off to buy another one,
Going outside and the sun is like a disk on light,
Remember you can be blind looking at the sun,
1 month and few weeks passed,
Rayleigh scattering goes through particles of light,
You know this,
Because the internet say iINTERNETt,
Summer is almost done,
You find out that blue scatters better than other colors of light,
The sun is a disk of light when you see,
The sun is a source that is bright,
The blueness around you is the atoms making the blue come,
It took you a summer now it's a waste,
But for dinner you got your favorite meal,
Chicken with that sweet taste,
You learned why the sky is blue,
And learned something important too,
Never wonder about anything ever,
Whenever you got nothing to do.
