Pros:Good education, reasonable tuition
Cons:Centrally Isolated
If God isn't a Penn State fan, then why is the sky blue and white?  That was the slogan on a bumper sticker I had on my dorm bulletin board while at good old PSU.
I'm sure my review is biased, because I loved my 4 years at Penn State.  I got a great education from a well respected school, made memories to last a lifetime, got to watch my Nittany Lions win the national championship in football while there, and made lasting friendships.
Penn State is nestled in Happy Valley, surrounded by the town of State College.  Can you tell everything in the area revolves around Penn State?  It's a large school in a small town (town and university populations are each about 40,000).  We like to say it is "centrally isolated".
The University Park campus is beautiful, the main mall is lined with Dutch Elm trees.  Many of the campus buildings are very old and made from brick or stone, but there are also a lot of new buildings since the university continues to grow.
Freshmen and sophomore class sizes are often very large, but I never experienced a problem with this.  Class sizes usually were smaller in the higher level courses.
There is a lot to do at Penn State, even without being near a large city.  Of course there is football!  But there are lots of other sports as well, basketball, ice hockey, volleyball, etc.  And with the opening of the Bryce Jordan Center a few years ago, there is often a lot of good entertainment now as well.  Wish that had been there when I was a student!
