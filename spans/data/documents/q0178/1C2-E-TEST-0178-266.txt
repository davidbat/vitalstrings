Blue Sky Science was created to inspire kids’ natural curiosity about the world around them.
A scientist is simply a person who observes the world around them and wonders about what they see. In fact, one of the most important things a scientist does is to ask questions. 
“The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers; he(or she!)’s the one who asks the right questions.”  (Claude Levi-Strauss)
Children are naturally curious and ask lots and lots (and lots!) of questions. Why is the sky blue? How does TV work? What’s that? What will happen if I pull the cat’s tail? Kids are natural     scientists and experimenters and if this natural ability is nurtured it will flourish as they grow and learn. 
The scientists at Blue Sky Science have developed a range of fun and interesting science experiences that will excite your child’s imagination and stimulate their brain cells.
