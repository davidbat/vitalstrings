This is not an easy answer! The sky isn't really blue, it just looks that way to us.
Essentially the sun sends all parts of the color spectrum. Each color has a different wavelength, and humans are most sensitive to red, blue, and green. Blue light is a much shorter wavelength than red, and scientists have shown that shorter wavelengths disperse much more than longer ones. So blue will be more visible than red. If our eyes were more sensitive to violet colors, the sky would actually appear to be violet to us. But because of our sensitivity to blue, it looks blue.
During sunrise and sunset the the blue light get scattered out of our line of site as the sun disappears behing the horizon. What we are left with is red, which is why the sky turns a reddish orange.
Does that all make sense?
There are a lot of scienctific reasoning in why, but essentially it boils down to what our eyes are sensitive to (red-green-blue) and the way light disperses making it more visible to us.
Here is another webpage that talks about this if you'd like to see it.
