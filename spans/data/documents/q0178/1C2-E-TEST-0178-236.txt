The blue color of our sky is caused by the scattering of sunlight off the molecules of the atmosphere. The light scattered down to the earth at a large angle with respect to the direction of the sun's light is predominantly in the blue end of the spectrum.
The Moon has no atmosphere, hence nothing to scatter the sunlight and show any color.
