It has nothing to do with reflection from the ocean.
White sunlight is refracted by the atmosphere.
The spectrum of coloured light waves are scattered.
Blue light waves scatter 'best'.

You hear it's a reflection of the water, you hear it's water or light particles, wavelengths, etc. but now you can actually read about it.  Enjoy.  : )

Because every color in the rainbow has a wavelength. When light passes through the atmosphere, the wave gets scattered. It spreads out. The blue we see is actually millions and millions of scattered blue lights. Tiny little pinpricks of light, all streaming into our eyes at once.

I've heard that it's because of pollution, but I'd agree that it might be because of reflecting the ocean.
