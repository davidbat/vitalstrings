Why the Sky is Blue
PROJECT TITLE:
Why the Sky is Blue
Aim:
The purpose of this project is to explain why the sky is blue and the sunset is red. When sunlight travels through atmosphere, blue light scatters more than the other colors, leaving a yellow hue to the transmitted light. The scattered light makes the sky blue and the transmitted light makes the sunset reddish.
