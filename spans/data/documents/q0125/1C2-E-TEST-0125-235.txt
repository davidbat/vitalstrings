Public          Company 1992-
Starbucks Becomes          a Public Company
Starbucks' initial          public offering (IPO) of common stock in June 1992 turned into one of          the most successful IPOs of the year (see Exhibit          3 for the performance of the company's stock price since the IPO).          With the capital afforded it by being a public company, Starbucks accelerated          the expansion of its store network (see Exhibit 1 ). Starbucks' success helped specialty coffee products begin          to catch on across the United States. Competitors, some imitating the          Starbucks model, began to spring up in many locations. The          Specialty Coffee Association of America predicted that the number          of coffee cafés in the United States would rise from 500 in 1992          to 10,000 by 1999.
The Store Expansion Strategy
In          1992 and 1993 Starbucks developed a three-year geographic expansion strategy          that targeted areas which not only had favorable demographic profiles          but which also could be serviced and supported by the company's          operations infrastructure. For each targeted region, Starbucks selected          a large city to serve as a "hub"; teams of professionals were          located in hub cities to support the goal of opening 20 or more stores          in the hub in the first two years. Once stores blanketed the hub, then          additional stores were opened in smaller, surrounding "spoke" areas in the region. To oversee the expansion process, Starbucks created          zone vice presidents to direct the development of each region and to implant          the Starbucks culture in the newly opened stores. All of the new zone          vice presidents Starbucks recruited came with extensive operating and          marketing experience in chain-store retailing.
Starbucks' store          launches grew steadily more successful. In 1995, new stores generated          an average of $700,000 in revenue in their first year, far more than the          average of $427,000 in 1990. This was partly due to the growing reputation          of the Starbucks brand. In more and more instances, Starbucks' reputation          reached new markets even before stores opened. Moreover, existing stores          continued to post year-to-year gains in sales (see Exhibit          1 ).
Starbucks had notable success in identifying top retailing sites for its stores. The company          had the best real estate team in the coffee-bar industry and a sophisticated          system that enabled it to identify not only the most attractive individual          city blocks but also the exact store location that was best. The company's          site location track record was so good that as of 1997 it had closed only          2 of the 1,500 sites it had opened.
Real Estate, Store Design, Store Planning, and Construction
Schultz formed a headquarters group to create a store development process          based on a six-month opening schedule. Starting in 1991, the company began          to create its own in-house team of architects and designers to ensure          that each store would convey the right image and character. Stores had          to be custom-designed because the company didn't buy real estate          and build its own freestanding structures like McDonald's or Wal-Mart          did; rather, each space was leased in an existing structure and thus each          store differed in size and shape. Most stores ranged in size from 1,000          to 1,500 square feet and were located in office buildings, downtown and          suburban retail centers, airport terminals, university campus areas, or          busy neighborhood shopping areas convenient to pedestrian foot traffic.          Only a select few were in suburban malls. While similar materials and          furnishings were used to keep the look consistent and expenses reasonable,          no two stores ended up being exactly alike.
In 1994, Starbucks          began to experiment with a broader range of store formats. Special seating          areas were added to help make Starbucks a place where customers could          meet and chat or simply enjoy a peaceful interlude in their day. Grand          Cafés with fireplaces, leather chairs, newspapers, couches, and          lots of ambience were created to serve as flagship stores in high-traffic,          high-visibility locations. The company also experimented with drive-through          windows in locations where speed and convenience were important to customers          and with kiosks in supermarkets, building lobbies, and other public places.
To better reduce          average store-opening costs, which had reached an undesirably high $350,000          in 1995, the company centralized buying, developed standard contracts          and fixed fees for certain items, and consolidated work under those contractors          who displayed good cost-control practices. The retail operations group          outlined exactly the minimum amount of equipment each core store needed,          so that standard items could be ordered in volume from vendors at 20 to          30 percent discounts, then delivered just in time to the store site either          from company warehouses or the vendor. Modular designs for display cases          were developed. And the whole store layout was developed on a computer,          with software that allowed the costs to be estimated as the design evolved.          All this cut store-opening costs significantly and reduced store development          time from 24 to 18 weeks.
A "stores of          the future" project team was formed in 1995 to raise Starbucks'          store design to a still higher level and come up with the next generation          of Starbucks stores. Schultz and Olsen met with the team early on to present          their vision for what a Starbucks store should be like"an          authentic coffee experience that conveyed the artistry of espresso making,          a place to think and imagine, a spot where people could gather and talk          over a great cup of coffee, a comforting refuge that provided a sense          of community, a third place for people to congregate beyond work or the          home, a place that welcomed people and rewarded them for coming, and a          layout that could accommodate both fast service and quiet moments." The team researched the art and literature of coffee throughout the ages,          studied coffee-growing and coffee-making techniques, and looked at how          Starbucks stores had already evolved in terms of design, logos, colors,          and mood. The team came up with four store designsone for each          of the four stages of coffee making: growing, roasting, brewing, and aromaeach          with its own color combinations, lighting scheme, and component materials.          Within each of the four basic store templates, Starbucks could vary the          materials and details to adapt to different store sizes and settings (downtown          buildings, college campuses, neighborhood shopping areas). In late 1996,          Starbucks began opening new stores based on one of the four templates.          The company also introduced two ministore formats using the same styles          and finishes: the brevebar, a store-within-a-store for supermarkets          or office-building lobbies, and the doppio, a self-contained 8-square-foot          space that could be moved from spot to spot. Management believed the project          accomplished three objectives: better store designs, lower store-opening          costs (about $315,000 per store on average), and formats that allowed          sales in locations Starbucks could otherwise not consider.
For a number of years,          Starbucks avoided debt and financed new stores entirely with equity capital.          But as the company's profitability improved and its balance sheet strengthened,          Schultz's opposition to debt as a legitimate financing vehicle softened.          In 1996 the company completed its second debt offering, netting $161 million          from the sale of convertible debentures for use in its capital construction          program.

Product Line
Starbucks          stores offered a choice of regular or decaffeinated coffee beverages,          a special "coffee of the day," and a broad selection of Italian-style          espresso drinks. In addition, customers could choose from a wide selection          of fresh-roasted whole-bean coffees (which could be ground on the premises          and carried home in distinctive packages), a selection of fresh pastries          and other food items, sodas, juices, teas, and coffee-related hardware          and equipment. In 1997, the company introduced its Starbucks Barista home          espresso machine featuring a new portafilter system that accommodated          both ground coffee and Starbucks' new ready-to-use espresso pods. Power          Frappuccinoa version of the company's popular Frappuccino blended          beverage, packed with protein, carbohydrates, and vitaminswas tested          in several markets during 1997; another promising new product being tested          for possible rollout in 1998 was Chai Tea Lattè, a combination          of black tea, exotic spices, honey, and milk.
The company's retail          sales mix was roughly 61 percent coffee beverages, 15 percent whole-bean          coffees, 16 percent food items, and 8 percent coffee-related products          and equipment. The product mix in each store varied, depending on the          size and location of each outlet. Larger stores carried a greater variety          of whole coffee beans, gourmet food items, teas, coffee mugs, coffee grinders,          coffee-making equipment, filters, storage containers, and other accessories.          Smaller stores and kiosks typically sold a full line of coffee beverages,          a limited selection of whole-bean coffees, and a few hardware items.
In recent years, the          company began selling special jazz and blues CDs, which in some cases          were special compilations that had been put together for Starbucks to          use as store background music. The idea for selling the CDs originated          with a Starbucks store manager who had worked in the music industry and          selected the new "tape of the month" Starbucks played as background          in its stores. He had gotten compliments from customers wanting to buy          the music they heard and suggested to senior executives that there was          a market for the company's music tapes. Research that involved looking          through two years of comment cards turned up hundreds asking Starbucks          to sell the music it played in its stores. The Starbucks CDs, created          from the Capitol Records library, proved a significant addition to the          company's product line. Some of the CDs were specifically collections          designed to tie in with new blends of coffee that the company was promoting.          Starbucks also sold Oprah's Book Club selections, the profits of          which were donated to a literacy fund supported by the Starbucks Foundation.
The          company was constantly engaged in efforts to develop new ideas, new products,          and new experiences for customers that belonged exclusively to Starbucks.          Schultz and other senior executives drummed in the importance of always          being open to re-inventing the Starbucks experience.
Store Ambience
Starbucks management looked upon each store as a billboard for the company          and as a contributor to building the company's brand and image.          Each detail was scrutinized to enhance the mood and ambience of the store,          to make sure everything signaled "best of class" and that it          reflected the personality of the community and the neighborhood. The thesis          was "Everything matters." The company went to great lengths          to make sure the store fixtures, the merchandise displays, the colors,          the artwork, the banners, the music, and the aromas all blended to create          a consistent, inviting, stimulating environment that evoked the romance          of coffee, that signaled the company's passion for coffee, and that          rewarded customers with ceremony, stories, and surprise. Starbucks was          recognized for its sensitivity to neighborhood conservation with the Scenic          America's award for excellent design and "sensitive reuse of          spaces within cities."
To try to keep the          coffee aromas in the stores pure, Starbucks banned smoking and asked employees          to refrain from wearing perfumes or colognes. Prepared foods were kept          covered so customers would smell coffee only. Colorful banners and posters          were used to keep the look of Starbucks stores fresh and in keeping with          seasons and holidays. Company designers came up with artwork for commuter          mugs and T-shirts in different cities that was in keeping with each city's          personality (peach-shaped coffee mugs for Atlanta, pictures of Paul Revere          for Boston and the Statue of Liberty for New York).
To make sure that          Starbucks' stores measured up to standards, the company used "mystery          shoppers" who posed as customers and rated each location on a number          of criteria.
Building          a Top Management Team
Schultz          continued to strengthen Starbucks' top management team, hiring people          with extensive experience in managing and expanding retail chains. Orin          Smith, who had an MBA from Harvard and 13 years' experience at Deloitte          and Touche, was brought in as chief financial officer in 1990 and then          was promoted to president and chief operating officer in 1994. The four          key executives during the company's formative yearsHoward          Schultz, Dave Olsen, Howard Behar, and Orin Smithcontributed the          most to defining and shaping the company's values, principles, and          culture. As the company grew, additional executives were added in marketing,          store supervision, specialty sales, human resources, finance, and information systems. Schultz also took care to add people to Starbucks' board          of directors who had experience growing a retail chain and who could add          valuable perspectives.
Employee Training
Accommodating fast growth also meant putting in systems to recruit, hire,          and train baristas and store managers. Starbucks' vice president          for human resources used some simple guidelines in screening candidates          for new positions: "We want passionate people who love coffee . .          . We're looking for a diverse workforce, which reflects our community.          We want people who enjoy what they're doing and for whom work is          an extension of themselves."16 Some 80 percent of Starbucks employees          were white, 85 percent had some education beyond high school, and the          average age was 26.
Every partner/barista          hired for a retail job in a Starbucks store received at least 24 hours          training in the first two to four weeks. The training included classes          on coffee history, drink preparation, coffee knowledge (four hours), customer          service (four hours), and retail skills, plus a four-hour workshop called "Brewing the Perfect Cup." Baristas were trained in using the          cash register, weighing beans, opening the bag properly, capturing the          beans without spilling them on the floor, holding the bag in a way that          keeps air from being trapped inside, and affixing labels on the package          exactly one-half inch over the Starbucks logo. Beverage preparation occupied          even more training time, involving such activities as grinding the beans,          steaming milk, learning to pull perfect (18- to 23-second) shots of espresso,          memorizing the recipes of all the different drinks, practicing making          the different drinks, and learning how to make drinks to customer specifications.          There were sessions on how to clean the milk wand on the espresso machine,          explain the Italian drink names to customers, sell an $875 home espresso          machine, make eye contact with customers, and take personal responsibility          for the cleanliness of the coffee bins. Everyone was drilled in the Star          Skills, three guidelines for on-the-job interpersonal relations: (1) maintain          and enhance self-esteem, (2) listen and acknowledge, and (3) ask for help.          And there were rules to be memorized: milk must be steamed to at least          150 degrees Fahrenheit but never more than 170 degrees; every espresso          shot not pulled within 23 seconds must be tossed; customers who order          one pound of beans must be given exactly thatnot .995 pounds or          1.1 pounds; never let coffee sit in the pot more than 20 minutes; always          compensate dissatisfied customers with a Starbucks coupon that entitles          them to a free drink.
Management trainees          attended classes for 8 to 12 weeks. Their training went much deeper, covering          not only the information imparted to baristas but also the details of          store operations, practices and procedures as set forth in the company's          operating manual, information systems, and the basics of managing people.          Starbucks' trainers were all store managers and district managers          with on-site experience. One of their major objectives was to ingrain          the company's values, principles, and culture and to impart their          knowledge about coffee and their passion about Starbucks.
Each time Starbucks          opened stores in a new market, it undertook a major recruiting effort.          Eight to 10 weeks before opening, the company placed ads to hire baristas          and begin their training. It sent a Star team of experienced managers          and baristas from existing stores to the area to lead the store-opening          effort and to conduct one-on-one training following the company's          formal classes and basic orientation sessions at the Starbucks Coffee          School in San Francisco.
Product Supply
Dave Olsen, Starbucks' senior vice president for coffee, personally          spearheaded Starbucks' efforts to secure top-notch coffee beans          to supply the company's growing needs. He traveled regularly to          coffee-producing countriesColombia, Sumatra, Yemen, Antigua, Indonesia,          Guatemala, New Guinea, Costa Rica, Sulawesi, Papua New Guinea, Kenya,          Ethiopia, Javabuilding relationships with growers and exporters,          checking on agricultural conditions and crop yields, and searching out          varieties and sources that would meet Starbucks' exacting standards          of quality and flavor. Reporting to Olsen was a group that created and          tested new blends of beans from different sources.
Although most coffee          was purchased in the commodity marketcoffee was the world's          second largest traded commoditycoffee of the quality sought by          Starbucks was usually purchased on a negotiated basis at a substantial          premium above commodity coffees, depending on supply and demand at the          time of purchase. Coffee prices were subject to considerable volatility          due to weather, economic, and political conditions in the growing countries,          as well as agreements establishing export quotas or efforts on the part          of the International Coffee Organization and the Association of Coffee          Producing Countries to restrict coffee supplies.
Starbucks entered          into fixed-price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply          of quality green coffee beans and to limit its exposure to fluctuating          coffee prices in upcoming periods. When satisfactory fixed-price commitments          were not available, the company purchased coffee futures contracts to          provide price protection. Nonetheless, there had been occasions in years          past when unexpected jumps in coffee prices had put a squeeze on the company's          margins and necessitated an increase in the prices of its beverages and          beans sold at retail.
Roasting          Coffee Beans
Starbucks considered          the roasting of its coffee beans to be an art form. Each batch was roasted          in a powerful gas oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Highly trained and experienced          roasting personnel monitored the process, using both smell and hearing,          to judge when the beans were perfectly donecoffee beans make a          popping sound when ready. Starbucks' standards were so exacting          that roasters tested the color of the beans in a blood-cell analyzer and          discarded the entire batch if the reading wasn't on target.
On a daily basis,          when he wasn't traveling in search of coffee supplies, Dave Olsen          checked coffee samples from the roasting process, sniffing the aromas,          tasting sample cups, and recording his observations in a logbook.
In 1998, Starbucks          had three roasting plants. The company's smallest plant, built in          1989 and originally thought to be big enough to supply the company's          needs for the next 10 years, was dedicated to supplying the company's          mail-order business. In 1993, a 305,000-square-foot plant was opened in          Kent, Washington, just south of Seattle; its output mainly was being used          to supply stores west of the Mississippi. In 1994, the company began construction          of an $11 million roasting facility in York, Pennsylvania, that could          be expanded to 1 million square feet to supply stores east of the Mississippi.
Bonding with Customers
About 5 million customers per week were patronizing Starbucks stores in          early 1998. Stores did about half of their business by 11 am. Loyal customers          patronized a Starbucks store 15 to 20 times a month, spending perhaps          $50 monthly. Some customers were Starbucks fanatics, coming in daily.          Baristas became familiar with regular customers, learning their names          and their favorite drinks. Christine Nagy, a field director for Oracle          Corporation in Palo Alto, California, told a Wall Street Journal reporter, "For me, it's a daily necessity or I start getting          withdrawals."17 Her standard order was a custom drink: a decaf grande          nonfat no-whip no-foam extra-cocoa mocha; when the baristas saw her come          through the door, she told the reporter, "They just [said,] 'We          need a Christine here.'"
Mail Order Sales
Starbucks published a mail-order catalog that was distributed six times          a year and that offered coffee, candies and pastries, and select coffee-making          equipment and accessories. A special business gift-giving catalog was          mailed to business accounts during the 1997 Christmas holiday season.          The company also had an electronic store on the Internet. In 1997, sales          of this division were about $21.2 million, roughly 2 percent of total          revenues; almost 50,000 mail-order customers were signed up to receive          monthly deliveries of Starbucks coffee as of late 1997. Starbucks management          believed that its direct-response marketing effort helped pave the way          for retail expansion into new markets and reinforced brand recognition          in existing markets.
Joint          Ventures
In 1994, after months          of meetings and experimentation, PepsiCo and Starbucks entered into a joint venture arrangement to create new coffee-related          products for mass distribution through Pepsi channels, including cold          coffee drinks in a bottle or can. Howard Schultz saw this as a major paradigm          shift with the potential to cause Starbucks business to evolve in heretofore          unimaginable directions; he thought it was time to look for ways to move          Starbucks out into more mainstream markets. Cold coffee products had generally          met with very poor market reception, except in Japan, where there was          an $8 billion market for ready-to-drink coffee-based beverages. Nonetheless,          Schultz was hoping the partners would hit on a new product to exploit          a good-tasting coffee extract that had been developed by Starbucks' recently          appointed director of research and development. The joint venture's first          new product, Mazagran, a lightly flavored carbonated coffee drink, was          a failure; when test- marketed in southern California, some consumers          liked it and some hated it. While people were willing to try it the first          time, partly because the Starbucks name was on the label, repeat sales          proved disappointing. Despite the clash of cultures and the different          motivations of the two partners, the partnership held together because          of the good working relationship that evolved between Howard Schultz and          Pepsi's senior executives. Then Schultz, at a meeting to discuss the future          of Mazagran, suggested, "Why not develop a bottled version of Frappuccino?"18          Starbucks had come up with the new cold coffee drink it called Frappuccino          in the summer of 1995, and it had proved to be a big hot-weather seller;          Pepsi executives were enthusiastic. After months of experimentation, the          joint venture product research team came up with a shelf-stable version          of Frappuccino that tasted quite good. It was tested in West Coast supermarkets          in the summer of 1996; the response was overwhelming, with sales running          10 times over projections and 70 percent repeat business. In September          1996, the partnership invested in three bottling facilities to make Frappuccino,          with plans to begin wider distribution. Sales of Frappuccino reached $125          million in 1997 and achieved national supermarket penetration of 80 percent.          Sales were projected to reach $500 million in 1998; Starbucks management          believed that the market for Frappuccino would ultimately exceed $1 billion.
In October 1995 Starbucks          partnered with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream to supply coffee extract for a new line of coffee ice          cream made and distributed by Dreyer's under the Starbucks brand. The          new line, featuring such flavors as Dark Roast Espresso Swirl, JavaChip,          Vanilla MochaChip, Biscotti Bliss, and Caffe Almond Fudge, hit supermarket          shelves in April 1996; by July, Starbucks coffee-flavored ice cream was          the top-selling superpremium brand in the coffee segment. In 1997, two          new low-fat flavors were added to complement the original six flavors,          along with two flavors of ice cream bars; all were well received in the          marketplace. Additional new ice cream products were planned for 1998.
Also in 1995, Starbucks          worked with Seattle's Redhook Ale Brewery to create Double Black          Stout, a stout beer with a shot of Starbucks coffee extract in it.
Licensed Stores          and Specialty Sales
In recent years Starbucks          had begun entering into a limited number of licensing agreements for store          locations in areas where it did not have ability to locate its own outlets.          The company had an agreement with Marriott          Host International that allowed Host to operate Starbucks retail stores          in airport locations, and it had an agreement with Aramark Food and Services          to put Starbucks stores on university campuses and other locations operated          by Aramark .          Starbucks received a license fee and a royalty on sales at these locations          and supplied the coffee for resale in the licensed locations. All licensed          stores had to follow Starbucks' detailed operating procedures, and all          managers and employees who worked in these stores received the same training          given to Starbucks managers and store employees.
Starbucks also had          a specialty sales group that provided its coffee products to restaurants,          airlines, hotels, universities, hospitals, business offices, country clubs,          and select retailers. One of the early users of Starbucks coffee was Horizon          Airlines , a regional carrier based in Seattle. In 1995, Starbucks          entered into negotiations with United          Airlines to have Starbucks coffee served on all United flights. There          was much internal debate at Starbucks about whether such a move made sense          for Starbucks and the possible damage to the integrity of the Starbucks          brand if the quality of the coffee served did not measure up. After seven          months of negotiation and discussion over coffee-making procedures, United          Airlines and Starbucks came up with a way to handle quality control on          some 500-plus planes with varying equipment, and Starbucks became the          coffee supplier to the 20 million passengers flying United each year.
In addition, Starbucks          made arrangements to supply an exclusive coffee blend to Nordstrom's for sale only in Nordstrom stores, to operate coffee bars in Barnes & Noble bookstores, and to offer coffee service at some Wells          Fargo Bank locations in California. Most recently, Starbucks began          selling its coffees in Chapters, a Toronto book retailer with sites throughout          Canada, and in Costco warehouse club stores. A 1997 agreement with U.S.          Office Products gave Starbucks the opportunity to provide its coffee to          workers in 1.5 million business offices. In fiscal 1997, the specialty          sales division generated sales of $117.6 million, equal to 12.2 percent          of total revenues.
International Expansion
In          markets outside the continental United States (including Hawaii), Starbucks'          strategy was to license a reputable and capable local company with retailing          know-how in the target host country to develop and operate new Starbucks          stores. In some cases, Starbucks was a joint venture partner in the stores          outside the continental Untied States. Starbucks created a new subsidiary,          Starbucks Coffee International (SCI), to orchestrate overseas expansion          and begin to build the Starbucks brand name globally via licensees; Howard          Behar was president of SCI.
Going          into 1998, SCI had 12 retail stores in Tokyo, 7 in Hawaii, 6 in Singapore,          and 1 in the Philippines. Agreements had been signed with licensees to          begin opening stores in Taiwan and Korea in 1998. The company and its          licensees had plans to open as many as 40 stores in the Pacific Rim by          the end of September 1998. The licensee in Taiwan foresaw a potential          of 200 stores in that country alone. The potential of locating stores          in Europe and Latin America was being explored.
Corporate Responsibility
Howard Schultz's effort to "build a company with soul" included a broad-based program of corporate responsibility, orchestrated          mainly through the Starbucks Foundation, set up in 1997. Starbucks was          the largest corporate contributor in North America to CARE, a worldwide          relief and development organization that sponsored health, education,          and humanitarian aid programs in most of the Third World countries where          Starbucks purchased its coffee supplies; Starbucks began making annual          corporate contributions to CARE when it became profitable in 1991. In          addition, CARE samplers of coffee and CARE-related mugs, backpacks, and          T-shirts were offered in the company's mail-order catalog; a portion          of the price on all sales was donated to CARE. In 1995 Starbucks began          a program to improve the conditions of workers in coffee-growing countries,          establishing a code of conduct for its growers and providing financial          assistance for agricultural improvement projects. In 1997, Starbucks formed          an alliance with Appropriate Technology International to help poor, small-scale          coffee growers in Guatemala increase their income by improving the quality          of their crops and their market access; the company's first-year          grant of $75,000 went to fund a new processing facility and set up a loan          program for a producer cooperative. Starbucks stores also featured CARE          in promotions and had organized concerts with Kenny G and Mary Chapin          Carpenter to benefit CARE.
Starbucks had an          Environmental Committee that looked for ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle          waste, as well as contribute to local community environmental efforts.          There was also a Green Team, consisting of store managers from all regions.          The company had donated almost $200,000 to literacy improvement efforts,          using the profits from store sales of Oprah's Book Club selections.          Starbucks stores participated regularly in local charitable projects of          one kind or another, donating drinks, books, and proceeds from store-opening          benefits. The company's annual report listed nearly 100 community          organizations which Starbucks and its employees had supported in 1997          alone. Employees were encouraged to recommend and apply for grants from          the Starbucks Foundation to benefit local community literacy organizations.
On the Fourth of          July weekend in 1997, three Starbucks employees were murdered in the company's          store in the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C. Starbucks offered a $100,000          reward for information leading to the arrest of the murderer(s) and announced          it would reopen the store in early 1998 and donate all future net proceeds          of that store to a Starbucks Memorial Fund that would make annual grants          to local groups working to reduce violence and aid the victims of violent          crimes.
Competitors
Going into 1997, there were an estimated 8,000 specialty coffee outlets          in the United States. Starbucks' success was prompting a number of ambitious          rivals to scale up their expansion plans. Observers believed there was          room in the category for two or three national players, maybe more. Starbucks'          closest competitor, Second          Cup , a Canadian franchisor with stores primarily in Canada, was less          than one-third its size; Second Cup owned Gloria Jeans, a franchisor of          specialty coffees, with stores located primarily in malls throughout the          United States. No other rival had as many as 250 stores, but there were          at least 20 small local and regional chains that aspired to grow into          rivals of Starbucks, most notably New World Coffee, Coffee          People , Coffee Station, Java          Centrale , and Caribou          Coffee . Observers expected many of the local and regional chains to          merge in efforts to get bigger and better position themselves as an alternative          to Starbucks. In addition, numerous restaurants were picking up on the          growing popularity of specialty coffees and had installed machines to          serve espresso, cappuccino, lattè, and other coffee drinks to their          customers.
The company also faced competition from nationwide coffee manufacturers          such as Kraft General Foods (the parent of Maxwell House), Procter & Gamble (the owner of the Folger's brand), and Nestlé ,          which distributed their coffees through supermarkets. There were also          a number of specialty coffee companies that sold whole-bean coffees in          supermarkets. Because many consumers were accustomed to purchasing their          coffee supplies at supermarkets, it was easy for them to substitute these          products for Starbucks.
Building the Starbucks Brand
So far, Starbucks had spent very little money on advertising, preferring          instead to build the brand cup by cup with customers and depend on word-of-mouth          and the appeal of its storefronts. The company was, however, engaged in          a growing effort to extend the Starbucks brand and penetrate new markets.          In addition to expanding internationally, venturing into ice cream with          Dreyer's and into Frappuccino with Pepsi, partnering with licensees,          and developing specialty and mail-order sales, Starbucks had recently          begun selling its coffees in supermarkets.
Supermarket sales          were test-marketed in over 500 stores in Chicago in the summer of 1997.          Management believed that the tests confirmed the appeal of offering Starbucks          coffee to existing customers in convenient supermarket locations while          at the same time introducing new customers to its products. Two-thirds          of all coffee was sold in supermarkets. In November 1997, Starbucks hired          Nestlé veteran, Jim Ailing, as senior vice president of grocery          operations to direct Starbucks' supermarket sales effort. The company          started rolling out supermarket sales of its coffees in 10 major metropolitan          areas in the spring of 1998. Starbucks coffee sold in supermarkets featured          distinctive, elegant packaging; prominent positions in grocery aisles;          and the same premium quality as that sold in its own stores. Product freshness          was guaranteed by Starbucks' FlavorLock packaging, and the price          per pound paralleled the prices in Starbucks' retail stores.
The company was          also said to be testing "light roast" coffee blends for those          customers who found its current offerings too strong. And, in the summer          of 1997, Starbucks quietly test-marketed four 20 percent fruit-juice beverages          in one market.19 The single-serve bottled drinks were priced around $2,          and at least one contained caffeine. Also on the new-product front was          an apple cider made exclusively for Starbucks by Nantucket Nectars. Plus,          the company was selling chocolate bars and other candy, and had plans          to bring candy production in-house if sales went well enough.
The          Future
Industry          analysts in 1998 saw Starbucks as being well on its way to becoming the          Nike or Coca-Cola of the specialty coffee segment. It was the only company          with anything close to national market coverage. The company's most          immediate objective was to have 2,000 stores in operation by the year          2000. Its longer range objective was to become the most recognized and          respected brand of coffee in the world. The company's efforts to          greatly increase its sphere of strategic interest via its joint ventures          with Pepsi and Dreyer's, its move to sell coffee in supermarkets, and the possibility of marketing fruit-juice drinks and candy under the          Starbucks label represented an ongoing drive on Schultz's part to          continually reinvent the way Starbucks did business.
In          order to sustain the company's growth and make Starbucks a strong          global brand, Schultz believed that the company had to challenge the status          quo, be innovative, take risks, and alter its vision of who it was, what          it did, and where it was headed. Under his guidance, management was posing          a number of fundamental strategic questions: What could Starbucks do to          make its stores an even more elegant "third place" that welcomed,          rewarded, and surprised customers? What new products and new experiences          could the company provide that would uniquely belong to or be associated          with Starbucks? What could coffee bebesides being hot or liquid?          How could Starbucks reach people who were not coffee drinkers? What strategic          paths should Starbucks pursue to achieve its objective of becoming the          most recognized and respected brand of coffee in the world?
