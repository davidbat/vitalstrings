This is my Starbucks as it's located only a couple of blocks away from work. The other day, I ordered my usual Venti Caramel Macchiato, and thought nothing of it. Well, I did have reservations about the Barista who took forever flirting with the 3 gentlemen ahead of me. I mean wow, he tipped her 2 whole dollars, for crying out loud.  Anyway, 2 of the aforementioned gentlemen got to the counter ahead of me when my drink was called. I thought no big deal, everybody orders the same drinks, right? I look over at the counter and the Barista is no longer making drinks.   I thought to myself (what the?) I tell this young man , "Excuse me, there is another Venti Caramel Macchiato coming, yes?" He was stunned at the hutzpa of those people for taking my drink. Me too.   Anyway, he promptly asked me if I wanted an extra shot on my drink for free and that he was making another one, tout de suite.   Good save. Thank you for the customer service!
