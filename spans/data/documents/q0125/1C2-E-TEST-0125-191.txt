re: Atomica
Thanks for the info.  I might try one but given the travel I'd probably avoid it or have really low expectations.  I mean, how many days does it take to get from Seattle to the Bay Area?  A donut over 18 hours old is suspect in my book...although I will eat them.

Maybe I'm cheap, but I can't bring myself to pay $1.65 for an "imported" (read: stale) donut - which is what they're going for here in the South Bay - rather than $0.65 for a fresh one.  The other day on the way to work, I was tempted by a lovely-looking donut at Starbucks, balked at the price, then, with donuts on the brain, stopped at Stan's (in Santa Clara, REALLY GOOD DONUTS!) and got 3 for $1.95.  Unfortunately, I ate them all before the day was over!

I was not familiar with these donuts but saw them in a Las Vegas Starbucks and had to give one a try. It was excellent, with a much more substantial consistency and  not- too-sweet falvor. Now that I know what they are all about, I look forward to trying them at the source in Seattle.

Top Pot donuts are the best I've had except for that bakery on the east end of Long Island. Maybe someone has SF/Berk/Oak donuts to recommend if the Top Pot are stale? Definetely check them out in Seattle.

Hmmm ... this seemed an innocent question that is gone ... but are you sure they are donuts imported from Seattle? In Detroit Starbucks is making making Polish donuts in-shop. Maybe there's a similar situation here where the donut dough is sent from Seattle and fried here ... one can always be optomistic, eh?
