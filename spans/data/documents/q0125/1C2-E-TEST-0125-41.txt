A third of transactions at Starbucks involve a food element, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a conference call announcing the purchase, which is expected to close in the company's fiscal fourth quarter following regulatory approvals.
“This is an investment in our core business,” Schultz said in an earlier statement. “After more than 40 years, we will be able to say that we are bakers too.”
Starbucks is now also a juice purveyor and sometime alcohol seller. The company said it has made a push in recent years to get rid of artificial ingredients and offer smaller portion sizes. It has also caved to consumer concerns about add-ins such as dyes made from cochineal insects.
Once the deal goes through, Rigo will be named senior vice president and general manager of La Boulange Bakery at Starbucks. Bay Bread’s wholesale customers will continue to be served as usual.
Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks’ U.S. and Americas segment, said that the company will work with outside suppliers to expand La Boulange’s offerings but stressed its “unwavering commitment” to the brand’s uniqueness. He said he expects the acquisition to help drive customer traffic into Starbucks, especially in the morning.
La Boulange currently operates 19 Bay Area stores selling croissants, pastries, loaves, cookies, breads and more as well as products in upscale restaurants, hotels and specialty grocery stores in the region.
