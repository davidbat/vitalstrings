When I tell my friends that my favorite place in Noe Valley and Mission is this Starbucks I get awkward looks of disapproval - Starbucks is not in fashion. Luckily I never cared about what's fashionable and I owe this place months of wonderfully spent productive time, so I think it deserves a detailed positive Yelp review from me!
What's great about this place?
-- the lighting: plenty of daylight on a sunny day, still plenty of light on a foggy day, pleasant warm artificial lighting in the evening
-- the atmosphere: a good balance of people coming here to chat with friends, spend time with their kids/parents, study, read, work; good mix of different ages, cultures and types of people
-- the decor: very well done interior (but nothing extravagant); I love that they change the artwork on the walls from time to time, and the quality of the artwork is actually respectable
-- the staff: always friendly, they take time to listen to the orders and gladly accommodate special requests
-- the music: just the right volume level, just the right energy level, chosen with a sense of taste
-- the "library" aspect: I can study/read/work here for an unlimited amount of time - stayed as little as half an hour, as long as the whole day (and I am not exaggerating when I say the whole day); there is free wifi, albeit it is a bit too slow for my liking
-- the cleanliness: not so uncommon in Noe Valley, but can be difficult to come by in some neighboring areas
What's unique about this place?
-- It's open till 10/10:30pm. As far as I know there is no other cafe in Noe open this late.
-- It actually has decent cafe food for less than $5. Anybody knows of another clean cafe open late that would serve food for this little in either Noe or Mission?
All in all, this cafe makes me happier every time I visit. Hope you feel the same next time you head there.
