Licensed Stores (not operated by Starbucks)
PLEASE NOTE
The list below is not meant to be a complete list of licensed stores. Some licensed stores are not listed on the Starbucks web site, and some of the stores listed below might have closed. That's not really important. I only keep track of them so I know which ones I don't need to visit. But if you know for certain that any of these are actually operated by Starbucks, please let me know (and send me a phone # so I can double-confirm).
