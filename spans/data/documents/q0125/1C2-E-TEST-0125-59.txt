A hearty congratulations is in store for Palo Alto.
In addition to Stanford University, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, AOL, and Jeremy Lin’s high school, the city will soon be home to another uniquely American landmark: a drive-through Starbucks.
The city is getting its seventh Starbucks location, nary three blocks away from another one, but lucky number seven will be find itself in the abodes of a bygone Jack-In-The-Box. This twist of fate means customers will have the luxury of ordering their orange mocha frappuccinos and Reduced-Fat Very Berry Coffee Cake without leaving the plushy confines of their Palo Alto vehicles.
According to the Starbucks website , the only other drive-through location anywhere near San Francisco is in Serramonte in the necropolis that is Colma; there are a few others in the further reaches of the East and South Bay.
