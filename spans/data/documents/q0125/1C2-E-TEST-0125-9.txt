Bittersweet. Fantastic people watching (to a point though because all you ever see are "hunters" and "posers" waiting to be "hunted") and the slide-away windows (did you know they actually do that? yes, you can open them even as a customer) and the open air feel is awesome on a Saturday or Sunday midday-afternoon. Very nice.
Inside it's a mix of cool locals and some very depressed looking has beens and lap toppers just too nerdy to reproduce and too serious for any evidence of social skills. A little depressing. Kinda like an airport only nobody has any real excuse to look so haggard since there are no planes to step off of.
But then just when it gets boring, there's homeless, homeless everywhere! And crazies! Oh yes, that's right, its part of Frisco's "charm". If you want homeless-free experience go to a Republican town somewhere out of state. Here, it's politically correct ot be homeless or at least dress like it (google "Mission Hipster - feeling guilty for having a job when others dont? prideful of your poverty? "ONE" with the common man?)
The bathroom is one atrocious firebombed, homeless bathing station, needle gallery (no so many needles lately) of funk and stench. Just like Berkeley only without the pretense and much more angst. Sorry, I forgot - part of the Frisco charm thing.
Poor baristas are as disconnected as an EMS worker. They have to be with all that unbelievable drama inside and outside on the concrete benches to contend with. Yelling, screaming, crying, talking to self, dramatcs for days and days. It's like Springer and Cookoos Nest on your front porch.
The art (yes its actual original art not office art) is nice and they actually have a compost bin.
The drinks? Eh, boring (at least it doesnt taste burnt like Peets) but in the Castro, what else is there really?
Was this review â€¦?
