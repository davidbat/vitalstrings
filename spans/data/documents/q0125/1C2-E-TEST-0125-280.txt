Getting Around Union Square & San Francisco
Unless you are planning on a daily basis to be driving outside of San Francisco, it would be recommended you don't rent a car at the airport. Either take Bart from the Airport to San Francisco, an Airport Van or a Taxi. It is very expensive to park your car in San Francisco and most hotels charge extra up to $100 per night. There are many rental car agency offices right in Union Square near most hotels and in some hotels for the days you might want to travel outside of San Francisco. Otherwise, the cable car and taxis are the best way to get around The City.
