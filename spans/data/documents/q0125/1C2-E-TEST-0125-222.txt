Starbucks turns 40
March 28, 2011
Starbucks went into business 40 years ago Wednesday, and coffee drinking hasn't been the same. The Seattle-based innovator made the "small" into the "tall," the clerk into the    barista    and the complex order into performance art and punch line — shot-of-this, skinny-that, 180-degrees, please.      It even went global, winning converts in the tea-drinking strongholds of Japan and Britain. China, you're next.      What Starbucks didn't do, however, is make coffee the adult beverage of choice once again.

Stealth Starbucks: Seattle-based coffee giant opening neighborhood shops in disguise
By Steve Johnson | July 17, 2009
In the continued flailings of the Starbucks chain, here's a new one: the stealth Starbucks store.      A Seattle outlet of the 16,000-store coffee behemoth is being rebranded without visible Starbucks identifiers, as 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea.      Two other stores in Starbucks' native Seattle will follow suit, each getting its own name to make it sound more like a neighborhood hangout, less like Big Coffee, a Starbucks official told The Seattle Times...

From Mao to 'money worship'
Steve Chapman | May 24, 2012
-  On an island in the Xiang River stands a massive bust of the late Chinese ruler Mao Zedong as a young man, his long hair blowing gracefully in an imaginary wind. Good thing for him he's a safe distance from the Expo Central China. If he could see it, he would be tearing his hair out.      As leader of the communist revolution of 1949, Mao was dedicated to class struggle and the elimination of property. He created a totalitarian society in which everyone wore the same clothes, chanted the same slogans and  -  as far as anyone knew  -  thought the same revolutionary thoughts.

Starbucks Welcome
By Michael S. Sigman | August 20, 2000
I was greatly amused by "Starbucks saturation stirs bitter backlash" (Page 1, Aug. 12). Never have I read so much laughable, unjustifiable whining from the people you interviewed. Hey I'm no great fan of gargantuan, monolithic corporations economically stepping on a neighborhood's identity or contributing to the diminishing supply (and higher prices) of property either. I learned long ago from my father and grandfather, small business owners, that if you're to succeed against the huge "chain" that bludgeons its way into town, your own business certainly needs to distinguish itself from all others.
