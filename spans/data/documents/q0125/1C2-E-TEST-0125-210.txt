January 2012: Commuters walking toward a rail station are seen through the window of a Starbucks store as snow  accumulates in downtown Chicago. Responding to customer feedback for more options to relax in its stores in the evenings, Starbucks Coffee announced on Jan. 23, 2012, plans to bring wine, beer and premium food offerings to a handful of locations in Atlanta and Southern California by the end of this year. These stores, along with several others recently announced for the Chicago area, will be the first extensions of the evening day-part concept outside of the Pacific Northwest.
