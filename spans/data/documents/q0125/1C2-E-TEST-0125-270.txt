FramelineGate!                                       hits the media
For five years,                                       QUIT! has been working with others in our                                       community to convince Frameline,                                       presenters of the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival, that                                       queer culture doesn't require partnering                                       with war criminals.  Now a packet of                                       documents leaked from the Jewish Community                                       Federation documents the lengths that the                                       Israeli Consulate went to to count this                                       campaign, and how Frameline colluded with                                       them to silence dissent in our                                       community.  Read                                       about this outrage against the                                       progressive roots of the LGBT liberation                                       struggle.

Palestinian Queers                                       Call for Boycott of Israel
In February,                                       speakers from ASWAT - Palestinian Gay                                       Women, al Qaws for Sexual and Gender                                       Diversity in Palestine, and Palestinian                                       Queers for BDS spoke to over 700 people in                                       San Francisco and Berkeley, as part of a                                       highly successful national tour.  They talked about how harmful "pinkwashing" - the Zionist efforts to portray Israel as                                       the only queer-friendly democracy in the                                       Middle East, is to their struggle for                                       equality and recognition.
After the tour,                                       Palestinian Queers for BDS issued an open                                       letter asking all queer institutions                                       to decline invitations to visit Israel or                                       partner with mainstream Israeli                                       institutions.
