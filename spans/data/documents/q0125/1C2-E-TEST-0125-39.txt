Yesterday I started out the morning full of confidence and high hopes. It ended with 55 points hung up on my alma mater. I then became a little cranky. Actually truth be told, I was a lot cranky. I decided to bail on my friends and catch a late night flight home back to SFO.
I woke up this morning still feeling cranky and decided it would be best if I just went into the office. Who cares if it was 5:50 in the morning I wasn't going to sleep anyway.
After just an hour of trying to work I thought about my true love in life---Hot Cocoa--- And I believe now is the time to fill you on my official 2009 hot chocolate ratings. So here you go, your guide to the best (and worst) of hot cocoa 2009.
Starbucks 7 out of 13. A bit heavy and syrupy. The milk flavor is hidden but I have my way of ordering that can greatly improve your experience.
Peets 8 out of 14. A little lighter than it's Starbucks counterpart with a little more froth as well. Careful ordering it "extra hot" because they will.
Specialties 11 out of 15. One of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. It's almost perfect and reminds of hot cocoa that you would find in Europe. Nice color as well, much like a fine wine.
Swiss Miss 9 out of 16. Yes, these packets of dried up cocoa is underrated. Used best with warm milk, but do not be afraid to mix with hot water as the yummy flavor remains.
Town Hall 18 out of 20. The best hot chocolate in the City, hands down. If you live within 50 miles of this p;lace, it's worth the drive. Trust me on this.
The vending machine at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation 3 out of 9. It's just piping hot water with a dash of something brown.
Starbucks (any airport location) 6 out of 14. Yes, your Starbucks experience at the airport is different than what you are used to. This is true.
There you have it. My 2009 ratings of hot cocoa. Feel to print a copy and take it with you and share this guide with your friends.
