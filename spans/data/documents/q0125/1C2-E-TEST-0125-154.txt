Notes: Coffee Sales;  Coffee Accessory Sales
Review
Another faceless Starbucks-branded experience attached to an office building atrium, this time its for the accountants and consultants in the 199 Fremont building. They have a few indoor tables and the mandatory for-sale Starbucks soundtrack overhead - the typical Pottery Barn selection of jazz classics with 'nuevo electronico' riffs. Using dual Verismo machines, they produce an espresso with a very pale crema that barely covers the surface of the anonymously manufactured Starbucks for-here cup. Volumewise, the pour isn't too excessive, and it has a darker roast flavor primarily dominated by smokiness. But this is hardly a stretch from their drip coffee.
