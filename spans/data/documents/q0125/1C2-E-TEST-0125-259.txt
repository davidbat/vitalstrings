Starbucks will open its first two cafes in Tel Aviv during the first week of September and plans to open another three                      branches in the area by the end of the year with 15 more throughout                      Israel by the end of 2002. Israel-based Delek, which recently                      purchased a chain of US convenience stores and established                      its US headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, will be the majority                      shareholder in Starbucks Israel.

Starbucks next                      market: Israel
Starbucks Coffee Co. chairman Howard Schultz loves a challenge.                      He opened the Japanese market during the depths of that country's                      spectacular recession, and now he's set his sights on conflict-ridden                      Israel.
The stores will be built through a joint venture company,                      Shalom Coffee Co., which will be owned by publicly traded                      Israeli conglomerate Delek Group and Starbucks Coffee International,                      Starbucks' internationally focused wholly-owned subsidiary.                      No word yet on how many Starbucks stores are planned for the                      tiny Middle Eastern nation, which has been plagued by escalating                      violence between Palestinians and the Israeli military since                      last fall.

Starbucks to                      open here later in year
By Sharon Berger
JERUSALEM (April 20) - The Delek Group and Starbucks Coffee                      International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Starbucks Coffee                      Company, said yesterday that they had reached an agreement                      to form a joint venture to open Starbucks here. The costs                      involved in the joint venture were not disclosed.
According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed                      in the next few weeks, Delek will hold 80.5 percent of the                      coffee chain, while Starbucks Coffee International will hold                      the remaining 19.5%. Starbucks will have the option to increase                      its share to 50% at a later date. Originally Delek and Burger                      King co-owner Yair Hason were negotiating for a 40% share                      each in a venture with Starbucks, but a few months ago the                      deal was cancelled.
The announcement that Starbucks will be coming is expected                      to be welcomed by local coffee lovers who have long been awaiting                      the rumored arrival of the chain which has with 3,600 stores                      in the US. According to the Delek Group the plan is "to                      open dozens of stores." The first stores are expected                      to open late this year.
"We expect Israel to be an excellent market for Starbucks,                      with great growth opportunities," said Peter Masien,                      president of Starbucks Coffee International.
Delek's investment in the coffee chain is part of its strategy                      to expand into new areas, said Giora Sarig, president of Delek's                      Israel Fuel Corporation, one of the three subsidiaries of                      the Delek Group. "We are delighted to become partners                      with such a world-class brand as Starbucks," he said.
The coffee shops will not be connected to the Delek gas stations.
The local competition is not overly concerned about the entrance                      of the well known chain. Aroma's operating manager Ben Balbinder                      told The Jerusalem Post that "more coffee stores will                      raise the awareness of coffee drinking."
He added that according to his personal experience in the                      US, Starbucks coffee is not on the same level as that of Aroma.
Aroma, which sells one and half tonnes of coffee a month,                      currently has eight cafes with another three are to be opened                      in the next two months. Balbinder said that the local coffee                      market is continuing to grow and has contributed to a decision                      to expand aggressively in the next year and a half.
Starbucks , which has been traded on Nasdaq since 1992, has                      a current market capitalization of $7.8 billion, with more                      than 4,500 retail locations in the US, Europe, the Middle                      East, and the Pacific Rim. It is well represented in the Middle                      East with stores in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon,                      Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
The company was founded in 1971 and also sells tea, pastries,                      ice creams, other food and beverages, and coffee accessories.                      The company also has an on-line store as well as selling directly                      to restaurants, businesses, airlines, and hotels.
The Delek Group, which was founded in 1951, has three major                      subsidiaries: Israel Fuel Corporation, Delek Real Estate,                      and Delek Investments & Properties, a holding company                      for activities in automotive distribution and retailing, oil                      and gas exploration, biochemical manufacturing, convenience                      stores, and other retail operations. Delek is traded on the                      Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at a value of NIS 2.8b.

Two "Standard replies" activists are receiving                      from Starbucks when they complaint about the recent speech                      Howard Schultz made:
First:
Thank you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company.
Howard Schultz recently spoke at his local synagogue and                        shared his concern over the rise of anti-Semitism, which                        is linked to the growing crisis in the Middle East. Howard's                        position is pro-peace and for two nations to co-exist peacefully.                        His comments were not intended to be anti-Palestinian in                        any way. As part of his comments, Howard addressed the rising                        concern over terrorist acts overseas, specifically relating                        to the bombing of a synagogue in France. Howard does not                        believe the terrorism is representative of the Palestinian                        people. Howard was speaking as a private citizen and did                        not interview with the media regarding this subject, however                        several local media outlets did run portions of his speech.
Thank you again for contacting Starbucks. If you have any                        further questions or concerns, please contact us at info@starbucks.com                        or call (800) 23-LATTE to speak with a customer relations                        representative.
