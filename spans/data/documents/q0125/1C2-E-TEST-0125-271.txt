 
WELCOME TO NOOK!
Located at the corner of Hyde Street and Jackson on Russian Hill, Nook is a charming Cafe & Wine Bar, a place you will soon call your home away from home.
It's the perfect spot to relax with a cup of coffee, meet some friends for lunch, or enjoy a good glass of wine or a sake/soju cocktail in the evening while watching the cable car run by.
With its many windows Nook is a friendly, sunny cafe during the day, turning into a cozy candlelit wine bar in the evenings.
The menu concentrates on items that are healthy (low fat, bran, natural ingredients, organic, vegan...), flavorful and imaginative. All the ingredients are fresh and your food will be made to order.
Nook is looking forward to making your visit memorable!
