"Very busy hotel, but great location"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The hotel was very nice, a great location and the staff was very friendly. This is a very busy hotel however, and you should allow more time than usual for check in. Also, make sure you get everything out of your car because like everyother hotel in San Fran, once you valet it is hard to get back to your car until check out. I would stay here again […] .

The Hilton is very nice once you get inside. The surrounding neighborhood is super sketch. Beware of parking. The hotel parking is exorbitant and cheaper parking is easily located just across the street.

When we checked, in our room was in a tower which had construction on the floor above. They had us move 2 nights after and moved us to a different tower. It was such a inconvenience! We had 2 rooms with kids, so that wasted half a day! They should have had us in the tower with no construction in the first place. Our new rooms were bigger and nice and […] quiet! Read more

Hilton is always reliable and this location does not disappoint. A few picky items: the hotel only facilitates the shipping of items through FedEX and not US Postal Service. Would not hesitate to stay again.

"Structural noise"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
With high winds up on floor 25 I could not sleep due to the loud sounds coming from the enclosed beams which sounded like rivets popping. I could feel with my hands the movement in the wall. This started at 2;30 a.m. I know weather is not Hilton's fault so stay on a lower floor in bad weather or make another hotel choice. I know it is part of earthquake […] design but I will choose another place for my next visit. Also parking is too$$$ use lot across the street for half price. Read more

For the money paid, I think the hotel provided OK experience. The shower faucet came off the morning we were checking out. It didn't take an hour to wait for the repair man to come and fix but my shower was delayed anyway. Two days ago the shower had no hot water when I turned it on but when the repair man came he said there was hot water. The breakfast […] was good but pricy. However, the room is clean and inviting and the bed is comfortable. Read more

Although the room was expensive (but not for that locale), it was small, and there was a lot of street noise - however it was St Patrick's weekend. It was a great location- we didn't need a car. So close to BART and trolley rides. Great hotel lobby. Many affordable eating options within a few blocks. I didn't eat at the hotel except for the Starbucks […] which closes early afternoon.  I would stay there again! Great concierge and front desk attention to detail. Read more

Horrible customer service! I had to wait in line for 20 minutes just to check in. When entering the room it looked nothing like the photos posted on hotel.com. Room was out dated and small! The front desk did nothing to help in this situation all they could say was that they did not post the photos and it must be taken from a good angle. We had four […] in our party and they would o ly give us two breakfast vouchers!!! Plus they didn't have a restaurant just take away breakfast from Starbucks.

"reasonable rate but outdated property"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The room was cramped, the bathroom was beyond small and nothing had been updated. Went with my BF for the weekend before Vday and it served the purpose for a place to crash but it was a disappointment compared to the SF hotel industry. The hotel was closed & had been for 6 months (?) for construction though we could have used the facilities at Hotel […] Niko had we wanted to go downstairs from our 19th floor room, outside and then up how many floors to the spa. We didn't eat at the lobby restaurant as it was a bit pricey with a very limited menu but the bar/lounge was fairly busy and looked enjoyable on Saturday night. Overall the property was clean so when they get around to remodeling it, it may compare to others in the area but the size of the rooms & bathrooms may always be tight, to say the least. The front desk staff were very pleasant and accommodating and the location was good for being near Union Square. Read more

I was very disappointed in this Hilton Hotel, it wasn't up to the standards of other Hiltons I have stayed in. The location was not what I expected, I asked for a Hilton close to Fishermans Wharf and this Hilton was located downtown so we needed to drive everywhere we wanted to go. The view was nice from our room of the city, however it wasn't worth […] the money we paid nightly and I was disappointed I was informed until we arrived that parking was over $50.00 per night.
