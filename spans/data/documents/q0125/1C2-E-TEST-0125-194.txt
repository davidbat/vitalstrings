"nice hote, poor customer service"
Reviewed by O A of Sacramento
The hotel is nice but overpriced for what it offers. THERE IS A $16 per day FEE FOR WI-FI. Hotel staff and security are very unwelcoming and unfriendly on both shifts.

Run down in some of the hotel furnishings. Overall very nice and clean and friendly. I was expecting nicer room furniture and higher-end experience. But average.

"Nice deal, but..."
Reviewed by Ken A. of Modesto, CA
Enjoyable stay, but do they really need to charge $20 extra just to use the pool? I have a 12 year old son, who really wanted to use the indoor pool so I paid the $20. The "deal" I had wasn't much of a deal after that.

"Convenient Amenities"
Reviewed by Tania G of SF Peninsula
We came into town (from a peninsula small city) to see Jack Jones' performance. The room was just OK. We WERE offered an upgrade if we bought a hotel breakfast the next morning. We already made other plans, so had to decline the offer. I'm really sorry we did. All in all, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff was great. The Anza Room for dinner was […] hospitable and extremely accomadating. Jack Jones Rrazz Room show, and the small jazz club, was very nice. Thanks for a nice stay. Read more

"Winter Vacation"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
We have stayed at the Nikko several times. The staff are excellent and the location near union square is also very nice. The breakfast buffet which includes both full Japanese and American choices is very good and was included with the price from hotel.com. This is one of the few hotels in town with a nice pool which is great for children.  One point […] was the room was adequately cleaned when we first entered it. we called housekeeping and they came back. Other than this we have always enjoyed our stay here and will probably return again. Read more

"Oasis in the Heart of San Francisco"
Reviewed by Donna H of Pleasanton, CA
Spent my birthday at Hotel Nikko in San Francisco and couldn't have been more pleased. Its location, near Union Square in SF, allowed us to walk to shopping and dining. Although it is located on bustling Mason St., once through the doors I experienced a calm, zen-like feeling. Staff was quietly polite and efficient, and we enjoyed dining at Anzo, right […] within the same building. Rates were very reasonable and I would recommend to family and friends. Read more

Been to the Nikko before for dinner. It was a really nice stay once we got a better room. First room was real nice but small for what I was expecting. They moved us the second night and it was great for the next few days. Clean. Great view. Super comfy.

"Not a four star hotel"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
This is an average hotel. The rooms are so so, and the staff isn't overly helpful. I have stayed here twice out of convenience, and found it lacking both times. I wouldn't recommend it, especially with a couple of four star hotels within a block of Nikko.

"Can't beat the location"
Reviewed by Tony D. of Chicago
Overall a great hotel and bargain. The location is within walking distance to tons of things and there are trains and trolleys close by to things that aren't. There is a bustling Starbucks next to the hotel. The lobby area and elevator area is a bit tired for a 4-star and could use freshening. The room was clean and updated, though a bit vanilla. Access […] to the fitness center is an extra $10. Read more

"Hotel Nikko San Francisco - Great place to stay"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
Very nice, modern hotel 2 blocks from Union Square. Our 'superior' room was nicely decorated, though somewhat small - large enough for the king size bed, chair, desk+chair, but no room to get past the bed if someone was in the chair at the desk. Only complaint was the price to park at $51.30/day and high daily internet charge.

The location of this hotel is great. We were able to go shopping and have dinner just by walking a few blocks. The Conceirge was very helpful in getting reservations for dinner at popular restaurants. Also because there is a club where we can enjoy entertainment on the first floor, it was so wonderful! Plus the health club was great.
