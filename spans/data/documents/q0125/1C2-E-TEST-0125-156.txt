Les Macarons de La Boulange? They may start showing up at Starbucks next year...
Well, for all those folks in the Sunset who were wary of the ever more chain-like La Boulange invading their neighborhood , there's a new reason for protest: La Boulange is now owned by Starbucks. The announcement arrives today via press release that La Boulange owner Pascal Rigo sold the business and the brand to Starbucks for $100 million. In the next year or so, La Boulange-branded products will start appearing at Starbucks stores nationwide, and all La Boulange employees will now be getting their paychecks from the coffee behemoth. But Rigo insists that the 20 Bay Area locations of La Boulange won't be becoming Starbucks anytime soon. "We’d be stupid to change anything," he tells the Scoop, though they will likely start selling Starbucks coffee. [ Business Times , Scoop ]
