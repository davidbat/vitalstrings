Starbucks San
Is Starbucks the only coffee shop in the world?
Does anyone dare venture outside of the Starbucks’ burnt beans and uninformed preperations of coffee staples (like macchiato that is a cappucino, latte that is..still a cappucino, or espresso with no crema and about 6 ounces overflowed)?
(cos it kind of doesn’t seem like it)
where do you go?
deidriches was good, they made great macchiato.
i loved the living room and cafe bassam
(all down in san diego)
at portland coffee house just down from the galleria i had a perfectly prepaired espresso
(here in portland)
I know starbucks isn’t the only coffee shop in the world, some people are just reading the question and not the details.
i’m just saying they’re popular but don’t know much about quality coffee and people are getting the wrong idea about how coffee should be prepared and taste.
so what are your suggestions for quality over qauntity?
Definitely Starbucks isnt the only coffee shop in the world. (:
I remembered that I visited quite a number of coffee shops. But I cant recall the names. Sorry. I will email you the details after I had remembered. (x
