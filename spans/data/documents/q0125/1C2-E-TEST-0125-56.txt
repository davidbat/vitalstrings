No. There are no Starbucks inside SFO at all. Probably one of the few places in America without them. With the exception of a single Burger King and Subway inside Terminal 3 (United and American domestic flights), most of the concessions at SFO are branches of San Francisco eateries.
The airport authority has contracted with locally owned businesses like Peet's Coffee and Tea. The menu is basically the same as Starbucks though. So, just order your usual Starbucks drink. Chances are they'll have it.
Southwest departs from Terminal 1 (where there are two Peet's coffee shops).
