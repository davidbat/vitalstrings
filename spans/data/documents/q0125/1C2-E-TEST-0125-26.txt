SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Starbucks (US:sbux) on Monday said it would acquire San Francisco-based bakery chain La Boulange for $100 million in cash. Starbucks said it plans to serve La Boulange's pastries, breads and sandwiches under the La Boulange name in its U.S. stores. Privately-held La Boulange, started in 1999 by French baker Pascal Rigo, operates 19 shops in the Bay Area, with much of that expansion over the last several years. Starbucks has been seeking to improve its food menu in a bid to drive more afternoon traffic. "This is an investment in our core business. After more than 40 years, we will be able to say that we are bakers too," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement. Starbucks shares closed Monday at $53.90, up 3%.
