It is a sad day when I resort to ordering a pre-made Teriyaki White Chicken $5.95 Salad at Starbucks.
Sounds okay right? Well, I don't care for iceberg lettuce for starters, but the dressing sounds good and there is chicken for substance. But when you discover the chicken is under cooked, you toss it! I took out all the chicken and ate the lettuce. This working lady who doesn't have time to get a better meal has to eat lettuce for lunch!!! MOOD, PISSED.
Alright so my other complaint about this location are the people that work there. The turn over rate seems high, but since I work near by I'm in 3 to 4 days a week. I rarely get a smile from the ones taking my order and every time I order 10 gift cards for $10 each (for employees) spending $100 + my order. They sigh, as if I am making them work too hard! What?!?! I should be the freaken customer of the month every month for the passed 9 months. Holy bagizus!
I wont complain about my raspberry mocha, they did introduce me to my favorite drink.
But still... When am I going to be the freaken customer of the month?
