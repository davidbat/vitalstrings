SEATTLE & MEMPHIS, Tenn., November 30, 2010 -         Earlier this month, Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and        International Paper (NYSE: IP), with Mississippi River Pulp, LLC.,        completed a six-week pilot project that – for the first time – proved        Starbucks used paper cups can be recycled into new paper cups. This        advancement brings Starbucks one step closer to its goal of ensuring 100        percent of its cups are reusable or recyclable by 2015.
“This innovation represents an important milestone in our journey,” said        Jim Hanna, Starbucks director of Environmental Impact. “We still have a        lot of work to do to reach our 2015 goal, but we’re now in a much        stronger position to build momentum across the recycling industry. Our        next step is to test this concept in a major city, which we plan to do        in collaboration with International Paper and Mississippi River in 2011.”
While some communities already recycle Starbucks paper cups, most do not        have the infrastructure in place to handle collection, hauling, and        processing due to a lack of demand for cup material by the recycling        industry. To date, Mississippi River is the only pulp mill in the U.S.        that has successfully recycled used cups into fiber suitable for        producing new cups.
“What’s really exciting about the cup-to-cup concept is that it has the        potential to benefit not only Starbucks, but the entire foodservice        industry,” said Greg Wanta, vice president of International Paper        Foodservice, the largest manufacturer of Starbucks paper cups. “If we        can continue to prove the value of used cup material generated by        Starbucks and other retailers, we can help increase recycling rates in        communities across the country.”
“We’re looking forward to working with Starbucks, International Paper,        and other stakeholders to take the pilot project to the next level,” said Rob Garland, chief executive officer at Mississippi River. “Based        on what we’ve seen so far, we think this is a very promising path.”
The cup-to-cup pilot was conceived earlier this year at Starbucks second        cup summit, which was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.        The two-day symposium convened government officials, raw material        suppliers, cup manufacturers, retail and beverage businesses, recyclers,        conservation groups, and academic experts to develop a plan for        improving local recycling systems. As an important stakeholder in        Starbucks supply chain, International Paper helped drive the summit        dialogue. The company has since played a leading role in making the        cup-to-cup concept a reality.
Starbucks launched the industry’s first paper cup containing        post-consumer recycled fiber (PCF) in 2006, following several years of        collaboration with Mississippi River. Over time, Starbucks switch to        cups made from 10 percent PCF has diverted nearly 200 million pounds of        paper from the landfill. While the company’s standard paper cups contain        PCF made from office paper, the PCF used for the pilot project        incorporates cup material.
Starbucks currently has another recycling pilot project underway in New        York. The company is collecting paper cups at 86 of its Manhattan stores        to determine whether they can be recycled into bath tissue and paper        towels. In early 2011, Starbucks plans to launch a new recycling pilot        in Chicago, aiming to transform the company’s discarded paper cups into        napkins for use in its stores. Over the past year, Starbucks has        introduced front-of-store cup collection in Toronto and Seattle, where        its cups can be recycled, and in San Francisco, where its cups can be        composted.
