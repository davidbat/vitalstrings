Description
SustainAbility has worked with Starbucks since 2004, when we facilitated a Starbucks-NGO dialogue in Seattle on the company’s first-generation C.A.F.E. Practices coffee sourcing guidelines, which were just about to be made public.  Soon afterwards, we undertook a comprehensive review of Starbucks’ sustainability strategy and governance, evaluating and making recommendations as to how Starbucks might improve efforts including sourcing practices for goods other than coffee, its approach to philanthropy, transparency, reporting and assurance, and leadership at executive and board levels.
Over the last few years, SustainAbility has advised on the company’s efforts to integrate sustainability messages at the consumer level, including the Starbucks Shared Planet campaign.  SustainAbility also has worked with Starbucks, Conservation International, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, Fairtrade Foundation UK and TransFair USA as the organizations examine opportunities to improve and harmonize ethical sourcing efforts generally and the Starbucks commitment to Fairtrade coffee purchase, marketing and sale specifically.
Starbucks has been a long-time member of SustainAbility’s Engaging Stakeholders program, as a result of which SustainAbility has assessed Starbucks sustainability reporting over multiple years as well as supporting development and implementation of the company’s approaches to materiality and assurance.  Starbucks also hosted the US launch of SustainAbility’s 2004 Global Reporters report Trust Us in Seattle.
