I think the new logo for 2011 looks cheap. Are their marketing people stupid? Cheap logo=cheap coffee… I have a feeling they will feel a hit on their sales after this. I know the point they are trying to get across… but it will always be “Startbucks Coffee”… no matter if they stick to just coffee and bakery stuff or move onto other things. Don’t fix it if it’s not broken.

I hate it. I’d stick with the original. Taking away the the word coffee is  a big no no, but taking away the name Starbucks from the emblem is like taking away the Nike swoosh. A disaster waiting to happen. Don’t do it please, it’s not to late to change your mind. People want a mark they can trust and it take decades to build that, I don’t trust this new mark. It’s to big of a change. If your going into other business ventures just take away the word coffee for things that are not coffee, if you must. This new emblem is not Starbucks, it is something else entirely, what I do not know yet, but it will never be Starbucks. Somebody please get a new marketing contractor, because this is not working. From a marketing and design stand point it does not appeal to me and from a customer standpoint it is not cool anymore, either way I see it as huge unnecessary risk.

They want to take the words from it because they want to make it international. In Chinese the name sounds a bit like “sheengbakeh”. I also dislike the logo and think it looks cheap, but I think that point people have missed.
Also wrt “It’s not cool anymore”… when in the hell was Starbucks ever cool? My mother goes to Starbucks.
