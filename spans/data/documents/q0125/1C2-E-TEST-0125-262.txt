The 15 Best Dunkin Donuts in America
So what might explain these results? Perhaps American coffee drinkers appreciate Dunkin' Donuts’ simple, no-frills, blue-collar soul . Starbucks bills itself as a fancy, high-end specialty retailer with complex, Italian-inspired coffee drinks — care for a venti decaf light caramel macchiato with whip, anyone? As such, Starbucks may attract a clientele that is willing to get charged more for what they perceive as a gourmet experience. 
Starbucks invites customers to hang out with its cozy café atmosphere and tables where they can work or socialize. Given that Starbucks now offers free wifi , their locations attract customers who may stay for hours, perhaps racking up more of a bill over time. Dunkin' Donuts, on the other hand, is more of a fast-food experience, aimed at customers on the go. Besides, Dunkin’ Donuts’ fluorescent lighting hardly asks you to linger .
The vilification of high-carb diets among weight-conscious customers probably doesn’t help Dunkin’ Donuts, either — witness the financial troubles that Krispy Kreme experienced for years once its fad appeal wore off . Dunkin Donuts has changed its menu in recent years to " meet the evolving needs of customers ," but it can't avoid the fact that "donut" is part of its name.
Perhaps Bundle found that Dunkin' Donuts is most popular in Louisiana because a few extra calories don't count as much on top of already-rich Creole cuisine , or because Louisianans very much like beignets or their kin with their coffee.
