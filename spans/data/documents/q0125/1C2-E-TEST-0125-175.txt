Visit any California city and it doesn’t take much of a search to find a Starbucks. The joke is there is a Starbucks coffee shop on every corner. The funny thing is, that’s not much of an exaggeration.
Many coffee drinkers seek out a Starbucks each morning and purchase a hot caffeine-laced beverage to get their day going.
Understanding the love people have for this popular coffee shop, Squaw Valley ski resort in Lake Tahoe took things to the next level – creating what Squaw is calling the world’s first ski-in/ski-out Starbucks on its upper mountain.
Last week Squaw officially opened the Starbucks at 8,000-feet elevation. The mountaintop Starbucks boasts some great views and the unique ability for guests to keep their skis or board on while they order their Starbucks beverage to go.
“We worked closely with the design team at Starbucks to create a one-of-a-kind experience that we know our guests will truly enjoy,” said Andy Wirth, Squaw Valley’s president and CEO. “Nowhere else in the world can skiers and riders enjoy a delicious Starbucks coffee without missing a beat on the slopes.”

Squaw Valley’s mountaintop Starbucks is located at the Gold Coast mid-mountain complex and can be accessed by the resort’s Funitel with or without ski or snowboard equipment. This Starbucks is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. throughout the winter season, weather permitting.
