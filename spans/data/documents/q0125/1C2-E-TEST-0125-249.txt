 
 
Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class is a twenty-six posture series done in a heated room, designed to scientifically warm and stretch muscles, ligaments and tendons, in the order in which they should be stretched. 
 
Bikram’s Hot Yoga systematically moves fresh, oxygenated blood to one hundred percent of your body, to each organ and fiber, restoring all systems to healthy working order, just as nature intended. Proper weight, muscle tone, vibrant good health, and a sense of well-being will automatically follow.

How many calories does one yoga class burn?
Health professionals’ have estimated between 400-1400 calories are burned per class.
 
How long will it take before I see results?
It does not take long to see the results of yoga. Depending on the frequency of classes, results occur in as little as 2 weeks (recommended at least 3 classes per week).
 
What should I expect for my first class?
Usually the first couple classes are the most challenging because toxins in the body are rapidly released and your body hasn’t acclimated to the heat. You will soon discover the heat is a powerful tool to help open and detoxify the body unlike anything else. Come with no expectations, just a light heart, open mind, and a well-hydrated body. Most students feel amazingly detoxified and relaxed after their first class.
