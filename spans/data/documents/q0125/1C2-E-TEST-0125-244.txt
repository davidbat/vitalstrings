Parklets, temporary public spaces built over parking spots, are about to explode throughout The City.
Despite the controversy that erupted over the application of Valencia Street’s Ritual Coffee, along with small businesses Farm:Table and Arizmendi Bakery , the Department of Public Works has given approval for those businesses to proceed.
And at least eight businesses that received no objections are working on their own parklets. DPW spokeswoman Gloria Chan breaks down where those new public spaces will be sprouting:
“To date, DPW has issued eight permits out of the 27 and is in the process of permitting the remainder over the next couple of weeks.
The approved parklets:
375 Valencia (Four Barrel Coffee)
1755 Polk (The Crepe House)
1132 Valencia (The Crepe House 3)
914 Valencia (Freewheel Bike Shop)- Installed
4033 Judah (Trouble Coffee)
3600 16th Street (Squat & Gobble)- Installed
937 Valencia (a private property owner)
 
Parklets that are currently in various processing stages:
2410 California (Pizzeria Delfina)
1315 18th Street (Farley’s)
3318-20 22nd Street (Fabric8)
78 29th Street (Café Seventy 8)
201 Octavia (Mercury Café)
1570 Stockton (Tony’s Pizza Napoletana)
1234 Polk Street (Quetzal Café)
384 Hayes Street (Arlequin)
982 Post St. (Bamboo Bike Studio)
Of the 27, approximately seven parklets are on hold at the request of the applicants. In addition, there are five parklets on the ground that were installed as part of the city’s pilot effort.”
