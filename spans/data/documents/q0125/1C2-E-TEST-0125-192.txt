SEATTLE, August 16, 2010 -         Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced the launch of Starbucks        Reserve™, a line of ultra-premium, single-origin coffees available in        select U.S. stores this fall. Chosen by Starbucks coffee buyers for        their unique flavors and rarity, Starbucks Reserve™ coffees will be        offered in limited quantities and while supplies last in select stores        within metropolitan markets including New York City, San Francisco Bay        Area, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Boston, Seattle, Portland, Ore.,        Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Miami.
The first offering, Galápagos San Cristóbal, originated on San        Cristóbal, one of the oldest geological locations within the Galápagos        Islands. The subtropical region’s intense microclimate, rich volcanic        soil and equatorial sun create ideal conditions for extraordinary        coffee. Influenced by these environmental characteristics, Galápagos San        Cristóbal is a medium-bodied coffee that features fresh flavors and        highlights of green herbs balanced by soft cocoa and spice.
“For nearly 40 years, our coffee buyers have traveled the world        discovering the most exquisite tastes to appear in a coffee cup,” said        Dub Hay, senior vice president of coffee and global procurement,        Starbucks Coffee Company. “Only three percent of all the coffee grown        around the world is good enough to make it into a bag of Starbucks® Coffee. Sometimes we encounter a truly rare and special coffee and we        can only purchase a small quantity. Starbucks Reserve™ represents our        heritage as a purveyor of the world’s finest coffees, and we’re thrilled        to offer our customers passage on this journey of discovery.”
Galápagos San Cristóbal, and all other Starbucks Reserve™ coffees, will        be available for sale as whole bean half-pound packages, and in select        markets they will be available brewed by the cup through either the        Clover® brewing machine or Pour Over Brewing method. Clover® brewing        machines are currently featured in more than 60 stores in the U.S., and        Starbucks will continue expanding the presence of Clover® in additional        Starbucks stores through the end of the year. Both the Clover® brewing        machine and Pour Over Brewing method are ideal methods to showcase        flavor and highlight subtle nuances of Starbucks Reserve™ coffees.
Beginning August 31, Galápagos San Cristóbal will be available for sale        as whole bean or hand-crafted by the cup in select markets, while        supplies last. The suggested retail price for a half-pound of whole bean        starts at $12.50 and a tall (12 fl. oz.) cup of Galápagos San Cristóbal        brewed by the cup coffee starts at $2.95.
For customers looking to secure the first Starbucks Reserve™ coffee        before the August 31 store debut, Galápagos San Cristóbal will be        available for purchase on www.starbucksstore.com starting August 17. And beginning August 21, participating stores will        reserve half-pound bags of whole bean coffee to be picked up on August        31.
As a special preview to My Starbucks Rewards Gold level customers, an        exclusive preview sale of Galápagos San Cristóbal was hosted on Gilt        Groupe on August 3. The coffee sold out in less than 12 hours as        Starbucks most loyal customers recognized the distinctiveness of this        coffee.
“Curating a private sale featuring Galápagos San Cristóbal was a special        opportunity to work with Starbucks to showcase this rare coffee and help        them recognize loyal My Starbucks Rewards Gold level members,” said        Stefan Pepe, general manager, Gilt Home. “The fact that this coffee sold        out in less than a day shows that the most discerning of Starbucks        customers recognized the rarity and special attributes of the coffee and        appreciated the exclusiveness of the Gilt.com sale.”
Additionally, Starbucks invites customers to participate in a special        preview tasting of the unique coffee on August 28 at participating        Starbucks Reserve™ stores. Customers can visit their local store for        times of each tasting event.
While Galápagos San Cristóbal is the first offering within the Starbucks        Reserve™ line, beginning in October up to four exclusive Starbucks        Reserve™ coffees will be available for a limited time in Starbucks        stores. The first coffees available for a limited time will include Aged        Sulawesi Kalosi, El Salvador Montecarlos Estate Pacamara, Nicaragua        Corcasan Fair Trade Certified and Brazil Sul de Minas Peaberry.
