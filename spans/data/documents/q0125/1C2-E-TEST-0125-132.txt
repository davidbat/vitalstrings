Starbucks to Buy La Boulange Bakery

Some San Francisco pastry-lovers are lamenting the news that Seattle coffee giant Starbucks is buying Bay Area bakery La Boulange for $100 million in cash. Starbucks wants to make it a nationwide franchise and sell the French pastries in its own coffee shops. 
 
Restaurant industry analyst Andy Barish, with the market research firm Jefferies, says the deal gives Starbucks new ways to improve its offerings.
 
"You can imagine there will be some baking going on in stores over time,” says Barish, “you know, the freshness, the smells.”
 
Barish also said that Starbucks has successfully reproduced a version of your local Italian espresso bar, and now wants to continue the transformation, moving towards being your neighborhood French bakery-café.
 
La Boulange is based in San Francisco and has nineteen Bay Area locations. The Starbucks deal is expected to close by the end of September.
