As we advance in life, we acquire a keener sense of the value of  time. Nothing else, indeed, seems of any consequence; and we become  misers in this respect.  - William Hazlitt, The Feeling of Immortality in Youth
To the extent that you entertain lies and deceit, you are held  prisoner in a world cut off from reality. The truth you hide from  yourself, prevents you from growth and fulfillment. The truth you  hide from others, keeps you distantly apart. The truth shines a  bright light on life, so you can clearly see the way to go.  Success, achievement, happiness, joy, fellowship, and fulfillment,  thrive in the warm and nurturing light of the truth. Honesty is the  most direct path to wherever you want to go. Truth and honesty are  often difficult, yet never more difficult, in the end, than deceit.  To think otherwise, is to deceive even yourself. Hiding in the  shadows of falsehood, makes it impossible to move forward. That  the truth is moral and ethical, is no secret. Yet truth is also  practical, efficient, and effective in every worthy pursuit,  something well known by those who enjoy lasting success. Live  in the bright, empowering light. Embrace the truth. It always serves you best.  - Ralph Marston

I was told a long time ago that dreams are the building blocks  of life. Now I look around myself, at the tragedies that have  befallen this beautiful nation and am amazed at how our entire  nation stands together, and with one voice says, "What have you  accomplished? We're still here. Our dreams are real. You cannot, and  will not win." I am amazed further still at the world's response  to this message. We watch as history unfolds before us, we watch the  heros that are working day and night, trying to recover those lost.  I love my country, my freedom, and I will fight for it.  - Heather Cowley

Life isn't supposed to be an all or nothing battle between  misery and bliss. Life isn't supposed to be a battle at all.
