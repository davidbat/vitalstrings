 "I had the good fortune to meet and talk one evening with               Churchill's only son, Randolph, who died in 1968. He told me about               his father's serious and prolonged depressions. He also told me               that his father had periods of high energy when he was forceful,               driving, tireless, and in need of very little sleep. At those               times, Winston seemed to be able to achieve whatever he wished, to               conquer any impossible situation, to succeed brilliantly as a               writer, politician, warrior, or prime minister. From the family               pedigree I would conclude that this was indeed a family in which               moodswing prevailed and had been passed down from generation to               generation. All his life he fought against severe spells of               melancholy - his episodes of "Black Dog" or deep               depression."
Dr. Ronald R. Fieve in his book entitled "Moodswing"
Churchill lived a long life and one probably richer in experience               than most in the course of human history. His biography runs to               some eight volumes. It is well known that he suffered throughout               his life from what is now known as bipolar mood disorder - what               used to be called manic-depressive disorder. This really makes his               accomplishments both more astounding and at the same time easier               to understand. Churchill will probably be remembered most fondly               for his iron will and tenacity, and his fearless courage in the               most difficult of circumstances. He had the ability to inspire a               nation. 
Documents             of Inspiration - Churchill's Life and Times
Childhood
Winston             Leonard Spencer Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace on St Andrew's             Day, 30 November 1874. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a             younger son of the Duke of Marlborough. His mother, Jennie Jerome,             was the daughter of an American business tycoon.
Winston's             childhood was privileged but not particularly happy. Like many             Victorian parents, Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill were distant             figures. Letters from his schooldays reveal a willful and somewhat             rebellious little boy.
Adventures               of Youth
In 1895               Churchill graduated from Sandhurst. He travelled to the United               States and Cuba, saw action on the north west frontier of India in               1897, and the following year joined Kitchener's expeditionary               force to the Sudan and participated in the cavalry charge against               the Dervishes at the battle of Omdurman.
His               adventures continued in 1899 when he sailed to South Africa as a               correspondent of the Morning Post to cover the Boer War. He was               captured and spent his twenty-fifth birthday as a prisoner of war,               before escaping and making his way across the enemy lines to               Durban.
Early               Steps in Politics
Churchill               was first elected to parliament in 1900, shortly before the death               of Queen Victoria. He took his seat in the House of Commons as a               Conservative member for Oldham. After four years he crossed the               floor and joined the Liberals, rising swiftly through their ranks.               As President of the Board of Trade he helped to lay the               foundations of the welfare state, while his brief tenure as Home               Secretary is still remembered for the Tonypandy Riot and the siege               of Sidney Street.
A Lasting Love
In 1908           Churchill married Clementine Hozier, granddaughter of the 10th Earl of           Airlie. They had five children, four of whom survived into adulthood.           The marriage was to prove a long and happy one, though there were           quarrels. Their personal correspondence sheds much light on the           private people behind the public myth. From the first years of their           marriage Winston and Clementine routinely ended their letters with           drawings. He was her 'pug' or 'pig'. She was his 'cat'.
First               World War Days
By               the time war broke out in 1914 Churchill was First Lord of the               Admiralty and already a major national figure. As the conflict in               Europe degenerated into a stalemate he became convinced that the               only way to end the war quickly was to mount a huge out-flanking               attack on Turkey through the Dardanelles. But his               attempts to force the straits using only ships foundered, leading               to the disastrous Gallipolli landings and costing Churchill his               job.
Rather               than remain idle, Churchill sought active service on the Western               Front. In January 1916 he was appointed as Lieutenant-Colonel               commanding the 6th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers.
Ups               and Downs
Churchill               successfully contested Dundee for the first time in May 1908. His               ministerial responsibilities kept him away from his constituency.               There were also clear differences in lifestyle and background               between Churchill and most of his constituents. By the time of the               1922 election, support for the Labour party had grown and the               local newspapers were hostile to Churchill.
Worse               still, appendicitis kept him from active campaigning. Clementine               spoke in her husband's place, but was spat upon for wearing               pearls. When the result was declared, Churchill was left, as he               wryly observed, without a seat, without a party and without an               appendix.
Between 1922               and 1924 Churchill left the Liberal party and rejoined the               Conservatives. Anyone could 'rat', he remarked, but it took a               certain ingenuity to 're-rat'. To his surprise he was appointed               Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's government - a               position he held until the Tory defeat in 1929.
During the               1930s Churchill fell out with Baldwin over the question of giving               India greater self-government and became more and more isolated in               politics. His dire warnings about the rise of Hitler and the               dangers of the appeasement policy initially fell on deaf ears.
War Breaks Out
When war               came in 1939, Churchill was inevitably recalled, as first lord of               the admiralty. The signal went round the fleet, "Winston is               back," a quarter of a century after his first going to the               post. But the first wave of German military power overwhelmed               Poland in September, and in the spring of 1940 the tidal wave               overwhelmed northwestern Europe, followed shortly afterward by the               fall of France.
On May 10,               1940, in the midst of this cataract of disasters, Churchill was               called to supreme power and responsibility by a spontaneous revolt               of the best elements in all parties. He, almost alone of the               nation's political leaders, had had no part in the disaster of the               1930's, and he really was chosen by the will of the nation. For               the next five years, perhaps the most heroic period in Britain's               history, he held supreme command, as prime minister and minister               of defense, in the nation's war effort. At this point his life and               career became one with Britain's story and its survival.
His immediate               contribution was to instill in the British people his own fiery               resolve and will to resist. Throughout the tense summer of 1940,               when Britain stood alone, his speeches proved an inspiration.
Yet               Churchill did more than just talk. He toured the country               inspecting the bomb-damaged towns and cities. He also worked               tirelessly on diplomatic and military initiatives to regain the               offensive. It was from Scapa Flow that he sailed in August 1941               for a crucial secret meeting with President Roosevelt.
As the threat               of German invasion receded, the tide of war began to turn.               Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union brought Churchill an               unlikely ally in the person of Joseph Stalin. The Japanese bombing               of Pearl Harbour transformed the war into a truly global conflict.               It also precipitated the United States into the war, and with the               Americans came the promise of an ultimate Allied victory. By               October 1942 Churchill clearly felt confident enough to accept the               Freedom of the City of Edinburgh.
Churchill               worked tirelessly to keep the Grand Alliance alive, shuttling               between capital cities and conferences. It is often forgotten that               he celebrated his 70th birthday during the war. While he tried               hard to project a fit and active public image, the strain               inevitably took a toll on his health.
The               Final Years
Churchill               did not allow his shock defeat in the 1945 General Election to               silence him for very long. He remained a hugely important               international figure, and used his status to speak out about the               new threats posed by the Cold War and the need for reconciliation               in Western Europe. In October 1951 the Conservative Party achieved               a narrow victory at the polls and Churchill became Prime Minister
once again. Failing health forced him to resign the premiership in               April 1955, but he remained an MP until 1964.
Churchill               passed away on 24 January 1965. He received the first state               funeral given to a commoner since that of the Duke of Wellington.
I am ready to               meet my Maker, whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of               meeting me is another matter...     Churchill
