100% right Germany and Hitler couldn't even hurt a fly.Hitler was a devoted Hari Krishna all he wanted to do is walk around in the Polish Wilderness in hisï»¿ robe and sandals.grow Broccoli and Butter Nut Squash,make home made Tofu and go Bird watching every morning.The fucking Brits turned around accused Germany attacking Poland and started War.Even then Hitler asked Churchill to come and meet and try his home made Broccoli & Herbs soup,but Churchill refused and attacked from behind Cheers!!!
