Travel to make a difference... this could be your chance of a lifetime.
We award Travelling Fellowships to British citizens from all walks of life to travel overseas, to bring back knowledge and best practice for the benefit of others in their UK professions and communities. 
Fellows receive a travel grant to cover return and internal travelling, daily living and insurance within the countries visited. For 2012 Fellowships are for between 4 to 8 weeks.
See what a Fellowship can achieve by looking Fellows' Stories , and what our current Fellows are doing on  Fellows' Travels .
Could a Fellowship bring real benefits to you, your community and the UK? 
If so check our categories and your  eligibility , and then  apply online before 2nd October 2012. No qualifications are required.
