Speeches that Changed the World
This afternoon, I watched Martin Luther King Jr.â€™s I Have a Dream speech again. (You can find the full speech text and video, along with an extensive Six Minutes speech analysis here .)
I was reminded of the tremendous power speeches can wield. One cannot watch Dr. King or read his words without stirring emotions, even though the speech was given over 47 years ago.
