English prime minister, statesman, and author
The English statesman and author Sir Winston Churchill led Britain during       World War II (1939–45) and is often described as the "savior       of his country." Sir Winston Churchill's exact place in the       political history of the twentieth century is, and will continue to be, a       subject of debate. But his strong personality and forceful determination       made him a popular figure during the war years.
Early life
Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born on November 30, 1874, at         Blenheim Palace—a home given by Queen Anne to Churchill's         ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough. He was the eldest son of Lord         Randolph Churchill, a Tory Democrat (a British political party) who         achieved early success as a rebel in his party. Later, after Randolph         Churchill failed, he was cruelly described as "a man with a         brilliant future behind him." His mother was Jenny Jerome, the         beautiful and talented daughter of Leonard Jerome, a New York         businessman. Winston idolized his mother, but his relations with his         father, who died in 1895, were cold and distant. It is generally agreed         that as a child Winston was not shown warmth and affection by his         family.
As a child Churchill was sensitive and suffered from a minor speech         impediment. He was educated following the norms of his class. He first         went to preparatory school, then to Harrow in 1888 when he was twelve         years old. Winston was not especially interested in studying Latin or         mathematics and spent much time studying in the lowest level courses         until he passed the tests and was able to advance. He received a good         education in English, however, and won a prize for reading aloud a         portion of Thomas Macaulay's (1800–1859) Lays of Ancient Rome (1842). After finishing at Harrow, Winston failed the entrance test for         the Royal Military College at Sandhurst three times before finally         passing and being allowed to attend the school. His academic record         improved a great deal once he began at the college. When he graduated in         1894 he was eighth in his class.
Military journalist
Very early on Churchill demonstrated the physical courage and love of         adventure and action that he kept throughout his political career. His         first role was that of a soldier-journalist. In 1895 he went to Cuba to         write about the Spanish army for the Daily Graphic. In 1896 he was in India, and while on the North-West Frontier with the         Malakand Field Force he began work on a novel, Savrola: A Tale of the Revolution in Laurania. The book was published in 1900.
More important, however, were Churchill's accounts of the         military campaigns           in which he participated. Savrola was followed by a book about the reconquest of the Sudan (1899), in         which he had also taken part. As a journalist for the Morning Post, he went to Africa during the Boer War (1899–1902), where British         forces fought against Dutch forces in South Africa. The most romantic of         his adventures as a youth was his escape from a South African prison         during this conflict.
Young politician
In 1899 Churchill lost in his first attempt at election to the House of         Commons, one of two bodies controlling Parliament in England. This was         to be the first of many defeats in elections, as Churchill lost more         elections than any other political figure in recent British history. But         in 1900 he entered the House of Commons, in which he served off and on         until 1964.
Churchill's early years in politics were characterized by an         interest in the radical reform (improvement) of social problems. The         major intellectual achievement of this period of Churchill's life         was his Liberalism and the Social Problem (1909). In this work he stated his belief in liberalism, or political         views that stress civil rights and the use of government to promote         social progress. Churchill was very active in the great reforming         government of Lord Asquith between 1908 and 1912, and his work fighting         unemployment was especially significant.
In 1912 Churchill became first lord of the Admiralty, the department of         British government that controls the naval fleet. He switched his         enthusiasm away from social reform to prepare Britain's fleet for         a war that threatened Europe. While at the Admiralty,

Churchill suffered a major setback. He became committed to the view         that the navy could best make an impact on the war in Europe         (1914–18) by way of a swift strike through the Dardanelles, a key         waterway in central Europe. This strategy proved unsuccessful, however,         and Churchill lost his Admiralty post. In 1916 he was back in the army,         serving for a time on the front lines in France.
Interwar years
Churchill soon reentered political life. He was kept out of the Lloyd         George War Cabinet by conservative hostility toward his style and         philosophy. But by 1921 Churchill held a post as a colonial secretary. A         clash with Turkish           president Kemal Atatürk, however, did not help his reputation, and         in 1922 he lost his seat in the House of Commons. The Conservative Party         gained power for the first time since 1905, and Churchill began a         long-term isolation, with few political allies.
In 1924 Churchill severed his ties with liberalism and became chancellor         of the Exchequer (British treasury) in Stanley Baldwin's         (1867–1947) government. Churchill raised controversy when he         decided to put Britain back on the gold standard, a system where         currency equals the value of a specified amount of gold. Although he         held office under Baldwin, Churchill did not agree with his position         either on defense or on imperialism, Britain's policy of ruling         over its colonies. In 1931 he resigned from the conservative "shadow cabinet" in protest against its Indian policy.
Churchill's years between world wars were characterized by         political isolation. During this period he made many errors and         misjudgments. Chief among these was his warlike approach to the general         strike of 1926. Thus, he cannot be viewed simply as a popular leader who         was kept waiting in the wings through no fault of his own.
World War II
The major period of Churchill's political career began when he         became prime minister and head of the Ministry of Defense early in World         War II, when British and American Allies fought against the Axis of         Germany, Italy, and Japan.
"I felt as if I was walking with destiny, and that all my past         life had been but a preparation for this hour," Churchill wrote         in the first volume of his account of the war. (This account was later         published in six volumes from 1948 to 1953.) His finest hour and that of         the British people came at the same time. His leadership, which was         expressed in noble speeches and constant personal activity, stated         precisely what Britain needed to survive through the years before the         United States entered the war.
The evacuation of Dunkirk and the air defense of the Battle of Britain         became legend, but there were and are controversies over         Churchill's policies. It has been argued that Churchill was too         sensitive to the Mediterranean as a theater of war, which led to         mistakes in Crete and North Africa. The value of his resistance to the         idea of a second front as the Germans advanced into Russia has also been         questioned. And there has been considerable debate over the courses he         pursued at international conferences, such as those at Yalta in February         1945.
Many believed some of Churchill's policies were responsible for         the "cold war" of the 1950s and 1960s, where relations         between Eastern Communist powers and Western powers came to a standstill         over, among other things, nuclear arms. Although criticisms may be made         of Churchill's policies, his importance as a symbol of resistance         and as an inspiration to victory cannot be challenged.
Last years
The final period of Churchill's career began with the British         people rejecting him in the general election of 1945. In that election         393 Labour candidates were elected members of Parliament against 213         Conservatives and their allies. It was one of the most striking           reversals of fortune in democratic history. It may perhaps be explained         by Churchill's aggressive campaign combined with the British         voters' desire for social reconstruction.
In 1951, however, Churchill again became prime minister. He resigned in         April 1955 after an uneventful term in office. For many of the later         years of his life, even his personal strength was not enough to resist         the persistent cerebral arteriosclerosis, a brain disorder, from which         he suffered. He died on January 24, 1965, and was given a state funeral,         the details of which had been largely dictated by himself before his         death.
There is little doubt that Winston Churchill was a political figure of         enormous influence and importance. His record, both before 1939 and         after 1945, was for the most part undistinguished. But as Anthony Storr         writes: "In 1940 Churchill became the hero that he had always dreamed of being.… In that dark time, what England needed was not         a shrewd, equable, balanced leader. She needed a prophet, a heroic         visionary, a man who could dream dreams of victory when all seemed lost.         Winston Churchill was such a man."
