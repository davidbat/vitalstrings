1854 - 1921
She was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her father was             a financier, owner of NY Times, involved in Broadway and horse             tracks. Her socialite mother took the daughters to Paris to find             royalty. She met Lord Randolph at Cowes during the yachting             festival. She became pregnant and her father paid Lord Randolph a             sum of $ 2.5 mil ( 2004 equivalent ). As soon             as this settlement was reached they were married, on 15 April 1874             at the British embassy in Paris. 
The wedding was a hushed and rushed affair with of  none of the splendor that an international society wedding of such             wealth and standing would normally receive, no public ceremony, and             little mention in the press.

John             Strange Jocelyn was responsible.
