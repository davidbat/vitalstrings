Winston Churchill Biography
Check out my personal freedom and political blog The Freedom Bus
To do full justice, a Winston Churchill biography would require 1,001 websites. There is of course, for those with a demand for detail, the Winston Churchill biography to end all Winston Churchill Biographies: the official multi-volume and majestic work by Randolph Churchill and Sir Martin Gilbert with its many companion volumes.
By providing information here I am of course not trying to compete with this wonderful resource (nor indeed with my favorite single-volume example "Churchill" by the late Roy Jenkins).  What I hope to do is provide you with an overview of the great man's life and illuminate what I see to have been the influential moments, events and people during Churchill's 90 years.
For the briefest of overviews look at a Timeline of Winston Churchill 1874-1965 . This will show you all the key events during Churchill's incredible 90 years.
