Winston Churchill was born November 30, 1874 to Lord Randolph Churchill and Jenny Jerome. Throughout his life he experienced many aspects of life, from politics to the military and even artistry. Though born into the aristocratic Spencer family, he chose to use the Churchill name publicly throughout his life. His birth also linked him to the American millionaire Leonard Jerome, through his mother. Born a rebellious child, he did poorly in his studies, which was frowned upon by his family. Upon entering Harrow School in 1888, it was found his true genius lie with English and History, and within weeks he had entered the Harrow Rifle Corps, also becoming a fencing champion within the school.
The only Prime Minister to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, Winston Churchill also can be noted as the first person to receive honorary citizenship in the United States. His fame as a war correspondent and the recognition for the many books he has written about his campaigns, along with his placement at the fore in politics, all make him a larger-than-life person of history. Churchill chose his career in war correspondence, not to keep the country informed, but to fund his over-the-top spending habits which regularly exceeded his military salary and the amount allowed to him by his family each year. However, despite his reasons for his work, his writings brought to him public attention and a significant income in addition to the afore mentioned salary and allowance.
Winston Churchill wrote several autobiographies or semi-autobiographies, including The Story of the Malakand Field Force (1898), The River War (1899), London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (1900) and Ian Hamilton’s March (1900) – all accounts of his early journalism career. The last two books were later re-edited and issued as My Early Life (1930). In 1962, all four books were republished in abridged form as Frontiers and Wars: His Four Early Books Covering His Life As Soldier and War Correspondent.
Winston Churchill has worn many hats in his 91 years of life. As an officer in the British Army, historian, writer, orator, statesman, Prime Minister, First Lord of the Admiralty, Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the Opposition are all titles he has held or been given for his deeds before retiring in 1955 from his position as Prime Minister. His death in 1965 marked one of the largest assemblies ever witnessed of world statesmen and he was granted a state funeral by the Queen.
