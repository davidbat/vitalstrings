November 30, 1874 â€“ January 24, 1965
Winston Churchill might have been part black.
Winston Churchill might have been part American Indian(!).
But was Winston Churchill part Jewish? It seems unlikely.
The rumor stems from an article that claims Winston's mother, Jennie Jerome, was once called Jennie Jacobson (conveniently forgetting that the Jeromes trace their lineage to Huguenot Timothy Jerome, who came to America in the early 18th century. These are flimsy Jewish rumors. Convenient forgetfulness is the norm).
Not that we wouldn't mind claiming Winston as a Jew. But that will just be silly. His name is Winston CHURCHill, after all.
Verdict: Not a Jew.
