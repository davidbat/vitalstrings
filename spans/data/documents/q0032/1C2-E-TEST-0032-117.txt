Executive summary: Early 20th century American novelist
Military service: US Navy (1894)
In the beginning decades of the 20th Century, Churchill was the most famous novelist in America. For a while, the English Winston Churchill began using his middle name Spencer to differentiate himself, and the two corresponded with each other about the confusion. Sir Winston later suggested to the American Churchill (who was also a New Hampshire state legislator, and one-time candidate for Governor of that state) that he run for President, perhaps to confuse historians even more. The Crisis remained in print until the 1970's, but (American) Churchill is largely an unread author today. Only one major biography exists of this once-giant literary figure.
