(formerly Churchill               Museum & Cabinet War Rooms)
Churchill War Rooms
The  Churchill Museum & Cabinet War Rooms changed its name in 2010 to the   Churchill War Rooms — to commemmorate the 70th  Anniversary of Winston Churchill becoming Prime Minister in May 1940.
The Churchill Museum — a permanent               exhibition               housed                              within the  historic Cabinet War Rooms — is the world’s             first major museum dedicated to life of Winston Churchill.
These top-secret bomb-proof underground                 Cabinet War Rooms protected Prime                   Minister Winston Churchill,                   his War Cabinet, and Chief Military Advisors against air attacks                   during                   World War II.
Today, visitors can see the                Cabinet War Rooms, just as they looked back then  featuring                original furnishings and equipment. This is a fascinating tour,                especially if you're a history buff.
Churchill's Room
This is the room where Winston Churchill spent the night when it                was too dangerous for him to return to his official residence at                No. 10 Downing Street.
The Transatlantic
Telephone Room
This tiny room housed the secret Hot-Line Telephone,                allowing Churchill and the U.S. President to conduct their strategic              discussions in complete security.
The Cabinet Room
Churchill, his Chiefs of Staff, and a select few War Cabinet               ministers and advisers met in this private chamber during the             evening bombing raids of 1940 and 1941.
The Map Room
The Map Room became the hub of the whole site until V-J Day the day that victory over Japan was celebrated by the Allies.                Closed down one day after the war  August 16, 1945  the room was left almost exactly as you see it today.
