Positive Quotes About Life
Many positive quotes about life help to explain the best of what                      there is to celebrate, and to also show what can be viewed in a                      more positive way. Life is full of twists and turns but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy and embrace these changes with a clearer and vibrant view.
Nothing in life is to be feared.
It is only to be understood.
Marie Curie
Just living is not enough.
One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.
Hans Christian Andersen
The miracle is not to fly in the air, or to walk on the water,
but to walk on the earth.
Chinese Proverb
Keep love in your heart.
A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.
Oscar Wilde
We make a living by what we get,
we make a life by what we give.
Winston Churchill
As we grow older together,
As we continue to change with age,
There is one thing that will never change. . .
I will always keep falling in love with you.
Karen Clodfelder
Things turn out best for those who
make the best of the way things turn out.
Jack Buck
One day your life will flash before your eyes.
Make sure its worth watching.

Positive Attitude Tip:
Life, something we all, at one time or another, take for granted.                           We all strive to lead a happy successful life, but how is that done.                            One of the easiest ways is to maintain a positive attitude,  to cherish                           the simple things in life.  There is a saying that for us summarizes this well,                          "What I do today is important, because I am exchanging a day of my life                          for it."  Reflect on those words and keep your attitude positive - find the                           good in every situation.
