The American Churchill
Winston Churchill was born in St. Louis, Mo in 1871. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1894, resigned from the Navy and then married Mabel Harlakenden Hall in 1895. He was elected to the New Hampshire legislature in 1902. After running unsuccessfully for Governor of New Hampshire in 1912, he withdrew from the political arena (he may have also run for Governor in 1906). At the height of his career (about 1918), a personal crisis resulted in his withdrawal from public life. The next twenty years were spent in isolation and personal reflection.
He wrote a number of books including
The Celebrity (1898,novel)
