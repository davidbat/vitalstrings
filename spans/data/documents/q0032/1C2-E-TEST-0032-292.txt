A Quote by Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill
Sure I am that this day - now - we are masters of our fate; that the task which has been set  before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our  endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will-power, salvation will not be denied us.
Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)
