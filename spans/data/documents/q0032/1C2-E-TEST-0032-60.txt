Although, by far, best known as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War 2 Winston Churchill had already had a long and eventful life, starting out as a military officer, and journalist, in Afghanistan and the Boer War in South Africa.
He also served in the Cabinet during the early years of World War 1, in which post he was responsible for the Gallipoli Campaign. The failure of this campaign lead to his resignation from the War Cabinet.
He would not return to government until the outbreak of World War 2, after almost six years of campaigning from the backbenches against the rising power of Nazi Germany. Although suffering numerous heart attacks during his time as Prime Minister, he inspired Britain to endure the travails of the blitz and other reverses during the course of the war.
Although his Conservative government was badly defeated by Labour at the end of the war, he would return to power in the early fifties before retiring from politics due to increasingly poor health.
He died in 1965.
