British Politician & Former Prime Minister
Biography
Sir Winston Leonard                                           Spencer Churchill (1874-1965) was                                           the son of Lord Randolph Churchill                                           and an American mother. He was educated                                           at Harrow and at Sandhurst Royal Military                                           College, after which he saw service                                           in India and the Sudan, and acted off-duty                                           as a war correspondent.
Churchill left the army in 1899                     to take up politics, but first travelled                     to South Africa as a journalist.                     Although taken prisoner by the Boers,                     he made a daring escape and returned                     to safety despite the price on his                     head. His consequent fame no doubt                     aided his success as the Conservative                     parliamentary candidate for Oldham                     in 1900.
He held many high posts in Liberal                     and Conservative governments during                     the first three decades of the century.                     At the outbreak of the Second World                     War, he was appointed First Lord                     of the Admiralty, a post that he                     had earlier held from 1911 to 1915.
In May 1940, he became Prime Minister                     and Minister of Defence and remained                     in office until 1945. He took over                     as leader again in the Conservative                     victory of 1951 and resigned in 1955,                     aged 81. However, he remained a Member                     of Parliament until the general election                     of 1964, when he did not seek re-election.                     Queen Elizabeth II conferred on Churchill                     the dignity of Knighthood and invested                     him with the insignia of the Order                     of the Garter in 1953.
Churchill's literary career began                     with campaign reports: The Story                     of the Malakand Field Force (1898)                     and The River War (1899), an account                     of the campaign in the Sudan and                     the Battle of Omdurman. In 1900,                     he published his only novel, Savrola,                     and, six years later, his first major                     work, the biography of his father,                     Lord Randolph Churchill. His other                     famous biography, the life of his                     great ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough,                     was published in four volumes between                     1933 and 1938.
Churchill's history of the First                     World War appeared in four volumes                     under the title of The World Crisis                     (1923-29); his memoirs of the Second                     World War ran to six volumes (1948-1953/54).                     After his retirement from office,                     Churchill wrote a History of the                     English-speaking Peoples that ran                     to 4 volumes (1956-58). His magnificent                     oratory survives in a dozen volumes                     of speeches, among them The Unrelenting                     Struggle (1942), The Dawn of Liberation                     (1945), and Victory (1946).
Throughout his life Churchill was                     plagued by depression, which he called                     the black dog. In January 1965 he                     suffered a terrible stroke and died                     on the exact same day that his father,                     Lord Randolph, had passed away 70                     years earlier. He was 90 years of                     age.
