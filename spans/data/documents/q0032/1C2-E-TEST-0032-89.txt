"It is                a crime to despair.
We must learn to draw from misfortune
the                means of future strength."
- Winston Churchill

Sandhurst, where the author lectured, was the Academy                    Churchill entered in 1893. The author seemed to have managed,                    however, an open minded approach.
Thumbs up.
Churchill
By Celia Sandys, who is the granddaughter of Sir Winston                    Churchill. Her mother was Churchill’s eldest daughter. She has                    lectured in Canada, Japan, Britain and America.
2003. 160 pages. Not the conventional sort of biography.                    Entertaining and easy to read.
Extra features: brief chronology, Churchill family tree,                    accompanied by VHS and DVD
Why not. Thumbs up.
Churchill (Life & Times) (Life and Times)
By Sebastian Haffner, who emigrated to London from Berlin in                    the 1930s and was a vocal critic of the Nazi regime, writing                    influential articles in the Observer. After the war, he became                    Germany’s pre-eminent political commentator.
German 1996, English 2003. 182 pages. Not afraid of a more                    critical view point. This can be refreshing and                    thought-provoking after reading a row of biographies that                    might have let Churchill off too easy.
Thumbs up.
