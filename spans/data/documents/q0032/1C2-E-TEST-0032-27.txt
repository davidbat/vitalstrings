In 1911 he was named First Lord of the Admiralty and presided over the British navy before the outbreak of World War I.
The Dardanelles expedition, a plan to outflank the Germans, was a disaster for the                   British military. It had been his idea and as a result Churchill  lost his admiralty                   post in 1915 and was sent to serve on the front lines in                    France.
In January 1916 he was appointed as Lieutenant Colonel of the 6th Battalion Royal Scots                   Fusiliers.
Re-elected in 1917 he was named minister of munitions and later secretary of state for                   war and air from 1918 to 1921. As colonial secretary in 1921-22, he helped negotiate the                   treaty to set up Ireland.
Between 1922 and 1924 Churchill left the Liberal party and rejoined the Conservatives.                   He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer - a position he held until the election of                   1929.. He was defeated at the next election.
 
From 1929                        Through 1932, Roosevelt Lived In America 
The Conservative government was defeated in 1929, and                        Churchill, now out of office, was in need of income. After                        an absence of almost thirty years, he crossed the Atlantic                        and undertook an extensive lecture tour of North America.                        He stayed in New York with Benard Baruch, his trip                        included his only visit to the West Coast of the United                        States, where he was lavishly entertained in California by                        William Randolph Hearst. Churchill also experienced                        Prohibition first hand and was in New York in time to                        witness the Wall Street crash. The collapse of the                        American stock market, in which Churchill had invested,                        wiped out any financial gains from the tour.
Churchill was now increasingly dependent on his writing                        and public speaking to sustain his lifestyle. He returned                        to America for yet another lecture tour in December 1931,                        but suffered a further setback when he was seriously                        injured by a car on New York's Fifth Avenue. On a late                        night romp he was so drunk he was hit by a car in 1932.
 
 
Churchill's Real Mentor
Baruched, and the New York Zionists            mentored Churchill,  who was a gambler and a drunk. He was first            hooked when Baruch covered his stock losses. 
Whether that was simply because of the Churchill-Roosevelt friendship or whether Baruch         thought he would be useful to the Jewish cause is not clear. We do not know if Churchill         made any commitment to Baruch. Churchill's hostility to Nazism seems not to have been the         result of this, but rather prior to this.
