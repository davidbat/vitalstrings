Forebears and Boyhood
Winston Churchill, ca. 1880.
Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill                 was born on November 30, 1874, to a British father and an American                 mother. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a British politician                 and aristocrat. His mother, Jennie Jerome, was the beautiful daughter                 of an American entrepreneur.
Lord Randolph was the younger son of the seventh Duke of Marlborough,                 and, as such, neither he nor Winston were likely to succeed to                 the family title. Nonetheless, from his earliest days Winston was                 acutely aware of his lineage. He was born and often stayed at Blenheim                 Palace, the mansion built by his illustrious ancestor, the first                 Duke of Marlborough, to commemorate his famous victory over the                 French in 1704.
As was the prevailing custom in upper-class British circles, Winston                 and his younger brother, John (called Jack), were entrusted to                 the care of a nanny and were sent to a succession of boarding schools.                 Churchill's parents were occupied with high society and Lord Randolph's                 meteoric, yet brief, political career and did not spend a great                 deal of time with their sons.
Young Winston was sometimes rebellious and often in trouble. He                 was not as bad a pupil as he subsequently claimed, but neither                 was he particularly distinguished academically. On leaving school                 at the age of eighteen, he joined the British cavalry. Lord Randolph                 died in 1895--before Winston had the opportunity to prove himself                 to his often critical father.
