Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (1874-1965) was a British Conservative politician.
Biography:
In Parliament from 1900, as a Liberal until 1923, he held a number of ministerial offices, including First Lord of the Admiralty 1911-1915 and chancellor of the Exchequer 1924-1929.
Absent from the cabinet in the 1930s, he returned September 1939 to lead a coalition government 1940-1945, negotiating with Allied leaders in World War II; he was again prime minister 1951-1955. Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953.
He was born at Blenheim Palace, the elder son of Lord Randolph Churchill. During the Boer War he was a war correspondent and made a dramatic escape from imprisonment in Pretoria.
In 1900 he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Oldham, but he disagr
eed with Chamberlain's tariff-reform policy, and joined the Liberals. Asquith made him president of the Board of Trade in 1908, where he introduced legislation for the establishment of labour exchanges. He became home secretary in 1910.
In 1911 Asquith appointed him First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1915-1916 he served in the trenches in France, but then resumed his parliamentary duties and was minister of munitions under Lloyd George in 1917, when he was concerned with the development of the tank.
After the armistice he was secretary for war 1918-1921, and then as colonial secretary played a leading part in the establishment of the Irish Free State. During the post-war years he was active in support of the Whites (anti-Bolsheviks) in Russia.
In 1922-1924 Churchill was out of Parliament. He left the Liberals in 1923, and was returned for Epping as a Constitutionalist in 1924. Baldwin made him chancellor of the Exchequer, and he brought about Britain's return to the gold standard and was prominent in the defeat of the General Strike of 1926.
In 1929-1939 he was out of office as he disagreed with the Conservatives on India, rearmament, and Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.
On the first day of World War II he went back to his old post at the Admiralty. In May 1940 he was called to the premiership as head of an all-party administration and made a much-quoted 'blood, tears, toil, and sweat' speech to the House of Commons. He had a close relationship with US president Roosevelt, reflected in the Atlantic Charter they concluded in August 1941.
He travelled to Washington, Casablanca, Cairo, Moscow, and Tehran, meeting the other leaders of the Allied war effort. In February 1945 he met Stalin and Roosevelt in the Crimea and agreed on the final plans for victory. On 8 May he announced the unconditional surrender of Germany.
On 23 May 1945 the coalition was dissolved, and Churchill formed a caretaker government drawn mainly from the Conservatives. Defeated in the general election in July, he became leader of the opposition until the election October 1951, in which he again became prime minister. In April 1955 he resigned. His home from 1922, Chartwell in Kent, is a museum.
His books include a six-volume history of World War II (1948-54) and a four-volume History of the English-Speaking Peoples (1956-58).
