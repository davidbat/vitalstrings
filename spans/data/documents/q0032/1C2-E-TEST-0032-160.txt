The Churchill Book Specialist
Located in Tucson (far from Churchill Country) is the best single source for books by and about Churchill.  I've been here--Mark Weber knows his stuff and prices fairly. The literature about Sir Winston is huge and the website provides a good guide to it.
Selected Books
Blake, Robert, and William Roger Louis, eds. Churchill. New                      York: Norton, 1993. Very good anthology of conference papers                      exploring most aspects of his life.
Churchill, Randolph (first two vols), and Martin Gilbert. Winston S. Churchill. London: Heinemann; Boston: Houghton                      Mifflin, 1966-1988, 8 vols. plus 16 "Companion Volumes" of documents to date (the three for 1939-41 published by Norton).                      Still in progress (with at least five more companion volumes                      to come), this is already the longest biography in English.                    Sadly all out of print, prices are fast rising on all volumes---though the entire series is gradually being reprinted (with new introductions by Sir Martin) in a new uniform edition by Hillsdale College in Michigan.

Gilbert, Martin. Churchill: A Life. New York: Henry Holt,                      1991. Based on the above, with new material. No biographer                      knows his subject better than Sir Martin.
(Ibid), ed. Churchill: A Photographic Portrait. London: Heinemann,                      1974, 1988 (expanded captions). Best picture book–and there                      are many!
James, Robert Rhodes. Churchill: A Study in Failure. Cleveland:                      World, 1970. Best critical study–takes Churchill's story to                      the eve of World War II when many saw him as a political has-been.
(Ibid). ed. Winston S. Churchill: His Complete Speeches, 1897-1963. New York: Chelsea House/Bowker, 1974 (8 vols). Not quite complete,                      but nearly so, in thousands of papers with brief contextual annotations and excellent indexes. There are many edited one-volume                      collections as well.
Jenkins, Roy. Churchill. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux,                      2001. The best one-volume treatment–very readable, in part                      for the author's own House of Commons and government experience                      and thus insight.

This is a bible for collectors                    of Churchill's vast output.

Perfectly fascinating story of the research and writing                      of Churchill's classic The Second World War (six volumes,                      1948-54), with some surprising findings.
