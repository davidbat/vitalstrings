Twice destroyed by fire, the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury, located at the corner of Westminster Avenue and 7th Street, is part of the National Churchill Museum. Dating from the 12th century, it was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren in 1677 after the Great Fire of London. Left in ruins by World War II, the architectural masterpiece was saved from demolition. The Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury was reconstructed and restored on the Westminster College campus in the 1960s.
