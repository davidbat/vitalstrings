Churchill War Rooms
Deep beneath the bustle of London lie the original Cabinet War Rooms - today part of the Churchill War Rooms - which sheltered the people at the heart of Britain's wartime government during the Blitz.
In 1940, shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Churchill stood in the War Cabinet Room and declared: 'This is the room from which I will direct the war'. Today, you can step back in time to explore the secret headquarters where Churchill and his staff changed the course of history.
Find out the stories of the people who walked the maze of corridors as London was being bombed above them. See where Churchill and his War Cabinet met, sometimes late into the night, and look through the lens of history into the Map Room, where the books and charts have remained exactly where they were left in 1945.
In the Churchill Museum, explore the man behind the image as you discover more about the influences and pressures that shaped Churchillâ€™s life and work.
