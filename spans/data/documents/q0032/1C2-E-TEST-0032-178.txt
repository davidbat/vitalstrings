Description
MY EARLY LIFE by Winston Churchill (unabridged) is presented by Blackstone Audio and comes with what is perhaps the best audiobook app available (see FEATURES, below).
“Narrator Frederick Davidson employs a slight Churchillian drawl, making this one of the most completely satisfying programs in years.” (Library Journal)
This is the story of the first twenty-five years of Mr. Churchill’s life, from his early apprentice days at Harrow and Sandhurst, through active service in Cuba, the North-West Frontier of India, Omdurman and the Boer War, up to the point where his unique parliamentary career was just beginning.
Self-contained, this audiobook app is perfect for your commute, on a trip, or while relaxing. Based on a library-quality recording, this app was built especially for your iPhone and iPod Touch. No unreadable text, no endless scrolling on a tiny screen. The audio is of higher-than-normal quality, making for a great listening experience that will not tire your ears or grate on your nerves.
NOTICE: This app includes the exact same 5-star recording offered elsewhere at much higher prices. It was professionally recorded by Blackstone Audio’s Earphones® Award-winning narrator, Frederick Davidson. You are not buying yet another amateur or volunteer narration. No clicks, background noises, throat clearing, mispronunciations, tinny voices or monotones will be found here.

___________________
This is the story of the first twenty-five years of Mr. Churchill’s life, up to the point where his unique parliamentary career was just beginning. From childhood and his apprentice days at Harrow and Sandhurst we follow him on active service to Cuba, the North-West Frontier of India, Omdurman and the Boer War (including the historic story of his escape from captivity), while in the background are his early adventures in politics and literature.
“I have tried, in each part of the quarter-century in which this tale lies, to show the point of view appropriate to my years, whether as a child, a schoolboy, a cadet, a subaltern, a war-correspondent or a youthful politician....When I survey this work as a whole I find I have drawn a picture of a vanished age.” —From the author’s preface.
