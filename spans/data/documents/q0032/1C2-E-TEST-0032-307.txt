His life.
Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, son of Lord Randolph Churchill (a son of the Duke of Marlborough) and Jennie, daughter of Leonard Jerome of New York, was born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. He did not succeed very well at school so he was sent into the Army, where he served in a cavalry regiment. After leaving the Army he became a Member of Parliament and started to write books. As a special correspondent for the "Morning Post" he was sent to South Africa to cover the Boer War and was taken prisoner in 1899. He escaped and became a hero back in England. In 1908 he married Clementine Hozier at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, adjacent to the Abbey. He fell from favour after the disastrous campaign at Gallipoli during the 1914-18 war but later became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Prime Minister 1940-45. His oratory during the Second World War and determination to defeat Hitler and the Nazis is legendary. He became Prime Minister again from 1951-55, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 and was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter and member of the Order of Merit. He declined a peerage.
In 1953 he launched the appeal for funds to restore the Abbey and a plaque in the Jerusalem Chamber records this. A few years before his death he was made an Honorary Citizen of the United States.
