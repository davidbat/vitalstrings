Winston Churchill's Biography | Family and Early Life
Family and early life
A descendant of the famous aristocratic Spencer family , [1] Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, like his father, used the surname Churchill in public life. [2] His ancestor George Spencer had changed his surname to Spencer-Churchill in 1817 when he became Duke of Marlborough , to highlight his descent from John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough . Winston's father, Lord Randolph Churchill , the third son of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough , was a politician, while his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill ( née Jennie Jerome) was the daughter of American millionaire Leonard Jerome . Born on 30 November 1874, 2 months prematurely, in a bedroom in Blenheim Palace , Woodstock, Oxfordshire , [3] Churchill had one brother, John Strange Spencer-Churchill .
Independent and rebellious by nature, Churchill generally did poorly in school, for which he was punished. He was educated at three independent schools: St George's School in Ascot , Berkshire , followed by Brunswick School in Hove , near Brighton (the school has since been renamed Stoke Brunswick School and relocated to Ashurst Wood in West Sussex ), and then at Harrow School on 17 April 1888, where his military career began. Within weeks of his arrival, he had joined the Harrow Rifle Corps . [4] He earned high marks in English and history and was also the school's fencing champion.
He was rarely visited by his mother (then known as Lady Randolph Churchill), and wrote letters begging her to either come to the school or to allow him to come home. His relationship with his father was a distant one; he once remarked that they barely spoke to each other. [5] Due to this lack of parental contact he became very close to his nanny, Elizabeth Anne Everest, whom he used to call "Old Woom". [6] His father died on 24 January 1895, aged just 45, leaving Churchill with the conviction that he too would die young, so should be quick about making his mark on the world. [7]
Speech impediment
Churchill described himself as having a "speech impediment" which he consistently worked to overcome. After many years, he finally stated, "My impediment is no hindrance". [8] Trainee speech therapists are often shown videotapes of Churchill's mannerisms while making speeches and the Stuttering Foundation of America uses Churchill, pictured on its home page, as one of its role models of successful stutterers. A large number of 1920s–1940s printed materials [9] by various authors mention the stutter in terms implying that it was a well-known Churchill characteristic. [10]
The Churchill Centre, however, flatly refutes the claim that Churchill stuttered, while confirming that he did have difficulty pronouncing the letter S and spoke with a lisp. [11] His father also spoke with a lisp. [12] Certainly, the careful ear of diarist and fellow parliamentarian Harold Nicolson led him to portray Churchill's speech with a lazy S rather than any hint of a stutter: "It is cuthtomary to thtand up when the Kingth thpeech is read." [13]
Marriage and children
Churchill met his future wife, Clementine Hozier , in 1904 at a ball in Crewe House, home of the Earl of Crewe and his wife Margaret Primrose (daughter of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery ). [14] In 1908, they met again at a dinner party hosted by Lady St Helier . Churchill found himself seated beside Clementine, and they soon began a lifelong romance. [15] He proposed to Clementine during a house party at Blenheim Palace on 10 August 1908, in a small Temple of Diana . [16] On 12 September 1908, they were married in St. Margaret's, Westminster . The church was packed; the Bishop of St Asaph conducted the service. [17] In March 1909, the couple moved to a house at 33 Eccleston Square.
Their first child, Diana , was born in London on 11 July 1909. After the pregnancy, Clementine moved to Sussex to recover, while Diana stayed in London with her nanny. [18] On 28 May 1911, their second child, Randolph , was born at 33 Eccleston Square. [19] Their third child, Sarah , was born on 7 October 1914 at Admiralty House . The birth was marked with anxiety for Clementine, as Winston had been sent to Antwerp by the Cabinet to "stiffen the resistance of the beleaguered city" after news that the Belgians intended to surrender the town. [20]
Clementine gave birth to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the official end of World War I. [21] In the early months of August, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent named Mlle Rose. Clementine, meanwhile, travelled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster and his family. While still under the care of Mlle Rose, Marigold had a cold, but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed with hardly any notice, it turned into septicaemia . Following advice from a landlady, Rose sent for Clementine. However the illness turned fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later. [22] On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child was born, Mary . Later that month, the Churchills bought Chartwell , which would be Winston's home until his death in 1965. [23] [24]
