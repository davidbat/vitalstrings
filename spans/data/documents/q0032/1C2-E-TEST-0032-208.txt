About Us
Hello and welcome to my historical quotes website.  My name is Matt and I am a collector of great quotations.
This site is dedicated to Sir Winston Churchill. Briefly stated, he was an acclaimed orator, statesman, officer in the British Army, historian, Nobel Prize-winner, and artist.
He became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and led Britain to victory in World War 2.
As a great man, his quotes are full of wisdom and wit. Please enjoy them and feel free to include your own submissions.
