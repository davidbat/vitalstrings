Cold War and Long Sunset
LIFTING THE IRON CURTAIN
Though out of office in Britain,               Churchill retained huge prestige and influence on the international               stage. In March 1946, at the encouragement of President Harry Truman,               he traveled to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, to speak.               His speech was a call for closer Anglo-American cooperation in               the post-war world, but it is now best remembered for its warnings               about the threat of Soviet expansionism, eloquently captured in               the phrase "Iron Curtain."
Churchill continued to speak out on the great issues--the Cold               War, the atomic bomb, and European unity--always stressing the importance of a "special relationship" between the British Empire               and the United States. Then, in October 1951, the Conservative               Party won the general election, and he returned as Prime Minister.
During his second premiership Churchill worked hard to strengthen               Anglo-American relations, retain British global influence, and,               above all, initiate a summit meeting with Stalin's successors in               the Kremlin. He felt that strong negotiation might obtain an end               to the nuclear arms race and establish détente in the Cold               War. In this goal he was frustrated, partly by his own failing               health, partly by the opposition of President Dwight Eisenhower               and other Western leaders who favored a harder line against communism               and the Soviet Union, and partly by the new Soviet leaders who             resisted détente.
