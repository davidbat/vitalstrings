Winston                Leonard Spencer Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, on November 30, 1874. His father                Randolph was a Conservative politician and descendant of the first                Duke of Marlborough, who would die of syphilis in 1892. Winston                Churchill's mother Jennie (1854 - 1921) was a flirtatious American                socialite, daughter of Leonard Jerome (Jacobson), who owned the                New York Times. In May, 1940, Churchill became British prime                minister until the end of World War II, and he led Britain again                from 1951 to 1955. By the time Winston Churchill died after a                stroke on January 24, 1965, he had become one of the pre-eminent figures of the 20th century. He had been                awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 .
 
The British leaders who have followed Churchill (with the                exception, perhaps, of Margaret Thatcher) have shown little of his                independence of spirit, or individualism. Five years ago,                Churchill was voted the greatest Briton of all time in a BBC poll . Those who claim to support Churchill                think mainly of his role as a statesman, and as a warrior in the                battle against Hitler and fascism.
 
 In today's politically correct Britain, few people are prepared                openly to criticize Islamism. A collective cowardice afflicts the                chattering classes. Too fearful of the stigma of being labeled "Islamophobe",                leaders and media figures would rather buy into the lies of Muslim                victimization than objectively analyze the threat that global                radical Islam poses to democracy. Few are aware of Churchill's                comments on Islam, and fewer still would dare repeat those words                in public today.
 
 Churchill was born into privilege but he gained first-hand                knowledge of Islam in the army. He joined the Fourth Hussars in                1895, and was posted in the North-West Frontier of India (now                Pakistan), bordering Afghanistan. During this time, he became a                war correspondent, working with full approval of Sir Bindon Blood ,                chief staff officer of the Chitral relief force. Originally,                Churchill's reports were sent anonymously by telegram and letter                to the Pioneer Mail. Eventually he was writing for the                London Daily Telegraph under his own name. The first of                these reports was published on October 6, 1897. He was paid five                pounds per article.
 
 He wrote of his experiences in the borderlands with Afghanistan                in a book titled The Story of the Malakand Field Force . This                book detailed not only the conflict of the region, but also its                cultural and military history, with notes on natural history. When                his mother informed him in late 1897 that Longmans had agreed to                publish this tome, he  noted :                that "the publication of this book will certainly be the most                noteworthy act of my life. Up to date (of course). By its                reception I shall measure the chances of my possible success in                the world." The book appeared the following year.
 
 In this book, when describing a local imam, Churchill coined the                term "Mad Mullah". Speaking of the Pathan and Beluchi tribesmen of                the border regions, he noted with some sarcasm that "the                Mullah will raise his voice and remind them of other days when the                sons of the prophet drove the infidel from the plains of India,                and ruled at Delhi, as wide an Empire as the Kafir holds to-day:                when the true religion strode proudly through the earth and                scorned to lie hidden and neglected among the hills: when mighty                princes ruled in Bagdad, and all men knew that there was one God,                and Mahomet was His prophet. And the young men hearing these                things will grip their Martinis, and pray to Allah, that one day                He will bring some Sahib (prince) - best prize of all - across                their line of sight at seven hundred yards so that, at least, they                may strike a blow for insulted and threatened Islam."
 
 Churchill wrote: "Indeed it is evident that Christianity,                however degraded and distorted by cruelty and intolerance, must                always exert a modifying influence on men's passions, and protect                them from the more violent forms of fanatical fever, as we are                protected from smallpox by vaccination. But the Mahommedan                religion increases, instead of lessening, the fury of intolerance.                It was originally propagated by the sword, and ever since, its                votaries have been subject, above the people of all other creeds,                to this form of madness."
 
 After 9/11, George W. Bush famously described Islam as a "religion of peace". Churchill entertained no such fancy                notions. In his history of the Malakand Field Force, Churchill                wrote that "civilisation is confronted with militant                Mahommedanism. The forces of progress clash with those of                reaction. The religion of blood and war is face to face with that                of peace. Luckily the religion of peace is usually the better                armed."
 
 By the time his first book was published, Churchill had taken                part in active service, fighting in Bangalore. He joined Lord                Kitchener's army in the Sudan, and took part in the Battle of                Omdurman on September 2, 1898. This battle took place in what is                now a suburb of Khartoum, and pitted British troops against 50,000                belonging to a local warlord, Abdullah al-Taashi. This man called                himself the Khalifa or "Caliph", and was the successor of Muhammad                Ahmad. Ahmad had been the self-styled "Mahdi" (Muslim Messiah) who                had beheaded General Gordon at Khartoum in 1885. The war in Sudan                was a religious war. The region had been exploited by the                Egyptians from 1819 to 1883. Originally the "Mahdi" had waged war                against Muslim Egypt but, irritated by the presence of 150 British                troops in Sudan, he soon declared Jihad (Holy War) against all                Christians. The Mahdi himself had died of typhus in 1885. The                Battle of Omdurman was not the last decisive battle in this war,                but it signaled the last time a cavalry charge was mounted by                British troops.
 
 Churchill wrote of the Mahdi's jihad, the succession of the                Khalifa and Omdurman in a two-volume book published by Longmans in                1899. Entitled "The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of                Sudan", Churchill wrote on pages 248-250 of the second volume: ""How                dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!                Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as                hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.                Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish                methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the                followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism                deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its                dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman                must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a                child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of                slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power                among men.
 
 "Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands                become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to                die. But the influence of the religion paralyses the social                development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force                exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a                militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout                Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were                it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of                science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the                civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation                of ancient Rome."
 
 This contentious passage became abridged in a shorter version published in 1902. However, the                abridged version still contained some harsh words for the                fanaticism of Islam. In Chapter One, Churchill wrote: "Fanaticism                is not a cause of war. It is the means which helps savage peoples                to fight. It is the spirit which enables them to combine - the                great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes                become insignificant. What the horn is to the rhinoceros, what the                sting is to the wasp, the Mohammedan faith was to the Arabs of the                Soudan - a faculty of offence or defence."
 
 In Chapter Two, Churchill stated: "All the warlike operations                of Mohammedan peoples are characterised by fanaticism" and in                its third chapter he observed: "After the fall of Khartoum and                the retreat of the British armies the Mahdi became the absolute                master of the Soudan. Whatever pleasures he desired he could                command, and, following the example of the founder of the                Mohammedan faith, he indulged in what would seem to Western minds                gross excesses. He established an extensive harem for his                own peculiar use, and immured therein the fairest captives of the                war."
 
 Churchill entered politics in the same year that "The River War" was originally published. As his eponymous grandson pointed out last March , Churchill noted the threat of Wahhabism                on June 14, 1921 at the House of Commons. His grandson stated in                an address to the Locke Foundation that this speech "followed "hard on the heels of the Cairo Conference, at which he had                presided over the re-shaping of the Middle East". This was the March 1921 Cairo Conference , rather than the better                known Cairo Conferences of 1943.
 
 At that time , Churchill was secretary for the British                colonies, and he had been involved in the creation of Iraq (in                1921), Jordan (Transjordan) and Palestine. The intention, he told                the Commons, was "to set up an Arab government, and to make it                take the responsibility, with our aid and our guidance and with an                effective measure of our support, until they are strong enough to                stand alone ... (and) to reduce our commitments and to extricate                ourselves from our burdens while at the same time honorably                discharging our obligations and building up strong and effective                Arab government which will always be the friend of Britain.
 
 What is less well known is that he also said on that day: "A                large number of Bin Saud's followers belong to the Wahabi sect, a                form of Mohammedanism which bears, roughly speaking, the same                relationship to orthodox Islam as the most militant form of                Calvinism would have borne to Rome in the fiercest times of                [Europe's] religious wars.
 
 The Wahhabis profess a life of exceeding austerity, and what                they practice themselves they rigorously enforce on others. They                hold it as an article of duty, as well as of faith, to kill all                who do not share their opinions and to make slaves of their wives                and children. Women have been put to death in Wahhabi villages for                simply appearing in the streets.
 
 It is a penal offence to wear a silk garment. Men have been                killed for smoking a cigarette and, as for the crime of alcohol,                the most energetic supporter of the temperance cause in this                country falls far behind them. Austere, intolerant, well-armed,                and blood-thirsty, in their own regions the Wahhabis are a                distinct factor which must be taken into account, and they have                been, and still are, very dangerous to the holy cities of Mecca                and Medina.
 
 The                Bin Saud to whom Churchill refers here is King Abdul                Aziz bin Saud (c. 1880 - 1953), who would go on                officially to establish Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1926 ,                this king's followers had control of Mecca. Traditionally a                caravan procession (mahmal) would arrive annually at Mecca with                embroidered curtains from Egypt at the time of the Hajj                pilgrimage. The curtains would be placed around the Ka'aba and                then returned to Egypt. The Wahhabists slaughtered 25 of the                Mahmal caravan members at Mina because they played trumpets. Music                was forbidden to the Wahhabists, and the tradition of mahmal was abandoned. The incident soured relations between Egypt and the                emerging nation of Saudi Arabia.
 
 Winston Churchill was fully aware of the potential for fanaticism                and warfare, inherent within Islam since the time of the founder                and his successors. He did not choose to dilute his words. His                experiments at nation building in the Middle East may not have                been as successful as he would have wished. He knew that war had                attended Islam since its origins, and a century ago fanatics were                exploiting this. Today, the world is still threatened by Islamic                terrorism and the war of jihad is still being fought, even in the                mountains and valleys of Malakand. Our leaders today, unlike                Winston Churchill, are too conciliatory to acknowledge publicly                the true nature of the beast that threatens us.
 
 When he was describing Nazism, Churchill said: "An appeaser is                one who feeds the crocodile hoping it will eat him last." He also                said: "Victory will never be found by taking the line of least                resistance." Those words should be heeded. In the current struggle                against the spread of Islamism, they are as true today as they                were 65 years ago.
