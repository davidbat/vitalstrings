Biography
The Right Honourable Sir Winston Leonard   Spencer Churchill (1874-1965), the son of Lord Randolph   Churchill and an American mother, was educated at Harrow and   Sandhurst. After a brief but eventful career in the   army, he became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 1900. He   held many high posts in Liberal and Conservative governments   during the first three decades of the century. At the outbreak of   the Second World War, he was appointed First Lord of the   Admiralty - a post which he had earlier held from 1911 to 1915.   In May, 1940, he became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence   and remained in office until 1945. He took over the premiership   again in the Conservative victory of 1951 and resigned in 1955.   However, he remained a Member of Parliament until the general   election of 1964, when he did not seek re-election. Queen   Elizabeth II conferred on Churchill the dignity of Knighthood and   invested him with the insignia of the Order of the Garter in   1953. Among the other countless honours and decorations he   received, special mention should be made of the honorary   citizenship of the United States which President Kennedy   conferred on him in 1963.
Churchill's literary career began with campaign reports: The   Story of the Malakand Field Force (1898) and The River   War (1899), an account of the campaign in the Sudan and the   Battle of Omdurman. In 1900, he published his only novel, Savrola, and, six years later, his first major work, the   biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill. His   other famous biography, the life of his great ancestor, the Duke   of Marlborough, was published in four volumes between 1933 and   1938. Churchill's history of the First World War appeared in four   volumes under the title of The World Crisis (1923-29); his   memoirs of the Second World War ran to six volumes   (1948-1953/54). After his retirement from office, Churchill wrote   a History of the English-speaking Peoples (4 vols.,   1956-58). His magnificent oratory survives in a dozen volumes of   speeches, among them The Unrelenting Struggle (1942), The Dawn of Liberation (1945), and Victory (1946).
Churchill, a gifted amateur painter, wrote Painting as a   Pastime (1948). An autobiographical account of his youth, My Early Life, appeared in 1930.
