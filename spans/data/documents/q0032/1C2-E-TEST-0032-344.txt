Churchill
.... You ask, What is our policy? I will say; It is to wage war, by            sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that            God can give us: to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed            in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.            You ask, What is our aim? I can answer with one word: Victory - victory            at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and            hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.
-- Winston Churchill
An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile-- hoping it will eat him last.
-- Winston Churchill
Vast and fearsome as the human scene has become, personal contact of            the right people, in the right places, at the right time, may yet have            a potent and valuable part to play in the cause of peace which is in            our hearts.
-- Winston Churchill
Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves            up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.
-- Winston Churchill
If you have an important point to make, don't try to be subtle or clever.            Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again.            Then hit it a third time-- a tremendous whack.
-- Winston Churchill

In war: resolution. In defeat: defiance. In victory: magnanimity. In            peace: goodwill.
-- Winston Churchill
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to            so few.
-- Winston Churchill
If you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without            bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and            not too costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight            with all the odds against you and only a small chance of survival. There            may even be a worse case: you may have to fight when there is no hope            of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.
-- Winston Churchill
Danger - if you meet it promptly and without flinching - you will reduce            the danger by half. Never run away from anything. Never!
-- Winston Churchill
We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight            in France, we shall fight on the seas and the oceans, we shall fight            with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend            our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches,            we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields            and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
-- Winston Churchill
The problems of victory are more agreeable than the problems of defeat,            but they are no less difficult.
-- Winston Churchill
In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended            by a bodyguard of lies.
-- Winston Churchill
If you go on with this nuclear arms race, all you are going to do is            make the rubble bounce.

Never give in. Never. Never. Never. Never.

Don't talk to me about Naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy,            and the lash.
-- Winston Churchill
The price of greatness is responsibility.
-- Winston Churchill
There is no finer investment for any community than putting milk into            babies.

I always avoid prophesying beforehand, because it is a much better policy            to prophesy after the event has already taken place.
-- Winston Churchill
If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find            that we have lost the future.
-- Winston Churchill
I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped            in a mystery inside an enigma.
-- Winston Churchill
The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that, when nations            are strong, they are not always just, and when they wish to be just,            they are no longer strong.
-- Winston Churchill
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty, and so bear ourselves            that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasts for a thousand            years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'
-- Winston Churchill
Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this            world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.            Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the 'worst' form of Government            except all those others that have been tried from time to time.
-- Winston Churchill
I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of Parliament. The            first lesson that you must learn is, when I call for statistics about            the rate of infant mortality, what I want is proof that fewer babies            died when I was Prime Minister than when anyone else was Prime Minister.            That is a political statistic.
-- Winston Churchill
An iron curtain has descended across the Continent.
-- Winston Churchill
A love for tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened            nations in their hour of peril.
-- Winston Churchill
You can always count on Americans to do the right thing -- after they've tried everything else.
-- Winston Churchill
It is a socialist idea that making profits is a vice; I consider the            real vice is making losses.
-- Winston Churchill
A communist is like a crocodile: when it opens its mouth you cannot            tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up.
-- Winston Churchill
The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings;            the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.
-- Winston Churchill
For my part, I consider that it will be found much better by all parties            to leave the past to history, especially as I propose to write that            history myself.
-- Winston Churchill
There is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result.

Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those            who could make a good peace would never have won the war.
-- Winston Churchill
Democracy is a government where you can say what you think even if you            don't think.
-- Winston Churchill

MacDonald has the gift of compressing the largest amount of words into            the smallest amount of thoughts.

The reserve of modern assertions is sometimes pushed to extremes, in            which the fear of being contradicted leads the writer to strip himself            of almost all sense and meaning.
-- Winston Churchill
Where does the family start? It starts with a young man falling in love            with a girl - no superior alternative has yet been found.

Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality that            guarantees all the others.
