Winston Churchill, named by Time magazine as one of the most important people of the 20th Century, was an accomplished and prolific artist. The Winston Churchill Trust has handpicked some of Churchill's finer works to be made available as limited edition lithographs.
Through the miracle of modern fine art publishing, Churchill's paintings will now be accessible to Churchill enthusiasts and fine art collectors around the world. We are thrilled  to be awarded this unique opportunity.
