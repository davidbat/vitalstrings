Winston         Churchill
Â Prime Minister of England
Winston Leonard Spencer- Churchill         and the Molloys are 17th cousins 1 time removed. Their common         ancestors are Ralph De Neville and Joan De Beaufort.
Winston Churchill enjoyed one of the longest and most interesting         lives of any person who has ever lived. From his birth at Blenheim         Palace on November 30th, 1874, to his death at Hyde Park Gate in         London on January 24, 1965, his life was one of action, controversy,         setback and achievement. It was never dull.
There are a number of very good biographies about that life, the most         thorough being the outstanding eight-volume official biography by         Martin Gilbert, Winston S. Churchill, plus the (fifteen volumes and         counting) Companion Volumes of letters and documents.
While Winston Churchill is best remembered as a statesman, politician         and world leader who saved the world from Nazi domination in the dark         days of 1940, throughout his life he cared for his family and         sustained his lifestyle through use of the pen. His books and         speeches were numerous and, generally, memorable and have led to a         plethora of quotes and witticisms from which one might be able to         select just the right quote for almost any occasion.
