When Winston  reached two to six year old, he lived in Dublin. His grandfather was chosen  Viceroy and had Churchill's father as his private secretary. During this time,  his mother gives birth to his one and only brother, John Strange  Spencer-Churchill in Ireland. When he was still young, Winston is fond of  watching military parades passing in the Vice Regal Lodge which is now the Aras  a UachtarÃ¡in, the official residence of the President of Ireland, because of  that he was fascinated in militarism. Winston's earliest endeavours at  education happened in Dublin. An instructor tried to educate him reading,  writing and arithmetic. 'Reading Without Tears' was the title of the first book  Winston had read. His Nanny Mrs. Everest was his confidante, nurse and mother  and they used up many happy hours playing in the Phoenix Park.
His Love of His Life and His Family
"I will not pretend that, if I had to choose  between communism and Nazism, I would choose communism" - Winston Churchill
Churchill met  Clementine Hozier, his wife now in 1904 at the ball in Crewe House, home of the  Earl of Crewe. Crewe is the wife of Margaret Primrose, the daughter of  Archibald Primrose, the 5th Earl of Rosebery. In the year 1908, Churchill and  Clementine met again at a dinner party hosted by Lady St Helier. Churchill  found himself seated beside Clementine and they soon began a lifetime romance. In  the 10th day of August 1908, Churchill proposed a marriage to  Clementine during a house party at Blenheim Palace, in a small Temple of Diana.
In that the same  year, 12th day September, Churchill and Clementine got married in  St. Margaret's, Westminster. The church was completed with the Bishop of St. Asaph  conducting the service. The newlywed couple spent their honeymoon at Highgrove  House in Eastcote. In March 1909, the couple moved to a house at 33 Eccleston  Square. In 11th day of July 1909, Winston and Clementine got their  first child named Diana, she was born in London. After giving birth, Clementine  went to Sussex for her recovery, while Diana stayed in London with her Nanny.  On 28 May 1911, their second child was born named Randolph, who was born at 33  Eccleston Square.
Sarah was their  third child; she was born on 7 October 1914 at Admiralty House. The birth was striking  with nervousness for Clementine because Winston had been sent to Antwerp by the  Cabinet to "stiffen the resistance of the beleaguered city" after  news that the Belgians proposed to surrender in the town. On 15 November 1918, four  days after the official end of the World War I, Clementine gave birth to her  fourth child named Marigold Frances Churchill. August 1921, the Churchills'  children were entrusted to a French nursery professor in Kent named Mlle Rose.
Clementine, in  the meantime, travelled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with the 2nd Duke of Westminster  Hugh Grosvenor and his family. While still under the care of Mlle Rose, their  fourth child Marigold got sick and was reported to have recovered from the sickness.  As the illness development with only just any notice, it crooked into  septicaemia. With the advice from her landlady, Rose sent a report to  Clementine. On the other hand, the illness wasn't having improvement for  Marigold. On 23 August 1921, the simple illness turned into fatal. And Marigold  died and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later after her  death.
"Go down in history as the man who restored  honour and peace of mind to the great Germanic nation and brought it back  serene, helpful and strong to the forefront of the European family  circle." - Winston Churchill quote
15th  day of September 1922, Clementine give birth for the last time to a little girl  named Mary. Late month of 1965, the Churchills bought Chartwell, which would be  Winston's home until his death.
His Favourite Friend
"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend  during the whole of the twenty years I had lived." - Winston Churchill quote
Churchill truly  has a mind of militarism, in fact in 1895; Churchill went to Cuba to observe  the Spanish fight the Cuban guerrillas. He had found an assignment to write  about the clash from the Daily Graphic. To his enthused, along his twenty-first  birthday, he came under fire for the first time. He had warm-hearted  reminiscences of Cuba as a "...large, rich, beautiful island..." While he was there, he soon obtained a taste for Havana cigars. Because of  that, he smoked for the rest of his life. When he was in New York, he resided  at the home of Bourke Cockran which he knew that was an admirer of his mother.  Bourke was a well-known American politician and a member of the House of  Representatives there. He deeply influenced Churchill in his move towards  oratory and politics and cheering a love of America.
As the time  passed by, while spending time in America, he received a letter telling him  that his Nanny Mrs. Everest was dying. He immediately returned to England and  stayed with his Nanny for a week until she died. Winston wrote in his journal  saying "She was my favourite friend." "She had been my dearest and  most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived." He  truly loves his Nanny, he never asks for more about her. He feel loved when he  is with his Nanny.
The Protector
"You were  given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will  have war." - Winston Churchill quote
Even during the  time Churchill was protesting against Indian independence, he received official  and or else secret information. Year 1932, Churchill's fellow citizen which was  Major Desmond Morton with Ramsay MacDonald's approval offer Churchill  information on German air power. Since 1930 onwards, Morton headed a section of  the Committee of Imperial Defence charged with investigating the defence attentiveness  of other nations. The secretary of State for Air, Lord Swinton and with  Baldwin's support, in 1934 gave Churchill access to official and otherwise  secret information.
 
Swinton did so; knowing Churchill would remain a  detractor of the government but believing that an informed detractor was better  than one relying on rumour and hearsay. Churchill was a violent detractor of  Neville Chamberlain's conciliation of Adolf Hitler and in a speech to the House  of Commons. He frankly and prophetically stated, "You were given the  choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have  war." He was very militarism; he never turned his back against his opponent,  he was certified critic for the good of the Government and for his family.
