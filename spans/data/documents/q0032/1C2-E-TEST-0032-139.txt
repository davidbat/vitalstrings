There is nothing wrong with change, if it is in the right direction.
~Winston Churchill
I confess, I have thought Churchill and Alfred Hitchcock looked awfully similar (ha)! Basically he saved modern Western society at large during one of our darkest hours. Check out the Churchill Centre and Museum for details on his very extraordinary life!
He poses a deceptively simple observation that begs for a thorough vetting.
Do You Know Where You’re Going
Are you willing to change course if you find yourself in a barren land? Would you notice if you’ve thus stumbled through life with blinders on – albeit with certain successes?
How would you feel if it was revealed you had fallen behind or were not meeting all of your potential in life?  Are you willing to feel the discomfort that comes from growth? Is true change something you strive for?
Most people are firmly entrenched — and comfortable in their mediocrity and lying to others about who they are. They’re lying because they don’t know themselves at all. They don’t want to examine, let alone move away from useless physical locales, intellectual perspectives or ideologies.
Do you know where you’re going?
