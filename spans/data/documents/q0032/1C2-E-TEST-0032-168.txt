This little book is a condensation of historian John Perry’s larger work on Winston Churchill, a towering figure not only in English history, but in worldwide history.  We all know the face and voice of the man who looked a bit like a bulldog, and his most well-known quotes and speeches are recognizable by even the most novice history buffs, but what was behind the public figure, and what made him the man who guided England through some of its darkest days?
Perry begins early in Churchill’s life and details how Churchill loved and nearly idolized his parents, who were not as nurturing as parents should be. His nanny was much more influential and more of a mother to him, and she deserves a great deal of credit for the man Churchill would become.
We see throughout the book that Churchill could be haughty, arrogant and self-centered, believing he was set apart by God to do “the Lord’s work.” Whether Churchill was ever truly saved is still a mystery, and while he said many of the “right” things, it’d doubtful any historian can give hard and fast evidence for his salvation.
Whether Churchill was saved or not, one thing is certain: he was clearly, as he said, spared and set apart for a reason. His contributions to English history, and to the state of the world during and after World War II, cannot be downplayed. Christian or not, he had a large measure of grace to accomplish his work. This book makes that clear, even if it reaches a bit and tries to finesse Churchill’s incomplete belief system into a Christian worldview.
