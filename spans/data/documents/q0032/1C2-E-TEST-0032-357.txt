The Britain at War Experience recreates the London Blitz in all its fury with
special effects highlighting the sights and sounds, the artifacts,
and even the dust and smoke of an air raid at its height.
Take the lift to the London Underground air raid shelter
and see where thousands spent sleepless nights.
Keep up to date with wartime news in the underground cinema
or read it in the memorable news pages.
Enter the BBC radio studio and tune it to Rome, Washington,
London and Berlin for the latest messages from Churchill,
Chamberlain, Roosevelt, Ed Murrow, Hitler and Lord Haw Haw.
