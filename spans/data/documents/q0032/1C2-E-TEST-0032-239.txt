Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.

Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening,ever-ascending, ever-improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the journey. But this, so far from discouraging,only adds to the joy and glory of the climb.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

Difficulties mastered are opportunities won.
