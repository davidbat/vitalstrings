Dear Graduating Girls,
Did you know that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in Canada and that using tanning beds before the age of 35 increases your risk of developing skin cancer by 75%! There are ways to reduce that risk. This year at Churchill, be a part of the Tan Free Grad campaign. Sign a pledge to remain tan free for graduation and you could win the grand prize of a manicure, pedicure and makeup appointment or one of six other individual manicures or makeup appointments at Terra Nova Salon and Day Spa for the day of Grad. Pledges will be available to sign on May 15th, 16th, and 17th at lunch in the front breezeway. Listen to announcements for further information or contact Alyssa Johnston or Sasha Topolniski-Atkinson.
 Don’t get melanoma with your diploma! Stay healthy to stay beautiful.
