Advantages: Close to the centre of town. Really close.
Disadvantages: Expensive, access issues, poor value for money, crappy wifi.
...I have only been to Inverness once, and although I loved the town, I did not enjoy my stay in my hotel.  I stayed in the Winston Guesthouse, which is in an absolutely fabulous location. It is right near the centre of town and is only just across the river from the castle. The front of the guesthouse is on the riverside itself.  Despite the excellent location, I feel that I paid an unfair price. I paid Â£50 for one night in a single room with breakfast. My single room was tiny. To get to it I had to go through the guests' common room (which was a bit intimating to consider baring in mind that I was a lone female traveller who would be coming back to the guesthouse late - who knows who I would have to encounter just to get to my room?), and up some stairs. The stairs were very narrow and had a sharp 180-degree turn on them. I had no problem...
