More Plastic Surgery for Hillary Clinton?

Did current Secretary of State and former First Lady Hillary Clinton have a facelift? That’s what Fox News is “wondering” , without actually reporting it. While Clinton’s eyes do look a lot less puffy in the recent photo, the fact that the side-by-side photos being compared were taken years apart makes it more difficult to judge.   
When Fox News left it up to its viewers to make the call, the answer was a resounding yes, with two-thirds of those polled saying that they believe that Clinton has had her eyes done. Considering the station leans conservative, however, this result may reflect a bias against Clinton’s politics more than anything. So we're posing the same question to the RealSelf community, a group of people who are definitely more in the know about all things plastic surgery.
