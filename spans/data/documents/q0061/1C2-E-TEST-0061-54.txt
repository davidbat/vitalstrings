Women's Place is in the House...and Senate!

Girls Scouts and the White House: The Ms. President Patch
As a young girl in Chicago, Hillary Rodham was a Girl Scout, and as First Lady, she was honorary President of the Girl Scouts (as are all modern First Ladies).  In 2002, the Girl Scouts, in collaboration with The White House Project on women in leadership, created a patch for the Girl Scouts called the Ms. President Patch.

Aboard the Calypso: Jacques Cousteau and Ocean Conservation
In 1992, the year that Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States, an international conference called the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was held in Rio de Janeiro. Popularly called the Earth Summit, or the Rio Summit, the conference was a gathering place for scientists and other people interested in Planet Earth.  One of those was Jacques Cousteau, whose ocean explorations aboard the Calypso had been made famous by the televised programs that showcased his work.

“Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”: Mary Poppins Comes to Town
When the original Walt Disney movie, Mary Poppins, was released in 1964, Hillary Rodham was 17 years old, a junior in high school, and busily campaigning for Republican presidential candidate, Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona.  We don't know whether she saw the movie, but chances are that she did: it was one of the most popular films of the year, nominated for 13 Academy Awards, and it made both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke famous nearly overnight.

Should Students Have Free Speech?
In 1969, the same year that Hillary Rodham gave her commencement speech at her graduation from Wellesley College, the Supreme Court rendered a verdict in a landmark case that answered the question, "Does the First Amendment guarantee of free speech apply to school students?"  At issue was the case of three high school students in Iowa who wore black arm bands to school in protest of the Vietnam War.

Exploring the Heavens: Women in the Space Program
While attending Maine East High School in Oak Ridge, Illinois, Hillary Rodham wrote to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) asking for information on becoming an astronaut.  NASA replied that they did not accept women for astronaut training.  Times have surely changed since the early 1960s!

Trouble in Little Rock: The Desegregation of Central High School
In 1957, four years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that said that segregated schools were inherently unequal, nine brave African American students desegregated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.  That year was difficult in many ways for those nine students, but they persevered and, in the end, helped to change the United States forever.  In 1997, President and Mrs. Clinton went "home" to Little Rock for the 40th anniversary celebration of that event.

Children and Poverty: The Children's Defense Fund
After graduating from Yale Law School in 1973, Hillary Rodham went to Massachusetts to work with Marian Wright Edelman at the Children's Defense Fund, where she had served as an intern while in law school.  Her internship there both stimulated an interest in children's law, and gave her the experiences that lay the foundation for later research and publishing in this area.

Impeachment!
William Jefferson Clinton was one of three Presdents of the United States against whom impeachment proceedings were instituted or threatened under Constitutional provisions for removing a President (or other high official, or judge).  The stories behind each case were different, but the sense of crisis each case brought to the nation was very similar.

American Health Care: The Best in the World?
Shortly after his inauguration as President, Bill Clinton named Hillary to chair a panel that would investigate health care in the United States and prepare a new health care plan to be submitted to Congress.  Both Hillary and the panel--called the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform--ran into two years of difficulties, which encompassed political, ideological, and personal issues.  By 1994, the panel and its proposals were effectively buried.  Still, it is the first time that a First Lady has held such an important and official position in her husband's administraton.  And health care issues continue to be a major problem for the United States.

Women Practicing Law: Crossing Another Boundary
In September, 1969, Hillary Rodham became one of only 30 students among a class of 160 students enrolled in the Yale Law School.  Like many First Ladies before her, Hilary Rodham broke barriers for other women who followed her; one of these was demonstrating that women could, should, and do practice law.
