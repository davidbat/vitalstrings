First Lady Rips Gop Attack On Hillary Clinton
August 14, 1992|By Janet Cawley, Chicago Tribune.
WASHINGTON â€” A stern Barbara Bush took direct aim at the chairman of the Republican National Committee Thursday, chastising him for attacking Hillary Clinton and declaring, ``I don`t like that kind of campaigning.``
Speaking to a small group of reporters in the family`s sitting room overlooking the Rose Garden and the Oval Office, the first lady was adamant that the campaign should be fought on the records and characters of the two candidates and not their wives.
``I mean there are two people running this year, period,`` she said.
But her husband, in an interview with Scripps Howard News Service, sounded a little less certain that GOP Chairman Rich Bond had been wrong.
Bond claimed Wednesday in Houston that if Bill Clinton were elected, it would mean ``advising Clinton on every move (would be) that champion of the family, Hillary Clinton, who believes kids should be able to sue their parents rather than helping with the chores as they are asked to do. She has likened marriage and the family to slavery. She has referred to the family as a dependency relationship that deprives people of their rights.``
To back up his remarks, Bond aides distributed copies of a 1974 essay by Hillary Clinton that appeared in the Harvard Education Review. But Clinton aides said Bond had twisted her words into ``lies.``
If Bond thought Hillary Clinton was too independent, he didn`t reckon with another independent woman, Barbara Bush.
Asked about his remarks, Bush said, ``I don`t like it. I`m not going to lie to you about that. I don`t like attacking. I think he`s got a great candidate to push and I hope he will. . . . I`m devoted to Rich Bond but . . . if you`re going to knock (someone) you ought to knock the other person running.``
Asked if she had phoned Bond to convey her displeasure, she replied, ``I don`t have to. I`m talking about it to you.``
In the Scripps Howard interview, the president stepped more gently. ``I think what Bond was doing (in criticizing Hillary Clinton), as I understand it, was quoting positions that she had publicly taken,`` he said. ``. . . If it was factual and stuff then that`s quite different from just attacks on my wife. I think if you`re going to be in the issue business, it`s fine to talk about issues. Barbara Bush is not in the issue business. She`s in something else.``
The difference of opinion between Barbara Bush and Bond follows close on the heels of another Republican upheaval over a vituperative press release by political director Mary Matalin that the president eventually disowned.
During the session, Bush was at times exasperated, at times resigned, at times combative as she took reporters` questions.
On other topics Bush:
- Said she thought the coverage earlier this week of a report-based on a book footnote quoting a man now dead-that the president may have had an affair with an aide was ``ugly.`` She told reporters, ``I think you ought to be ashamed of yourselves (for) even printing those things or asking them.``
She called it a ``lie in every way, shape and form. . . . And I felt the same way-I don`t have a double standard-I felt the same way about printing the Bill Clinton story (claiming he had an affair with Gennifer Flowers).``
- Dismissed rumors that the president was ill as ``nutty . . . I mean he`s the strongest man in the world.``
She said she was particularly amused by a rumor that he was going to have open-heart surgery after the election. ``Do you think I would let the person I love more than life run for public office if he was going to have open-heart surgery after the campaign?``
- Said she thought several recent articles critical of her, particularly one in Vanity Fair, were attempts to get at the president. ``We`ve got four months before the election,`` she said. ``How do you get to George Bush?
Clobber his wife.``
- Described her convention speech on family values next week as ``sort of a little Mighty Mouse. I mean it`s nothing. It`s very short, I mean like five minutes. . . . Don`t expect anything `cause you`re not going to get it.``
- Declined to answer questions about her position on abortion, adding,
``When I run for office you ask me and I`ll tell you.`` Asked if she would support the conservative abortion plank drawn up this week in Houston, she replied, ``I`m going to answer that next week.``
- Said she agreed completely with the president`s remark that if a granddaughter said she wanted to have an abortion he would try to counsel her against it, ``but of course I`d stand by my child.``
The best thing to do, she said, is to teach children to abstain from sex. ``I`m not sure in my own mind whether it`s worse to get AIDS or whether it`s worse to be a 14-year-old who has to quit school, have a baby, can`t take care of it and knows that she is locked into poverty the rest of her life.``
