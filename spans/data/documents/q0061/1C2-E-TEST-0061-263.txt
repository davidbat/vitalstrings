Hillary: First Lady, Senator, Lesbian?
June 29, 2005
By Jim David
A strange phenomenon in nature is occurring, akin to seas boiling                and dogs talking: conservatives are rushing to the defense of Hillary                Rodham Clinton. Yes, that Hillary, the Senator (D-NY), first lady                from Hell, Queen Of The Damned.
Edward Klein's muckraking book, The Truth About Hillary: What                She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far She'll Go to Become President,                is evidently so trashy that marching orders were issued from the                head Republican Borg and zapped to the minions which said, in effect, "Guys, this book is too much bullshit for even us to defend.                Do something we don't usually do: fact check."
Faced with the book's undeniable National Enquirer stench,                Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and others are claiming that the conservative                movement had nothing to do it the book and does not support it,                despite a huge push by every conservative media outlet before publication                and a link to the book on many right wing websites.
The publisher is distancing itself from the book, saying, "factual                accuracy does not mean unopinionated or unbiased. Mr. Klein's interpretation                of what he reports is unabashedly his opinion." For a book with                the word "Truth" in the title, this statement implies                that the target audience is drooling morons.
Among the book's many stop-the-presses whoppers, it alleges that                Hillary only recently began shaving her legs and armpits and has                been "botoxed to the hilt," impeachable offenses indeed.                One source from her Arkansas days said, "You should have seen her!                No, you should have smelled her," despite the fact that everyone                in Arkansas has stunk at some point.
With revelations like these, the book's biggest scoop may be that                Bill Clinton is actually Chelsea's father, but with the implication                that she was conceived by force; a source says that after a night                of heavy drinking in Bermuda, Bill said, "I'm going back to my cottage                to rape my wife." Apparently Klein has no sense of humor or has                never heard the famous Roy Rogers/Dale Evans story where America's                G-rated cowboy said, at the end of a day's filming, "Good,                we're done. I'm gonna go home and fuck Dale."
But one of the book's spiciest claims is Hillary's supposed flirtation                with lesbianism, featuring staggering evidence like "Hillary                talked about it a lot, read lesbian literature, and embraced it                as a revolutionary concept." Also, Hillary was very much a part of the "lesbian culture" in college. There is no first-hand                account of any actual tango with Sappho, but she had lesbian friends                and actually – gasp – discussed it, so if it walks like a                dyke, and talks like a dyke... well? Where there's smoke, there's                fur?
Even Sean Hannity defended Hillary against the lesbian rumors,                the same Hannity who champions every right-wing talking point from                Juanita Brodderick to the Swift Boat Vets. Bill O'Reilly won't have                Klein on his show because of the book's "personal attacks," the same O'Reilly who personally attacks someone every night, especially                during sweeps week.
And aren't these and other conservatives the ones who, during the                2000 primaries, helped spread the rumor that John McCain fathered                an illegitimate black child? Aren't they the ones attacking gay                visibility every chance they get?
Klein seems to think the mere whiff of that Arkansas smell of                lesbianism is enough to derail Hillary's presidential future, which                is typical. Conservatives attack gays whenever it suits them and                then defend the privacy of Republican gays when someone questions                their hypocrisy. The simple mention of someone like Mary Cheney                causes them to shake like Katharine Hepburn on crystal meth.
Conservatives are fine with gays as long as they keep quiet, don't                fight for their rights and don't "ram their lifestyle down                people's throats," a frequent and unintentionally funny complaint                when gays simply come out.
If Hillary did indeed experience hot girl-on-girl action at some                point, I would hope she would proudly pant like Piper Laurie in Carrie, exclaiming, "Yes, yes, I did it, and I liked                it, I liked it!!!" But she's probably rolling her eyes                at yet another smear, and laughing at the never ending attempts                to accuse any powerful woman of lesbianism. Conservatives are all                for gay bashing, except when it backfires.
