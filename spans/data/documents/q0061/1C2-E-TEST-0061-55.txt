Peru's Prime Minister meets with U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton
 Peruvian First Lady Nadine Heredia held an informal meeting with U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton on the sidelines of the Sixth Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia.
Clinton expressed willingness to visit Peru and participate in activities programmed by the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) for the "Week of Social Inclusion and Gender" to be held in Lima in the second half of this year.
Nadine Heredia said that "the importance of focusing on this issue is that women have a central role in the promotion and sustainability of development.
"Inclusion policies adopted by the Peruvian State imply the achievement of better conditions and opportunities for women and greater participation in the public sphere," the first lady noted.
U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton said there is an explicit interest in the Peruvian model of social inclusion and hinted at the possibility of providing technical support to the process.
The meeting was held minutes before the meeting between Presidents Barack Obama and Ollanta Humala in Cartagena, Colombia.
