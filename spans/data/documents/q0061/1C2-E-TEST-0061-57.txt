Wake up people
You're an awesome lady Mrs. Obama, I'm sure whatever you do, you will be great at it! God bless all of you. Thank you for showing the world a classy, black family. ( Since so many have only seen blacks on tv or the news.) Smh.
OBAMA 2012!

"cali is brok, keep raising those taxes jerry. they think the other 49 states will bail them out if barry gets back in."
And what would be wrong with that?  For over hald a century we've been bailing out failed red states by giving them more federal dollars than they pay in taxes.  Meanwhile, CA's receipts of federal money have consistently been dropping and they only receive about $0.75 to $0.80 for ever $1.00 in taxes they send to the federal government.  Guess where that other quarter is going?  That's right...Ole' Miss, Albama, SC, etc.  How is that not a bailout?  Red states and their failed GOP/conservative governments have consistently needed the federal government and the rest of the states to "bail them out" for over a half century.  Year after year after year.  Maybe it actually is time for some parity.

Ok Sniff, you can start right now, donate part of your income to California.  Or, better yet move there and pay the taxes that will be required for the huge state Govt they have.  Pretty soon there won't be any companies left in Cal. because they aremoving to more business friendly states.  Good luck finding a job.

FLOTUS is smart, she knows that we're all waiting on Hillary Clinton to finish off the Republican party once and for all.

As soon as I get my refund for all the taxes I gave to Mississippi, SC, Alabama, Louisiana, et al.
"Pretty soon there won't be any companies left in Cal. because they aremoving to more business friendly states. "
Really?  I'm pretty sure last time I checked that everyone and their mom wants to live and work in CA's internet industry and Hollywood.  Those aren't going anywhere, and Apple is about to build a billion dollar building that looks like a spaceship to house their corporate faciilities.  Do you just make these things up because it helps you convince yourself that reality really is the way you've been told it is by Faux Noise and the rest of the right wing's chosen prophets?  Yo have no backup for these kinds of statements...the GOP/Teatrolls never do...they just "conclude" that it "must be true" beacuse "my ideology tells me so."

The REAL Truth...
@rob â€“ the FLOTUS is a REALLY class act. And.... A little research will show you that GDP, Growth, Productivity and profitability have ALWAYS been higher in times of HIGHER tax rates. The supply-side, trickle-down GOP economic policies simply DO NOT WORK, and that is FACT!  The ONLY benefit to the economy in lower tax rates is that the wealthy get WEALTHIER. That wealth does NOT go into job creation... the 1% DO NOT USER THEIR OWN MONEY to create jobs... it's the SMALL businessman/entrepreneur that uses their own money..
The cause/effect has been proven time after time... lower taxes do NOT improve the economy. The opposite is true. Please educate oneself.

Running for political office would leave her no time for vacationing. It was an easy choice for her to make.

Countless vacations with her friends and the bill is paid by the taxpayers.  No other fist lady (Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Kennedy) did this.  What class? She is a perfect match with her husband.  All take and no give.

And that is not all bad.  She is obviously in it for the luxurious parties and deluxe tax paid vacations, not for the raw political power.

It's a bit funny how often she and her husband are on the View.  We get personal details and national policy coming from the same show.
