"Hillary Clinton Nude: Naked Ambition, Hillary Clinton and Americas Demise" is a blockbuster literary exploration of the most controversial politician in America. Stripping away the veils of imagery which mask the imperfections of Hillary Rodham Clinton, "Hillary Clinton Nude" presents a non-partisan yet passionate case against a second Clinton presidency. Author Sheldon Filger has written a bombshell of a political book, conveying a warning to the American people of the dire risks to the nations continuity should the former First Lady succeed in fulfilling her ultimate political ambition. More than just another Hillary Clinton book, "Hillary Clinton Nude" is a sobering commentary on the state of American politics in the new century, and the influence of money, image making and celebrity power in the debasement of meaningful political discussion in the United States. Democrats, Republicans and independent voters will discover much to reflect on in this incisive and revealing book. The 2008 presidential elections may be among the most decisive in Americas post-war history. Do not go to the polls without arming yourself with the knowledge found in Sheldon Filgers incisive book, "Hillary Clinton Nude."
