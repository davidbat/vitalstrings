Barack Obama and George Bush Show Congress How to Act Like Adults
By Paul Bedard, Washington Whispers
It pays to stay in the public eye, especially if you are Hillary Clinton. President Obama's secretary of state, a controversial first lady who went on to become an effective U.S. senator, tops our Whispers poll for the most important first lady since the 1980s. By more than 2 to 1, Clinton beat another headline-gathering first lady, Nancy Reagan, and the two Bushes barely made a blip on the poll conducted March 9-11 by Synovate eNation among 1,000 nationally representative households. Barbara Bush, who recently underwent heart surgery, was last among the four, but recall that she had only one term to prove herself, while the others had two four-year presidential terms.
