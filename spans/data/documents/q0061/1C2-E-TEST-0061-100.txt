A revolutionary first lady in many ways, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to transform the position from a largely ceremonial role into that of a policy adviser to the president.
“She re-expanded the role of first lady,” says Gutin. “I think she showed there was flexibility there that perhaps her predecessors had not taken advantage of."
In her first major undertaking as first lady, Ms. Clinton spearheaded the administration's fight for health-care reform. While that effort was largely unsuccessful, Gutin notes that Clinton rebounded quickly.
“I would say the good outweighed the bad,” Gutin says, noting in particular a speech Clinton made in Beijing concerning human rights. “She balanced that against the fact that she kind of had a crash and burn with health care.”
Clinton received both praise and censure for standing firmly by her husband's side during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that tarred Bill Clinton 's second term. “Women were really on the fence" about her decision, Gutin says. “Even if you ask that question today, people may still have a mixed answer. There are still women who are mad at her.”
In 2000, she made history as the only former first lady to be elected to the United States Senate . Far from ending her career in politics and government there, Clinton launched a campaign for president in 2008 and currently serves as secretary of State.
Her popularity has fluctuated widely, but in 2010 she tied President Obama in topping Gallup’s annual “Most Admired” poll, beating out Oprah Winfrey , Sarah Palin , former President George W. Bush , and others.
