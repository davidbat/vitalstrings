Work that Hillary Clinton performed at the Rose Law Firm during this period would later become a central part of the Whitewater Scandal during Bill Clinton's presidency.  In brief, the Clintons' partners in the Whitewater real estate venture, Jim and Susan McDougal, also operated a savings and loan bank that retained Mrs. Clinton's legal services.  The subsequent failure of the bank triggered Federal investigations, and Hillary Clinton's billing records were subpoenaed in 1994; they were not produced until 1996, when they were found in a private area of the White House.  While both of the McDougals were jailed as a result of the federal investigations, and Webster Hubbell pled guilty to felony charges of lying to federal investigators about Hillary Clinton's role in the land deal and bank failure, Bill and Hillary Clinton were never charged with any crimes and reportedly even lost the money they had invested in the business projects.
Hillary wrote a weekly newspaper column entitled "Talking It Over," which focused on her experiences as First Lady and her observations of women, children, and families she has met around the world.
