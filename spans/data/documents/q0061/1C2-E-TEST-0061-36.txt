Unedited candid video - August 4, 1999: FIRST LADY HILLARY CLINTON VISITS DUNKIRK NY in CHAUTAUQUA COUNTY. At that time Hillary considered running for US Senate in NY. In spite of poor audio, what is fascinating  to watch is how small town America reacts to a visiting First Lady. Audio improves at the end during the topic on education. A complete 30 minute DVD of this video is available.  Email: Stanwrite@aol.com
