President Bill Clinton's connection to the paranormal is First Lady Hillary's mystical sessions with a New Age guru
In the book The Choice, journalist Bob Woodward of Watergate fame describes how Hillary Rodham Clinton attended some mystical sessions with a New Age guru when Bill was first running for the presidency.
Mrs. Clinton, according to Woodward, had been friends with a psychic researcher named Jean Houston, who often wrote and lectured about the existence of unseen spirits of the dead. In 1995, during a s√©ance in the White House solarium, the book says, Hillary sank into a trance and channeled the spirits of Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.
After Woodward's book broke this story, and fearing comparisons to Nancy Reagan and her astrologer, both Hillary and Houston downplayed the event. They said they were just imagined conversations and idea sessions.
