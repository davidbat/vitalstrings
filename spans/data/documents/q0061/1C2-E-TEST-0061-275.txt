This week Michelle Obama made news on her England trip for twice having a bad hair day with the English wind blowing her hair amiss.   Bad hair days, or should we say “wind malfunctions,” are not uncommon to Presidential First Ladies who are under the scrutiny of the camera 24/7.  So I decided to highlight some of the other windy moments from Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton to remind everyone that even our highest honored ladies are just like the rest of us.
