Laura Bush ain’t too bad. Either are McCain and Obama’s wives. But nobody wants to hear about the best looking first ladies. Here are the 10 worst. Enjoy.
10. Louisa Adams
Probably doesn’t help that you dress like those bird things from The Dark Crystal.
9. Barbara Bush
We’re surprised she would be this low. Grossest scenario: Barbara saying, “Read my lips. Those lips”.
8. Eleanor Roosevelt
Poor FDR was crippled and a lesbian wife. Wonderful person. Just not a looker. A licker, just not a looker.
7. Lucretia Garfield
Klingon forehead. And her name is fucking Lucretia.
6. Ellen Wilson
First wife of Woodrow Wilson. Wonky eye.
5. Martha Washington
Stick to sewing. You’re ghastly.
4. Margaret Taylor
