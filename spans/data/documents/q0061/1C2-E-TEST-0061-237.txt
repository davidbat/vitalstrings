They moved to Austin to work for the McGovern campaign in 1972. In 1974,       Hillary Rodham moved to Washington, where she worked for the House Judiciary Committee's special counsel John Doar on the impeachment of Richard Nixon.       In October, 1975, she returned to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton. He       was elected Attorney General in 1976, and she worked on Jimmy Carter's       campaign. Afterwards, she joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock and in       1977 was appointed to part-time chairman of the Legal Services Corporation.
Bill Clinton ran for governor of Arkansas in 1978. He won the Democratic         nomination, which more or less ensured victory in the general election.         During this time, Hillary Clinton invested $1,000 in commodities futures         on the advice of a friend who worked as an attorney for Tyson Foods,         one of the state's biggest businesses. That investment, which ultimately         netted $100,000, has been the object of much criticism.
In the early 1980's she continued her law practice, as well as service         on the board of the Children's Defense Fund. She chaired the Arkansas         Education Standards Committee in 1983 and 1984. She served on the boards         of TCBY and Wal-Mart. The National Law Journal named her in         1988 and 1991 as one of the top 100 influential lawyers in the country.
During these years, she and her husband invested in the Whitewater         real estate project. The project's bank, Morgan Guaranty Savings and         Loan ended up failing, costing the federal government $73 million. Whitewater         later became the subject of congressional hearings and an independent         counsel investigation.
After winning the Presidency in 1991, Bill Clinton announced that the         leader of his task force on health care reform would be the first lady,         Hillary Rodham Clinton. The controversial commission produced a complicated         plan which never came to the floor of either house. It was abandoned         in September, 1994.
Clinton persevered through the health care debacle and the numerous         White House scandals. She worked on lesser but noteworthy projects like         shaping the CHIP, children's health insurance program, as well as breast         cancer funding.
She authored It Takes A Village and donated the proceeds to         children's hospitals. In 1998 the year was engulfed with the Monica Lewinsky         scandal, through which she continued to publicly support her husband.
Three days after the 1998 elected, New York Senator Daniel Patrick         Moynihan announced that he would not seek re-election in 2000. Moynihan,         who had served four terms, was considered one of the Senate's greatest         thinkers, and he left big shoes to fill.
Clinton announced her campaign for Senate, despite the fact she did         not live in New York state, or that she had never before had run for         office. Despite early problems, and charges of carpetbagging, Clinton         pulled off is universally viewed as an impressive campaign. Spending         over $41 million, she beat popular Republican Rick Lazio by a surprisingly         wide margin - 55% - 43%.
Clinton's prospects for a long Senate career are good. But many believe         her ultimate goal is to return to the White House, this time as President.         Her memoir Living History shines         insight into the ideas, history and motives of who is clearly the country's         more popular, yet divisive, Democrat.
