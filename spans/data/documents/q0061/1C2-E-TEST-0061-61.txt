See How They Ran
It is now official. The Clinton co-presidency is over. Hillary Clinton's Senate run means         that she will become modern America's first "absentee first lady," as the Washington         Post noted. In 1992, Hillary Rodham Clinton rejoiced, "If you vote for him, you get me." Eight years         later, Hillary! -- sans her last name -- implores: Vote         for me, forget about him.
Amid         this extraordinary campaign, it is worth assessing Mrs.         Clinton's seven-year-stint as a full-time first lady. Her         closing flourish is in keeping with her entire tenure.         Ironically, this historic gesture will cement her         reputation as a great first lady with most historians and         with her fans, even as it damages the very office she         vowed to expand and invigorate.
Without winning a single vote,         simply by becoming the first first lady ever to run for         office, Mrs. Clinton has imposed a happy ending on her         stormy White House years. Win or lose, by ending on this         bold note, Mrs. Clinton guarantees that historians will         compare her to Eleanor Roosevelt not Barbara Bush - that         they will view her compromises as small detours from her         trail-blazing path. Months before the launch, the         Associated Press reported that "Historians say         Clinton, a lawyer by training and a policy advocate by         experience, has redefined the role of first lady to the         extent that this political race is not so         extraordinary." This symbolic legacy compensates for         her otherwise minor individual achievements and major         surrenders.
To be fair, being first lady is one         of the world's toughest posts. It is an aristocratic         throwback in a modern egalitarian democracy. Occupants         endure a maximum of scrutiny with a minimum of autonomy.         The gossamer shackles of the first lady's office put         First Ladies in an exquisitely feminine bind -- their         husbands' position gives them great potential to do good         while constraining them terribly. First Ladies are         supposed to help shape their husbands' image; they are         not supposed to share power. Americans expect First         Ladies to be happy homemakers and do-gooding celebrities,         independent yet supportive, newsworthy but not         controversial, neither too feminine nor too feminist.         First Ladies enter the public sphere to champion the         private sphere, they are supposed to blaze the trail for         modern women while defending the traditional family.
In recent years, some First Ladies         have thrived. Both Betty Ford and Rosalynn Smith Carter         came to love what Nancy Reagan called the first lady's "white-glove pulpit,." with Mrs. Ford using it         to express herself, and Mrs. Carter using it to champion         her husband. Even Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush found         their voices.
Alas, Hillary Clinton's tenure has         been particularly rocky. She has sustained unrelenting         abuse -- some unfounded, some deserved. Her enemies         caricatured her in 1992 as the Lady Macbeth of Little         Rock; during the presidency, as Shrillary the White House         feminazi. Her responses and her actions, however, have         often fed her critics. Early quips that she would not         just stand by her man like Tammy Wynette or that "I         suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and         had teas" did not endear her to millions of         homemakers - or country music fans. Revelations that she         made $99,537 in cattle futures off a $1,000 investment in         nine months during the 1980s undermined the Clintonian critique of Reaganite selfishness. And she has yet to         offer a convincing explanation how her long-sought and         subpoenaed Whitewater billing records mysteriously         reappeared in the White House Book Room, adjacent to her         private office, in the heart of the fortress-like         executive mansion, with her fingerprints.
Even worse than the criticism, her         husband's behavior humiliated her, repeatedly. From the         Gennifer Flowers tapes to the Monica Lewinsky dress, it         is hard to imagine the psychic toll of standing by her         man. In Primary Colors, Joe Klein has the Hillary         Clinton character "haul off" and slap her         errant husband "right across the face. It was a         perfect shot, a resonant splat." But the American         people have only seen that kind of assertiveness in         fiction, in the National Enquirer, or in the         mind's eye. Hillary's public, recorded response to the         revelations has been defiance, hostility to the Clintons'         common enemies, and, during the worst days in August         1998, after her husband admitted to the Lewinsky affair,         a dead, vacant, heartbreaking look in her eyes that only         hinted at her pain.
Amid all this public tumult, amid         all this publicly broadcast private agony, it is         remarkable that she has been able to get up in the         morning, let alone help shape history. And Mrs. Clinton         scored some successes. She has been a key Clinton         administration figure, recruiting personnel, honing         policies, defining strategy, advancing pet projects,         selling both the program and the president. Like most         presidential wives, she has often been a confidante,         sounding board, safe haven and touchstone of normal         domesticity for her husband amid the luxurious White House pressure cooker. Her health care crusade was a         glorious failure, a bold power play that, despite many         flaws, identified a pressing social problem and showed         that the first lady can help craft the solution.
In the wake of the health-care         debacle, she, like her husband, has advanced a more         modest, baby-steps agenda, but an agenda nevertheless.         She, like he, has tried to make America a "kinder,         gentler place," if you'll pardon the expression,         without ambitious Great Society programs. Her call for a "politics of meaning," for some spiritual and         altruistic dimension to our lives, generated much         ridicule but served as a welcome reminder amid a dizzying         boom that there is more to life than IPOs and SUVs. More         practically, she has been able to publicize the needs of         America's children, America's schools, America's Gulf War         veterans, and America's sick, for more effective         policies, more generous programs.
Overseas, Mrs. Clinton usually         triumphed. Her silence when Suha Arafat libeled Israel         was a rare gaffe. Her call for microcredit programs has         helped jumpstart economic projects in the Third World and         shine the spotlight on the need to think creatively in         helping the poor. Her speech in China during the United         Nations Fourth World Conference on Women denouncing human         rights was courageous and typical of her commitment to         fighting oppression everywhere.
Abroad and at home, her frenzied         fans have accorded her rock star status. Many Hispanics         and African Americans hail her as their friend in the         White House. Many professional women, young and old,         revere her. To millions of women, Hillary can do no         wrong. She is their role model, their inspiration, their         icon. When she pioneers, they applaud her boldness; when         she compromises, they appreciate and identify with her         sacrifices.
All these successes, combined with         her dramatic finale, will make it easy for historians --         who are notoriously easy on First Ladies -- to place her         in the progressive mold, to celebrate her as another         pathbreaking first lady in the activist's pantheon with         Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, and         Rosalynn Carter. Her various personae, the different         approaches she has taken to the task, will confirm the         conventional wisdom that the first lady can be whatever         she wishes to be.
And yet, the Hillary partisans are         wrong. Celebrating her middling successes overlooks her         grander failures. Mrs. Clinton's tenure has damaged the         institution of the first lady - and the cause of modern         women.
In crying "Buy one get one         free" in 1992, both Clintons recognized the         centrality of the first lady to the president's success.         They rooted their plans to work closely together in their         unique "partnership" as well as in the         evolution of the first lady's role since the days of         Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. In office, Mrs. Clinton         repeatedly invoked Mrs. Roosevelt, and other         predecessors, to justify her involvement in all phases of         governing. And yet, after overstepping as co-president in         1993 and 1994, Mrs. Clinton retreated. Her rapid         disappearance from the national radar screens implied         that she was wrong, that First Ladies should not shape         policy. Mrs. Clinton then spent four years trying to         rehabilitate her reputation and reestablish the rationale         for a first lady's involvement in White House life.         Gradually working her way back into policy meetings and         into the political fray, she found the equilibrium that         other First Ladies had also found -- focusing on specific         projects, publicly appearing more deferential than         revolutionary, focusing on the needs of children, not the         minutia of legislation. And in 1998, during the Lewinsky         scandal, her loyalty all but singlehandedly saved her         husband's presidency.
Yet now she has decided that the         first lady does not have to be around so much, that the         nation and her husband can thrive without her, thank you         very much. It is of course impossible to resign from a         post with no salary, no contract, no formal terms of         employment. But she is not only abdicating, she is         abandoning the half-century attempt to argue that the         first lady, for all the ambiguity, is indeed         indispensable.
Even more disturbing, the office         she is leaving is more partisan than ever, thanks to her.         First Ladies, like their husbands, have always had to         balance service to particular partisan needs with their         duty to the nation. Even in the 1940s and 1950s Bess         Truman and Mamie Eisenhower stumped with their husbands         on campaign trains. More recently, during the 1990         midterm elections, Barbara Bush was in greater demand as         a campaigner for Republican congressmen than her husband.         Still, Mrs. Truman, Mrs. Eisenhower, Mrs. Bush, and most         other First Ladies distanced themselves from politics.         They understood that they were not only their husbands'         wives, but one of the nation's symbolic leaders.
While she has helped light the         national Christmas tree and performed other non-partisan         duties, Mrs. Clinton has all but dropped the illusion         that the first lady is non-partisan. She has campaigned         and fund-raised aggressively - and effectively. More than         most First Ladies, she has hosted groups of committed         supporters rather than a cross-section of Americans. And         worst of all, her often self-pitying and polarizing         rhetoric has intensified the partisan divide in America.         Attributing the Lewinsky scandal to her infamous "vast right wing conspiracy" is only the most         conspicuous and successful example. Her us versus them,         left versus right, good versus evil rhetoric has made it         clear. Hillary Rodham Clinton functions more as the first         lady of the Democratic Party, or of Clinton, Inc., than         of the United States of America.
As a partisan zealot in the Clinton         wars, Mrs. Clinton has rarely acknowledged her flip-flops         or her errors. While less slick than her husband, she,         too has demonstrated an elusive relationship with the         truth. Life with the Clintons has been an unnerving         journey through the looking glass, a fluid fantasy world         where today's spin wipes out yesterday's realities.
In the world of Hillary Rodham         Clinton, any woman linked romantically to her husband         becomes a gold-digger or a right wing stalking horse;         sleazy real estate transactions become altruistic         attempts to set up Chelsea's college fund; sweetheart         deals in the commodities market become the fortunate         result of having learned "the stock tables" from her father. Mrs. Clinton morphs seamlessly - in         public -- from crusading for health care as co-president         to championing domesticity as a happy homemaker to         running for Senate as a White House insider.
In this hall of mirrors, truth         became a mere pose. Reporters spent countless hours         speculating not about what really happened - but about         what Mrs. Clinton wanted the American public to believe         at any given moment. The biggest challenge came in the         wake of Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony. "Two         irreconcilable story lines began seeping out" of the         White House, Time would later report, "one so         painful it was hard to hear, the other so cynical it was         hard to believe." Was it "worse for Hillary to         appear as a stupid, duped wife or as a conniving wife who         had been covering for her husband all year?"
In 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton         entered the White House as a shrewd, proud, powerful         dynamo, an unapologetic, sometimes defiant, lawyer who         brought her own skills, her own passions, her own agenda,         into politics. True, conservatives bristled that she was         too independent - resurrecting the "Who Elected         Her" complaint thrown at Rosalynn Carter. And yes,         some feminists bristled that this high-powered career         woman was too dependent, getting her high position         through her man. Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be         striking a perfectly reasonable and quite modern balance:         maintaining her sense of self and her integrity while         acknowledging the unique nature of her husband's job and         their opportunity. Seven years later, she is trying to         resurrect that earlier self and parlay her image as a         powerful, progressive celebrity into a Senate seat. She         just might succeed in wooing enough New Yorkers, just as         she has succeeded in keeping her partisans committed, and         will also succeeded in dazzling most future historians.         Alas, her saga has been a more complex one than the         Hillary for Senate forces will acknowledge, a tale of         constant compromise, of betrayal -- by her husband and of         her ideals -- and of spinning a web of deceit so complex         and so multi-dimensional that out of sheer exhaustion it         is easier to believe the line of the day rather than the         truth.
As all the potential First Ladies         in the current campaign emphasize their deep commitment         to the old-fashioned family, the damage Hillary has         wrought to modern feminism becomes clear. As Laura Bush         and Tipper Gore recoil at direct political questions and         refuse to take bold stands, the damage Hillary has         wrought to the modern first ladyship is evident. It takes         a village to raise a child; and it will take time before         a first lady feels comfortable enough to advance in the         footsteps of Eleanor Roosevelt not Barbara Bush.
