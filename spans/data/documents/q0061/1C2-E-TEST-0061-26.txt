Hillary Clinton
Current Secretary of State and former First Lady, Hillary                      Clinton was born in Chicago in 1947. She attended Yale Law                      School in Connecticut where she graduated with honors. Throughout                      college she worked summers and breaks in various programs                      advocating for migrant workers and for victims of child abuse.                      In 1974, she joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas                      Law School with her Yale classmate and boyfriend Bill Clinton                      also worked.
Hillary Clinton
In 1975, the two married forming one of the most formidable                      political partnerships since FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt. In                      1978, Bill began serving his first of five terms as Governor                      of Arkansas. In 1980, the couple gave birth to a daughter,                      Chelsea Clinton. While the First Lady of Arkansas, Clinton                      pursued many causes working for children, education, and families.                      She also wrote a weekly newspaper column where she discussed                      political and social issues.
When Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992, he used the                      power duo's status as a selling point in his campaign, stating                      that the nation would get "two for one" if he was                      elected. Her heavy involvement in her husband's politics combined                      with her sharp tongue and no nonsense manner made Hillary                      Clinton an easy target for controversy. It became quickly                      evident that she was not going to stand in the shadow of anyone.
Immediately, Clinton dedicated herself to healthcare reform,                      working to make the country aware of how many of its citizens                      could not afford basic medical insurance. Her work drew intense                      criticism, and her first efforts were eventually abandoned                      without a vote coming to the House Floor. Clinton did, however,                      create the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997.
The program, which provides insurance for children whose                      parents cannot afford it, is considered her most successful                      achievement as First Lady. Regardless of whether people liked her or agreed with her, Clinton was doing the work that she                      felt needed to be done. She kept an office in the White House,                      and attended meetings when her husband was addressing issues                      that she was working on. She stayed in the spotlight and kept                      her finger on the pulse of the nation while her husband served                      as President.
Not everyone appreciated Clinton's involvement. In 1993,                      it was rumored that she had illegally profited from a development                      in the Ozarks called "Whitewater." The Whitewater                      controversy would define much of Hillary Clinton's time as                      First Lady, as she found herself on the defensive at every                      turn. In 1998, Bill Clinton admitted to having an affair with                      a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Hillary stood                      behind her husband supporting him through a very public scandal.
In 2000, Clinton became the first First Lady elected to public                      office when she won the U.S. Senate seat from New York State.                      She served as both First Lady and as U.S. Senator for twenty                      days. In 2007, she entered into the Presidential race becoming                      the first First Lady to enter a national political race. Despite                      raising over $100 million for her campaign, Clinton lost the                      nomination to Barack Obama. When elected, President Obama                      asked Clinton to serve as his Secretary of State making her                      the third woman in history to hold that office and one of                      the most famous women in recent history in politics.
There is a secret you don't know 
Besides the factual Hillary Clinton biography presented above                      there is a secret that no one knows except you and me right                      now. Instead of swearing like a sailor as she'd like to do                      on occasion, Hillary Clinton just blurts out "Fox Soccer" over and over again.
