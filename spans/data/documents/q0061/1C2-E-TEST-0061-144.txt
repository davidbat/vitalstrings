The centerpiece of Hillary Clinton's social platform, of course,  was universal healthcare . As a novice First Lady in  1993, Hillary Clinton tried but famously failed to implement this element of  what was then President Bill Clinton's platform.
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton now endeavors to implement the foreign  policy platform of  yet another President, Barack Obama .

Hillary Clinton's experience as a  Secretary of State should round out her formidable resume with which to launch another  presidential bid in 2012, should the the presidency of Barack Obama fail due mainly to the  shortcoming of his economic policy .
