A person taking antidepressants, or having a history of treated depression is generally disqualified for any form of FAA Medical Certificate. That means that someone on Zoloft can’t even fly a Cessna-172.
Now this woman wants to command the most powerful air force in the world, and all its nuclear-capable bombers.
She never ceases to amaze me.

The book says Clinton's "emotional state" was "as fragile as it had ever been" in late 1994 after her close friend Vince Foster had committed suicide
I wonder how often she has nightmares telling her thugs to either make the hit or cover it up.
Oh' never mind you need a soul to have nightmares...................

I’m sure Darth Vader had his down days too... They both had the blood of children on their hands.

Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner to become the next American president
This is where the Democrat Media storyline has been leading. Wondered how long it would take before they would implement it.

No, you’re misreading, sorta. Late 1994, when Bernstein claims she was depressed, is unarguably after July 1993.

I believe that this is undeniably a large hole in Hillary’s inevitability balloon. And from Carl Bernstein.
