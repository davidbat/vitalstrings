Clinton recalled the ’80s with boxy, double-breasted suits and experimented with thick headbands, short-sleeved suit jackets and unusual mixes of color.
She might have been a woman in a man’s world but sometimes she stood out for the wrong reasons.
Plus, who can forget Clinton’s many, many hairstyles?
What did you think of Hillary Clinton’s style?
