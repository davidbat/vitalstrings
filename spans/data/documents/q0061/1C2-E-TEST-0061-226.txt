HILLARY CLINTON'S RIGHTWING RECORD ON INTERNATIONAL           LAW
STEPHEN ZUNES, FOREIGN           POLICY IN FOCUS - Senator Hillary Clinton has opposed restrictions           on U.S. arms transfers and police training to governments that           engage in gross and systematic human rights abuses. Indeed, she           has supported unconditional U.S. arms transfers and police training           to such repressive and autocratic governments as Egypt, Morocco,           Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, Equatorial Guinea, Azerbaijan,           Cameroon, Kazakhstan, and Chad, just to name a few. She has also           refused to join many of her Democratic colleagues in signing           a letter endorsing a treaty that would limit arms transfers to           countries that engage in a consistent pattern of gross and systematic           human rights violations.
Civilian Casualties
Not only is she willing           to support military assistance to repressive regimes, she has           little concern about controlling weapons that primarily target           innocent civilians. Senator Clinton has refused to support the           international treaty to ban land mines, which are responsible           for killing and maiming thousands of civilians worldwide, a disproportionate percentage of whom have been children.
She was also among a minority           of Democratic Senators to side with the Republican majority last           year in voting down a Democratic-sponsored resolution restricting           U.S. exports of cluster bombs to countries that use them against           civilian-populated areas. Each of these cluster bomb contains           hundreds of bomblets that are scattered over an area the size           of up to four football fields and, with a failure rate of up           to 30%, become de facto land mines. As many as 98% of the casualties           caused by these weapons are civilians.
Senator Clinton also has           a record of dismissing reports by human rights monitors that           highlight large-scale attacks against civilians by allied governments.           For example, in the face of widespread criticism by reputable           human rights organizations over Israel's systematic assaults           against civilian targets in its April 2002 offensive in the West           Bank, Senator Clinton co-sponsored a resolution defending the           Israeli actions that claimed that they were "necessary steps           to provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist           infrastructure in the Palestinian areas." She opposed UN           efforts to investigate alleged war crimes by Israeli occupation           forces and criticized President Bush for calling on Israel to           pull back from its violent re-conquest of Palestinian cities           in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
Similarly, when Amnesty           International, Human Rights Watch and other reputable human rights           groups issued detailed reports regarding Israeli war crimes during           that country's assault on Lebanon in the summer of 2006, Senator           Clinton insisted they were wrong and that Israel's attacks were           legal. Furthermore, though these groups had also criticized the           radical Lebanese group Hezbollah for committing war crimes by           firing rockets into civilian-populated areas in Israel, exhaustive           investigations have revealed absolutely no evidence that they           had used the civilian population as "human shields" to protect themselves from Israeli assaults. Despite this, Senator           Clinton, without providing any credible evidence to the contrary,           still insists that they in fact had used human shields and were           therefore responsible for the death of more than 800 Lebanese           civilians.
Senator Clinton has voted           to send tens of billions of dollars unconditionally to Baghdad           to prop up that regime, apparently unconcerned about the well-documented           reports of death squads being run from the Interior Ministry           that have killed many thousands of unarmed Sunni men.
In Senator Clinton's world           view, if a country is considered an important strategic ally           of the United States, any charges of human rights abuses  no matter how strong the evidence  must be summarily dismissed.           Indeed, despite the Israeli government's widespread and well-documented           violations of international humanitarian law, Senator Clinton           has praised Israel for its "values that respect the dignity           and rights of human beings."
IT'S COST THE TAXPAYERS $2.3 BILLION TO KEEP HILLARY           IN THE SENATE
LA TIMES - To fuel her rise, Clinton has           relied on the controversial funding device known as "earmarking." The earmarks enabled her to win favor with important constituents,           many of whom provided financial support for her campaigns. .           . Since taking office in 2001, Clinton has delivered $500 million           worth of earmarks that have specifically benefited 59 corporations.           About 64% of those corporations provided funds to her campaigns           through donations made by employees, executives, board members           or lobbyists, a review by the Los Angeles Times shows.
All told, Clinton has earmarked more than           $2.3 billion in federal appropriations for projects in her state           since her election to the Senate, much of it for public works           projects funded in conjunction with fellow Democratic Sen. Charles           E. Schumer and others in the New York congressional delegation.
CATALOG OF HILLARY CLINTON'S LIES
STUART TAYLOR JR, NATIONAL JOURNAL - Let's           take a trip down memory lane -- from the tawdriness of the 1992           presidential campaign through the mendacity of the ensuing years           -- to revisit a sampling of why so many of us came to think that           Hillary's first instinct when in an embarrassing spot is to lie.
Gennifer and Monica: Former lounge singer           Gennifer Flowers surfaced in early 1992 with claims -- corroborated           by tapes of phone calls -- that she had had a long affair with           then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who had arranged a state job           for her. Bill Clinton told the media, falsely, that the woman's "story is untrue."
Although well aware of her husband's philandering           history, Hillary backed his squishy denials, famously asserting           on "60 Minutes" that she was not "some little           woman standing by her man like Tammy Wynette." More deceptively,           she suggested to ABC's Sam Donaldson that Bill's contacts with           Flowers were just an example of how he loved to "help people           who are in trouble" and "listen to their problems."
"Hillary's words uncannily foreshadowed           her insistence six years later to ... a White House aide that           Bill had 'ministered' to [Monica] Lewinsky because she was a           troubled young woman," Sally Bedell Smith writes in her           fine new book about the Clintons, For Love of Politics. Hillary           has continued to insist that she believed what she said about           Lewinsky. But friends and former aides have told Smith and others           that she knew her husband was lying all along.
Travelgate: The first Clinton scandal after           Bill became president started in May 1993, when Chief of Staff           Mack McLarty fired the seven employees in the White House office           that arranges travel for the press corps. The White House cited           gross financial mismanagement. (The charge was never substantiated.)           The sudden firings created a media uproar, especially when the           dismissed employees were quickly replaced by friends and relatives           of the Clintons.
Hillary later told the General Accounting           Office, in a document prepared by her attorney, that she had           no role in the decision to fire the employees, did not know the "origin of the decision," and "did not direct           that any action be taken by anyone" other than keeping her informed.
But her statements were contradicted by           evidence, including a long-concealed memo to McLarty and a written           chronology prepared by White House aide David Watkins that came           to light years later. Hillary, Watkins wrote, had said that "we           need those people out and we need our people in" and had           made it clear that "there would be hell to pay" unless           she got "immediate action." Another aide wrote that           Hillary intimate Susan Thomases had said, "Hillary wants           these people fired."
While saying that no provable crime had           been committed, Robert Ray, who had succeeded Kenneth Starr as           independent counsel, reported in October 2000 that Hillary's           statements had been "factually false" and that there           was "overwhelming evidence that she in fact did have a role           in the decision to fire the employees."
Cattle futures: The New York Times revealed           in March 1994 that in 1978, just before her husband became governor,           Hillary had made a $100,000 profit on a $1,000 investment in           highly speculative cattle-futures contracts in only nine months.           Hillary's first explanation (through aides) of this extraordinary           windfall was that she had made the investment after "reading           The Wall Street Journal" and placed all the trades herself           after seeking advice from "numerous people." It was           so preposterous that she soon had to abandon it. Eventually,           she had to admit that longtime Clinton friend James Blair had           executed 30 of her 32 trades directly with an Arkansas broker.
In an April 1994 press conference, Hillary           denied knowing of "any favorable treatment" by Blair.           But the astronomical odds against any financial novice making           a 10,000 percent profit without the game being rigged led many           to believe that Blair, the outside counsel to Arkansas-based           poultry giant Tyson Foods, must have put only profitable trades           in Hillary's account and absorbed her losses. The heavily regulated           Tyson needed friends in high places, and Bill Clinton helped           it pass a 1983 state law raising weight limits on chicken trucks.
Removal of Vince Foster documents: During           the same press conference, Hillary was asked why her then-chief           of staff, Maggie Williams, had been involved in removing documents           from the office of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster after           his suicide. Foster had been a partner of Hillary's at the Rose           Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark. "I don't know that she did           remove any documents," Hillary said. But it was reported           three months later that Hillary had instructed Williams to remove           the Foster documents to the White House residence. Then they           were turned over to Clinton attorney Bob Barnett.
Castle Grande: In the summer of 1995, the           Resolution Trust Corp. reported that Hillary had been one of           11 Rose Law Firm lawyers who had done work in the mid-1980s on           an Arkansas real estate development, widely known as Castle Grande,           promoted by James McDougal and Seth Ward. McDougal headed a troubled           thrift, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, and had given Hillary           legal business as a favor to Bill. McDougal and his wife, Susan,           were the Clintons' partners in their Whitewater real estate investment.           Ward was father-in-law to Webb Hubbell, another former Rose Law Firm partner, who was briefly Clinton's associate attorney general           in 1993. Later, Hubbell went to prison for fraud, as did James           McDougal.
Castle Grande was a sewer of sham transactions,           some used to funnel cash into Madison Guaranty. Castle Grande's           ultimate collapse contributed to that of the thrift, which cost           taxpayers millions. Hillary told federal investigators that she           knew nothing about Castle Grande. When it turned out that more           than 30 of her 60 hours of legal work for Madison Guaranty involved           Castle Grande, she said she had known the project under a different           name. A 1996 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report said that           she had drafted documents that Castle Grande used to "deceive           federal bank examiners."
Prosecutors later came to believe that           Hillary had padded her bills; she "wasn't guilty of [knowingly]           facilitating nefarious transactions -- she was guilty of doing           less work than she took credit for," Jeff Gerth and Don           Van Natta Jr. explain in their 2007 biography, Her Way. Hillary           herself never took refuge in this explanation.
Billing records: Hillary's billing records           for Castle Grande were in a 116-page, 5-inch-thick computer printout           that came to light under mysterious circumstances on January           4, 1996 -- 19 months after Starr's investigators had subpoenaed           it and amid prosecutorial pressure on Clinton aides who had been           strikingly forgetful. For most of that time, Hillary claimed           that the billing records had vanished. But a longtime Hillary           assistant named Carolyn Huber later admitted coming across the           printout in August 1995 on a table in a storage area next to           Hillary's office; Huber said she had put it into a box in her           own office, without realizing for five more months that these           were the subpoenaed billing records.
This implausible tale, on top of other           deceptions, prompted New York Times columnist William Safire           to write on January 8, 1996, that "our first lady ... is           a congenital liar."
The next day, the White House press secretary           said that the president wanted to punch Safire in the nose for           insulting his wife. Five days later, the president invited Monica           Lewinsky to the Oval Office for what turned out to be one of           their 10 oral-sex sessions. Two years and 13 days after that,           Hillary was on the "Today" show suggesting that her           husband's Lewinsky affair was a lie concocted by "this vast           right-wing conspiracy."

HILLARY CLINTON claims she played               pickup basketball when she was young, presumably to get ready               for her race against Obama. Newsmax has compiled a list of other               little known facts about HRC, an obscurity some feel is due to               their non-existence:
- She was named after Sir Edmund               Hillary. who climbed Mount Everest.
- She was a Yankees fan when she               lived in Chicago.
- She told upstate New Yorkers she               had been a "duck hunter."
- She claimed on Sept. 11 daughter               Chelsea was jogging around the World Trade Center.
HRC AND WEBSTER HUBBELL
SUSAN SCHMIDT, WASH POST, 1998 - Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr yesterday           secured a new federal indictment of Webster L. Hubbell, alleging           that the former top Justice Department official lied to Congress           and federal banking regulators to conceal work that he, Hillary           Rodham Clinton and their law firm did in the mid-1980s for a           rogue savings and loan.
The 15-count indictment alleges that Hubbell           covered up the Rose Law Firm's involvement in a phony multimillion-dollar           land deal that caused losses big enough to bankrupt Madison Guaranty           S&L, the thrift owned by the late James B. McDougal, the           Clintons' Whitewater business partner. Hillary Clinton's legal           work for Madison in the mid-1980s is referred to throughout the           indictment but she is accused of no wrongdoing. . .
Hubbell pleaded guilty in 1994 to charges           lodged by the independent counsel that he bilked Rose Law Firm           clients and partners. . .
The independent counsel lodged no Whitewater           charges in his impeachment report to Congress on President Clinton           and closed down his Arkansas office months ago without bringing           charges against Hillary Clinton. The Hubbell indictment was issued           by a grand jury here. . .
While Hillary Clinton's name is not mentioned           in the indictment, her actions are described, albeit obliquely.           She is mentioned some 35 times throughout the indictment, but           only as Rose's "1985-86 billing partner" for the Madison           account. The document describes some of her work on Madison's           ill-fated Castle Grande project, an 1,100-acre industrial and           trailer park development south of Little Rock.
Some of the loans that the accountants           were blamed for allowing Madison to make were Castle Grande transactions           that Hillary Clinton and Hubbell worked on for his father-in-law,           Seth Ward. The indictment charges that Hubbell falsely told regulators           and Congress he did no work on Castle Grande matters and was           not aware of what work Rose did for Madison.
LYING FOR HILLARY
One of the issues that came up in           a lengthy suit (American Physicians and Surgeons, Inc, et al.           v. Hillary Rodham Clinton, et al.) was whether White House aide           Ira Magaziner, speaking on behalf of Hillary Clinton's health           task force, told the truth when he claimed that only federal           employees were members of the group. This was found to be false           and Judge Royce Lamberth issued an opinion, part of which follows:
"[I]t is clear that the decisions           here were made at the highest levels of government, and that           the government itself is--and should be--accountable when its           officials run amok. . . The court agrees with plaintiffs that           these were not reckless and inept errors taken by bewildered           counsel. The Executive Branch of the government, working in tandem,           was dishonest with this court. . . .
"The Department of Justice           has a long tradition of setting the highest standards of conduct           for all lawyers, and it is a sad day when this court must conclude,           as did the United States Attorney in his investigation, that           the Department of Justice succumbed to pressure from White House           attorneys and others to provide this court with "strained           interpretations" that were "ultimately unconvincing."
"It seems that some government           officials never learn that the cover-up can be worse than the           underlying conduct. Most shocking to this court, and deeply disappointing,           is that the Department of Justice would participate in such conduct.           This was not an issue of good faith word games being played with           the Court. . . . The United States Attorney found that the most           controversial sentence of the Magaziner declaration--"Only           federal government employees serve as members of the interdepartmental           working group"--could not be prosecuted under the perjury           statute because the issue of "membership" within the           working group was a fuzzy one, and no generally agreed upon "membership" criteria were ever written down. Therefore, the Magaziner declaration           was actually false because of the implication of the declaration           that "membership" was a meaningful concept and that           one could determine who was and was not a "member" of the working group. . . "
PROGRESSIVE REVIEW, 1997 - It was just symbolic and, in the end,           the money comes out of our pockets but at least one judge has           called the White House for lying, assessing a fine of over a           quarter of a million dollars. As the above excerpt from Judge           Lamberth's opinion indicates, this was no minor peccadillo but           rather, "The Executive Branch of the government, working           in tandem, was dishonest with this court." At issue was           the composition of Hillary Clinton's health task force, a body           stacked with those from the medical industry who would gain most           from the faux reforms of the Clintonistas.
You might think a federal judge           calling one of Mrs. Clinton's top aides a liar would be big news,           but the Washington Post found room on its front page for "Seniors           Strut Their Stuff in Pool Pageant" while burying the health           care story on page 21 under a boring headline. That was nine           pages better than the New York Times, which ran the story under "Judge Rules Government Covered Up Lies on Panel," hardly descriptive of the story's significance.
ATTORNEY CLINTON
During the 1992 campaign, Hillary Clinton           defended her role in the Madison Guarantee S&L scandal by           saying, "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies           and had teas. But what I decided to do was pursue my profession,           which I entered before my husband was in public life."
Forgotten, however, is what inspired this           homily: accusations that Ms. Clinton had represented Whitewater           business partner Jim McDougal's S&L before her husband's           government. Here's what the New York Times reported on March           17, 1992: "Hillary Clinton said today that she did not earn           'a penny' from state business conducted by her Little Rock law           firm and that she never intervened with state regulators on behalf           of a failed Arkansas savings and loan association. . . "
Records would show that she did, in fact,           represent Madison before the state securities department. After           the revelation, she says, "For goodness sakes, you can't           be a lawyer if you don't represent banks."
Susan McDougal recalled Ms. Clinton coming           in and drumming up the business. Ms. McDougal told the Washington           Post: "The problem was finances, her finances." The           Washington Times quoted an unnamed Clinton business associate           who claimed the governor used to "jog over to McDougal's           office about once a month to pick up the [retainer] check for           his wife."
Jim McDougal's version of the story, according           to the LA Times, was that Clinton asked him to throw some legal           work his wife's way to help the Clintons out of a financial crunch: "I hired Hillary because Bill came in whimpering that they           needed help."
Hillary Clinton wrote Jim McDougal enclosing           a power of attorney for him to sign "authorizing me to act           on your behalf with respect to matters concerning Whitewater           Development Corporation." Another power of attorney was           enclosed for Susan McDougal. The power of attorney included the           right to endorse, sign and execute "checks, notes, deeds,           agreements, certificates, receipts or any other instruments in           writing of all matters related to Whitewater Development Corporation."
This letter, uncovered in 1993 by Jerry           Seper of the Washington Times, directly contradicted the claim           of the Clintons that they were "passive shareholders" in Whitewater.
From a 1996 Chicago Tribune editorial: "The legal issues will sort themselves out in time. But           one thing has become all too clear. Bill and Hillary Clinton           and their aides have made a concerted effort to deceive official           investigators and the American public with half truths and outright           lies . . . It's not clear what the Clintons want to conceal,           but it's clear that they have made extraordinary efforts to do           so."
WHITEWATER
WHAT WHITEWATER WAS ALL ABOUT: Almost totally           lost in the Clinton saga known as Whitewater is what Whitewater           was originally all about. It was basically a land resort scam           of the sort that local TV stations win awards for exposing. Here's           how it happened:
In the late 1970s, the Clintons and McDougals           buy land in the Ozarks with mostly borrowed funds. The Clintons           get 50% interest with no cash down. The plot, known as Whitewater,           is fifty miles from the nearest grocery store. The Washington           Post will report later that some purchasers of lots, many of           them retirees, "put up houses or cabins, others slept in           vans or tents, hoping to be able to live off the land." HRC writes Jim McDougal, said that "If Reagonomics works           at all, Whitewater could become the Western Hemisphere's Mecca." More than half of the purchasers will lose their plots thanks           to the sleazy form of financing used.

HRC AND ETHNIC SLURS
Virtually no attention has been given to           Hillary's Clinton's reported anti-Jewish statements. This is           another example of the impenetrable media bubble placed around           HRC since her husband first ran for president.
There have been a few exceptions. For example,           in August 2000, the NY Post reported:
"The Arkansas man who accused Hillary           Rodham Clinton last month of uttering an anti-Semitic slur in           1974 has passed a lie-detector test arranged by The Post. Paul           Fray, who has charged Mrs. Clinton called him a "f- - -ing           Jew bastard" after Bill Clinton lost his race for Congress,           cleared the polygraph exam administered Sunday near his home           here. "There's no doubt in my mind that Mr. Fray is truthful," concluded state-licensed Arkansas polygrapher Jeff Hubanks, who           gave the three-hour test. . . The findings were reviewed yesterday           by another expert, Richard Keifer, a former head of the FBI's           polygraph unit who has 20 years of experience. Keifer judged           the results "inconclusive" because they didn't meet           the high federal polygraph standards - but said he found nothing           to indicate Fray was lying. Clinton campaign spokesman Howard           Wolfson said, "Paul Fray is an admitted liar, and we're           not going to be responding to his lies anymore."
That same year former Arkansas state trooper           Larry Patterson claimed that in their frequent arguments, Bill           and Hillary Clinton would use such expressions as "Jew motherf*cker," "Jew Boy" and "Jew Bastard."
That same year, the Review discussed the           issue of how the media handles these matters:
PROGRESSIVE REVIEW, 2000 - The kid gloves           treatment of Hillary Clinton's alleged ethnic slurs is, of course,           in marked contrast to the media handling of, say, John Rocker,           Louis Farrakhan or Jesse Jackson. But she is not the only one           who has been give a pass. A reader sends along a 1997 issue of           the Progressive with an article by Susan Douglas that includes           this:
"As ABC News reminded us over and           over, the lesson from Tiger Woods's victory is 'that anyone can           make it to the top.' Woods was immediately canonized by every           news outlet in the land as a breakthrough, trans-racial saint,           an agent of integration and goodwill. The newscasters genuflected.           Once again, the future of western civilization was freighted           onto the shoulders of the latest guy who can throw/hit/kick a           ball. The media pilloried pro-golfer Fuzzy Zoeller for making           racist remarks about fried chicken and collard greens. But they           have virtually ignored Woods's own racist, sexist, and homophobic           remarks.
"In the April issue of GQ, Woods speculated           that 'good-looking women hang around baseball and basketball'           because 'black guys have big dicks.' And he asks: Why do lesbians           always get to their destination so quickly? He answers: 'Because           lesbians are always going sixty-nine.' This doesn't fit into           the pack journalism "new-messiah" image, now does it?           So just let it slide."
But the current masters of applying multiple           standards to matters claimed to be worthy of zero tolerance may           well be the Blair government. Not only was Tony Blair's campaign           to end under-aged drinking in bars celebrated by his son turning           up dead drunk on a London sidewalk, but Home Secretary Jack Straw,           riding in a car driven by a special branch officer, was pulled           over for doing 103 mph on a motorway. The incident occurred at           8:55 am as Straw was rushing to a meeting with Blair, perhaps           to discuss new measures to make the British behave. Straw, hit           man for Blair's zero tolerance policies, also has a son who got           into trouble with the police after selling ten pounds (sterling)           of marijuana to an undercover reporter.
Whatever the facts of the matter, the accusation           in a new book that Hillary Clinton called one of her staffers           a "Jew bastard" in 1974 adds a significant new problem           to her already troubled effort. Clinton flatly denied the incident           ever happened and quoted her husband as saying, "I was there           on election night in 1974 and this charge is simply not true."
The campaign also produced a 1997 handwritten           letter from the man allegedly excoriated, Paul Fray, to Hillary           Clinton in which he says, "I have wronged you. I ask for           your forgiveness because I did say things against you, and called           you names, not only to your face -- but behind your back . .           . names that are unmentionable." The circumstances under           which Fray allegedly wrote the letter are not clear but the document           is reminiscent of the affidavits signed by various women denying           being sexually involved with Clinton's husband. The Clintons           have the largest collection of affidavits and letters attesting           to alleged non-events to be found in contemporary politics.
Fray's comments, quoted in Jerry Oppenheimer's           new book, "State of a Union," have been verified not           only by his wife but by another Clinton aide at the time, Neill           McDonald.
According to Michael Kramer in the NY Daily           News:
"The slur allegedly was uttered at           a heated, finger-pointing session at Bill Clinton's Fayetteville,           Ark., campaign headquarters on election night in 1974, following           his defeat in his first try for political office, a run for Congress           in Arkansas' 3rd Congressional District. In the room that night           were Bill Clinton; his then-girlfriend, Hillary Rodham; Paul           Fray, Clinton's campaign manager, and Fray's wife, Mary Lee.           Another campaign worker, Neill McDonald, was just outside the           door and says he heard everything. The story of that encounter           has been widely reported before, but without any charge that           Hillary Rodham ripped into Paul Fray using an anti-Semitic slur.           In interviews with The News on Friday and Saturday, the Frays           and McDonald all confirmed that Hillary uttered the slur. McDonald           said Hillary was speaking in the "heat of battle" and           that he doesn't believe she is an anti-Semite. McDonald added           that he is and has always been a supporter of the Clintons.".           . .
Dick Morris has joined the fracas, repeating           his previous claims that on one occasion HR Clinton said to him, "Money, that's all you people care about is money." Morris says he responded, "By money, Hillary, by you people,           I assume you mean political consultants?" And she said,           'Oh yes, of course that's what I mean.' But it wasn't what I           thought she meant."
The president had risen to HR Clinton's           defense but his credentials are more than a little suspect ever           since the tapes of his conversations with Gennifer Flowers, which           included this Flowers comment on Mario Cuomo: "Well, he           seems like he could get real mean . . . I wouldn't be surprised           if he didn't have some mafioso major connections." And Clinton           replies, "Well, he acts like one."
And then there's that police sting video           of Roger Clinton saying he has to get some cocaine for his brother           who has a nose like a vacumn cleaner, in which Roger makes free           use of the word nigger, a term trooper Patterson says he also           heard from WJ Clinton when talking about Jesse Jackson and prominent           Little Rock black figure, Robert 'Say' McIntosh.
CATTLE FUTURES
TWO MONTHS after commencing the Whitewater           scheme, Hillary Clinton invested $1,000 in cattle futures. Within           a few days she has a $5,000 profit. Before bailing out she earns           nearly $100,000 on her investment. Many years later, several           economists will calculate that the chances of earning such returns           legally were one in 250 million.
AGBIZ TILLER - Mrs.           Clinton's ability to turn $1000 into a near $100,000 in ten months           of futures trading, a congressional study would learn, coincided           with a period of time that a select group of executives from           packing houses, grain companies, feedlot operators and commodity           brokers reaped tens of millions of dollars in an "insider" trading scheme in the cattle futures market. . . Between February,           1978 and April, 1979 some 32 cattle industry insiders made profits           of $110 million by selling cattle futures after they received           some 15 "secret signals," which was followed within           an average two and one half day period, by a marked drop in cattle           future prices. Then Rep. Neal Smith (Dem.-Iowa), chairman of           the House Small Business Committee, which released the report           in February, 1981 noted that in all a total of some 1027 individuals           made total net profits of approximately $156 million. Thus, three           percent of the large traders --- those with 50 contracts or more           --- with correlated trading activity and/or common business affiliations           accounted for 70% of the total net profits of this group of traders.           Mrs. Clinton traded 50 or more contracts three times . . .
A previous USDA study in 1979, for example,           pointed out that during 20 of the 21 months preceding October,           1979 there was not a single day in which a farmer-feeder could           have used the futures market to hedge in a profit and only five           days in the remaining month that the farmer-feeder could have           broken even . . . Meanwhile, the eight largest packers, who at           the time were slaughtering 44% of the nation's beef, held over           one-half of the futures contracts and made twice as much money           in the futures market as they did in trading cattle . . . In           all, between February, 1978 and December, 1980, some 29 "secret           signals" were given although Smith's Committee staff made           no estimates on the profits earned after April, 1979 . . . There           are estimates that 75% to 95% of individual investors lose money           in commodity futures markets.
WASHINGTON TIMES, 2007 - Mrs. Clinton initially           explained her success by claiming to have done all her own research           studying the Wall Street Journal. Then she admitted that Jim           Blair, the outside counsel for Tyson Foods, advised her and placed           most of her trades. Mr. Blair helped her open her trading account           in mid-October 1978. That was three weeks before her husband           rode to certain victory (63 percent of the vote) in his race           for Arkansas governor, a position from which he would enforce           the state's environmental policies affecting chicken waste and           appoint numerous regulatory officials overseeing Tyson. The odds           of a retail trader executing the intraday transactions that generated           a 530 percent overnight return, which Mrs. Clinton achieved on           her first day, "are about the same as [the odds] of finding           the Dead Sea Scrolls on the steps of the State House in Little           Rock," according to estimates by Wall Street Journal financial           columnist Caroline Baum and commodities speculator Victor Niederhoffer           in their devastating account of Mrs. Clinton's trading activity.
HRC AND WAL-MART
WARD HARKAVY, VILLAGE VOICE 2000 - Twice in three days last week, Hillary Rodham           Clinton basked in the adulation of cheering union . . . They           would have dropped their forks if they had heard that Hillary           served for six years on the board of the dreaded Wal-Mart, a           union-busting behemoth. If they had learned the details of her           friendship with Wal-Mart, they might have lost their lunches.           . .
As she was leaving the dais, she ignored a reporter's question           about Wal-Mart, and she ignored it again when she strode by reporters           in the hotel lobby.
But there are questions. In 1986, when           Hillary was first lady of Arkansas, she was put on the board           of Wal-Mart. Officials at the time said she wasn't filling a           vacancy. In May 1992, as Hubby's presidential campaign heated           up, she resigned from the board of Wal-Mart. Company officials           said at the time that they weren't going to fill her vacancy.
So what the hell was she doing on the Wal-Mart board? According           to press accounts at the time, she was a show horse at the company's           annual meetings when founder Sam Walton bused in cheering throngs           to celebrate his non-union empire, which is headquartered in           Arkansas, one of the country's poorest states. According to published           reports, she was placed in charge of the company's "green" program to protect the environment.
But nobody got greener than Sam Walton and his family. For several           years in the '80s, he was judged the richest man in America by           Forbes magazine; his fortune zoomed into the billions until he           split it up among relatives. It's no surprise that Hillary is           a strong supporter of free trade with China. Wal-Mart, despite           its "Buy American" advertising campaign, is the single           largest U.S. importer, and half of its imports come from China.
Was Hillary the voice of conscience on the board for American           and foreign workers? Contemporary accounts make no mention of           that. They do describe her as a "corporate litigator" in those days, and they mention, speaking of environmental matters,           that she also served on the board of Lafarge, a company that,           according to a press account, once burned hazardous fuels to           run its cement plants. . .
And the Clintons depended on Wal-Mart's largesse not only for           Hillary's regular payments as a board member but for travel expenses           on Wal-Mart planes and for heavy campaign contributions to Bill's           campaigns there and nationally. . .
MOTHER JONES, 2003 - More than two-thirds of all Wal-Mart employees           are women -- yet women make up less than 10 percent of top store           managers. Back when she was first lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton           became the first woman appointed to the Wal-Mart board, and tried           to get the company to hire more women managers, but that effort           apparently went the way of national health insurance. Wal-Mart           today has the same percentage of women in management that the           average company had in 1975.
LISA FEATHERSTONE, NATION, 2005 - Unlike so many horrible things,           Wal-Mart cannot be blamed on George W. Bush. The Arkansas-based           company prospered under the state's native son Bill Clinton when           he was governor and President. Sam Walton and his wife, Helen,           were close to the Clintons, and for several years Hillary Clinton,           whose law firm represented Wal-Mart, served on the company's           board of directors. Bill Clinton's "welfare reform" has provided Wal-Mart with a ready workforce of women who have           no choice but to accept its poverty wages and discriminatory           policies.
FLAG BURNING
ST PETERSBURG TIMES EDITORIAL, 2005 - Sen. Hillary Clinton's decision to co-sponsor           a bill to make it a crime to burn the American flag amounts to           political pandering of the worst kind. She was against outlawing           flag-burning before she was for it.
The New York Democrat says she opposes           a constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning but has signed           on to a bill that would ostensibly accomplish the same thing           by federal statute. Her position is unprincipled. Clinton may           think this is a middle-ground position with broad political appeal,           but most people will see it for what it is. . .
JOHNNY CHUNG
CNN, MARCH 1998 - Democratic fund-raiser           Johnny Chung has agreed to plead guilty to election law violations           and cooperate in the ongoing Justice Department investigation           into illegal campaign fund-raising in the 1996 elections. . .           Chung became a major figure in the Democratic fund-raising scandal           when it was learned he made almost 50 visits to the White House.           During one visit, Chung gave first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's           then-chief of staff, Maggie Williams, a $50,000 check for the           Democratic National Committee. The check was delivered inside           the White House. Two days later Chung was able to bring a group           of Chinese businessmen to watch President Bill Clinton deliver           a radio address in the Oval Office. They then had their picture           taken with the president. The DNC returned more than $300,000           that Chung raised because of questions about the source of the           money.

MANA FROM HAVANA
NY POST, 2000 - Hillary Rodham Clinton's           Senate campaign returned $22,000 in "soft money" to           a businesswoman linked to a Democratic campaign contribution           from a drug smuggler in Havana. The donation by Vivian Mannerud           Verble, first reported by The Post, was the largest single contribution           received by Clinton's soft-money committee. Verble, whose company           runs charter flights between Cuba and Miami, also served as the           fund-raising intermediary between Jorge Cabrera and the Democratic           National Committee in 1995, according to congressional investigators.           The probers reportedly learned that Cabrera cut a $20,000 check           to the DNC from a bank account in which he also kept profits           from his lucrative cocaine trade. The DNC eventually returned           the money, while Cabrera pleaded guilty to importing 6,000 pounds           of cocaine into the United States. He is serving a 19-year federal           prison sentence in Florida . . . Although Verble was never charged           with any criminal wrongdoing, she was at the center of one of           the most embarrassing fund-raising scandals in the Clinton administration..
ANOTHER LAND DEAL
JERRY SEPER, WASHINGTON TIMES, 2000 - The           Arkansas Supreme Court, which is considering disbarment proceedings           against President Clinton, yesterday said it also is investigating           whether first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton engaged in fraud in           a questionable Whitewater-related land deal. The probe, confirmed           by the court's Committee of Professional Conduct, has focused           on accusations about Mrs. Clinton's legal representation of a           failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association real estate           venture, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. called a "sham." A major area of concern is an option agreement that facilitated           a $300,000 payment to Seth Ward, father-in-law of Mrs. Clinton's law partner, Webster L. Hubbell. The option, written by Mrs.           Clinton and Mr. Hubbell while they were at Little Rock's Rose           Law Firm, guaranteed Mr. Ward a payoff and negated his liability           in the project.
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SOME TORTURE ACCEPTABLE
BEN SMITH, NY DAILY NEWS -           Despite her apparent opposition to torture, Hillary Clinton said           in a Daily News editorial board meeting yesterday that the practice           is acceptable in some circumstances. .
At yesterday's Daily News editorial board           meeting, it emerged that she's not actually against torture in           all instances, and that her dispute with McCain and Bush is largely           procedural.
She was asked about the "ticking time           bomb" scenario, in which you've captured the terrorist and           don't have time for a normal interrogation, and said that there           is a place for what she called "severity," in a conversation           that included mentioning water-boarding, hypothermia, and other           techniques commonly described as torture.
"I have said that those are very rare           but if they occur there has to be some lawful authority for pursuing           that," she responded. "Again, I think the President           has to take responsibility. There has to be some check and balance,           some reporting. I don't mind if it's reporting in a top secret           context. But that shouldn't be the tail that wags the dog, that           should be the exception to the rule."
TO INDICT OR NOT TO INDICT
ON APRIL 27, 1998,           deputy independent counsel Hickman Ewing met with his prosecutors           to decide on whether to indict Hillary Clinton. Here's what happened           as reported by Sue Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf in their book, "Truth at Any Cost:"
"[Ewing] paced the room for more than           three hours, recalling facts from memory in his distinctive Memphis           twang. He spoke passionately, laying out a case that the first           lady had obstructed government investigators and made false statements           about her legal work for McDougal's S & L, particularly the           thrift's notorious multimillion-dollar Castle Grande real estate           project. . .The biggest problem was the death a month earlier           of Jim McDougal. . . Without him, prosecutors would have a hard           time describing the S & L dealings they suspected Hillary           Clinton had lied about."
CNN, MAR 18, 1999 -           Deputy independent counsel Hickman Ewing testified at the Susan           McDougal trial Thursday that he had written a "rough draft           indictment" of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton after he           doubted her truthfulness in a deposition. Ewing, who questioned           Mrs. Clinton in a deposition at the White House on April 22,           1995, said, "I had questions about whether what she was           saying were accurate. We had no records. She was in conflict           with a number of interviews."
Ewing said those interviews by investigators           were primarily with other people in the Rose Law Firm. Ewing said he had questioned Mrs. Clinton about her representation           of Jim McDougal's Madison Guarantee Savings & Loan when she           was at the Rose Law firm in Little Rock. "I don't know if           she was telling the truth. I did not circulate the draft. I showed           it to one lawyer (in the independent counsel's office) who said           he didn't want to see it," Ewing said, under questioning           from McDougal attorney Mark Geragos. . .
Ewing also testified that in a later deposition           with both the president and first lady on July 22, 1995, he had           questions about the truthfulness of both Clintons. McDougal's           attorney Mark Geragos asked Ewing: "Did you say the Clintons           were liars?" "I don't know if I used the 'L-word' but           I expressed internally that I was concerned," Ewing said.
LINCOLN BEDROOM
FOX NEWS, 2000 - Hillary Rodham Clinton           denied allegations that she or her fund-raisers offered overnight           stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and Camp David to supporters of           her Senate campaign. "We have friends and supporters come           and spend time with us and spend the night with us that we are           getting to know and who like spending time with us," Clinton           said when questioned at a campaign stop at a western New York           diner. "I don't see what's news about that." . . .           White House staffers said that since the summer of 1999 there           have been at least 26 instances in which people, mainly couples,           were overnight guests after donating to the first lady's campaign           or promising to do so. . . "The Lincoln Bedroom was never           sold," Clinton said in 1997, when the White House released           a list of 938 guests who had spent the night at the executive           mansion up to that point in the Clinton presidency. The list           included the names of political supporters, as well as entertainment           luminaries and old Clinton friends
CASTLE GRANDE
1999 Mrs. Clinton is mentioned 36 times           in the fraud indictment against Webster Hubbell. Writes the AP's           Peter Yost: "Starr alleges Hubbell concealed his own and           Mrs. Clinton's work during the 1980s on a failed Arkansas land           deal, known as Castle Grande, that federal regulators say was           riddled with 'insider dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'" Yost notes the criminal contempt trial of Susan McDougal: "The           indictment against Mrs. McDougal details a series of grand jury           questions about Mrs. Clinton and Castle Grande that Mrs. McDougal           refused to answer." The Castle Grande project involved a           baroque set of deals aimed at least in part in shoring up the           McDougal's failing savings and loan.
Not until the immaculate reconception of           Mrs. Clinton's billing records in 1996 did her extensive role           in the matter come to light. Billing records documenting HRC's           work on the Castle Grande development scam were discovered in           the family quarters of the White House. HRC said she has no idea           how they got there.
She also claimed that she could not remember           her work on the project nor 15 conversations with Hubbell's wheeler-dealer           father-in-law, Seth Ward. In the end, Castle Grande cost the           S&L nearly $4 million in unpaid principal and interest.
THE TRAVEL OFFICE CASE
1993 - HILLARY CLINTON and David Watkins           move to oust the White House travel office in favor of World           Wide Travel, Clinton's source of $1 million in fly-now-pay-later           campaign trips that essentially financed the last stages of the           campaign without the bother of reporting a de facto contribution.           The White House fires seven long-term employees for alleged mismanagement           and kickbacks. The director, Billy Dale, charged with embezzlement,           will be acquitted in less than two hours by the jury. An FBI           agent involved in the case, IC Smith, will write later, "The           White House Travel Office matter sent a clear message to the           Congress as well as independent counsels that this White House           would be different. Lying, withholding evidence, and considering           - even expecting - underlings to be expendable so the Clintons           could avoid accountability for their actins would become the           norm."
CNN OCT 18 2000 - Independent Counsel Robert           Ray's final report on the White House travel office case found           first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's testimony in the matter was "factually false," but concluded there were no grounds           to prosecute her. The special prosecutor determined the first           lady did play a role in the 1993 dismissal of the travel office's           staff, contrary to her testimony in the matter. But Ray said           he would not prosecute Clinton for those false statements because "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable           doubt" that she knew her statements were false or understood           that they may have prompted the firings. . . The final report           concludes that "despite that falsity, no prosecution of           Mrs. Clinton is warranted."
TPR, 2000 - Here is what Ray said, which           we were only able to find buried in the NY Times and not at all           in the Washington Post (which played the story on A6): "It           is, in the independent counsel's judgment beyond peradventure,           that as a matter of historical fact, Mrs. Clinton's input into           the process was a significant - if not the significant - factor           influencing the pace of events in the travel office firings and           the ultimate decision to fire the employees. Accordingly, the           independent counsel concludes that Mr. Clinton's sworn testimony           that she had no input into Watkins's decision or role in the           travel office firings is factually inaccurate." In other           words, she lied.
Robert Ray, the prosecutor           may not be able to say this, but we, as citizens, can. Just as           we can say with enough certainty for electoral purposes that           she lied about Whitewater, her legal activities in Arkansas,           her investment in cattle futures, her missing file boxes, and           her activities in the wake of Vince Foster's death. We may be           wrong about any or all of these, but if so it is only because           Mrs. Clinton herself has deliberately, cynically, and deceitfully           attempted to conceal matters from us. We may be wrong, but we           are entitled to make the judgment.
It is worth recalling that           Mrs. Clinton was mentioned 36 times in the fraud indictment against           Webster Hubbell. She also said "I don't recall" or           its equivalent 50 times in a statement to a House investigating           committee that was only 42 paragraphs long.
Mrs. Clinton's victim, Bill Dale, put it           this way: "Everyone, especially Robert Ray, knows Hillary           Clinton lied under oath about her key role in firing me and my           colleagues . . . Of course, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted           me with no evidence of any wrongdoing on my part. Despite my           38 years of government service, Bill and Hillary Clinton tried           to destroy my good name. They put my wife and me through pure           hell."
Number of times Hillary Clinton               said "I don't recall" or its equivalent in a statement               to a House investigating committee: 50. Number of paragraphs               in this statement: 42
IT TAKES MORE THAN A VILLAGE           TO GET CREDIT FROM CLINTON
Things that happened to Barbara           Feinman after becoming ghostwriter for "It Takes a Village," Hillary Clinton's book-like substance:
-- She got no acknowledgement           in the book by HR Clinton, contrary to what was stipulated in           the contract.
-- A reporter asked her how much           she had written and she replied, "All I can say is they           didn't pay me $120,000 to spell-check it."
-- The White House spread rumors           that Feinman had been fired.
-- Simon & Schuster refused           to pay the last $30,000 of her fee. Asked why, Feinman was told           that the White House didn't want her paid.

 From a 1996 Chicago Tribune editorial: "The legal issues will sort themselves out in time. But               one thing has become all too clear. Bill and Hillary Clinton               and their aides have made a concerted effort to deceive official               investigators and the American public with half truths and outright               lies . . . It's not clear what the Clintons want to conceal,               but it's clear that they have made extraordinary efforts to do               so."
WIKIPEDIA - Clinton's acknowledgment section began: "It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone           who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete           this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous           that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually,           for fear that I might leave one out." .
THE PETER           PAUL FUNDRAISER
Three days after telling the Washington           Post that Peter Paul made no contribution to her August 12, 2000           gala and that her campaign would not accept contributions from           him, Hillary sent this letter
[The story that follows           has many loose ends, but one thing is certain, and eerily typical           of the Clinton saga: the extraordinary number of criminals, con           artists and other low life the Clintons have had as friends,           employees, business partners, and supporters. This story involves           just one fundraising event yet the cast of Clinton connected           criminals include Peter Paul, Aaron Tonkin, Jim Levin, and Raymond           Reggie. Add the McDougals, Web Hubbell, Dan Lasater, Jorge Cabrera,           and the more than 40 other convicted individuals and companies           connected to the Clinton machine and you have to start wondering           when the Democrats discover this may not be the best they can           do.]
IN AUGUST 2000 Hillary Clinton held a huge Hollywood           fundraiser for her Senate campaign. It was very successful. The           only problem was that, by a long shot, she didn't report all           the money contributed: $800K by the US government's ultimate           count in a settlement and $2 million according to the key contributor           and convicted con Peter Paul. This is, in election law, the moral           equivalent of not reporting a similar amount on your income tax.           It is a form of fraud. Hillary Clinton's defense is that she           didn't know about it. That has so far worked in court but whether           it will meet similar approbation in 2008 among the media, opponents           and the general public remains to be seen. To some it is what           some lawyers call the ostrich defense: I had my head in the sand           while everything was going on or, yes, I signed the letter but           I never actually read it.
It's not working too well in the Enron           case. Reports Carrie Johnson of the Washington Post, "Former           Enron Corp. executives Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay           say they held their heads high when they led the energy company.           But jurors will be allowed to consider whether they intentionally           buried their heads in the sand to avoid blame for fraud.
U.S. District Judge Simeon T. Lake III           this week granted the government's bid for a controversial jury           instruction known as 'deliberate indifference' or 'willful blindness.'           The language allows jurors to consider whether Skilling and Lay           averted their eyes from fraud within Enron's ranks to deny responsibility           for it later. . .Defense lawyers argue that the jury charge,           also known as an ostrich instruction, will prejudice their clients           and improperly lower the government's burden of proof to a 'should           have known' standard common in civil cases where financial damages           -- not prison time -- is at stake."
Whether Hillary Clinton engaged in 'deliberate           indifference' or 'willful blindness' remains to be determined           by the voters but you can almost guarantee it will become a matter           of interest to them.
The initial reaction was reported by Lloyd           Grove of the Washington Post on August 15 2000: "Is Hillary           Clinton soft on crime? We certainly hope not, even though convicted           felon Peter Paul--who served three years in prison two decades           ago after pleading guilty to cocaine possession and trying to           swindle $8.7 million out of the Cuban government-- helped organize           Saturday's star-glutted $1 million fundraising gala for Clinton's           Senate race at businessman Ken Roberts's Brentwood estate. .           . [Paul] added that he only produced the gala and hasn't given           or raised money for the first lady's New York campaign. "And           we will not be accepting any contributions from him," Clinton           campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson vowed.
Later, Paul would change his story claiming           that his involveme
nt stemmed from           his desire to hire ex-president Bill Clinton, a deal he claimed           became contingent on his not only producing but funding the HRC           gala, costing him $2 million in kind and in cash. The Clinton           campaign would also have to change its story: by September, Paul's           Stan Lee Media had contributed $100,000 to HRC's campaign despite           Wolfson's protest. According to Salon, "Bill Clinton was           reportedly promised an additional $15 million in Stan Lee stock           to join the board. . . Paul also says then-DNC Chairman Ed Rendell           said it would be 'nice' if Paul gave $150,000 to the DNC after           Paul sought a presidential pardon for his two prior convictions."
The man with whom Clinton was allegedly           going into business had a known criminal past. According to Worldnet           Daily, "Paul has pleaded guilty to a 10(b)5 violation of           the Securities and Exchange Commission for not publicly disclosing           control of Merrill Lynch margin accounts that held stocks in           his company, Stan Lee Media. . . Under the Carter administration,           he was convicted for cocaine possession and an attempt to confiscate           more than $8 million from Fidel Castro in a black market coffee           transaction the Cuban dictator was using to defraud the Soviet           Union."
The Washington Post reported that "In           1983, Paul violated parole by traveling to Canada under a false           identity and ended up pleading guilty in federal court to making           false statements to customs inspectors. Paul went to prison in           California. When paroled, he stayed in California."
The Post also noted that, "In 1998,           Paul co-founded Stan Lee Media, a Hollywood-based Internet animation           studio. The company was named for Paul's business partner, Stan           Lee, creator of Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk. Almost from           the start, prosecutors alleged, Paul and a few co-conspirators           manipulated the market for the stock of Stan Lee Media: They           artificially inflated the stock to a peak value of $350 million,           creating a false appearance of demand by making transactions           through and between accounts that Paul controlled but maintained           in the names of others. Paul and his co-conspirators misused           the brokerage account to borrow more than $4 million from Merrill           Lynch, money prosecutors say they used to buy real estate, travel           and make political contributions. Stan Lee was never implicated           in the scheme."
After the indictment and the collapse of           his firm Paul filed suit arguing that Hillary Clinton had never           properly reported his $2 million contribution to the campaign.           The suit was thrown out because Paul had become a fugitive under           arrest in Brazil. On his return, however the suit was refiled.
A Clinton fundraiser, David Rosen, was           acquitted of three counts of election fraud but last December           his superior, Andrew Grossman, admitted responsibility for three           false FEC reports for which the campaign paid a fine of only           $35,000.
There is one other thing, as Worldnet Daily           reports: "Bill and Hillary Clinton head an all-star cast           of witnesses in a lawsuit by business mogul Peter Franklin Paul           that alleges the former president reneged on a $17 million deal           in which he promised to promote a business in exchange for massive           contributions to his wife's Senate campaign.
"The potential witness list includes           celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Brad Pitt, Barbra Streisand,           James Brolin, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg, George Hamilton, Olivia           Newton John, John Travolta, Diana Ross, Shirley McLaine, Michael           Bolton, Toni Braxton, Paul Anka and Larry King.
"Also on the list are former Vice           President Al Gore, the Clinton's daughter Chelsea Clinton, former           Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security chief Michael           Chertoff, former California Gov. Gray Davis, former Democratic           National Committee Chairman Terrence McAuliffe, CBS News reporter           Mike Wallace and ABC News reporter Brian Ross.
"Paul told WND these people, and many           others, have direct knowledge of the alleged frauds. He says           he explained, for example, in person to actors Pitt and Travolta           that his personal contribution of some $2 million for a Hollywood           gala and fund-raiser for Sen. Clinton's Senate campaign in 2000           was done in exchange for Bill Clinton promoting Paul's Internet           business, Stan Lee Media, after leaving office.
"Clinton was promised an additional           $15 million in stock to join the board of the company, which           Paul formed in partnership with famed Marvel Comics creator Stan           Lee.". . . On April 7, a judge in Los Angeles dismissed           Sen. Clinton as a defendant in the civil lawsuit, but she will           be deposed as a material witness in preparation for a trial set           for March, 27, 2007."
The story - and not just the characters           behind it - is a remarkable one, making all the more incredible           the failure of the establishment media to report it in more than           a perfunctory manner. Two excerpts from a sworn statement of           Paul give the flavor:
- "While attending the August 13,           2000, brunch at Barbra Streisand's house, Chelsea Clinton came           up and spent approximately 25 minutes with my wife, Mr. Oto,           and myself, recapping the events of the day before, and narrating           what her parents did after they left the Gala VIP Dinner at 2:30           a.m. the night before. Chelsea related that she and her parents           had stayed up playing scrabble, discussing the Gala and the prospect           of her fatherï¿½s working with the creator           of Spider Man when he left the White House. . ."
- "Through the Secret Service, I arranged           for a private meeting with the Clintons at the National Italian           American Dinner in Washington in 1994, where my then-client,           'Fabio,' chased Hillary Clinton around a conference table and           then physically lifted the First Lady, from her sitting position           on the floor, for a series of romance-pose photographs."
Clearly, ex-con Paul is not someone to           trust easily. But the same is true of Hillary Clinton, the only           first lady to come under criminal investigation, who once told           a House committee "I don't recall" or its equivalent           50 times in 42 paragraphs.
But a real press would be out covering           this story, not sweeping it under the rug.
THE ROSEN TRIAL
PROGRESSIVE REVIEW 2005 - The acquittal           of Hillary Clinton's former fundraiser David Rosen follows a           bizarre trial in which a Clinton-appointed judge announced Mrs.           Clinton not culpable before any evidence had been presented and           a prosecutor concealed from the jury a damaging tape astounding           even the judge.
As Newsmax reported on May 18:
Prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg           announced yesterday that he would not introduce the government's           strongest evidence that Rosen is guilty . . . 'The government           does not intend to introduce the tape or elicit any testimony           from the witness about that conversation,' Zeidenberg told Judge           A. Howard Matz. Judge Matz was stunned by Zeidenberg's announcement,           and hinted that the Bush prosecutor was throwing away his case.           'You couldn't keep [the tape] out,' an incredulous Matz protested.           'I wouldn't let you keep it out.'"
But eventually the Clinton           appointed judge relented, saying he said he would allow Zeidenberg           to file a 'real pithy' argument in lieu of introducing the Rosen           tape.
The Bush prosecutor went           so far as to trash the Rosen audiotape, arguing that it was 'hearsay,'           and requesting that Judge Matz bar even the defense from referencing           it.
The recording, made by           Kennedy in-law Raymond Reggie during a September 2002 meeting           with Rosen at a Chicago steakhouse, was believed to offer evidence           supportive of the prosecution's argument that Rosen had deliberately           understated the costs of an August 2000 gala fund-raiser for           Mrs. Clinton. . .
On May 20, Martha Carr in the New Orleans           Times Picayune - the only major paper to give the story serious           coverage - reported:
A transcript of the tape           obtained by The Times-Picayune shows that while some parts could           have helped bolster the government's case, others contained potentially           embarrassing details about the fast-and-loose practices of top           Democratic fund raisers and party officials. The judge ultimately           agreed to exclude its contents. . .
While Reggie agreed to           help the feds almost three years ago, his role as government           informant was kept secret until recently in an effort to conceal           his cooperation in at least two other unrelated investigations,           one involving a state senator, and the other, a prominent political           figure who may have been illegally soliciting national campaign           donations from foreign nationals, according to an FBI affidavit.           The government has agreed to recommend that Reggie's sentence           not exceed five years in return for his cooperation, he testified           Thursday.
Like several other actors           in the political drama being played out in the Los Angeles courtroom,           Reggie, who was invited to state dinners and even slept at the           White House, watched his high-powered world come crashing down           after his wheeling and dealing got out of control. . .
The underwriter of the           Hollywood gala, Peter Paul, is a three-time convicted felon who           built an Internet company with Spider-man creator Stan Lee. He           awaits sentencing for bilking investors out of $25 million. His           former company, Stan Lee Media, is now defunct.
[Aaron] Tonken, who organized           the gala, is serving five years in prison for defrauding charities           out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, after years of consorting           with the rich and famous in Los Angeles, driving luxury vehicles           and living off borrowed money.
Lastly, there is Jim Levin,           a Chicago businessman and Clinton confidant who has pleaded guilty           to federal bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges in connection           with the awarding of public contracts to his family's fencing           company.
The judge - a Clinton patronage           pick pushed by Barbara Boxer - not only didn't recuse himself           as a more cautious jurist might have under the circumstances,           he was unusually loquacious. In a NY Sun story he was quoted           as saying that Paul was "a thoroughly discredited, corrupt           individual" and "a con artist." Metz also said, "This isn't a trial about Senator Clinton. Senator Clinton           has no stake in this trial as a party or a principal. She's not           in the loop in any direct way, and that's something the jury           will be told."
What's curious about this           is that at least two witnesses had told investigators that they           had informed Mrs. Clinton about the hidden campaign cash.
Prsecutor Zeidenberg was           equally anxious to exonerate Hillary Clinton, telling Matz, "You           will hear no evidence that Hillary Clinton was involved in any           way, shape or form. In fact, it's just the opposite. The evidence           will show that David Rosen was trying to keep this evidence from           the campaign." . . .
It helps to remember that the Clinton-Bush coziness           goes back to the days of Iran-Contra, when Papa Bush was supervising           covert arms shipments to Latin America out of Arkansas (with           drugs making the return trip) and Governor Clinton was busy looking           the other way. Further, as was clear during abortive Republican           investigations into various Clinton scandals, in the culture           of impunity of Washington, politics stops at corruption's edge.           Almost all major corruption is either bipartisan or common enough           that one side can effectively blackmail the other.
THE PELLICANO CONNECTION
JOSEPH FARRAH, WORLDNET           DAILY, JULY 2005 - A significant portion of the [Clinton's] Shadow           Team's operations were carried out by private investigators,           among them: Terry Lenzner, founder and chairman of the powerful           Washington, D.C., detective firm Investigative Group International;           high-ticket San Francisco private eye Jack Palladino and his           wife Sandra Sutherland; and Hollywood sleuth Anthony J. Pellicano.           . .
Hillary's detectives engaged           in "a systematic campaign to intimidate, frighten, threaten,           discredit and punish innocent Americans whose only misdeed is           their desire to tell the truth in public," former Clinton           adviser Dick Morris charged in the New York Post of Oct. 1, 1998.
Hillary's secret police           tend to be a tight-lipped bunch, professionally skilled at keeping           a low profile. However, we know more about Anthony "The           Pelican" Pellicano than about most Hillary operatives, thanks           to his boastfulness and taste for the limelight. Pellicano's           violent career as a private investigator reveals much about the           sorts of qualifications Hillary sought in her Shadow Team.
In the January 1992 issue           of GQ magazine, Pellicano boasted of the dirty work he had performed           for his clients, including blackmail and physical assault. He           claimed to have beaten one of his client's enemies with a baseball           bat. "I'm an expert with a knife," said Pellicano. "I can shred your face with a knife."
FBI agents raided Pellicano's           West Hollywood office on Nov. 22, 2002, and arrested him on federal           weapons charges. In his office, they found gold, jewelry, and           about $200,000 in cash - most of it bundled in $10,000 wrappers           - thousands of pages of transcripts of illegal wiretaps; two           handguns; and various explosive devices stored in safes, including           two live hand grenades and a pile of C4 plastic explosive, complete           with blasting cap and detonation cord.
C4 is a military explosive           that cannot be sold legally to civilians. Pellicano had a surprisingly           large quantity in his safe. "The explosive could easily           be used to blow up a car, and was in fact strong enough to bring           down an airplane," noted Special Agent Stanley Ornellas           in a sworn affidavit.
The FBI raided Pellicano's           office after an accomplice ratted him out. Ex-convict Alexander           Proctor told the FBI that Pellicano had hired him to threaten           and intimidate Los Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch, who had           been poking her nose a little too deeply into a feud between           Mafia kingpins and actor Steven Seagal. It seems that Seagal's           former friend and production partner, Julius R. Nasso, was tied           to the Gambino crime family. When Seagal and Nasso quarreled,           the dispute got ugly.
On the morning of June           20, 2002, reporter Anita Busch approached her car, which was           parked near her home. To her horror, she saw a bullet-hole in           her windshield. A cardboard sign taped to the glass bore one           word: "Stop." A dead fish with a long-stemmed rose           in its mouth lay on the hood.
Busch took the hint. She           immediately went into hiding, staying in a series of hotels at           her paper's expense, while the FBI and the Los Angeles Police           Deprtment's organized-crime division investigated.
A break in the case seemed           to come when ex-convict Alexander Proctor spilled the beans to           an undercover FBI informant. Proctor reportedly told the informant,           on tape, that it was not the Mafia who were harassing Anita Busch           - it was Steven Seagal! Proctor said that Seagal hired detective           Anthony Pellicano to intimidate the woman into silence. Pellicano,           in turn, had subcontracted Proctor to do the dirty work.
"He wanted to make           it look like the Italians were putting the hit on her, so it           wouldn't reflect on Seagal," Proctor told the informant.           Proctor accused Pellicano of ordering him to "blow up" or set fire to Busch's car to frighten her. However, Proctor           said he got cold feet and merely damaged the car, leaving the           dead fish and "Stop" sign as calling cards.
A federal judge sentenced           Pellicano to 30 months in prison for possession of the hand grenades           and C4. Later, on June 17, 2005, Los Angeles County District           Attorney Steve Cooley charged him with conspiracy and making           threats against former Los Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch.           He will likely face prosecution for illegal wiretapping.
Pellicano's 2002 arrest           was big news in Hollywood. Article after article touted Pellicano           as a "celebrity sleuth" and a "private detective           to the stars," whose client list had included the likes           of Elizabeth Taylor, Kevin Costner, Sylvester Stallone, Roseanne           Barr, O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson (whose chronic problem           with child molestation charges provided Pellicano with plenty           of damage-control work).
Despite the sensational           coverage, few mainstream news organizations uttered the name           of Pellicano's most famous client: Hillary Rodham Clinton. "Of           the more than two dozen media reports on Pellicano's Thursday           arrest so far, none have mentioned his ties to the Clinton attack           machine," reported NewsMax on Nov. 23, 2002."
[The dead fish with a rose           in its mouth brought to mind this]
PROGRESSIVE REVIEW, 1998           - Kathleen Willey had the tires on her car mysteriously punctured           with dozens of nails and her cat suddenly disappeared. Subsequently,           Willey was out jogging near her home when a stranger approached           and asked if the tires had been fixed and if the cat had been           found. The man then asked Willey, "Don't you get the message?" and jogged off. Willey also found an animal skull on her porch           the day after she testified in the Paula Jones case.
WASHINGTON POST, FEB 22,1998           - [Sidney] Blumenthal was also asked [in the grand jury] about           any contacts he may have had with three private investigators:           Terry F. Lenzner, who heads the Investigative Group Inc. and           who has been hired by the law firm of Williams & Connolly,           Clinton's private attorneys in the broad Whitewater investigation;           Jack Palladino, who is based in San Francisco; and Anthony J.           Pellicano, who is based in Los Angeles . . .In an interview this           week, Pellicano denied he has been doing background investigations           on Starr or his staff. He refused to say whether he is doing           other work on the Lewinsky investigation.
CARL LIMBACHER, NEWSMAX,           2003 - Though the American press insists on not reporting this           inconvenient detail, Anthony Pellicano was first hired by Bill           and Hillary Clinton in 1992 in a bid to discredit Gennifer Flowers'           steamy tape recordings of conversations with Mr. Clinton.. .           . In 1999 Flowers filed a defamation suit against Clinton campaign officials James Carville and George Stephanopoulos - along with           then-first lady Hillary Clinton - based on their attempts to           use Pellicano's analysis to discredit her. Arguing before the           9th Circuit Court of Appeals last year, Flowers' Judicial Watch           attorneys tied Pellicano directly to the first lady-turned-New           York senator, telling the court: "Anthony Pellicano was           a private investigator hired by Mrs. Clinton herself. And he's           the one who did the analysis of the tapes." e court ruled           in Flowers' favor, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.
But that isn't the only           time Pellicano has been linked to the Clintons. Four days after           the Monica Lewinsky story broke in January 1998, ex-Lewinsky           boyfriend Andy Bleiler came forward with the claim that she had           stalked him. The Washington state school teacher also contended           that Lewinsky wanted to become a White House intern so she could           perform oral sex on then-President Clinton. "I'm going to           Washington to get my presidential knee pads," Bleiler's           lawyer, Terry Giles, quoted Lewinsky as saying.
"Anthony Pellicano,           the L.A.-based private investigator and O.J. defense team veteran           [was] responsible for digging up Andy Bleiler," the New           York Post's Andrea Peyser reported at the time. Sexgate provocateur           Lucianne Goldberg told Peyser that Pellicano's services were           bought and paid for by the Clinton White House. When Peyser confronted           the "investigator to the stars" with Goldberg's claim,           he didn't deny it. "You're a smart girl. No comment," Pellicano told the Post reporter.
Indeed, the tough-talking           private eye makes no bones about his hardball tactics. He claimed           to carry a baseball bat, not a gun, as his weapon of choice and           once told the Los Angeles Times, "I only use intimidation           and fear when I absolutely have to."
Interestingly enough, some           of Pellicano's targets, like former Los Angeles Times reporter           Anita Busch and one-time "Hard Copy" correspondent           Dina Dimond, report break-ins and property vandalism, the kind           of problems encountered by Clinton accusers like Flowers, Sally           Perdue, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick.
CARL LIMBACHER JR, NEWSMAX,           FEBRUARY 2, 1999 - The very hour before Clinton entered the well           of the House to speak to Congress and the nation, Andy Bleiler           took center stage 3,000 miles away. Bleiler's account of his           five-year affair with a teenage Monica, delivered from his Oregon           home in a full-blown, nationally broadcast press conference,           was the Clinton attack machine's boldest foray into "nuts           and sluts" territory. It was at that press conference that           America learned for the first time that Monica had traveled to           Washington intent on earning her "presidential kneepads." . . .
In the aftermath of Bleiler's           press conference, only the New York Post's Andrea Peyser was           eagle-eyed enough to notice that Bleiler had not just appeared           out of thin air. In an interview with Lucianne Goldberg, Peyser           learned that, "Anthony Pellicano, the L.A.-based private           investigator and O.J. defense team veteran [was] responsible           for digging up Andy Bleiler." Pellicano's services, Goldberg           claimed, were bought and paid for by the White House. . .
NEWSMAX, June 22, 2000           - U.S. Senate hopeful Rick Lazio alleged yesterday that his opponent           Hillary Clinton hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on           him as soon as he announced he would run against her. The New           York congressman said the development is an indication of the           kind of dirty tricks campaign he expects Mrs. Clinton to wage           in her bid for elected office. . .
NEWSMAX, 2002 - When Peyser           confronted the Los Angeles private detective with Goldberg's           claim, he didn't deny it. "You're a smart girl. No comment," Pellicano told the Post reporter. Digging up Bleiler's "presidential           kneepads" story wasn't the first time Pellicano had gone           to bat for the Clintons. According to Ron Kessler's 1995 best-seller, "Inside the White House," Clinton's first presidential           campaign relied on Pellicano's expertise in the field of audio           analysis to discredit Gennifer Flowers' smoking gun tapes. The           Clinton camp made much of the fact that Anthony J. Pellicano,           an expert on audio recording analysis, had told the press that           a twelve-minute portion of the tape of conversations between           Flowers and Clinton had been 'selectively edited' at two points," Kessler reported. To counter Pellicano's claims, Flowers submitted           her recordings to Truth Verification Labs, which found them to           be 100 percent authentic. In 1999 Flowers filed a defamation           suit against Clinton campaign officials James Carville and George           Stephanopoulos - along with then-first lady Hillary Clinton -           based on their attempts to use Pellicano's analysis to discredit her. During a February court appearance, the head of Flowers'           legal team, Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman, told the Ninth           Circuit Court of Appeals, "Anthony Pellicano was a private           investigator hired by Mrs. Clinton herself. And he's the one           who did the analysis of the tapes." Of the more than two           dozen media reports on Pellicano's Thursday arrest so far, none           have mentioned his ties to the Clinton attack machine.
AMERICAN THINKER - Two           LA Times reporters today used almost 2800 words to examine the           highly questionable background of Hollywood celebrity sleuth/audio           expert/guest of the federal penal system Anthony Pellicano. Although           the major focus was on his career as a "forensic audio" expert, not once did they manage to mention his most prominent           gig: "analyzing" the Gennifer Flowers tapes of her           conversations with Bill Clinton, and declaring them "doctored" during the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Readers with long memories           will recall that Pellicano's "discrediting" of the           tapes, on which then-candidate Clinton was heard disparaging           Mario's Cuomo's ethnicity and possible ties to the underworld,           as well as making colorful comments of a sexual nature, led the           press to immediately drop the matter, and treat the tapes as           a gigantic fraud.
Credit where it is due:           reporters Scott Glover and Matt Lait do raise many questions           about the validity of Pellicano's "expert" testimony           as an audio analyst. They point out that he has a record of hearing           things no one else can, that he doesn't understand the science supposedly underlying his analytical techniques, and that occasional           judges have thrown out his opinions as valueless. . .
CARL LIMBACHER NEWSMAX           - New York Sen. Hillary Clinton's Washington scandal attorney           David Kendall is denying that recently jailed tough guy-investigator           Anthony Pellicano ever worked for the Clintons, a claim directly           contradicted by senior Bush White House advisor Mary Matalin           - and not even denied by Pellicano himself. Kendall told the           New York Daily News on Friday that reports linking the former           first lady with the controversial gumshoe, who was jailed last           Monday on weapons and explosives charges, are "politically           motivated and utterly false.". . . When Newsweek asked Pellicano           directly whether he was working for the Clinton White House,           his denial was significantly less forceful than Mr. Kendall's. "I have no comment," he told the newsmagazine.
CARL LIMBACHER, NEWSMAX           - [Mary] Matalin, now a senior White House advisor, discussed           the episode in 1997 during a stint as a talk radio host on CBS's           Washington, D.C. affiliate. "I got the letters from Pellicano           to these women intimidating them," Matalin told her audience. "I had tapes of conversations from Pellicano to the women.           I got handwritten letters from the women.". . . "I           controlled the money in the [1992 Bush] campaign," Matalin           explained. "And [Clinton damage controller] Betsy Wright           announced that she was putting $28,000 on the 'bimbo' patrol           and on Jack Palladino and Pellicano, the other guy. "And           $28,000 to me, the political director, was four states in the           Rocky Mountains. You had a limited budget. I said, how could           they spend this much money? How could they basically give up           four states to track down 'bimbos'? "That's why it was kind           of shocking to me that it must have been a bigger priority than           putting money into states for the purpose of winning and that's           why I flagged it at the time."
NY POST - Court TV anchor           Diane Dimond, who reported on the first days of the Michael Jackson           sex case a decade ago, is the latest to be caught up in a Hollywood           phone-bugging scandal. Dimond said yesterday that authorities           have informed her that wiretaps on her phone from 1994 are part           of evidence seized by the FBI last year from the computer of           Hollywood private eye Anthony Pellicano. Dimond was a reporter           for "Hard Copy" in 1993 in the first days after the           story broke of a youngster accusing Jackson of sexually molesting           him. Pellicano worked for Jackson's attorney, Harold Weitzman. "I [was] positive my phones were tapped - I heard lots of           clicking and crackling noises on the line and then my words started           coming back to me through others," Dimond told The Post. "I would call new sources and they would tell me, 'We understand           you've heard X, Y and Z' so I knew my phone had to be tapped.           . . "My house was vandalized. My car was broken into on           the Paramount lot [where 'Hard Copy' was taped]. "I had           documents underneath an expensive leather coat - the coat wasn't           taken, but the documents were stolen from my car," Dimond           said. "My mailbox was mowed over. They gave me armed guards           to go to and from work - nothing was safe," she says.
TOO IMPORTANT TO BE SUED
1999 - Fighting a subpoena by Judicial           Watch in a $90 million lawsuit on behalf of GOP officials and           others whose FBI files were abused by the Clinton White House,           HRC, in her brief, declares that "as a general proposition,           high-ranking government officials are not subject to depositions" and she shouldn't have to testify so she can "have time           to dedicate to the performance of [her] government functions." One problem: Mrs. Clinton was not a government official. She           was, however, a defendant in the suit.
THE CLINTON HEALTH PLAN FIASCO
TONY SNOW, 1999: In 1994, [HRC] set out to redesign the American health-care system           and convened a panel that drafted its plan secretly -- in violation           of federal law . . . The plan prescribed some eye- popping maximum           fines: $5,000 for refusing to join the government- mandated health           plan; $5,000 for failing to pay premiums on time; 15 years to           doctors who received "anything of value" in exchange           for helping patients short-circuit the bureaucracy; $10,000 a           day for faulty physician paperwork; $50,000 for unauthorized           patient treatment; and $100,000 a day for drug companies that           messed up federal filings . . . When told the plan could bankrupt           small businesses, Mrs. Clinton sighed, "I can't be responsible           for every undercapitalized small business in America." When           a woman complained that she didn't want to get shoved into a           plan not of her choosing, the first lady lectured, "It's           time to put the common good, the national interest, ahead of           individuals." As for privacy, forget it: Her plan would           have required people to carry national identification cards that           embedded confidential patient information on computer chips.
SAM SMITH, SHADOWS OF HOPE, 1994 - During the first months of the Clinton administration,           one of the biggest national policy changes of the past fifty           years was being forged by a secret committee led by Mrs. Clinton           under procedures that periodically defied the courts and the           Government Accounting Office and whose public manifestations           consisted of highly contrived media opportunities, carefully           staged "town meetings," and similar artifices.
Despite the contrary evidence of public           opinion polls, the concept of Canadian-style single-payer insurance           was dismissed early. Tom Hamburger and Ted Marmor in the Washington           Monthly tell of a single-payer proponent being invited to the           White House in February 1993. It was, he said, a "pseudo-consultation;" the doctor was quickly informed that "single payer is not           politically feasible." When Dr. David Himmelstein of the           Harvard Medical School pressed Mrs. Clinton on single payer,           she replied, "Tell me something interesting, David."
In other words, write Hamburger and Marmor: "Fewer than six weeks into the Clinton presidency, the White           House had made its key policy decision: Before the Health Care           Task Force wrote a single page of its 22-volume report to the           President, the single payer idea was written off, and 'managed           competition' was in."
If there was any popular, grassroots demand           for "managed competition" it never appeared. Managed           competition had not been tested anywhere. Nonetheless, reported           Thomas Bodenehimer in Nation:
"Around Hillary Rodham Clinton's health           reform table sit the managed-competition winners: big business,           hospitals, large (but not small) commercial insurers, the Blues,           budget-worried government leaders and the 'Jackson Hole Group,'           the chief intellectual honchos of the managed competition movement.           . . Adherence to the mantra of managed competition appears to           be the price of a ticket of admission to this gathering. "
What was finally proposed involved a massive           transfer of the American health industry -- by some accounts           now larger than the military-industrial complex -- to a small           number of the largest insurance companies and other major corporations.           These were companies that had the assets to play the game being           offered -- a medical oligopoly that would dispense health-care           under the rules of the Fortune 500 rather than according to those           of Hipprocrates.
Clinton's position on health care had bounced           around in the early months of the campaign, finally settling           on a policy that would leave the big health insurers largely           unscathed. It was not particularly surprising. Max Brantley,           columnist for the Arkansas Times, noted that "Blue Cross           owns Arkansas, and [Clinton] never did much to fight them."
The stakes would eventually become so high           that a number of the biggest insurers -- including CIGNA, Aetna           and Metropolitan Life -- would leave the industry-wide Health           Insurance Association of America. Five of the largest insurance           companies formed something called the Alliance for Managed Competition.           In this new game one of the first targets of 'managed competition'           was the smaller insurance companies that now account for nearly           half of the health underwriting business. Said managed competition           advocate Lynn Etheridge, "Ninety-nine percent of the insurance           companies are going to be wiped out because they're only prepared           to be insurance companies." Mrs. Clinton, sounding like           a 1980s takeover lawyer, said, "It's going to be a Darwinian           struggle. Only the best and fittest of them will survive." Similarly, when asked how small businesses were meant to cope           with the added costs of her plan, Mrs. Clinton replied, "I           can't go out and save every undercapitalized entrepreneur in           America."
Her interest lay with the largest companies,           i.e. the ones with the ability to purchase or create the health           maintenance organizations that would become de rigeur under the           Clinton scheme. The new HMOs would be major profit-centers for           companies, simultaneously subsidized by federal payments for           the ailments of the poor, elderly and those without conventional           insurance.
THE WATERGATE INVESTIGATION
PROGRESSIVE REVIEW 1999 - Jerry Zeifman           was the Democrats' general counsel chief of staff of the House           Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation. In an           article for the Wall Street Journal he reviews HRC's performance           as a staff member:
-- She violated House and committee rules           by disclosing confidential information to unauthorized persons.
-- A number of the legal procedures she           recommended were ethically flawed
-- In one written legal memorandum, she           advocated denying President Nixon representation by counsel.
-- She proposed that the committee should           neither 1) hold any hearings with or take the depositions of           any live witnesses, nor 2) conduct any original investigation           of Watergate, bribery, tax evasion, or any other possible impeachable           offense of President Nixon. Instead, the committee should rely           on prior investigations conducted by other committees and agencies.
-- She advocated that the official rules           of the House be amended to deny members of the committee the           right to question witnesses.
-- Zeifman decided that he could not recommend           her for any position of public or private trust.
THE PHOTOS
There's been a lot of talk about photos           of Jack Abramoff and George Bush, but Hillary Clinton has her           own photo problems. For example, there's the photo of Bill and           her standing next to illegal fundraiser Johnny Chung signed by           HRC, "To Johnny Chung with best wishes and appreciation." Chung reportedly funneled several hundred thousand dollas from           Chinese military intelligence to Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign.           As Chung put it once, "I see the White House is like a subway           -- you have to put in coins to open the gates." He was talking           about the $50,000 he gave Hillary Clinton's top aide while seeking           VIP treatment at the White House.
And then there's Jorge Cabrera - the drug           dealer who gave enough to the Democrats to have his picture taken           with both Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. In a 1997 story, Don Van           Natta Jr. of the NY Times reported, "Jorge Cabrera, a drug           smuggler who has emerged as one of the most notorious supporters           of President Clinton's re-election campaign, was asked for a           campaign contribution in the unlikely locale of a hotel in Havana           by a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, congressional investigators           have learned. . . On his return to the United States several           days after that meeting, in November 1995, Cabrera wrote a check           for $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee from an account           that included the proceeds from smuggling cocaine from Colombia           to the United States, said the investigators, who spoke on condition           of anonymity.
"Within two weeks of the contribution,           Cabrera met Gore at the dinner in Miami. Ten days later, Cabrera           attended a Christmas reception at the White House hosted by Hillary           Rodham Clinton. At the events, Gore and Mrs. Clinton posed for           photographs with Cabrera, who has two felony convictions dating           from the 1980s and is now in a prison here on a drug-smuggling           conviction. . .
"A Cuban-born American, Cabrera was           arrested two times on serious drug charges in the 1980s. Both           times he pleaded guilty to nondrug felony charges. In 1983, he           pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for conspiring to bribe           a grand jury witness and served 42 months in prison. In 1988,           he pleaded guilty to filing a false income-tax return and served           one year in prison. After his brief brush with presidential politics,           Cabrera was arrested in January 1996 inside a cigar warehouse           near here in Dade County, where more than 500 pounds of cocaine           had been hidden. He and several accomplices were charged with           having smuggled 3,000 pounds of cocaine into the United States           through the Keys. . . In January, Cabrera received an invitation           to Clinton's inauguration.
THE BILLING RECORDS
1996 - Hillary Clinton's Rose law firm           billing records, sought for two years by congressional investigators           and the special prosecutor are found in the back room of the           personal residence at the White House. Clinton say she has no           idea how they got there.
THE JOHN HUANG CONNECTION
In 1994 John Huang quits the Lippo Group           -- with a golden parachute of around $800,000 -- and goes to           work for the Commerce Department. Some believe the move is instigated           by his friend, Hillary Clinton. The Indonesia-based Lippo Group           was headed by Mochtar Riady, a central character in the Clinton           scandals.
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown ordered a           top secret clearance for Huang. While at Commerce, Huang visits           the White House about 70 times, is briefed 37 times by the CIA,           views about 500 intelligence reports, and makes 281 calls to           Lippo banks. In 1999 Huang was sentenced for campaign finance           violations.
Also in 1994, Webster Hubbell is convicted           of tax evasion and mail fraud involving the theft of nearly a           half million dollars from his partners at the Rose firm and failing           to pay nearly $150,000 in taxes. After quitting the Justice Department           and before going to jail, Hubbell is a busy man. He meets with           Hillary Clinton, and follows up by getting together with major           scandal figures John Huang, James Riady, and Ng Lapseng. Riady           and Huang go to the White House every day from June 21 to June           25, 1994 according to White House records. Hubbell had breakfast           and lunch with Riady on June 23. Four days later -- and one week           after Hubbell's meeting with Hillary -- the Hong Kong Chinese           Bank, jointly owed by Lippo and the Chinese intelligence services,           sends $100,000 to Hubbell.
