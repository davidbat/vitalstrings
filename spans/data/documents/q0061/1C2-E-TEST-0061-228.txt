The Obama Camp is leaning on Hillary Clinton to authorize the release of the HillDocs (thousands of pages of documents Bill Clinton’s presidential library that bear on her activities as First Lady).  From two of Obama’s supporters:
“Throughout this campaign, you have repeatedly emphasized your experience as First Lady,” wrote Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, and Lu Barron, a Linn County supervisor. “However, by refusing to authorize an expedited release of the records from your time in Washington, you are preventing the Iowa voters from thoroughly reviewing that experience.”
The New York Times posted this as Hillary’s response:
Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with Radio Iowa on Saturday, said she did not know what the papers would reveal, but she supported releasing them as quickly as possible. “I think it’s like people think we have boxes of records in our basement and why don’t I just go and get them and hand them over,” she said. “And you know my husband has never blocked a record ever. He has been the most forthcoming of all presidents.”
I wonder what the Obama camp is looking to find? Some long forgotten dirt maybe on Whitewater ?  Or maybe dredging up some juice about the suicide of Vince Foster , Hillary Clinton’s Cattle Futures Controversy ?  Or revisiting some old dirt like TravelGate or FileGate ? Hillary Clinton has so many skeletons in her closet, that perhaps she’s lost track of them. Certaintly there is gold dirt in them thar papers somewhere.  Even if these documents aren’t released, who will vote for someone with all this baggage?
