first lady makeups: Hillary Rodham Clinton
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (born 1947) was the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001 as the wife of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton. Thereafter she was a United States Senator for New York from 2001 to 2009.  She  was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008  election. She is currently the 67th United States Secretary of State, serving in the administration of President Barack Obama.
She was the first First Lady to hold a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual First Lady offices in the East Wing. She is regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history, save for Eleanor Roosevelt and was appointed to head the Task Force on National Health Care Reform.
In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had had extramarital sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. This was his second admitted extramarital relationship (the same year he had admitted a sexual encounter with Gennifer Flowers had occured some twenty years earlier) – Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Paula Jones, Sally Perdue, and Dolly Kyle Browning, amongst others, have also admitted or alleged having affairs with Bill Clinton.
The movies & TV shows
The Special Relationship (2010): This movie followed the ‘special relationship’ between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton from when the new Labour leader visited the USA in 1992 through to 2001 when Blair forged a new equally special – but ultimately diasterous – relationship with George Bush. Hope Davis played Hillary Clinton. Daniel Phillips was the makeup and hair designer.
