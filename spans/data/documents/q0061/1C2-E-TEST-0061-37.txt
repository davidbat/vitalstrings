Life After the Presidency
First Lady: Hillary Rodham Clinton by Martin Kelly and Melissa Kelly
Hillary Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois. She was an excellent student and graduated valedictorian of her class at Wellesley College in 1969 with a degree in political science. She then went to Yale Law School and graduated in 1973. She and Clinton met at Yale Law School, and they both ended up teaching there while they were dating. They married on October 11, 1975. Together, the Clintons have one daughter, Chelsea.
Powerful First Lady
Hillary Clinton was an extremely powerful first lady and was heavily involved in directing policy during her husband's time in office. She was appointed in 1993 to head the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. However, the goal for nationalized health insurance never became reality as it met heavy resistance in Congress.
Throughout her time as first lady, she spoke out on women's and children's issues both at home and on the world stage. She was a driving force for important legislation like the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which dealt with the adoption of foster children. She was also responsible for hosting numerous events and refurbishing the Blue Room at the White House.
Senator Clinton
After Clinton retired from the presidency, Hillary decided to go into politics on her own merits. She successfully campaigned for and won a U.S. Senate seat, becoming the junior senator from New York. She has been very active in the Senate and has announced her intent to run for the presidency in 2008.
