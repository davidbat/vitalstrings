There was a split among male and female respondents. Among women, the survey results were: Obama (20 percent), Clinton (18 percent), and Reagan (14 percent). Among men, the survey results were Reagan (24 percent), Clinton (20 percent), and Laura Bush (11 percent).
(The online poll, with a margin of error ofÂ  +/- 3.1 percent, questioned 1,016 American adults from May 13 to 14, 2010, and was statistically weighted to be demographically representative of the United States.)
