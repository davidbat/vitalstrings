Wife of William Jefferson Clinton
40th and 42nd Governor (1979-1981, 1983-1992)
President of the United States of America (1992-2000)
To the Governorâ€™s Inaugural Ball in 1979, Mrs. Clinton wore a full-length gown of pink velvet modeled after her wedding dress.  Antique lace, beads, and sequins accent the fitted bodice with princess lines.  The long sleeves feature a band at the upper arm and fit snuggly around the lower arm and wrist.  The bell shaped skirt features three tiers each gathered into the tier above.
