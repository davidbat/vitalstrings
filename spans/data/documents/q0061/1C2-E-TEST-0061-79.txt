My view is that, you know, life unfolds                                          at its own rhythm. You know, I have never                                          lived a life that I thought I could plan                                          out. And I'm just trying to do the best                                          I can every day. I find I have a lot to                                          get done between the time I get up and                                          the time I go to bed.
