Hillary Clinton's first Speech About Health Care        Reform.
 
On June 18, 1993, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton        addressed a panel of governors at the Woodstock Town        Hall in Woodstock, Vermont, as part of the Democratic        Governors' Association annual issues conference. The        Hillary Clinton Quarterly attended the meeting and        brought along its tape recorder. The following is a        verbatim transcript of Mrs. Clinton's remarks. Due to        space limitations, we have not included the First Lady's        introductory remarks to the governors and some        references to specific state programs.
 
While many news outlets continue to speculate about        specific details of the health care proposal, Mrs.        Clinton's remarks were clearly meant to establish the        broad communications themes that will be used in the        months ahead to sell the benefits of the program to        voters. Three themes stand out in particular: health        care security, personal responsibility and state        participation.

Address by Hillary Rodham Clinton
to the Democratic Governors' Association
I'd like to take a few minutes to talk        about the process we have undertaken to improve the        country's health care system, and to talk about the        fundamental goals of our reform.
Just as Governor Dean (of Vermont) has already said, we        tried to pull together from across our country people        from every walk of life, every kind of experience, who        knew what the problem was, and had experienced it first        hand. We felt strongly that state government had to be        represented in that process. Many of these governors,        and many others, sent staff members to work with us,        came in themselves to attend meetings, gave us the        benefit of their deliberations as they drafted        legislation, worked with legislators and with groups in        their home states. We've been meeting on a regular        basis, and we have found, as you might guess, that our        process has been improved because of the contributions        from the state and local level.
We've held more than 1,000 meetings with people who have        a particular point of view on health care reform,        because just about everyone in this country does have a        stake in making sure we do it right. And it's been        interesting to me to see how willing people have been to        put aside their own particular point of view to try to        look at the whole, because it is unlikely we will -- or        anyone could -- come up with a proposal that would        satisfy everybody. Everybody will have to move a little        bit to get to the point where the whole will be bigger        than the sum of its parts. Many people have been willing        to do just that in our efforts to craft this proposal.
We have also been working hard to educate ourselves and        the American people about what is at stake. When people        understand how the health care crisis impacts on them        personally, not just in terms of whether or not they        have insurance, or whether their insurance this year        costs the same as it did last year, or whether they fear        losing insurance because of something beyond their        control like a pre-existing condition or their inability        to change jobs, or even whether they stand scared on the        precipice of the next health care disaster because they        don't have insurance -- when they begin to see their        personal situation in context with what is going on in        the broader community, then we make real progress so        that everyone understands how the pieces of this fit        together. That is the kind of educational process that        we are engaged in now, and each of you is a part of it.
It's important, as I walk down later this afternoon this        beautiful street I rode up to come to this meeting, to        know that I will pass store after store after store --        some of the people working in those stores will have        insurance, down the block some will not. If a medical        emergency happens later this afternoon, the person will        be taken to the nearest hospital without regard to that.        The person will then be given the care that is needed        for that emergency. Because it is not fair to say that        people go completely without care in our country. They        get care, but often only in an emergency, only when it's        become more expensive than it should have. And        regardless of whether that person had the insurance to        take care of that emergency, it will be paid for by        those of us who do -- those of us who carry private        insurance, those of us who have employers who pay for        it, those of us who have government assistance. That is        one of the reasons why when one looks at a hospital bill        you're sometimes struck by the fact that that aspirin        was charged to you for $20. It's not because it's worth        $20; it's to take care of those people who were taken        care of who didn't have compensation.
When people begin to understand how we are all in this        together, how today is not at all secure with respect to        what we will have tomorrow, then the education process        really takes hold. Because the most important thing that        I have found as I've travelled around the country, no        matter who I've talked with, is security. That's what        people want whether they think they have it now, or        whether they never have -- they want the security to        know that their primary and preventive health care needs        will be taken care of, and that their acute and chronic        needs will be taken care of.
This is the key to what kind of health care reform we        have to offer to the American people. Because what we        have to be able to say at the end of this process is        that if we enact the President's proposal, those        millions of Americans, nearly 40 million now, who do not        have any insurance, will have health security, and that        those millions more who have some insurance, but not        enough if a real emergency comes, will have security.        And, most importantly, the majority of us who do have        some insurance who feel that we have taken care of        ourselves through our own efforts and that of our        employers -- we can rest assured that we will have it        next year, and the year after, and the year after that,        no matter who we work for, no matter how sick we might        become, no matter who we marry or the state of the        health of the child that we bear, we will all be secure.        We have to make it possible for every American who works        for a living, who pays the bills, who takes care of        raising their family, who pays the taxes, that they do        not have to fear going without insurance and health        security.
Once the new health care system is up and running, every        American citizen and those who are permanent residents        in this country will get a health security card. That        card will guarantee all Americans a comprehensive        package of benefits, no matter where they work, where        they live, how old they are, or whether they have ever        been sick. The benefits package will emphasize primary        and preventive health care. We have to begin to redress        the imbalance that has been allowed to develop in our        health care system where we have the most highly        sophisticated health care available anywhere in the        world, so that you could with great ease and comfort of        mind know that you can get a heart bypass, but you could        not be sure that you will be able to get your child        adequately immunized. We need to reverse that, to not do        anything that endangers the quality of the very top of        our health care system, but to build up the base so that        we can provide more services and save more money because        we will allocate our resources better.
Second, we are going to make sure that with that health        card that guarantees those benefits packages, we will be        bringing costs under control. You see, everyday what        happens is that health care is priced out of reach of        many Americans. Many of you have seen your own personal        costs, your businesses' costs, your states' costs, get        driven out of sight. I know that Florida's health care        costs, for example, have quadrupled in the last 12        years. And that is happening all over the country. This        forces us as individuals, as businesses, as states, and        as the federal government to absorb more and more red        ink. It forces many segments of the health care system        to shift costs wherever they can find those dollars.        That's what leads to the $20 aspirin. All of us bear the        burden. If left unchecked, health care costs will        continue to hurt our families, bankrupt our businesses,        and our state budgets, and drive the federal deficit        ever and ever higher.
We will have to rein-in health care costs in several        ways. We will have to get rid of incentives for doctors        to do more tests and procedures. Instead, we will create        a system that encourages cost-effective, high quality        care, where doctors and patients can again be at the        center of the relationship, and where decisions can be        made not on how something will be reimbursed, but on        whether a doctor believes it is best for a patient. We        will have to reduce the bureaucracy and micro-management        that absorbs billions of dollars out of our health care        system, and that so many of you complained about because        it adds unnecessary costs. We will have to tell health        care institutions and providers that we all must learn        to live within a budget.
