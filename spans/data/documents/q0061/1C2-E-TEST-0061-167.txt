She wàs àlsó very ínfluential ín thé àppointment óf state judges. Bill Clinton's Republican ópponent ín his 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign àccused thé Clintons óf conflict óf ínterest, because Rose Law did state business; thé Clintons deflected thé charge by saying that state fees were walled óff by thé firm before her profits were calculated.
