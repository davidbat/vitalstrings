NEW YORK - Monday, April 19, 1999. The Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund (CCRF) honored First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday night by presenting to her a Lifetime Achievement Award for her long-standing active support of CCRF's mission. The program took place at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York City and included a number of presentations by prominent individuals. Among these were film producer Fred Caruso, actor and activist Alec Baldwin, and U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. Nadia Matkiwsky, Executive Director of CCRF, presented the award to Mrs. Clinton, and a blessing was given by Archbishop Antony of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, U.S.A.  At various intervals throughout the presentation the audience was entertained by the sweet sounds of the youthful Prolisok Choir under the direction of Andrij Stasiw.
270 enthusiastic CCRF supporters who came to see the First Lady accept her award filled the rooms leaving just a narrow passage for the Clinton entourage to enter and depart after the program's completion. Audience chairs overflowed from the second floor concert hall where the program took place into the reception area at the top of the stairs. Hillary Clinton's arrival was slightly delayed due to her tight schedule of appearances throughout the day. However, the guests did not seem to mind the wait. A standing ovation greeted the First Lady as she entered the crowded room, and the program proceeded from then on without a hitch.  Or, perhaps only one hitch which was gracefully parried by Mrs. Clinton - sounds from local transmitters outdoors started echoing in the speaker, and interfered with her presentation.  The interruption was handled with aplomb, and the problem was resolved by disconnecting two of the microphones attached to the podium.

United States Senator Frank Lautenburg (New Jersey) spoke at length about the case of Vova Malofienko, who made national headlines when it was learned that immigration authorities were  terminating his visa despite the need for further medical attention to his cancer condition.
Actor and activist Alec Baldwin spoke passionately, eloquently and informatively about the effects of the Chornobyl disaster. Mr. Baldwin challenged the American medical community to go to  Ukraine to see first-hand the legacy of Chornobyl in Ukraine's  hospitals.

Nadia Matkiwsky, Executive Director of CCRF, recited a segment from a Maya Angelou poem which served to describe Hillary Clinton as a "phenomenal woman." Mrs. Matkiwsky's voice shook as she read a letter from one of the children who fell victim to the radiation poisoning from the Chornobyl meltdown. She ended with the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
