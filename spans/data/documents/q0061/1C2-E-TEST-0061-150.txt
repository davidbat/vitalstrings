Interesting how she “says” she is not for gay marriage…but the gays in NY put her in power.
Does everyone see the sham that the Clintons are?
I don’t believe anything that a Clinton says.

This only serves to rally Republicans more and more against her.  Think about the fundraising whatever Rep. nominee will get if they just show the picture of Hillary and Ellen talking side by side.
Dems are horrendously stupid if they pick this woman.  HORRENDOUSLY STUPID.
As  Democrat, I’d be livid….we’d have to live another 8 years of Republican rule.

The Gays put her in power in New York?
I had no idea The Gays were that powerful!
Who knew?

The gays put her in power? I thought the NY Republicans did.
Clinton won w/ 67% of the vote and, at best, lukewarm support from the ‘gays’, but thanks for the laugh. Who said Republicans have no sense of humor?

Hey Steve, the gays in NY didn’t put her in power, rural upstate New Yorkers did. And she’s far more popular in regularly leaning Republican parts of the state than Giuliani. Deal with it. And Howie, get over your Clinton phobia. If she wins the nomination she’ll crush whatever “pigmy” (to quote a true joke, Gingrich) the Republicans offer up. And I’m not even a Clinton fan, just a realist. How nice it would be for a few of them to be in charge of this country again. Let the grownups return, please.

Every time I see videos of women in Middle eastern countries covered in veils, I want to elect Hillary just so the misogynist leaders of those areas will have to deal with a powerful American woman! She’s also smarter than most of them.

Look I’m gay and realize we live in a simple minded democracy.If Hillary came out in support of gay marriage she would lose. We would have 4 more years of another Bush.
I think politically, she is saying what she can, given that people in this country are religious dimwits. Their holier than thou attitude about marriage unfortunately amounts to many votes.
The only we will get equal rights is to elect someone who will get us legal rights on the books. Then use the court system to prove it is not equal under the law. Sort of a segregation approach.
As ignorant as many people in this country are, there are equal amounts of ignorant homosexuals who choose to react, rather than think about the complex political realities of this country.

“The gays in NY put her in power?”
Just how many gay voters does NY State have to give our junior senator 67% of the vote (over 3 million votes) in 2006?
As for not believing anything a Clinton says, keep right on believing what Bush and Cheney are telling you; it’s a free country!

Men don’t want to see a woman in the White House, period.  Whether they will admit it or not (and most won’t because its politically incorrect).  So, be prepared for men to say they anything to disparage Hillary, and, of course, hold her to a higher standard than a man, just like every other woman that’s in a position of power.

“Mrs. Clinton also said she thinks defining marriage should be a state matter…”
Of course it should. But not education. Or health care. Or abortion. Or gun control. Or anything that the constitution says should be left to the states. Did somebody grind up the 10th amendment and slip a little into her morning coffee?

I have come to believe that there is always some sort of schizophrenia inhabiting all Clinton haters when eber their names come up in any piece. Never in my life have I ever seen professional haters and paid haters. Steve at No. 2 says no one should believe anything the Clintons say. He says so because Clinton is against Gay Marriage but pro-Civil Unions. Her position is clear. Let the States decide. the federal government has no business in people’s bedroom lives. Are you insinuating that she is pro-gay marriage and simply concealing the truth or what is your logic in the post? All these Clinton haters should go get a life. There is a reason why these republicans hate the Clintons. They made the government work well for the people. So, the Republicans were so disappointed given that they are so good in failed governments and have therefore become very allergic to anything that is pro-government. My Divine message is this: Hillary will be the nominee and ultimately, the President-Elect of the United States come 2008 and the President of the United States come January 2009. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Hillary R. Clinton. Did we just say Madam President? I can feel the Clinton haters fuming.

As a gay American, her position on gay marriage does not surprise me or concern me. If she came out for gay marriage there’s not a chance in the world she’d get elected. I’m just grateful that A) I can vote a Clinton; and B) That I will be voting (once again) with an absentee ballot from the Netherlands, where civil unions or gay marriage have been allowed for a decade now.

I dont usually read this website as I’m a UK citizen, and only came across this article from an Ellen Degeneres fansite, and I must say it’s a welcome breeze to read an article that is well constructed, formal and polite, unlike the usual trite I have to read. I believe, or at least speculate, that one of the main reasons Ellen Degeneres asked Hilary Clinton about gay issues is that viewers could submit questions to be asked, and I would suppose that a lot of viewers wanted to know Hilary’s position. For certain political talk is not Ms. Degeneres’ thing, but she has made infrequent references on her show, such as a monologue entitled ‘Why a woman president?’, plus both Bill and Hilary have been guests on her show previously. Well thanks for the low down on this episode.

Howie and Steve (and your dittoheads): As soon as the fly paper is hung you are immediately snared by your lust for the throat. Please say something sensible and thoughtful. You writings seem more appropriate for a supermarket tabloid cover.
