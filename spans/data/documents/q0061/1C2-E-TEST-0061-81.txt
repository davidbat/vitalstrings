Hillary Clinton: Being Vice President “Kind Of Like Being First Lady”…
Joe Biden last seen looking for a pair of size 12 slingback pumps .
Via Politico :
Mark Leibovich has a great read on Vice President Joe Biden’s difficulties transitioning into a second-tier role behind President Obama, in which the author describes the Veep’s “effort to subordinate his own voice (or manhood) to the broader enterprise” as “a struggle.”
The piece quotes Hillary Clinton, currently the most popular national figure and the looming figure over the 2016 sweepstakes, at various points, including this description of the VP’s role:
“Being a vice president is kind of like being a first lady,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said. “You are there to support and serve the president. There is no job description.”
It’s hard to see that making Biden feel better.
