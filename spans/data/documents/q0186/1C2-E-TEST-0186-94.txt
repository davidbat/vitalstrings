Aardvark
Description..
An  Aardvark The Aardvark, also known as the anteater, is a medium sized  mammal that has four legs and can be found in Africa. The aardvark is  pale yellowish gray in color,and often stained reddish-brown by soil.  The aardvark's coat is thin and the animal's main protection is its  tough skin. It has very large ears and a long snout. It has a long  tongue that can be up to 30 centimeters long, and they have long claws  that they dig with. Aardvarks are known for being able to dig very fast,  but they are slow otherwise.
Where does it live?
 The  Aardvark can be found in it's natural habitat in Africa. It lives in  grasslands, bushland, savanna, and woodland. The Aardvark is nocturnal,  meaning it comes out at night and sleeps during the day. They live by  themselves most of the time until they have children. They are said to  be shy animals. They dig burrows with their long claws and live there  with their children. In captivity Aardvark's can live up to about 10  years. The age average age it lives to be in the wild is unknown.
What does it eat?
An  aardvark comes out from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly  after sunset, and moves over a large range of land, swinging its long  nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food like ants and  termites. The Aardvark is a very fast digger and when a large amount of  ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into the dirt with its  powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for  predators. When the aardvark is successful in finding food, the  aardvark's long sticky tongue licks up the insects; the termites'  biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are useless because of the  Aardvark's tough skin. Its hearing warns it of predators: lions,  leopards, hyenas, and pythons.
How do they protect themselves?
Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude  enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail  and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all  fours. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.The aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and  pythons.
Reproduction.
The gestation in this species lasts between seven and nine  months,resulting in a birth of one cub.The young aardvark will remain in  the burrow for roughly two weeks or so before accompanying its mother  on night time foraging hunts.
                            African Wild Dog
African Wild Dog
Description.
The African wild dog also known as Cape hunting dogs or  painted dogs,have a mottled collection of  spots and colors on their coats.Adults typically weigh 37-79 pounds.A tall, lean animal, it stands about 30 inches at the shoulder,  with a head and body length averaging about 40 inches and a  tail of 12 to 18 inches.Animals in southern Africa are  generally larger than those in eastern or western Africa.
Where does it live?
They are primarily found in eastern and southern Africa, mostly in the two remaining large populations associated with the Selous game Reserve in Tanzania and the population centered in northern Botswana and eastern Namibia. Smaller but apparently secure populations of several hundred individuals are found in Zimbabwe, South Africa (Kruger National Park)and in the Ruaha/Rungwa/Kisigo complex of Tanzania. Isolated populations persist in Zambia, Kenya, and Mozambique.
What does it eat?
The African wild dog will eat impala, Thomson's Gazelle, Springbok and wildebeest calves.It sometimes hunts large birds, especially Ostriches.Some packs will also include large animals in their prey, such as zebras and warthogs.
How do they protect themselves?
They protect themselves by using their razor sharp teeth, claws, and speed,they can run 40 miles per hour.The African Wild Dog is endangered by human overpopulation,habitat loss,hunting,lions and hyenas.
Reproduction.
The African Wild Dog reproduces at any time of year, although mating  peaks between March and June during the second half of the rainy season.  Litters can contain 2-19 pups, though 10 is the most usual number.The time between births is usually 12–14 months, though it can also be  as short as 6 months if all of the previous young die. The typical  gestation period is approximately 70 days.Pups are usually born in an abandoned den dug by other animals such as those of the Aardvark.  Weaning takes place at about 10 weeks. After 3 months, the den is  abandoned and the pups begin to run with the pack. At the age of 8–11  months they can kill small prey, but they are not proficient until about  12–14 months, at which time they can fend for themselves.
                                Arctic Fox
Arctic Fox
Description.
Arctic foxes can be both gray-blue or white. The blue coloration is not as    common as white. The young of each color may occur in the same litter.    For the most part         Arctic foxes are snow-white in winter. During summer they become    gray-brown which helps them blend in with the area.The Arctic fox weighs about six to ten pounds. The arctic fox measures 75 -115 cm in length. The arctic fox's adaptation to its subzero climate    includes a compact body with short legs, thick fur, and densely    haired foot pads, which insulate the fox from the cold and provide    traction on ice.
Where does it live?
This small fox is native to Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is common throughout the Arctic tundra biome as well as the outer edges of Greenland,Russia,Canada, Alaska, and Svalbard, as well as in subarctic and alpne areas, such as Iceland and mainland alpine Scandinavia.
What does it eat?
The Arctic Fox will generally eat any meat it can find, including lemmings, Arctic hare, eggs, and arrion.  Lemmings are the most common prey. A family of foxes can eat dozens of  lemmings each day. During April and May the Arctic Fox also preys on ringed seal  pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are  relatively helpless. Fish beneath the ice are also part of its diet. If  there is an overabundance of food hunted, the Arctic Fox will bury what  the family cannot eat. When its normal prey is scarce, the Arctic Fox  scavenges the leftovers and even feces of larger predators, such as the polar bear, even though the bears' prey includes the Arctic Fox itself.
How do they protect themselves?
To protect themselves they have claw, sharp teeth and they can run faster than some other species of fox.Predators of the arctic fox include humans (due to major hunting),arctic wolves and polar bears. Young  foxes can also be carried away from their dens by golden eagles.
Reproduction.
The Arctic Fox tends to be active from early September to early May. The gestation period is 53 days. Litters tend to average 5-8 pups but may be as many as 25.Both the mother and the father help to raise their young. The females  leave the family and form their own groups and the males stay with the  family.
                               Arctic Hare
Arctic Hare
Description.
The Arctic hare usually stands 22-28 in tall and weigh about 9-12 lbs.They are brown in the summer and white in the winter.(much like the Arctic fox above).Their ears are longer than the average rabbits and are black at the tips year round.
Where does it live?
The arctic hare is distributed over the tundra regions of Greenland and the northernmost parts of Canada as well as Alaska and Scotland.
What does it eat?
Arctic hares eat mainly woody plants but also dine on buds, berries, leaves and grasses.In the early summer they eat purple saxifrage.
How do they protect themselves?
The arctic hare protects itself usually by digging holes under the ground or snow.As well as using speed,the Artcic hares can run 40 mph.Humans are predators who kill them for their skin.but its top predator is the Arctic wolf.
Reproduction.
Female hares give birth in spring or early summer.They can have up to eight baby hares called leverets.The  leverets stay within the mother's home range until they are old enough  to survive on their own.
 
Armadillo
Description.
The adult Armadillo is about two feet long and  weighs up to 15 pounds.They  have long, pig-like snouts with long, sticky tongues which they  use to root  their foods out of the ground.Armadillos  are about equal in size to  opossums, usually weighing between 8-17 pounds. Armadillos are gray,  brown or pink in color. They have armored plates that are something like a turtle’s shell, but much more  flexible.
Where does it live?
Armadillos,are found in North  America, from  Texas to New Mexico, into Oklahoma and Missouri, and then   extending over to Alabama,  Georgia  and Florida.Some are also found in South America.
What does it eat?
An Armadillos diet is 75% insects(its favorite meal) but they also feast on carrion, small mammals, reptiles, birds, eggs    and vegetable matter. They are very fond of crops, particularly peanuts, melons    and tomatoes.
How do they protect themselves?
When  threatened they roll into a tight ball. However, it usually prefers to avoid danger by  digging itself into the ground. When doing so in a dusty place, an armadillo simply holds its  breath for extended periods, just as it does in water.They have predators like wolves, coyotes, bears and wildcats but the risk are so few that the main threats  come from dogs, cars and human hunters.Also Humans consider them as pest and call exterminators to rid them from  their gardens.People tend to run over them with their cars as Armadillos  pay no attention when they are crossing the street.
Reproduction.
Gestation lasts anywhere from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation, so that the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the Armadillo family give birth to four identical quadruplets,but other species may have  typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born  with soft leathery skin, which hardens within a few weeks.Armadillos are  solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.
                                                Aye-Aye
Description.
Aye-ayes are dark brown or black and are distinguished by a bushy tail  that is larger than their body.They also feature big eyes, slender  fingers, and large, sensitive ears. Aye-ayes have pointed claws on all  their fingers and toes except for their opposable big toes, which enable  them to dangle from branches.The Aye-Aye's Head and body is 14 to 17 in,their Tail is between 22 to 24 in,and they typically weigh 4-6 lbs.
Where does it live?
The Aye-Aye's live in the rain forest on the east coast of Madagascar.
What does it eat?
The Aye-aye commonly eats nuts, grubs, fruits, nectar, seeds, and fungi, classifying it as an omnivore.  It often picks fruit off trees as it moves through the canopy, often  barely stopping to do so. An Aye-aye not lucky enough to live in its  natural habitat will often steal coconuts, mangoes, sugar cane, lychees and eggs from villages and plantations.
How do they protect themselves?
They retreat to the trees when danger is present and Hiss when threatened.Their predators are fossas and humans which usually kill them because of a superstition that the 4 to 6 pound animal is believed to creep into the houses of  villagers and use its peculiarly long middle finger to lance the hearts  of sleeping victims.
Reproduction.
They will mate any time of the year and give birth every 2-3 years.The  gestation period is 160-170 days and the young nurse up to one year.  Aye-aye females typically "park" their infants in the nest for a  majority of the first two months of life.
