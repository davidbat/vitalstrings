The majority of insectivorous bats hunt their prey              by chasing it down while flying. These insects are detected by the              bats echolocation. When using a bat detector a sound called a              feeding buzz can be heard as a bat homes in on an insect. This buzz              sounds like a zip being done.
INSECTS - ground  feeders
Some insect eating bats can land on the ground and              chase insects that live in leaf litter or similar places. One of              these bats called the Pallid Bat, from USA, loves to eat scorpions              and large centipedes. These bats seem to be immune to the stings of              scorpions and the poisonous bits of big centipedes. Pallid Bats              always have scars on their wing membranes from bites and          stings.
NECTAR
Not only butterflies and bees drink nectar from              flowers. The Australian Southern Blossom Bat, the smallest fruit bat              at only 3 inches, comes to flowers, at night, to drink nectar. The              plants that bats come to, only release their nectar at night along              with a strong scent for them to home in on. Nectar feeding bats have              very long tongues to enable them to get something to eat from              nectarines deep inside flowers.
POLLEN
This group of bats is very important for pollinating              many of the exotic fruits we eat. Mangoes and bananas are two of the              better-known fruits. Pollen bats have tongues that are adapted to              feeding on pollen by having 'brushes' to collect the grains.
FRUIT
Fruit bats help in the re-growth of rainforests              where slash and burn farming takes place. These bats deposit large              amounts of seeds in their droppings as they fly to and from trees              that have ripe fruit. At one time fruit farmers thought that fruit              bats only ate ripe fruit but recent studies have shown that they eat              more over ripe fruit.
FROGS
Frog-eating bats hang from branches that overhang              ponds and slow running streams. They listen for frogs croaking and              home in on them. These bats can even distinguish edible frogs from              poisonous ones.
FISH
Fisherman bats fly low over rivers and ponds              'looking' for ripples on the surface that indicate something is just              below the surface. As they get close to the food item the drop their              feet into the water and trawl for the fish. Fisherman Bats have              adapted to this method of feeding by having very big feet, long toes              and sharp toe nails
RODENTS
Mammals like mice and small rats are the favorite              food for some bats. These bats have evolved to be very agile on the              ground and can run after their prey
BATS/BIRDS
Some bats eat other bats by catching them as they              fly around doing their own thing.
BLOOD
Probably the most famous bat in the world is the              Vampire which lives in Central and South America. There are 3              species of Vampire, the Common, the Hairy legged and the              White-winged. The latter two specialise in feeding on the blood of              exotic birds but sometimes they are attracted to farmyard birds. The              Common Vampire feeds mainly on mammal blood and due to deforestation              they are coming into close contact with people. Vampires are the              most agile bat while on the ground. They are able to jump forwards              and backwards quickly and find it very easy to fly from the            ground.
