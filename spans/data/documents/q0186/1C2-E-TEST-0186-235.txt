Manchester
22/4/2010
The Café in the back of Blackwell's, (or Everyman's) is a favourite haunt of students, lecturers and shoppers alike, and is nearly always packed with customers, munching their way through plates mounded with salads, quiches, fish and fresh, warm bread.
When I first started at the University of Manchester, the Blackwell's café quickly became a favourite haunt of mine for lunch away from the business of University Place. Although I only went once a week (if that), it was a much-loved treat of mine, and friends, to meet for a splurge lunch in the Café. Unfortunately, the café is not particularly cheap, especially compared to the University eateries, but the quality and standard of food is very high, and you can be guaranteed a good meal.
The staff, although rushed off their feet, are friendly and accommodating, and will tailor a meal to suit your personal tastes. The venue, on the other hand, is small and cramped, and as one wall is effectively a big window, can get very, very hot when the sun is out. The greenhouse effect lives on in Blackwell's café! Aside from that, it is well worth a visit!
