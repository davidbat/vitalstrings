ohh, this one is weird... i look at it as a piece of uncommon animal, because that is i guess not available in the philippines.. though i used to see it on the glossy-paged large animal book i had when i was a kid, it perplex me most still, how they grew such a long snout and a swift moving spiky tongue!!

do you base what you perceive as normal as what is in the Philippines? as an Island (or i guess archipelago - several islands) they probably have a large amount of animals that are different from ones on mainlands (see Darwin's finches)

We have a relative of that here in the Philippines.It can be found in Palawan. It is called "balinton" locally. As far as I remember it's called scaly anteater in English. It is smaller than that animal in the picture but it has a snout similar to that, it has scales that serve as armor, it curls into a tight ball when threatened.
