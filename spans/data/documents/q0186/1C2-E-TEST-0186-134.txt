01. Copper Sunset The best beginning, this initial keyboard, Steve Milliner knew a bit of the thing, heavier which great guitar 'rockeira' thereabouts. I think which straight inheritance of the doideras of Keith Emerson (And, L*P) what always investigated these things. The melody after that is well 60's with a few keyboards more 'calminhos' low one more the touched one for sensational Stan Aldous. The vocal of Dave Skillin and the battery of Frank Clark, they are not so virtuous, but they are good anyway. The final part reminded of me a little The Doors.
02. Very Nice Of You you it Call That one from here is totally psychedelic (not in the crazy sense of the thing), it reminded of me the Love and the Strawberry Alarm Clock, with very legal melodies and that thing what them 60's they had average 'cheerfully'. A beautiful ground of piano in the middle of the song, this refrain that sticks in the mind, and an end that, unfortunately, finishes in predestines in October. Great sound!
03. Many Things you it Of Face, this is Iron Butterfly in the last one, those riffs that should be touched by guitars, but what the keyboard operators do it and with pride. I find that sensational! Riff on top of riff the faces is building a belt with heavy and interesting climate.
04. Greencap I felt Keith's tip again in these keyboards, and the 'effect' is brilliant in the voice to sing the first verse, sensationally. In the second verse we have a more 'romantic thing. The grounds finish having a little bit of guitar in the sound incialmente, only then the fact is that we give real attention. After a totally instrumental part and let's say quite 'strange', they turn the vocal ones with effects of the beginning, they should have appeared more for the belt.
05. I Can't Stop The keyboard travel of the beginning hands over almost classic influences this way (since it was of waiting from any keyboard operator whom s value highly). Several brilliant keyboards this way. When the verse begins of truth the keyboards are party-going, full of riffs and onomatopoeic.
06. Outing After the counting be prepared for Rock and roll. Vocal comic and very legal many people. In fact that one is to more travel of the disc. Flood of noises, passages and great madness. Inclusive of all the wrapped musicians.
07. Once Upon A Hill Corrected in the madness of Outing, Once Upon A Hill is pretty, it reminded of me the Family. Calm and with vocal quite emotional the music follows in a style Lullaby (Lullaby). In the final organ of church to cheer up the day and .
08. Put That In Your Pipe To close bargain with the last belt of the disc, which it follows with the organ of quite organized way up to what. A riff of the infernos, quick and crazy counts seizure of the belt, with a gigantic distinction for the bear Stan Aldous, he is simply brilliant in the base that he created, totally insane! Meanwhile in another corner Steve Milliner goes flat like a madman in his keys full of sounds, they are his variable newspaper commentaries.Some duels of melodies are always very quite arrived, legal same is the bumbo without stopping of Frank Clark (what nomezinho eh!). That one binds that an instrumental one of the infernos is, and look, very well.
This band is totally unknown and go there, it is not well prog, but for the one who likes a sound bark 60's early 70's it can come without fear.
