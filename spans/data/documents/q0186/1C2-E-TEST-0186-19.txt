I think that anteaters eat other things than ants. I think that because the video kind of showed me that they live by trees and by trees there is not a lot of insects or ants.

You’re absolutely right, Julia Renee!  Anteaters eat other types of insects (and other foods), too!  We thought it was really interesting to learn that anteaters who live in zoos also like to eat things like ground beef and dry dog food!  Thanks so much for leaving us a comment today!

Hi Wonderopolis,
I am not with my third graders because I am working with some great science teachers in Tiburon, CA.  The teachers are from all over the United States. I introduced them to your site and they love it.  I am so impressed with your work and am excited that more and more students will be discovering you.

No, because if we would eat watermelons would we be called watermeloneaters? They can eat termites, soft-bobied grubs, soft fruits and birds’ eggs. In the zoo anteaters eat fruits, hard boiled eggs, ground beef, and dog kibble, too.

Dear Wonderopolis,
I know tommorow’s wonder is about Halloween.

Hello, Sarah!  You’ll have to check back to see if your guess is correct about Wonder of the Day® #393.  We think you’re really smart, though, and will be happy to see what the next Wonder will be!

If my name was named after a food it would either be a bananaeater or a macaroniandcheeseeater. I thought anteaters only eat ants and termites, not soft-bodied grubs, soft fruits and birds’ eggs. I really learned a lot about anteaters today.

Cool!
At first I thought they were disgusting, but now they look cute!
How do they sense the ants, anyway?
Wonderopolis
31. Oct, 2011 at 9:38 am
That’s a GREAT question, Moa!  We think it’s part instinct, part appetite, and a super sense of smell that helps the anteaters know where the ants and other bugs are!  Thanks so much for hanging out in Wonderopolis today!

Does the snorkel thing really work?
Wonderopolis

Hello, Samrox667!  Thanks so much for your comment today!  We’ve seen some anteaters swim at the zoo, and they’re very good at it!  Sometimes, their heads go under the water and only their long noses stick out!  We bet it sure helps to have a built-in snorkel when you want to go for a swim!

How do they use the snorkel?
Wonderopolis

Hi there, Emily!  Anteaters don’t use real snorkels, but they use their long noses to help them breathe while they’re swimming!  They stick their noses out of the water and up into the air!

Wow, I think that this was a really cool wonder of the day.  I had no idea that Anteaters could swim.  I didn’t really even know that Anteaters could even touch the water.  Two facts that I learned were that the bigger Anteaters sleep above ground and all the other Anteaters sleep below ground.  Do the bigger Anteaters just sleep above the ground just because they need more space and light?  I also learned that Anteaters can swallow up to 35,000 ants and termites a day.  I didn’t know that Anteaters ate that many ants and termites everyday.  In my opinion, I think that Anteaters are kind of cute and kind of scary just a little bit.  One time, I got to sleep at the zoo.  It was a zoo camp in for Indian Princess and we got to see an Anteater.  It was kind of creepy because it came quite close to me and I didn’t know what it was going to do.  So, I was a little creeped out.  Thanks, and I enjoyed this wonder of the day.

We think it is REALLY neat that you got to get close to an anteater, Alexandra!  What a great adventure you had getting to spend the night at the zoo…it sounds like so much FUN!  We appreciate it when our Wonder Friends make personal connections to the Wonders of the Day and share them with us in a comment!  Thank you for doing that today!

Dear Wonderopolis,
Wow, I think that was a really cool wonder of the day.  I had no idea that anteaters could swim.  I didn’t really even know that anteaters could touch water.  I didn’t know that they sleep above ground and all the ants that they ate.  I know why people don’t invite anteaters for picnics, because they are disturbing.  I think my name would be the pancakeeater.  I never knew that anteaters can be called antbears.  I never knew there was such thing as a giant anteater, silky anteaters, and collared anteaters.  Now I know silky aneaters are the smallest of all.  I never knew that vermilingua meant worm tongue.  I didn’t know that anteaters didn’t have any teeth.  I knew anteaters had sharp claws.  This is how you say anteaters in Spanish: osos hormigueros. Thanks for a really good wonder video!

Hi, Marco!  Thanks for leaving us this comment today…it was AWESOME!  We like how you shared all the awesome things you learned about anteaters, and some of the things you already knew before you visited this Wonder.  We liked learning how to say “anteater” in different languages, too!  Thank you for sharing how to say “anteater” in Spanish!  You are a GREAT Wonder Friend!
