Stewie was offered a lick of cream cycle but was startled and clawed the whole thing off the stick. He then was eating it and started doing the OMG it's cold dance. I have et to get that on film. My dad was concerned and asked what he was doing. The explanation of brain freeze got the point across and made for a laugh. This was m attempt to recreate the dance but it didn't happen.
