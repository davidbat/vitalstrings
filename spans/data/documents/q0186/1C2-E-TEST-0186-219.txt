Brookfield Zoo announced the arrival of the first aardvark born at the suburban Chicago facility in a decade Wednesday .
According to the zoo, the baby aardvark was born on Jan. 12 at 4.5 pounds, and was already 13 pounds on Wednesday. Its mother, Jessi, and its father, Hoover, were part of a breeding program and on loan from other zoos.
The aardvark has not been named yet, and its gender has not been determined. After a few more months of around-the-clock care, the aardvark will be shown at the zoo.
For now, however, Brookfield Zoo has provided some pretty adorable pictures:
