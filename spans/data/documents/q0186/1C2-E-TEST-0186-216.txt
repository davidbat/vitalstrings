A Pinker Tomorrow: In a distant, bleak, future, Pink Panther wakes up to a colorless world that's ruled by Big Nose's big-brained dog, who commands him to strip Pinky of his color after he finds himself able to spread colorÂ all over town. A battle ensues, and Pinky is victorious when he uses paint and music to get the better of the villains. He rejoices before losing his own color, only to find it was all a dream. Pinky is delighted to see the surrounding modern day neighborhood full of color with the lone exception being Big Nose's house, which he's painting gray. And it looks like he's being mentally commanded by his big-brained dog, who's lurking in the shadows. Awful Aardvark: An angry aardvark with a moustache storms into the jungle looking for his skateboard and puts a scare into the other animals in the process. Ant eventually finds it before losing it to the others, who are in service to Aardvark, thinking he's Awful Aardvark. Confusion arises when they see the two aardvarks, who battle to determine which is Awful. Aardvark is discovered as the phony, but Awful finds himself fearful of Awful Ant (also having a moustache), who orders him to clean up the jungle after the battle. The other animals then chase Aardvark after he deceived them. Pinkular Mechanics: Pink Panther's scooter breaks down, so he tries to repair it. He finds a couple of gremlin-like creatures in the engine and tries to remove them. Eventually they leave, only to learn that they get bigger when they're in contact with water. They run wild in the city, eating all sorts of metal in their path, and get even larger when Big Nose tries to spray them with a fire hydrant. Afterward, they're big enough to begin eating the entire city, but Pinky has the solution to get them back down to size by using a hair drier to shrink them down.moreless
