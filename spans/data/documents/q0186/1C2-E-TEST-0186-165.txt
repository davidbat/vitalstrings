GOT HEARTBURN? DIGEST THIS!
The National Heartburn Alliance is funded by companies selling remedies for acid indigestion caused by hard to digest foods.
Their gut response to heartburn resulted in a recent press release that linked food consumption with heartburn. The headline:
"25 Million Americans Suffer From Heartburn on    a Daily Basis - and Most Say The Foods They Eat    Are to Blame!"
If you have heartburn, it's really no comfort in swallowing each dose of their marketing with your doses of extra-strength Pepto Bismol!

My father used to experience heartburn. Gastric reflux. Indigestion. That is, until he eliminated ice cream, cheesecake, sherbet, and his traditional glass of milk after every meal.
Doctors convinced dad that there was something pathologically wrong with his stomach. Thousands of dollars of doctor visits and tests, and an equal investment in medications could not cure his condition. One week of NOTMILK made all the difference in the world.
The National Heartburn Alliance has printed a new guidebook alerting consumers as to which foods cause heartburn. Consider this point. If this book cures all heartburn, who will need their heartburn medications?

Their advice is to stop heartburn before it starts. Certain foods and beverages cause heartburn more often than others.
Their color-coded brochure divides all foods into three categories, red (stop, you may want to reconsider this choice), yellow (consume with discretion), green (generally a go, with little potential to cause or aggravate heartburn). They include seven categories of food, and here is how they rate dairy products:
Red is sour cream, milk shake, ice cream, regular cottage cheese.
Yellow is yogurt, 2% milk, skim milk, frozen yogurt, low fat cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, mozzarella (beware of the pizza!)
Green is fat-free cream cheese, feta cheese, goat cheese, fat-free sour cream, low fat soy cheese.
Remarkably, the heartburn people do not even list whole milk. Using their logic, fatty foods warrant the highest level of warning. They give a yellow warning to low fat and no-fat milks. Why no "red" warning to whole milk?
Whether you believe that the world was created in just seven days by an all-knowing God, or that we evolved over the course of the eons, you must respect the profound brilliance of that mechanism by which mammals feed their infants. Milk is more than just food. Milk contains hormones, lactoferrins, and immunoglobulins which nurture the young of each species for which it was so designed. In order to protect those substances which are produced specific to the young of each species, milk must also create an environment in which those critically important substances survive digestive processes.
Nature's perfect plan creates a scenario in which the nursing infant eats only one food in his or her formative years: milk from mom. Infant anteaters eat no ants. Infant Grizzlies eat no honey, berries, or salmon. Infant cats eat no mice. Infant dogs eat no Alpo. Infant cows chew no grass.
When milk is the only substance in a stomach, the gastric acid is neutralized, or buffered. This weakens the potential of acid so that gentle proteins in milk survive, intact, and deliver those profound messages for which they were designed.
Here is the key, then, to heartburn. Milk stops digestion long enough for the substances that nurture and protect an infant to survive.
Milk should not be combined with grass or dead animal flesh or grains or insects. Milk was designed to be in the stomach with absolutely no other substances.
When milk is combined with other foods, milk prevents the stomach from doing the job for which it was designed.
Once an infant begins to eat solid foods, that is the time that the brilliantly designed hormonal delivery system should end. This basic advice should be applied to all species of mammal. Most species of mammal possess the wisdom to grasp this law of nature. One species does not.
Doctors and scientists lack the vision to recognize this most basic concept and plan. Such simplicity. Such brilliance of design.
If you continue to drink milk, and experience the pains of improper digestion, try this simple experiment. It works for all humans.
Enjoy this evening's meal. Eat whatever you would normally eat. Have seconds. Eat no dairy products.
Tomorrow evening, eat exactly the same meal that you enjoyed this evening. Have ice cream for dessert. Follow that with a tall glass of milk.
You will have created an environment in which your stomach acid has been neutralized. Your food will sit in the stomach and begin to ferment and putrefy. You will suffer discomfort. You may even suffer heartburn.
Teach yourself something that physicians rarely learn in medical school. You are your own best doctor. Listen to your body's clues. Act accordingly.
