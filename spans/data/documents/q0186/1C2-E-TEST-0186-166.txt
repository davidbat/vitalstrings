 
Location and Habitat
Aardvarks are located throughout central and southern Africa, south of the Sahara Desert.  They are   found in several different habitats including savannas and brushlands, and sometimes rainforest.   Aardvarks inhabit many of the same areas that lions, hyenas and cheetahs inhabit, and will often   fall prey to these animals.  This makes aardvarks necessary to the food chain in Africa.
Diet
Aardvarks feed on termites and ants.  They are specialized in feeding on these insects.
Size and Description
There are not many animals in the animal kingdom that resemble aardvarks.  Their name, which means   "earth pig", is derived from a South African language called Afrikaans.
Their odd appearance begins with their large ears.  Aardvarks will use their large ears to help them   hear insects in the ground or any predators that are nearby.  Aardvarks need to be able to hear well   as they are nocturnal animals, which means they come out of their burrows at night.  Large ears may   also help keep aardvarks cool in hot African climates, though they rarely come out during the day.
Aardvarks have long, cylindrical, pig-like noses that they use to help locate their next meal.  Once   they have located a termite or other insect mound, they will use their shovel-like claws to dig through   the clay and the mud to break into the mound.  Aardvarks have long, sticky tongues that they can then use   to grab the insects and eat them.
Aardvarks have two eyes, one located on either side of their long snouts.  Aardvarks' eyesights are poor,   and are mostly reliant on their excellent hearing for protection and direction.
Aardvarks grow to be between 4 and 5 feet in length.  Their tails can be as long as two feet.
Behaviors
Aardvarks will also use their claws to dig burrows.  They will stay and sleep in these burrows during the   daytime, and then come out at night to search for food.
Other Facts
Aardvarks are the only members of the order "Tublidentata.
