Does the Termite have a natural predator?
We have/had termites in our home and I was wondering if there is a natural predator to the termite. Since the termites have been poisoned we seem to have much more Ant activity around the home. We have lived in this house for 20 years but I've never seen so many ants all of a sudden. Do ants eat termites and their eggs.
