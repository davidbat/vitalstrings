Geez Louise…no one ever gives away a stuffed tamandua.  It’s always the monkeys – they get alllllllllll the attention and I’m left in the dark sucking up ants butts.  Where’s the justic in this world ??

Hey Neotorama ! Yea , I’m talking to you  ! A stuffed monkey ?OHHHHHHHHH I didn’t read the fine print I thought I was going to have a real monkey.  Damn, I was hoping for monkey stew tonight – eating ants gets quite tedious, ya know ?  Try sucking up ants for a living, it’s just a not a way to go through life.

After performing Shakepeare  for nearly an hour, Mr. Tamandua refused his manager’s request to go back on stage for an encore exclaiming, “Until you stop paying me in dollars and start paying me in Euros I’ll be in burrow until further notice – I will not be a victim of the exchange rate any longer !!!”

Latest report from the Globe Theater in London:
Mr. Tamandua refuses all Paparazzi attempts for questioning until learning that the Discovery channel was lurking in the back alley.    After a moments thought he waves his manager over and yells ” Hey Murray get the limo around back and tell the Discovery Channel I’ll meet them down the street, tell them to have the cash ready and I’ll give them some good money shots”…..      Those Americans…. anything for cash…. just because I’m South American doesn’t mean I don’t have standards.
