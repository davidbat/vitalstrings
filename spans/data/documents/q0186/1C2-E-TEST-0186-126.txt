What Do Frogs Eat and What Eats Frogs?

A lot of people have no idea that frogs are not only the prey of many         larger animals, but also what frogs eat exactly.  Have you ever had         a pet frog?  If not, that you are probably not familiar with the         fact that frogs actually do eat other live prey and are definitely not         vegetarians by any means.  Insects, snails, spiders, worms and even         small fish have all been known to be part of a frog’s diet and while         some bigger frogs had been known to go after something as big as a         mouse, there are still those frogs that just stick to insects.   
One of the neat facts about how frogs eat   is that they have no teeth.  Similar to snakes, frogs have to   swallow their entire meal whole because they can not chew anything.  Usually, frogs will only use the upper jaw to hold onto their prey, it   is not used for biting or chewing at all.  One of the most   memorable things that people usually pick up on is the sticky tongue   that all frogs have.  This tongue takes less than a second to roll   out and once it is out, whichever insect they are attempting to catch   will not have any time at all to react.   
Another cool fact about how frogs eat is         the fact that their eyes help them swallow.  As you may have         noticed in some of the photographs of frogs up close, when frogs eat,         their eyes actually sink through the opening of their skull in order         force the food to go down their throat.  This is one of the main         reasons why it seems as if frogs are constantly blinking while they are         eating.   
When it comes down to it, frogs are         pretty low on the food chain.  Now, they do have a few defense         mechanisms, such as their color being able to change and the fact that         they are so fast in their jumping ability, but in general, there are         many different animals that make frog part of their diet.  
Snakes, foxes, dogs, bass, pike, hawks         and even seagulls have all been known to fest on frogs on a regular         basis, but there are many humans that have made frogs part of their         diet.  In France, frog legs are definitely one of the top menu         items in some of the best French restaurants.  While you may think         that most of the water frogs may be safe from creatures attempting to         make a meal out of them, water frogs are usually a regular diet for many         of the sharp-toothed fish and even sharks in the world.   
If you are out hunting for a frog to make         it part of your dinner, be sure that you are watching out for the         poisonous frogs.  While poisonous frogs do not make their home in         every single state, you still need to be careful and read up on the         colors of frogs.  Many red, blue, purple and even bright green         frogs can be extremely poisonous to us humans.
