I would suggest getting rid of the problem for good by getting rid of the ants rather than just getting something to eat them. You can put down chemical baits, but if you're looking for an all natural method, put ground cayenne pepper down. It really messes up their senses and they won't cross over it, thus preventing them from coming into the home. Put a solid line around the home and you should be all set, don't forget to reapply after soaking rainstorms since they will dilute the spice.
