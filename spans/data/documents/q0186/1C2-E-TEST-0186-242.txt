Review of Aardvark Kennels from 15 May 2011
A couple of weeks ago I was looking for a new bichon frise puppy . When I saw the add from Aardvark kennels and saw the picture of 3 handsome bichon frise males I called up and asked when I could visit and see the puppies. The following Saturday I took an hour drive from Surrey to Aardvark. When we arrived a very kind helpful man took us out back to look at the puppies. Out back we were greeted by lots of lovely healthy playful puppies of different breeds which were all happy to see the kind man and ourselves . The puppies in the bichon frise unit were very alert and joyful . We were passed a puppy each to hold so that we could choose our new puppy. The choice was extremely difficult although we did finally have a favourite . We purchased the puppy and we have now taken him home to our other bichon frise Snowy that is 4 years old . They bonded very quickly and know are extremely good friends. We have now had our new puppy , Sonny , for a week and he is very playful healthy and intelligent Puppy. Sonny is 13 weeks and is getting his 2nd injection very soon so he can go outside . I would strongly recommend Aardvark kennels and deeply hope anyone wishing to purchase a puppy would come here
