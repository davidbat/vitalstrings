Right.  When you spend a substantial amount of money on a product, you
expect that.  But then, with a lot of those products (and a lot of those
operating systems), you got the source code anyway, along with the deal.
Somewhere around here I have the VMS 4.7 source code on microfiche.  It
cost us something like $200k when we got it.  It was worth every penny
of that in being able to customize and maintain systems.
Now that computer systems are much cheaper and the labor to update and
maintain them is more expensive, it makes even more sense for vendors
to make this sort of thing available.

They are very popular, and there is a wide variety of different systems.
Some of them just change a few engine parameters, some of them completely
replace the software.  Some of them replace the software in such a way
that you can plug a laptop into the ECU and change the gains on the fly
while driving.  Then there are systems which completely replace the ECU
itself with their own processor, which are very popular among the NASCAR
crowd.

That's why you spend $300 for the shop manual.  Or get the dealer to throw
one in for free when you buy the car.
