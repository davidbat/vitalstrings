Description:
This is the smallest species of anteater, ranging from 13-20                      inches long, with a 12 inch tail, and weighing 6-13 ounces.                      It has golden-brown fur that it uses for camouflage. It has                      a short tube-like pink nose and a prehensile tail. The forefeet                      each have a large claw. The hind feet each have small claws                      used for climbing branches.
Habitat and Range:
These anteaters can be found in forests from southern Mexico                      to Bolivia and Brazil. They can be found in Ceiba (kapok)                      trees, which provide excellent camouflage because the sheen                      of its seed pods and the silky fur of the anteater are almost                      identical.
Diet:
Strictly insectivorous, the silky anteater feeds on ants,                      termites, and beetles. An anteater will eat from 100 to 8000                      ants per day.
Behavior:
This usually solitary animal is arboreal, slow-moving, nocturnal,                      and almost never descends to the ground. Due to predators,                      the silky anteater never stays in the same tree for more than                      one day.
Communication:
When defending itself, the silky anteater will stand on                      its hind legs, grasping tree limbs with its hind feet and                      prehensile tail, and raising its fore feet to its head, it                      will slash predators with its large claws.
Reproduction:
The gestation period for a silky anteater is 120-150 days.                      One young is born and placed in a nest of dry leaves in a                      hole in a tree trunk. Both parents raise the young; the male                      even sometimes carries the young on his back.
Species Status:
These anteaters are not threatened. However, this is a very                      secretive and solitary species, which makes a census very                      difficult. Also this species has a poor husbandry record in                      captivity, seldom surviving for more than 30 days. The longevity                      record for this species in captivity is two years and four                      months.
Interesting Facts:
This animal is sometimes hunted by natives for food. It                      is reported to defecate only once a day. Some of the feces                      examined by scientists, showed a large quantity of exoskeleton                      fragments of insects, indicating that the Silky Anteater does                      not possess either chitinase or chitobiase, digestive enzymes.
