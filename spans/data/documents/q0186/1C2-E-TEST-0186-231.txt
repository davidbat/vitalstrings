Chrono Trigger Game Script Apathetic Aardvark  Before we start, Chrono Trigger involves seven characters of which only three  may be in the main party at any time.  Characters not in the main party do not  say things during the respective chats.  Since seldom are all three characters  chosen for a player, the dialogue will be slightly different depending who is  in the party.  There are also a few times when choosing yes or no to a  particular question will send them game in very different paths, listings for  both results of very important choices will be done as well.  It is also  useful to know Crono isn't very well known for his conversational skills.   Almost every line he says during the entire game is an assumed line which does  not really occur in the script.  For instance, someone may say "Nice Day  Crono, right?" and then the same person will follow it up with "..." which is  when Crono is saying his bit and then follow it up again with "Yeah, I think  so too, lets play!" Without any further delay:  Game -----  Doves fly high in the sky over some sort of carnival.  It is a fair to  celebrate the year, 1000 A.D.  Fireworks are going off into the sky, bells  ring.  It looks like such a great time, but one boy is still in bed.  Crono's Mom: Crono...  Crono!  Good morning, Crono!  Come on, sleepy head!   Get up!  She opens his curtains.  Crono's Mom: Ah, Leeneâ€™s Bell makes such a beautiful music!  You were so  excited about the Millennial Fair that you didn't sleep well, did you...?  I  want you to behave yourself today!  Let's get moving, now!  She walks down the stairs and Crono gets out of bed, stretches out and is  set.  Crono goes downstairs.  Crono's Mom: Finally!  By the way, that inventor friend of yours...  Uh... you  know...!  Oh, dear, I've forgotten her name! [Name selection screen].  That's  right, Lucca!  Don't forget that she invited you to see her new invention!   Run along now, and be back before dinner.    Crono heads to the fair, which is at Leene Square.  Crono will wander around  until he collides with a girl.  Girl: Hey!!  Ouch, that hurt!  The bell rings.  Girl: I'm so sorry!  Are you okay?  Uh oh... My pendant!  She looks around for it.  Girl: Oh, no!  Don't tell me I lost it.  Crono finds it nearby and returns to her.  Girl: Oh, thank goodness!  My pendant!  It has a lot of sentimental value!   May I have it back? [yes]  I came to see the Festival!  You... live in this  town, don't you?  I feel a little out of place here.  Would you mind if I  walked around with you for a while? [sure] [all excited] You're a true  gentleman!  Oh, by the way... MY name is, er... [Name selection screen] ...  um, Marle!  And you're? Crono? What a nice name!  Pleased to meet you!  Now,  lead on!  Many nearby people will hint that Lucca's invention is done and that Crono  should go see her test it, which is further north inside the fair grounds.   Crono runs towards it.  Marle: Hold your horses!  I want to get some candy.  Marle shops for candy, though she is rather slow.  Marle: Hi!  I'd like some of this.  Lady: Sure, young lady.  Marle [To Crono]: Thanks for waiting!  They exit up to a screen with Lucca and Taban along with two very odd looking  machines.  Taban: Step right on up, any of you who have the time and the courage!  Our  Super Dimension Warp is the invention of the century!  To use it, jump up  here... and you'll get teleported here!  it's the masterwork of my beautiful  daughter, Lucca.  Crono approaches him.    Taban: Give it a try, kid?  Oh, it's you, Crono!  He walks up to Lucca.  Lucca: Crono!  Where have you been!?  No one wants to try the Telepod!  How  about you?  Marle: It looks like fun!  I'll watch while you try it out!  Lucca steps out of the left pod.  Lucca: Just hop onto the left pod!  Crono walks onto it.  Taban flips a switch.  Taban: All systems on!  Lucca: Begin energy transfer!  Crono is teleported from the left pod to the right pod.  The few people watching: Oh wow.  That was GREAT!  Marle: What a kick!  I want to try it, too!  Lucca: Huh?  Hey Crono, how did you pick up a cutie like her?  Marle: Hang on, Crono!  I'll be right there!  Taban: Behold, ladies and gentlemen, as this vision of loveliness stops aboard  the machine!  Marle: Don't go away.  I'll be right back!  Taban: You're sure about this...?  There's still time to change your mind!   Marle: No way!  Throw the switch!  Marle steps in the left pod.  Taban: Okay, everyone, let's give her a great big hand when she reappears!  He flips the switch, it powers up.  Taban: All systems on!  Lucca: Begin energy transfer!  Her pendant begins to flash.  She is not teleported.  Marle: What's happening?  My pendant... it's...  She starts to spin, the machine begins to fry.  Lucca: Huh?  Lucca and Taban run away from it, some sort of gateway Portal opens, Marle  vanishes inside of it.  Her pendant falls onto the platform.  Taban: Lucca!  Where is she?!  Show's over, folks!  Let's head along now!  Everyone except for Taban, Lucca and Crono leave.  Taban: What's going on Lucca?  WHERE IS SHE?  Lucca: The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod!  The warp  field seemed to be affected by her pendant...  Taban: What are we going to do now?  Lucca: She's so familiar!  I KNOW I've seen her somewhere...   Crono grabs the pendant and stands in the Telepod.  Lucca: Crono!  Taban: You're actually going to do it?!  What a fine lad!  Lucca: Listen!  I don't know where this machine is going to send you, but we  haven't any other choice.  Taban: Won't they both be lost?  Lucca: This is our only hope!  That pendant seems to be the key, so hang on to  it Crono, and brace yourself!  Taban starts up the machine.  Taban: All systems on!  Lucca: Begin energy transfer!  Power to full!  Taban: Roger!  Lucca: More!  Give me more power!  Taban: Roger!  The machine begins to short out the way in which it did when Marle was in it.  Lucca: There!  We did it!  Crono spins and the same Gateway Portal opens.  Lucca: I'll follow you after I know what went wrong.  Good luck, Crono!  Crono is sucked into the Gateway Portal as well.  He travels for a long time.   He winds up in what looks to be the same area, though the scenery has changed  substantially.  He is immediately attacked by some enemies.  Soon he'll exit  to see the Guardia Castle and Truce Village, though something is different.   Word from the townspeople of Truce speak that the year is still 600 A.D.  At  this time, the 21st King of Guardia is still fighting a war against Magus and  the Mystics.  The Queen recently returned to the castle after having been gone  for quite some time.  Crono rushes towards the Guardia Castle; he is stopped  at the gates.  Soldier: Halt!  Who goes there!    Soldier 2: Check out that hair!  Where're you from, son?  Are you one of  Magus's troopers?  Soldier: Hardly!  This kid never would have made the cut!  Show us your stamp  collection, son!  Crono of course has no idea what they are talking about.  Soldier 2: Har, har!  Now beat it, shrimp!  Queen: Stop that at once!  Soldier: Queen Leene!  The queen walks to the gates.  She is very beautiful and looks quite familiar.  Queen: Show your manners!  This is a friend of mine!  Soldier: But there's something odd about him!    Queen: You refuse to obey my orders?!  The soldier on the left kneels.  Soldier: Forgive me, my lady!  Please enter, sir!  Queen: *Giggle*  She turns around and enters the castle, when Crono gets there she is no where  to be seen.  There is a King and Chancellor also in the room.  Rumor around  the castle says the Chancellor has been acting rather odd visiting the  Cathedral frequently.  Eventually Crono will find his way to the Queen's royal  chambers.  Queen: Ah!  There you are.  [To guards and Maids] Please lave us.  I need to  talk to this individual.  Attendants: Certainly, your Highness.  They all leave.  Queen: Come nearer, Sir.  *giggle* Fooled you, didn't I, Crono?    The queen did look familiar, she's Marle!  Marle: It's me!  But everyone calls me, Leene!  I'm so relieved you're here!   We barely know each other, but somehow, I knew you'd come for me...  Thank  you, Crono!  The room dims.  Marle: S, something's wrong!!!  W, what's happening?!  It feels like... I'm  being torn apart!  Help me, Crono!  I'm scared!!!  Please... Crono... h, help  me!  Marle lifts off into the air and disappears entirely.  Crono leaves the room, whether out of fear or need to rescue is unknown.  He  heads back down into the main room of the castle.  Lucca managed to get in.  Lucca: Crono!  Huff, puff... you're okay!  Did you find the girl?  GONE?!   Whadd'ya mean she's gone?!  Hmmm... it's just as I thought.  I knew I  recognized her!  And this looks identical to the castle in OUR time!  I'll bet  they mistook that girl for her ancestor...  You see, she's a member of the  royal family in OUR time!  She's Princess Nadia!  Crono makes a face of shock.  Lucca: Marle, that is, Princess Nadia, is a descendant of Queen Leene!  Queen  Leene has been kidnapped.  As I recall, someone was supposed to have saved  her.  But history has been changed!  Marle looks so much like Leene, that they  probably called off their search when she appeared here.  But if the real  Queen is killed... Marle will simply disappear.  There might still be time!   If we can save Leene, history as we know it should remain unchanged!   Something must have happened to the Queen in this era.  As a result, Princess  Nadia ceases to exists [exist]!  Hurry!  We have to find the real Queen!  They rush out of the castle and search around.  They will find a cathedral.   The nuns inside of it send mixed messages with their speeches.  Something is  odd, Crono will find a flashing object on the ground.  Lucca: What did you find?  A hair pin.  That's Guardia's royal crest!  The nuns quickly come up around Crono and Lucca and burst into flames, they're  not nuns, they're enemies!    Lucca: Phew!  That was close!  One of the enemies comes back and attempts to hurt Lucca, a frog jumps down  from above and fights it off.  Frog: Lower thing guard and thou'rt allowing the enemy in.  Thou'rt here to  save the Queen?  The lair is deep within.  Will thee accompany me?  Lucca: A... a FROG!?  Crono, it's a talking FROG!  I hate frogs!  Frog: My guise doth not incur thy trust...  Very well, do as thee please.  But  I shall save the Queen.  Lucca: W, wait!  You don't see like a bad... ...uh, person-frog-thing... I  mean...  Crono!  What should we do?  [Go with the frog.]  I'll just have to  handle it!  I mean... deal with... him!  What's your name? [Name selection  screen]  Frog: Frog will do.  Lucca: All right... Nice to meet you Frog.  Frog: Mayhap a hidden door lurks nigh?  Let us search the environs.  Crono plays the piano and opens a secret passage.  Within  the halls of this  area Crono and crew will eventually stumble upon the real Queen Leene.  Chancellor: Prepare yourself, Queen Leene.  Crono, Lucca and Frog step into the light.  Chancellor: YOU!  How did you get in here?  Leene: Frog!  Frog: Majesty, stand back and allow us the honor!  Leene: Be careful!  Leene retreats from the area, the Chancellor is left alone with Crono, Frog  and Lucca.  Chancellor: Gyah, ha, ha... It's useless to fight!  No one will leave here  alive!  Stupid frog!  it's time you jumped off this mortal coil!  True-form...  CHANGE!  The Chancellor transforms in an enemy, Yakra.  A battle ensues.  Leene: You came to rescue me!  Thank you Frog.  Frog: The King awaits.  Let us return to the castle.  I thank thee, Crono and  Lucca.  Leene: Yes, thank you so much.  Please join us.  Inside a nearby chest is the Real Chancellor.  Real Chancellor: Phew, thank you!  That monster stuff me in there.  Your  highness!  As you can see, I am undamaged!  They all exit and return to Guardia Castle.  King Guardia: You had me worried, Leene.  Chancellor: That no good Yakra!  Impersonating me and kidnapping the Queen!   We MUST create a criminal justice system in this Kingdom to do away with such  fiends.  Frog: I failed to protect Queen Leene.  I hath disgraced thee.  Leene: Frog!    Frog leaves the throne room.  Crono follows.  Frog: 'Twas a fault of mine, which endangered the Queen.  I shall depart for  good.  Crono, you hath potential to be a good swordsman!  Frog hops away.  Lucca: ...  Froggy, you weren't such a bad guy either.  Crono and Lucca will head back to the throne room.    Leene: Your timing was perfect.  Who knows what would have happened had you  not saved me!  By the way, there is the girl who was mistaken for me?  Lucca: Oh, yeah!  I forgot all about Princess Nadia!  Crono!  Where did  Princess Nadia disappear?  She may still be there!  Crono races up the stairs and into the Queen's chamber, Marle suddenly appears  there.  Marle: Huh?  What happened?  Lucca: Princess Nadia!  Marle: Crono!  It was awful...  I can't recall it all... I was somewhere cold,  dark... and lonely.  Is that what it's like to... die?  Lucca: Welcome back, Princess Nadia!  Marle: You risked your life to help me, too?!  Princess... Nadia...?!  Uh  oh...  I guess you guys figured it out, huh?  Sorry, Crono.  I didn't mean to  deceive you.  I'm Princess Nadia.  My father's King Guardia the XXXIII.  I  really enjoyed being with you at the fair.  But if you had known my  identity...  Crono, you wouldn't have shown me around the fair, right! [Choose  Wrong!]  Oh, Crono!  That's why I like you!  The real Queen's safe, right?  So  let's go home, Crono!  Crono, Marle and Lucca head back out of the castle and through the forest.  As  it turns out, Frog swam across the water the destroyed bridge fails to get  walkers over.  Crono and Lucca head back to the Canyon in which they arrived.  Marle: How do we get home?  Lucca: Your Highness, er, Princess... we...  Marle: Please call me Marle!  Lucca: Well then, Marle... Observe!  Lucca opens a Gateway Portal!  Marle: Wow!  Lucca!  You're amazing!  Lucca: Ain't it the truth!  Oh, um... I mean...  Marle: Enough with the false modesty!  You have a real gift!  I would trade my  royal ancestry for your genius in a heartbeat!  Lucca: Well, if you say so...  Anyway, I call this thing a Gate.  It's a kind  of portal, that takes you to the same location in a different era.  Gates are  very unstable, so I used the principal behind my Telepod device to create a  Gate Key.  Now we can use them as we please.  Marle: But why did this Gate suddenly appear?  Lucca: Either the Telepod had something to do with it, or... something else  made it.  Marle: This is getting pretty weird.  Let's at least head back to our own time!  Lucca: All right!  Coming, Crono?  They all jump into the Gate and pop out in the same location in 1000 A.D.,  right next to the Telepods.  Marle: Phew!  We're back!  Crono, Lucca, why don't you come home with me to  the castle?  I'd like you to come over for dinner!  Lucca: Sorry for putting you through all that, Marle.  Marle: Are you joking?  That's the most fund I've had in months!  And I have  some new friends, too!  Lucca: Crono, be a gentleman and take her home.  I've got some work to do.  Marle: See you soon, Lucca!  Lucca exits.  Marle: Will you escort me home, Crono?  They exit the fairgrounds and run to Guardia Castle.  Crono and Marle are  greeted at the door by soldiers.  Chancellor: Princess Nadia!  Are you all right?  Where have you been?!  I  heard you were abducted!  We had soldiers searching for you!  He sees Crono.  Chancellor: Scoundrel!  You're the one, huh?  Kidnapping Princess Nadia!  Marle: No!  Crono's...  Chancellor: Admit it!  You confused her and tried to take over the throne!   Terrorist!!  Marle: S, stop it!  Guards come from all sides, Marle tries to block them off.  Marle: Stop this at once!!  They all kneel before her.  Chancellor: What are you doing!  Soldier: But Princess Nadia said to...  Chancellor: Idiots!  Detain him!!  They all capture Crono.  Marle: Crono!!  The next scene is in a court room.  Crono has been accused of Kidnapping  Marle.  It is a very high crime.  Depending on a few options during the fair,  Crono will either be guilty or not guilty.  Chancellor: I'm the Chancellor, the prosecutor!  Pierre: I'm the lawyer, Pierre.  Chancellor: Members of the court.  We now bring forth the defendant, Crono,  who is charged with abducting Princess Nadia.  He exits and brings Crono in.  Chancellor: What shall we do with him?  Fire, perhaps?  Hang him upside down  for a few years?  Or... shall we employ the guillotine?  You, the jury, shall  decide his fate.  Now, let us begin.  Judge: Crono, you are hereby ordered to tell the truth!  Pierre: Crono is charged with Premeditated Abduction of Royalty.  The question  is, did he kidnap Princess Nadia?  The answer?  No, he did not.  In fact, no  abduction took place!  The two met completely by accident.  In fact, the  Princess ASKED Crono if SHE could join HIM!  Chancellor: Is this try?  Who actually started this whole mess? [I did]  Just  as I suspected!  The defendant deliberately tried to get near the Princess!  They show the scene of Crono bumping into Marle.  Chancellor: The Princess then innocently followed you to Lucca's little  sideshow.  Whereupon you both disappeared!  if that wasn't criminal abduction,  I don't know WHAT is!  And I have facts that throw the defendant's character  into question!  Pierre: Objection!  This can't have any relevance whatsoever to this case!  Judge: Care to respond, Chancellor?   Chancellor: Crono's character is at the very core of this case!  Pierre: We have nothing to hide.  The issue here is MOTIVE.  Was there any  motive for this fine citizen to kidnap Princess Nadia?  No!  There was none.  Chancellor: What about ransom?   Crono, fortune DID tempt you, did it not?  [No].  Are you sure?  You really weren't tempted? [Not at all]  That's  enough.  I have no more questions.  Pierre: It is evident that my client is a fine, noble young man!  You honor,  the defense rests.  Judge: Members of the jury... If he is guilty, stand to the left.  If  innocent, stand to the right. The jurors will decide if Crono is guilty or not, based on these things and a  few from earlier.  This particular one they elected him not guilty.  Judge: Order in the court!  A verdict has been reached!  The verdict is... not  guilty!  But the fact remains that even if he did not kidnap her, he ran off  with her.  3 days solitary confinement as punishment.  Chancellor: Take him away!  Soldiers come in to take him away, Marle runs in behind them.  Marle: Now just a darn minute...  Chancellor: Princess!  The King enters.  King: That's enough, my dear!  Marle: But Father...!  King: All I asked was for you to behave like a Princess.  Even royalty must  obey rules.  Leave the rest up to the Chancellor and forget about the events  in town.  We're leaving!  The King leaves, followed by the guards taking Crono away.  Marle: Crono!!!  Crono is walked to a prison area with the Chancellor.  Regardless of what the  jury decided on, the Chancellor has other plans.  Chancellor: This terrorist has tried to overthrow our kingdom!  He has been  found guilty, and you must now carry out his sentence.  Supervisor: So THIS is the monster who kidnapped the princess!  Chancellor: The execution is 3 days away.  Do NOT let him out of your sight!  Supervisor: Execution?!  Strange, but I don't seem to recall hearing anything  about an execution.  Chancellor: WHAT!!! How DARE you question ME!  The paperwork's probably just  been held up in the system!  Supervisor: Understood, Sir!  Guards!  Guards enter.  Supervisor: Take the prisoner away!  A guard swats Crono with a sword and knocks him down.  Crono wakes up in a  prison cell.  There are some things inside of it.  When Crono touches one, the  view shifts to a guard.  Guard: Some sympathizers brought that stuff for you, you lousy felon.  There's nothing to do, Crono can just drink up.  Time slowly ticks away on the  poor lad.  Finally, execution day arrives.  Supervisor: We're here to take you to your place of execution.  A guard opens the cell.  Supervisor: Come along.  They walk Crono through the prison in front of other inmates to the guillotine  chamber.  Crono is placed inside of one.  Supervisor: We've sharpened up the guillotine...  Any last words?  There's a sound outside, Lucca runs in the room.  Lucca: Crono!  I've come to save you!  Supervisor: Who the heck are YOU?  Lucca: Get outta my way!!  Take 5, you mugs!  Luca knocks out everyone with some sort of blow gun.  Lucca: So, what do you think of my Zonker-38?  Pretty cool, huh?  Let's blow  this joint!  Crono gets up and joins Lucca.  They rush out of the prison and execution  area.  As they cross a narrow bridge from the prison tower, everything shakes.  Lucca: What was that?   It all shakes again, it is some sort of machine used to catch prisoners!  The  Chancellor is behind it.  Chancellor: Forward, Dragon Tank!  Crush those rebels!    A battle ensues.  Once the Dragon Tank is weakened, Crono dives onto it  stabbing the sword into it.  The Dragon Tank begins to explode!  Chancellor: They got the Dragon Tank!!  Fix it!! Quickly!  The Chancellor and some guards try to fix it, but it blows up taking the  bridge out from under them.  They all manage to hang on though, making a path  for Crono and Lucca to cross.  Chancellor: Don't fool yourselves into thinking you've gotten away with this!  They run down the stairs of the tower.  Guards: They're escaping!  Lucca: We have no choice but to break through!  They continue to run out, more guards come after them.  Voice: Stop!  It's Marle who enters.  Soldier: Princess Nadia!  They all kneel, again.  Marle: This is my friend!  Show him your respect!  Soldier: B, but...  Marle: can't you take orders?  Soldier: Of course!  The Chancellor busts in.  Chancellor: Hold it right there.  DO as King Guardia XXXIII says!  Marle: Father...  King: Silence, Princess Nadia!  The throne comes before your personal wishes!  Marle: What!?  Just because I have a title doesn't mean I'm not a person!  King: You pick up strange ideas venturing outside!  Marle: I didn't pick up anything!  It's called common sense!  King: Princess Nadia!  Marle: I despise you!  I'm leaving!  She rips off the ugly Princess outfit revealing her nice figure and fighting  outfit.  Chancellor: Princess Nadia!  Marle: Come on, Crono!!  Marle, Crono and Lucca leave.  Chancellor: Don't just stand there!  After them!  The guards get up and chase after them.  King: Princess Nadia...  Crono and crew head back into the Guardia Forest, they are closely followed.  Soldier: There they are!  Don't lose 'em!!  Several soldiers trap them.  Soldier: There's no escape!  Soldier: Silence!  The soldiers seem to have a split allegiance.  Crono will eventually get  pinned to the east.  Marle: Looks like a dead end!  Lucca walks to a small gate.  Lucca: A gate!  Marle: Come on!  Lucca: But we don't know where it'll take us!  Marle: Who cares?!  This place stinks, anyway!  Chancellor: Princess Nadia!  The Chancellor rushes over with soldiers.  Lucca: This is completely irrational.  Marle: Hurry, Crono!  A big gate opens, Marle, Crono and Lucca jump in.  Chancellor: They... disappeared!!    The gate opens in another time, they are deposited in some sort of metallic  room.  Marle: Eeeek!  Lucca: Yeoouch...!  Marle: there's no way they Chancellor can reach us here.  But, where are we...?  Lucca: The civilization here seems so... advanced...  Marle: Like we're in another world.  They exit the room they are in.  The world has totally changed.  It is in  ruins.  People in nearby domes have nothing left, they are dying.  They speak  of Lab 16 and the monsters there, which prevent them from reaching other  domes.  Crono, Lucca and Marle traverse this area in hopes of finding  something else in this time of use.  The enter the Arris Dome.  Old Man: You there, where're you from?...  Lucca: We came from the laboratories to the west.  Old Man: W, what?! Hey, we've got people who crossed the ruins!  People: Say again!?  You're joking?!  Old Man: So there ARE people who can beat up those freaky mutants...  They speak of monsters in the basement and how they prevent everyone else from  getting down there.  The Old Man is named Doan.  Doan: Are you going down below?  Marle: Of course!  Doan: But no one's ever returned from there.  Lucca: Gotta try, right?  Doan: ......  It's nice to see such spirited young people for a change.   Careful, now.  And come back alive.  They climb down a ladder and see a nearby control panel.  Lucca: This console controls the passageway.  We need a password to get  through.  Instead, they walk around and get entangled with some security beams.  A large  robot appears.  It is a guardian.  Guardian: Executing program...  Marle: Crono!  What's going on?!  Lucca: Marle!  Let's go!  A battle ensues.   In the next room there is a terrible stench, along with one  person.  Marle: Phew!  Something reeks!  Lucca: Everything's completely rotten.  The refrigeration must have failed.  Marle: Crono, look!!  Passed away long ago, I suppose...  He's holding  something.  What do you suppose this is?  Lucca: It looks like some kind of seed.  Marle: A seed?  Do you suppose it could grow in a place like this?  A sheet of paper on the dead man talks about the Rat Statue which sat  innocently on the rafters before being much more than the a statue, perhaps  even knowing the password.  They exit back to the rafters.  Marle: There!  There it is!  Lucca: Shhh!  It might run away.  They catch the rat.  Rat: Squeak!  I give up.  I'll tell you everything, squeak.  Press and hold  the L&R buttons and then press the A button to access the secret passage,  squeak.  Don't make any mistakes, or you'll be sorry!  They open up the secret door and soon find an information center.  Lucca: So this is the info center!  Good!  The computer's still operational!   If we run a search on time warps, we might find our Gate!  Here!  Got it!   East of Arris Dome...  The map pops up and shows off another area far to the east.  Lucca: That would be Proto Dome, I believe.  Marle: Leave it to Lucca!  I'm beginning to think you could find anything with  this device!  Say, what does this button do?  Marle hits it!  Lucca: 1999 A.D.?  Visual record of The Day of Lavos...  The screen changes.  A Volcano erupts and a massive life form pops out,  raining fire upon the earth.  The screen goes blank.  Marle: Wh, what... IS that?  Lucca: Lavos?... Is that what's destroying our world?!  Marle: We must truly be in the future...  No!  NO WAY!  I refuse to believe  it!!  This...  this can't be the way the world ends...  Lucca: ......  Marle: Crono...  There's only one thing we can do.  We must change history!   Just like Crono did when he saved me!  Okay, Lucca?  Okay, Crono?!!  Lucca: I... guess so...  It was a stroke of luck that we were sent here  through that Gate.  Crono, Let's go! [Okay]  Marle: Crono!  Lucca!  Together we can do this!  Lucca: Let's take a second and do some more research on Lavos' activities back  in our time period!  Next stop, Proto Dome!  They climb back out of the basement areas up to Doan's floor.  Doan: You're back!  Everyone gathers around.  Doan: Well?  What did you discover?  Marle: This is... our future!  Doan: ???  Man: Who cares, where's the food?!  Marle: This is all we could get...  Doan: Seeds...?  Lucca: You don't know how long the Enertron'll hold out.  Those seeds might be  your only hope.  Marle: You have to stay alive.  And so do we!  Doan: Huh...  You're strange... You're different from us...  Marle: I think it's because we're healthy!    Doan: Heal-thy?  Got a nice ring to it!  We'll try growing the seeds...  Kid: What're those?  Doan: They just might be our future...  Heading for Proto Dome?  Go by way of  Laboratory 32, and take this with ya.  Doan gives them a bike key.  Doan: It's a key to the Jet Bike in lab 32.  I used to ride it when I was  young.  Hope it still works...  They've got more powerful robots over there.   Take care, and stay... healthy!  They head to the lab and secure the bike.  An alarm goes off, robots come to  attack, but before they do, everyone is halted.  Man: Hold it right there!  Robots: Hey it's... the MAN!  The Man: Like, thanks for the intro, babe!  Robots: ...the MAN!    The Man: You lowlifes can call me Johnny.  Now listen up.  Part of an old  highway leads through these ruins.  Think you can beat me in a bike race?  Use  that Jet Bike and... don't chicken out, babe!  Do you know how to ride?  They race him down the highway and win.  Johnny: YOU Beat me?  I don't get it!  You can challenge me anytime.  We'll  ride the wind, babe!  Inside of the Proto Dome, nothing seems to be powered.  There is a nearby  robot which seems to have been deactivated.  Marle: Wh, what's this?  Lucca: It's in bad shape... but it appears to be a humanoid robot!  Incredible!  Lucca inspects it.  Lucca: I think I can fix it.  Marle: What?!  It might attack us!  Lucca: I'll make sure it won't.  Machines aren't capable of evil...  humans  make them that way.  Marle: Lucca, you... pity them don't you?  Lucca: Let me get to work now, okay?  Lucca fixes up the robot.  It takes a while.  Marle inspects the door behind  the robot.  Marle: The door won't budge.  Lucca: Right, that does it!  I'm going to give it some juice!  Lucca turns on the robot.  It dances around a bit.  Marle: Good morning!  Robot: Mo......  Good morning, mistress.  What is your command?  Marle: I'm not your mistress.  I'm Marle!  and this is Crono... and Lucca,  here, fixed you!  Robot: Understood.  Madam Lucca fixed me.  Lucca: Just Lucca will do.  Robot: impossible.  That would be rude.  Lucca: Look, I hate formal titles.  Don't you, Marle?  Marle: Hate 'em!  Robot: I understand, Lucca.  Lucca: All right!  Now what's your name?  Robot: Name?  Ah, my serial number.  It is R66-Y.  Lucca: R66-Y?  Cool!  Marle: No!  That won't do at all!  Come on Crono, let's give him a better  name! [Name selection screen]  Marle: Robo... Robo... that's perfect!  Your new name is Robo, okay?   Robo: I am... Robo... Data storage complete.  Lucca: Hey, Robo, why aren't there any people here?  Robo: ......  What... What has happened here?  There WERE many humans and  others of my kind in this dome.  Lucca: I think something awful happened here...  Robo: ......  It would appear so...  But how is it that you survived?  Lucca: We came through a time warp from the year 1000.  Marle: While exploring the Arris Dome we learned there was a Gate here.  Lucca: We found you when we came looking for the Gate!  Marle: But the door to the inner chambers is locked, so we're out of luck...  Robo tries to open it.  Robo: The power is off.  If we go to the factory up north, I can pass through  the security and activate this dome's generator.  Marle: You'd do that for us?  Robo: You repaired me.  Now it's my turn to help you.  But the generator won't  run for long, so someone must stay behind to open the door while the power's  on.  Lucca: Then Marle or I will stay.  Crono must choose who stays behind. I chose Marle to wait behind.  Marle: Okay.  Please be careful, Crono!  The rest of the party heads up to the factory.  When they enter, Robo will  disable the security system.  Robo: Override Security System 00.  Deep within the factory is a switch.  Crono pulls it and alarms sound off.  Robo: Emergency! Security system has gone haywire.  Must escape immediately!  As the run, walls collapse trying to seal them in, Robo catches one and holds  it.  Robo: Hurry!  Now!!!  He holds it for Crono and Lucca to get through.  They run up and several  robots which look like Robo block them.  Robo: Th... these are my friends!  R-64Y, R-67Y, and R-69Y!  Good to see you!  R-67Y slugs Robo.  Robo: Wh, what are you doing?!  R-64Y: You are defective.  R-67Y: You have been tainted. Robo: Pardon?  Robo walks back up to them.  Robo: I'm... malfunctioning?  R-64Y: Affirmative.  Robo: A defect... I'm a defect...  R-69Y: Have you forgotten our mission?  All intruders must be eliminated!  Robo: THAT was my purpose?  R-64Y: You shame us!  You must be destroyed.  All of the robots attack Robo and beat the nuts and bolts out of him.  Lucca: Wh, what are you doing!  They stop, Robo gets up and waddles over to Crono and Lucca.  Robo: Please stop.  Pl... ease...  They attack him again.  He falls motionless onto the ground.  Crono steps up.   They through Robo into some sort of shaft.  Lucca: Robo!  R-64Y: Now to take care of the intruders...  Lucca: No!  Let's take care of YOU!  A battle with the six robots ensues.  Lucca runs over to the shaft.  Lucca: Robo!  They trashed him!  She goes in and gets him.  Lucca: He's in bad shape... I'm not sure I can fix him.  Let's get him back to  Proto Dome for now...  They walk back to Proto Dome.  Robo: C... can you r... repair... me?  Lucca: Shh, don't talk.  Robo: You... are trying to save our world?  Lucca: I don't know how far we'll get, but that's the plan.  Anyway Robo, what  are you going to do when you're repaired?  Robo: What am I... going to do?    Lucca: Yeah.  I mean, what plans do you have for the future?  Robo: Lucca, no one has ever asked me that before!  The screen dims, the next day arrives.  Robo seems fully fixed.  Robo: Good morning.  Marle: Robo!  You're all right!!  Lucca, you're incredible!  Lucca: I hope I never have to do that again...  Robo: Lucca, I have made up my mind.  I want to go with you...  Marle: Pardon?   Robo: There is nothing left for me here.  Together, maybe we can give this  planet of ours a chance.  Lucca: Then let's go!  The Gate's up ahead!!  They walk up to the previously closed door.  Lucca: Hang on to your shorts!  She opens the Gate and they all jump in.  They certainly wind up in a weird  spot, on some sort of fenced in porch.  Robo: Where are we?  Below the porch is a man leaning up against a lamp post.  Old Man: Ah, more guests...!  Lucca: What do you mean, guest?  And, WHERE are we?  Old Man: Why, this is The End of Time, of course!  All lost travelers in time  wind up here!  Now, where are you from?  Lucca: We're from Guardia Kingdom, circa 1000 A.D..  Robo: I come from 2300 A.D..  Old Man: When 4 or more beings stop into a time warp, the Conservation of Time  theorem states that they will turn up... at the space-time coordinates of  least resistances.  Here.  Disturbances in the space-time continuum have  increased recently.  Far too many folks are just popping in here...  I fear  something is having a powerful effect on the very fabric of time...  Lucca: Which means one of us has to remain here.  Marle: Stay HERE?  ALONE?  Old Man: It is pretty bleak here...  But not to worry.  All time periods  connect here...  You can visit your friends whenever you wish!  But you can  never travel in groups greater than 3...  Robo: So, one of us must stay.  Lucca: Who'll it be, Crono?  Since by default Robo is left behind, that is what I will do.  Robo: Please come for me whenever you need me.  Old Man: So there you have it.  Don't forget.  Press the Y button to switch  party members.  Marle: How do we get back to our time?  Old Man: You see those lovely pillars of light?  Those hook you up to  different eras.  Once you've been through a Gate, you can always use it to  come here.  To use a Gate from here, step into the light and press the A  button.  But beware the Gate which leads from that bucket...  Behind the lamp post and the man is a room.  Inside is... something which  looks like that cute Gremlin in the Gremlins movies.  Spekkio: What're you lookin' at?  I'm Spekkio.  The Master of War!  I've seen  all kinds of battles from here.  How do I look to you guys? [Choice between  Strong or Weak].  I see.  Let's put it this way.  If you're strong, I look  strong.  If you're weak, I look weak. You are strong of will...!  That's why  the Old One let you through.  Long before you were born... there was a kingdom  where magic flourished.  Everyone there could use it!  But in time, people  began to abuse their powers.  It got so bad that no one was allowed to use  magic except wizards.  But you have it... determination, I mean!  Magic needs  power of the heart.  It needs inner strength.  Magic is divided into 4 types:  Lightning, Fire, Water & Shadow.  You, with the punk hairdo!  You're  Lightning.  The one with the ponytail is Water.  The one with the goofy  glasses is Fire.  Not just magic, but EVERYTHING is based on the balance of  these 4 powers.  Think MAGIC, and, starting from the door, walk clockwise  along the walls of my room 3 times.  Don't lose track, now.  After you do it, he will be happy.  Spekkio: Very good!  Ipso, facto, meeny, moe... MAGICO!  Spekkio spins very fast and teaches all three of them how to use magic.  Spekkio: So!  Fortified with magic!  Wanna try it out?  It doesn't matter what you choose.  Saying yes results in an optional fight.   They exit out to the courtyard with the old man.  The old man will tell them  that they need to get back to their era to chance what was messed up, because  the longer they wait around in The End of Time, the harder it becomes to fix.   They all head to Medina Village, 1000 A.D. via a gate.  They pop out in some  couples closet.  Man: Wait a sec.  Medina village was founded by the ancestors of the Mystics,  who lost a war to human beings.  Most Mystics hold a grudge against humans.   Be careful...  There's an odd man who lives near the cave in the mountains to  the west.  You might enjoy a chat with him.  Marle: Thanks!  Why are you being so nice?  Mystics aren't supposed to get  along with humans.  Man: Humans fought the Mystics over 400 years ago.  My motto is forgive and  forget but not many seem to agree with me.  They'll wander around the area, most of the people aren't friendly, the market  has insanely high prices, which Crono will need to fight to get offered to  him.  In the town square many of the inhabitants are circling a statue talking  about how Lavos will destroy the humans in the way Magus failed to do, 400  years ago.  Nearby the village is a blacksmith named Melchior, he sells  things, but I mention him now as he'll be more important later.  Eventually  Crono and company will reach Heckran Cave.  In the cave they'll fight a boss,  when he dies he spouts out.  Heckran: If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had  destroyed the human race!  The world would've belonged to us Mystics!  GRRRRRR!  Lucca: In the Middle Ages, Magus created Lavos, the destroyed of this planet's  future!  Marle: If we go to the Middle Ages and take out Magus, can we change history?  Lucca: We could use the Gate at the Fairgrounds!  They exit the cave and get spat up near the Truce Village.  Going around town  will get a few dialogues with Lucca's parents in particular, and with Fritz,  the man who would have been guillotined before.  They enter the gate near the  Telepods Lucca had created, they end up at The End of Time.  From there they  use another gate to enter Truce Canyon in 600 A.D..  One thing is different  since they were last here, the Bridge has been fixed.  The Captain of the Knights complains his army has no food.  When Crono arrives  at Guardia castle, the chancellor sends him up to see the King, who is wounded  in bed.  The King speaks of a hero returning, though this hero has gone south,  he is the only one who can defeat Magus!  Crono wanders around into the  kitchen but the Chef seems busy, he tries to leave the castle.  Chef: Wait!  Take this with you!  The Chef gives Crono, jerky.    Chef: And, this is for you guys.  Take it, will ya.  [Crono receives a Power  Tab] And tell that fool...  He had better come back alive!  They return to the Zenan Bridge and talk with the Knight Captain.  Knight Captain: Sir Crono!  Is that for us? [Yes]  Food Rations!  The cook...  he has saved us all!  Sir Crono, if I do not make it back... give my brother  my thanks...  There is a loud noise from the bridge.  Knight Captain: WHAT is going on here?!  Soldier: Magus's troops have launched an attack!  They're breaking through our  defenses!!!  Knight Captain: Stop sniveling!  It shames the Knights of the Square Table!   We shall DESTROY Magus's troops and bring honor to our King!  Soldier: But, we are far outnumbered!  Knight Captain: This is our last line of defense.  We must let no one through!  Soldier: Understood!  The Knights of the Square table are tired and outnumbered.  Magus's troops  slaughter them.  Crono and crew run halfway across the bridge to see it  happening.  Ozzie: I'm Ozzie, Magus's top general!  Those who dare defy Magus have to  answer to me!  Yes my children... Give 'em a taste of doom!  There will be a series of battles, Ozzie will continuously bring more troops  and retreat when they fail.  Ozzie: Those wimps're stronger than I though.  Marle: Wait up, already!  Ozzie: Seems I misjudged you.  But I won't do that twice!    Ozzie reanimates some dead soldiers into skeletons.  Ozzie: Grrrr!  You're through!  A battle happens, Ozzie's troops fail again.  Ozzie: Drat!  Crono and crew run to the land on the other side.    Ozzie: That's IT!  Now you're finished!  Marle: Don't mess with Crono, or you'll really be sorry!  Ozzie summons several undead which merge together.  Ozzie: Go Zombor!  Crush Sir Magus's enemies!  Ozzie runs away, The path to the Village of Dorino is now open.  They are  allies of Guardia, they speak the hero and the epic battle against Magus it  will cause.  They also speak of a sword, The Masamune, which is able to be  used only by a hero.  One past hero they mention is Cyrus.  South of Dorino is Porre.  The legendary hero was born here and is the son of  Tata.  The villagers seem to spend their day in amazement talking of this.   Between the two villages are the cursed woods, which is where Crono will  head.  In the forest there is a bush which moves, hiding a ladder down.  It  goes to a small little home, but of whom?  Frog: Who's there!?  'Tis thee, Crono!  Thou art here to practice thy skill in  swordplay?  Crono tells him of the situation, apparently.  Frog: What?!  The King hast been injured?  ......  I see...  'Tis nary a thing  I canst do... Please be on thy way.  They leave Frog, he is still angry.  They head to the Denadoro Mountain  Range.  They are in search of the Masamune.  A strange boy is in the room with  it. in which it is stuck in a slab of stone.  Crono approaches the sword.  Kid: Stop!  Are you here for the Masamune?  [Yes]  Thought so... Wait a  second, okay?  Oh big broooother... Where are you, Masa?!  Masa: What is it, Mune?  Not again!?  So!  You want to get a name for yourself  by grabbing the Masamune?  What a buffoon!  Mune: Humans are so... silly!  It's how you USE the sword that's important...  not who owns it!  Masa: You can't even understand something as simple as that.  That's why  you're human.  Mune: What should we do?  Masa: The usual... test them.  You can entertain us for awhile.  Mune: All right!  Here we go!!!  Whoosh!    They transform into cute little things and attack.  Masa and Mune are defeated.  Mune: Hey they're pretty tough.   Masa: Only Cyrus made it this far.   Mune: What should we do?  Masa: This time it's for real!  Mune: All right, this is it...  Masa: Yeah.  We mean business!  With Masa's bravery and... Mune's knowledge!  Masa and Mune combine into a fat  creature which looks like stay puft marsh mellow man combined with the  astrological symbol Taurus.  Masa and Mune are again defeated.  They split  back up into little boys.  Mune: They beat us, big brother...  Masa: That was fun!  Mune: Will they fix us?  Will they find us an owner?  Masa: Yeah, it'll be all right.  Masa and Mune combine into the sword.  It glows and floats.  But it seems bent  in two.  Lucca: So this is the Masamune...  But it looks like it's been broken for ages.  Crono takes the broken Masamune.  Masa: Allow me!  We'll ride the wind to the base of the mountain!  Mune: Good luck to you.  They are spat out onto the world map.  With the sword in hand, Crono heads to  the house of the supposed Hero.  Tata, is there, not quite the Hero he was  built out to be.  Tata: I... I'm sorry everyone.  Some frog guy dropped this in a cafe.  I  thought I'd sell it, but then everyone started to calling me a hero.  I  couldn't bear to get rid of it!  I can't fake it any longer.  I'm no Hero...!   I'm so ashamed!  here.  Please take this!  Crono is given the Hero Medal.  Tata's Father: Scoundrel!  I knew this was all a sham!  With Frog's Hero Medal, Crono returns to his home.  Frog: Thee hath returned?  Th, the hero Medal!  Aye... Then thou hast seen the  lad.  Yet there's nary a thing I canst do against Magus.  The legendary  Masamune is required to fight Magus.  And I've no right to wield it.  Please  leave now...  Frog moves revealing a pot, Crono reaches inside and pulls out the top of a  sword.  Lucca: A broken sword... It's part of the Masamune!  It's engraved with  archaic letters.  I think I can read it.  Um... mm...  M... e... l... c...  h... i... o... r!  Marle: Melchior?  That guy in Medina Village?  What does this mean, Crono?  They run back to Truce Canyon and enter the Gateway back to The End of Time.   From there they head to the Medina Village in 1000 A.D. to get some answers  from Melchior.  Melchior: You're back again?  Come to see my collection?  Th, this sword...  it's the Masamune!  How did you get it?  Lucca: Why would your name be engraved on the sword?  Melchior: It's a... long story.  You do want to hear this story, right?  Lucca: Of course!  Tell us about the Masamune!  Is it possible to reforge it?  Melchior: Hmmmmm... It might be possible if we could get our hands on some  Dreamstone, which the sword is made of.  Marle: Dreamstone?  Where can we get that?  Melchior: You can't find it anymore.  It was a red stone that was once used as  money.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been available for a very long time.  He doubts you'll ever find any, though promises to reforge the sword if you do  find some.  They head back to The End of Time.  They head to 65,000,000 B.C.  at Mystic Mountain.  Melchior said it hadn't existed in a LONG time, after  all.  They fall out of the portal to the ground, there are a lot of green  reptiles running around.  Lucca: They're all green and scaly!  Marle: Wh... what are those?  After the reptiles are defeated, about twice as many jump in and corner Crono  and the group.  Lucca: We're outnumbered!  Marle: What should we do, Crono?!  From nearby a very scantly dressed blonde haired cave woman jumps down and  starts kicking some serious green ass.  Marle: Goodness!  She is tough!  Lucca: Who IS that woman?!  The cavewoman runs more of the reptiles off of the screen, leaving four left  on it.  Marle: Uh oh... they're coming our way!  Crono and crew are able to make short work of them, just as the cavewoman  rolls back into the screen.  Marle: Wh... what do you want?    She takes an aggressive stance.  Marle: Ack!  Crono!  The cavewoman charges Crono pushing him up against a wall and is supposed to  be having a small skirmish with him, though it looks more like they're making  out to be honest.  Woman: You strong.  What name?  Crono, huh?  Good name.  Me?  Me... [Name  Selection Screen].  Me Ayla.  Ayla like strong people.  So Ayla like Crono!  Marle: Get away from her, Crono!  Lucca: I think she likes you, Crono...  Ayla: You strong too.  Ayla respect strong people.  Men and women.  Marle: Oh, brother...  Lucca: Where have they been keeping her?  Ayla: Crono, where from?  Marle: Uh, how can we explain?  Lucca: We're from way after the day after tomorrow.  Ayla: Ha ha, you funny.  Ayla like funny people.  Lucca: It's no use...  Ayla: Come to village!  We talk and eat.  Dance!  Eat!  Fun!!  Lucca: We'd love to go, but we've got to look for the Dreamstone now.  Ayla: Stone?  Plenty stones!  Here, there, at village.  You take plenty.   Crono come, Ioka village this way.  She runs off on all fours.  Crono has no choice by to follow.  As they follow,  they get attacked multiple times.  Ayla: Crono too slow!  Crono come, Ioka village this way.  They head to the village and enter the chief's hut.  Ayla is already there  dancing or something O_o.  Ayla: Good, Crono come.  Night soon and ready for party.  Come Crono!  Later that night, the entire area is filled up with people.  Ayla: Listen all!  New friends here!  Strong man.  Crono!  Friends of Crono,  Marle, Lucca!  All: Unngaaa!  Ayla: Now, we dance!  A dance party begins.  One person, Kino, doesn't seem to thrilled that Ayla is  holding a party for strangers.  After a while, Crono returns to Ayla.  Ayla: Crono you try?!  Special Jurassic pork soup!  Good stuff!  Ayla fight  Reptites.  Their leader Azala.  Very smart.  All in Ioka village fight.  No  fight, go to Laruba village.  Don't know where village is.  Always hide.   Azala want to destroy Ioka AND Laruba.  But Ayla no lose.  Only when Ayla  dead, give up!  Enough.  Meet Crono today.  Good day!  Eat, party, sing, dance!  Crono dances with Marle around the fire and drinks a big bowl of punch for  Lucca.  He again returns to Ayla.  Ayla: Crono, you look for red rock?  Rare, red rock sign of power.  Ayla  strongest in Ioka village.  So Ayla's rock!  You want, you challenge Ayla!   You win, then Ayla give to you.  Challenge Ayla? [Yes]  Bring plenty soup!   Party now, so eat!  Crono and Ayla have soup race!  They drink soup as fast as they can.  Crono will eventually win.  Ayla: Enough, Crono.  You win, I give you rock!  Crono eat plenty.  Eat last  bowl for health!  Ok, eat.  Maybe eat too much!  They all pretty much pass out where the party was.  They wake up the next  morning.  Lucca: Phew...  What?  Liar!  I was a perfect lady last night!  Buy why does  my tummy hurt so...?  Marle: Morning Crono!  Wasn't that fun last night?!  Lucca: Hey!  Who made these footprints?!  It's gone!  The Gate Key's been  taken!  These prints were left by the thief!  Without it, we're stuck here  forever!  This isn't funny!  Let's go see Ayla!  They rush to Ayla.  She is sleeping.  Ayla: Snort... zzzz... zzzz...  Crono wakes here.  Ayla: Huh... Crono, you up already?  Yaaawn...  Too much soup.  Sleep like  stone.  Burrp...  Lucca: Sorry to wake you, but we've been robbed!  Ayla: Wh, what?  Must be Reptites! Crono come with Ayla!  We settle with  Reptites!  Who else come?   Since Marle by default stays with the party, she'll be the one to come with.  Ayla: Someone from village see.  We go ask.  Crono come!  They ask around and Kino is missing as well.  Many villagers say they saw  Reptites head south to the Forest Maze.  Kino is right near the entrance.  Ayla:  Kino!  What you do?!  Say NOW!  Kino: Ayla... Kino take Crono stuff.  Ayla: Why take?!  Kino: Kino like Ayla best.  Ayla like Crono, but Kino not like...  Marle: Ayla!  Mellow out!  Ayla: Kino.  You know why I punish?  Kino: Ayla no like Kino...  Ayla: No!  Ayla like Kino BEST!  No more do bad stuff, okay?!  That wrong!  Kino: Ayla...  Sorry Ayla!  Sorry Crono!  Ayla: Give back stuff to Crono!  Kino: No have... Reptites take!  Ayla: Reptites!!  Where they go?!  Kino: Run into trees... there!  Ayla: Ayla go too.  Kino go back village.  Kino protect village when Ayla not  there.  Kino: Okay, Ayla!  Ayla: Kino is man... so if Ayla die, Kino chief then.  Marle: Ayla...  Ayla: Chase Reptites!  Get back Crono stuff!!  They rush through the maze and into a cave it shelters.  Inside are many  Reptites.  Near the back is the Reptite who stole the Gate Key, Azala.  Azala: What's this?!  Could those apes have made something THIS advanced?  Ayla: Azala!!  Azala: Ah, the apes have arrived!  Hmm.  You're nothing like Ayla...  Tell me  what this is, at once! [Choose yes to telling Azala what it does]  Liars!  No  one would talk that easily.  This should loosen your tongues.  Come, Nizbel!  Nizbel comes up through the earth and attacks.  He is a triceratops looking  monster if you, the reader, care.  Once Crono wins, Azala will not be happy.  Azala: Th... the apes beat Nizbel!  Ayla: Give thing back to Crono.  NOW!  Azala: But remember, WE Reptites will rule the world!  Your days are numbered!  He drops the Gate Key and runs off.  Marle: Is the Gate Key okay?  Thank goodness!  It looks all right.  Ayla: I fight anytime, Azala.  Ayla no lose!  Bbburp!  They return to Ayla's hut.   Ayla: You leave, Crono?  No fun for Ayla!  Lucca: Thanks Ayla.  I learned a lot from you.  Kino: Sorry, Crono.  I try be strong now.  Just like Crono!  Ayla: Come again, Crono!  Party!  Eat!  Dance!  Fight!  Fun!  They return to the Gate at Mystic Mountain and warp back to The End of Time.   They return to 1000 A.D. and pay another visit to Melchior.  Melchior: You found some Dreamstone?!  Then I'll repair the Masamune!  HOW on  earth did you get the Masamune... and the Dreamstone?  No, don't tell me.  I  don't think my heart could take it.  It'll take a little while to fix this...  He goes into his basement.  Lucca: I'll lend a hand!!  They head into the basement and begin working.  Lucca works with the  Dreamstone, Melchior with the sword itself.  Before long they finish.  Melchior: Sorry to keep you waiting.    Lucca whips out the Masamune.  Melchior: Take a good look!  THIS is the Masamune!  Marle: Awesome!  What a weapon!  Melchior: Well, I think that's everything.  Marle: Ok Crono, let's take the Masamune to Frog.  They hop back to The End of Time and back to 600 A.D., where they walk to the  Cursed Woods to pay a visit to Frog.  Frog: 'Tis thee again.  This sword... 'Tis the Masamune?  I must ponder this  turn of events.  Remain'eth here the night.  During the night, Frog has a flashback.  Queen Leene: Cyrus!  Are you leaving?  Cyrus: Yes, it's time we took back the Medal from the Frog King.  And I'd like  to see that mythical sword for myself.  King Guardia: But Cyrus, the kingdom needs you!  And Leene and I need you.   You must return to us!  Cyrus: As long as there is life in these bones, I shall return!  By your  leave...  Soldiers: Sir Cyrus!!  We, the Knights of the Square Table, wish you a safe  journey!  Cyrus: Listen well, my friends...  I now entrust the safety of the kingdom to  you!    Cyrus exits to a man near the gates of the castle.  Cyrus: Pardon the delay.  Shall we be off?  Queen Leene comes out.  Queen Leene: Glenn, you be careful too!  Glenn: Be of sound health, your Majesty!  The two of them fight many battles in the Guardia Forest, until they come to  the King Frog.  King Frog: So!  You want the Badge of Courage, dear knight of the kingdom?   Well come and take it... if you can!!!  Grribit...  Cyrus: Prepare yourself, polywog!  En garde!  Nirvana Strike!  He swats King Frog.  King Frog: Graaaack...!  How dare you pick on a helpless amphibian!  Filthy  medal!  I won't forget this!  The frogs toss the medal aside and retreat.  later on, near the Denadoro  Mountain, Cyrus and Glenn run into Ozzie and another man.  Glenn: Aaah!  Cyrus: Beware Glenn!!  Glenn: Cyrus!  The sword... The Masamune!  Ozzie: Gyah ha ha... Is THAT the best you can do?!  Without your sword, you're  nothing!  Cyrus: Arrgh!  You haven't beaten me yet!  Glenn: C, Cyrus... I'm a g... goner.  Cyrus: Glenn, escape while I keep them at bay.  Glenn: B, but...!  Cyrus: If you stay, they'll get us both.  Go on, Glenn!  Magus: You'd better worry more about yourself, Cyrus!  Cyrus: Come on, Glenn!  GO!!  Aaahhh...!  Cyrus charges Magus and is beaten to the ground by some sort of lightning  charge.  Glen: C, Cyrus!  Cyrus: R... run... Glenn...  The Queen.  Take care... of... Leene...  Ozzie sets Cyrus on fire.  Glenn: C, Cyrus!?  Cyruuuus!!  Cyrus's body is burnt to ashes.  Magus: Harumph!  What's the matter?  Aren't you going to try your luck?  Glenn: Err...!  Ozzie: Gyah, ha ha... Cat got your tongue kid?  How about it, Magus?  Can't  you give him a more fitting form?  Magus: All right, why not?  There's always time for a little fun.  Glenn: !!  A...augh!!  Glenn is hit by a spell from Magus.  Glenn: Aaaaack!  Glenn falls from the cliff.  Ozzie: Gyah ha ha...!  You spineless wimp!  Frog: 10 years hath passed...  Can I do it?  I've changed so much.  Alas, poor  Cyrus...!  Morning arrives.  Frog: Awake'th, Crono!  Though we may fail... Let us go to Magus's lair.  The  knowest his power?  Lucca: Nothing can beat science!  Marle: We won't be beaten by a bad guy!  The party is reformed, I'll stick with the default three in it; Crono, Frog  and Marle.  They head out of the Cursed Woods and east of Fiona's Villa.  Frog  has another flashback in this area.  There are several kids with purple hair  attacking one with green hair, who is Glenn.   Kids: Aaahhhh!    Cyrus: Hey you!  Kids: It's Cyrus!  Run for your lives!  Glenn: Sniffle... Thanks, Cyrus.. Hic...!  Cyrus: Glenn, there're times when people simply have to grit their teeth!  Glenn: But... it hurts when I get hit.  They...  Cyrus: You're a marshmallow, Glenn...  The scene shifts again.  Cyrus and Glenn are older now, and talking on a  bridge.  Cyrus: Hey Glenn...  I've been thinking about becoming a Knight...  Glenn: I knew you were going to enlist!  You'll make a great warrior!  Cyrus: Why don't you join, too?  Glenn: I... don't think I'd make the cut.  Cyrus: But, why?  You're better with a sword than I am!  Glenn: I don't know... I think I'd really lose it if I had to hurt someone.  The scene shifts back to just after Magus killed Cyrus.  Glenn: !!  A...augh!!  Glenn is hit by a spell from Magus.  Glenn: Aaaaack!  Glenn falls from the cliff.  He falls off as a Frog...  The Frog.  The Hero's Medal floats down stream and  lands near him.  Frog: The... Medal.  The Hero's... Medal...  It shifts back to the present.  They all look at a solid wall which is  blocking a cave which leads to Magus's Lair.  Frog: Hand'eth over the Masamune!  Crono puts the Masamune in the ground.  Frog walks up to it.  Frog: Mine name is Glenn!  Cyrus's hopes and dreams... And now the  Masamune...  Forthwith I shall slay Magus and restore honor!  Frog rips the Masamune out of the ground, it sparks intensely, sending a  pillar of light into the air.  He takes one HUGE swing and completely  separates the mountain into two.  Soon they arrive at a dark, dark castle.  It is of course, the Lair of Magus.  Frog: This can only be...  The game finds it necessary to show the creepy look of the castle now.  Frog: Magus's castle...!  They enter and explore for a while, before long, Ozzie laughs...  Frog: Ozzie!  Ozzie makes himself visible.  Ozzie: Welcome, Glenn!  Or should I say, Sir Froggy!  Mwa, ha!  Say, looks  like you got some replacements for Cyrus!  Magus is a tad buy right now.   You'll have to take up your business with me... the swordsman, Slash, and  Flea, the magician... And...!  Many monsters appear.  Ozzie: You'll have to defeat all 100 of the beasts in Magus's castle...!  Ozzie Vanishes.  Crono and crew work their way up one side of the castle of  the other.  I took the left first.  Frog: It's been ages, Sir Slush!  Slash: That's SLASH, you slimy dolt!  Still playing the comedian, eh Glenn?   You'd be singing a different tune if Cyrus hadn't been there with you last  time!  You'd have fit right in with those boney fellows you just busted up!  A battle ensues.  Slash: Now, let's get to business.  This is going to do me a world of good!   [He grabs his sword] And with no Cyrus to protect you, you're mine!  You dare  to oppose me?!  Slash is beaten.  Slash: Unbelievable...!  But falling in the line of duty for Magus... leaves  me few regrets!  Slash dies and drops his sword.  Up the other side of the castle is Flea.    Frog: The magician, Flea, I presume?  A battle ensues, Flea dies almost instantly.  Frog: Wait!  That isn't Flea...  Where's the REAL Flea?!  Bat: Mwa Ha..  Here, over here...  The bat turns into a woman.  Flea: Giving up, little tadpole?!  Marle: Who IS this person?  Frog: Keep your guard up!  This is no ordinary woman!  Meet Flea, the magician!  Flea: What the...?!  Hey, I'm a GUY!  Marle: THAT is a GUY!?  Flea: Male... female... what's the difference?  Power is beautiful, and I've  got the power!  Poor little Froggie!  You must be lonely now that Cyrus is  gone.  And to be turned into something so hideous!  Dreadful!  But since  you've brought your new friends over to play...  I'll show you all a good time.  A battle ensues.  Flea is beaten.  Flea: How can this be...  Sir Magus...  Flea dies.  They return to the main chamber of the castle and are transported to a new  area.  Before long they reach Ozzie.  Ozzie: I grow tired of this!  Slash!!  Flea!  Frog: Sorry, Ozzie, but they can't help you now...  Ozzie: You fly eating, tongue flicking...!  Oz...  Ozzie's in... a jam!!  He runs into the next room.  Frog: Thou can'st not run!  The next room has massive sharp objects hitting the ground over and over,  Ozzie is controlling them it seems.  He'll talk as Crono gets closer and  closer to him.  Ozzie: Welcome!   Mwa, ha... How's this.   Crono reaches the steps just below him.  Ozzie: Urghhhhhhh...  What the...?!  Impossible...!  He runs off into another room, shock of all shocks.  Crono will chase him  around more, gradually working through the mazes of Magus's Lair.  As you get  to him again, he'll run away to yet another room.    Ozzie: What the...?!  Impossible...!  Once again they'll make it to Ozzie, and he'll say his favorite line again.    Ozzie: What the...?!  Impossible...!  He frantically tries to get reinforcements.  Ozzie: Urghhhhhh...  Grr... This takes the cake!  Get this... Ozzie runs into the next room!  Oh ho, Ozzie is trapped this time.  Ozzie: Urghhhhhh...  Frog: Thy time hath cometh, Ozzie.   Ozzie: Harharhar...  I'm sure Sir Magus has already called for  reinforcements...!  Wait until Lavos arrives!!  I shan't be defeated.  No form  of attack will break MY barrier!  Ozzie covers himself with quite the ice  barrier.  Crono and the party aim for levers which control floor mechanisms  instead of Ozzie.  He starts to laugh at the bad aim of Crono and crew.  When  the final lever is hit Ozzie suddenly realizes... oops!  He falls below!  The  landing he made didn't sound too good, either.  Marle: That was a breeze!  Frog: We must hurry to Magus's place!    Soon they enter a dark room, no light at all.  As they walk up dim blue fires  burn.  Magus: Neuga, ziena, zieber, zom...  Now the chosen time has come...  Exchange  this world for...!  Many blue fires appear, Magus is now visible on top of an evil icon.  Frog: Magus!!  Magus: I... it's that stupid frog!  Kissed any princesses lately?!  Frog: I rather enjoy this form.  And I oweth it all to you!    Frog whips out the Masamune.  Frog: I have something for you!  Magus: Ah... The Masamune!!!  I bet you're just dying to use it!  The black  wind begins to blow...  Okay... give me your best shot...  If you're prepared  for the void!  A battle with Magus ensues.  The fires dim, Magus falls to his knees.  Magus: W.. what have you done to the Masamune...?  The objects behind Magus fade away.  Marle: What the...?!  Frog: Could it be... Lavos?!  Magus: bad time...!  Don't wake up on me now...!  Marle: Wake up?  YOU'RE the one who CREATED him!  Magus: You fools!  I only summoned him!  He lives in the inner earth,  absorbing the land's power and growing ever stronger!  Marle: What?!   Frog: What's going on?!  Marle: Th, the Gate?!  Magus: You!  If you hadn't shown up...!  Marle: Crono!!  Frog: Whoa...!!  The room grows blurry, there's a Gate there.  Everyone in the room is sent  spiraling.  Crono is in bed, much like at the beginning of the game.   Marle: Crono...  Honey... You're late for work!  I'd forgotten how beautiful  Leene's Bell could sound!  Crono!  We can't keep sponging off my dad!  Go out  and get a job!  Crono!!  Crono! Crono! Crono! Crono! Crono! Crono! Crono!!  They all awaken for real in Ayla's hut.  Ayla: Crono awake?!  Marle: Ayla!  Ayla: Ayla had strange dream.  Went to Mystic Mountains/  Everyone lie there,  hurt.  I carry back to hut.  Frog: Magus!  Ayla: Yummy frog!  For Ayla eat?  Frog: P, perish the though, lass!  By the way, whither the blue-haired one?  Ayla: Only find you there.  Blue-hair one more tasty?  Frog: We hath lost him...  Marle: But if Magus didn't create Lavos, where did... it... come from?  Ayla: Lavos?  Not worry now.  You rest.  Hurt bad.  Ayla leaves the hut and everyone sleeps more.  They wake up the next morning  and Kino greets them.  Kino: Crono, ok now?  Ayla busy, look for Laruba village.  Fight Reptites  together.  Destroy Reptites or we no survive.  Man: Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiino!  Kino: What happen?  Quiet!  Crono rest.  Man: North wood burning!!!!  They head north, in the woods are some ancient ruins.  Crono and crew are  stopped at the entrance by a local.  Man:  Reptites take Kino!  Reptites hurt all who fight!  What do now?!  Ayla is nearby talking to a very old man.  Old Man: Ayla... This your fault!  Look at mess...  Reptites followed you!  So  village now ruined!  Ayla: Ayla feel bad.  Old Man: Reptites strong!  They live long time before us, they smart so we  hide.  But Ayla say fight together... Ayla still fight?!  Ayla: Ayla fight while alive!  Win and live.  Lose and die.  Rule of life.  No  change rule.  Old man breathe, but dead on inside.  Old Man: Ayla, you strong, can make big talk.  We no have power...  Ayla: No!  Have power!  We fight, gain more power!  Ayla help you, but need  Dactyl.  Give Dactyl.  Old man: Need Dactyl?  To Tyrano lair?!  That's Reptite's place.  Dangerous!   Ayla want die?  Ayla: Want to live, so go there!  Ayla be OK.  Give Dactyl!  Old Man: Ok.  Go to Dactyl's nest and keeper will help.  Careful, Ayla!  Ayla: Thank you, old man!  She runs off to the Dactyl nest, not even seeing Crono as she runs by.  They  follow her to the Dactyl lair, she has just summoned a Dactyl to ride on.  Ayla: Crono!!  Marle: Don't even THINK about leaving us behind!  Ayla: No!  Tyrano lair dangerous!  Maybe all perish!  Marle: We can't let you go alone!  Ayla, you saved us.  Now it's payback  time!  Right Crono?  Ayla: Ayla have strong friends!  Marle: Ayla, let's go!  Next stop, the Tyrano Lair!  Ayla summons two more Dactyls, of course this means someone will have to stay  behind.  I'm bringing from with me, so of course the dialogue will be slightly  different than if someone else came along.  Anyway, whoever got chosen will  all get on their Dactyls and fly over to the Tyrano Lair.  Inside of the lair  are many prisoners.  Jailer: Thanks for bringing, er, being the main course!  It's the apes!  Kino is in the cell.  Kino: Ayla!  Ayla: Kino get back!  Ayla save you!  Ayla beats on the cell door, but winds up inside the cell with the door still  closed!  Frog: Hmmmph.  Kino: Sorry Ayla.  All Kino's fault.  Ayla: No matter.  Kino escape with Laruba villagers!  Kino: What Ayla do?  Ayla: Put end to this!  Kino: Kino go too!  Ayla: Kino no come.  If Ayla dead, Kino new chief of Ioka!  Kino: Ayla...  Ayla breaks the door down this time, they all run out into the main hall.  Ayla: Ayla strong.  No lose!  Kino: Kino understand.  And show you something!   Everyone follows Kino.  Kino opens another path in the Tyrano base.  Kino: You strong, me weak.  Ayla good chief!  Kino runs off to safety.  Further along is Nizbel, the triceratops from before.  Nizbel: Azala's in the back.    He'll let you pass, but soon come after you.  Nizbel: Hold it.  This is a special place.  The great Nizbel was defeated here!  A battle with Nizbel II [though labeled Nizbel outside of battle *shrug*]  ensues.  Soon after it they make their way to Azala.  Azala: So... you are here at last.  This is it, then.  The showdown.  Today  there shall be a conclusion.  Will it be the Reptites, or you silly apes who  end up ruling the world?  Ayla: Strong survive.  Ayla strong.  Ayla fight!  A loud shriek, which is supposed to be a roar, fills the room.  Azala: Hear that lovely voice?  You'll soon become the best of friends!  Azala runs into the next room.  Fortunately it doesn't turn into a chase Ozzie  fest, instead, Azala has one big ass dinosaur to aid him.  Azala: Red star...  Fall!!!!!  Stain the earth... RED!  Though it may be our  fate to perish, we will not simply hand this world over to you!  Mwa ha ha!   With this Black Tyrano I can finally exterminate those filthy apes!  A battle ensues.  Azala: No... It can't be...!  Could the heavens truly have sided with the  apes?  Listen, primates, and let it be known.  We Reptites fought bravely to  the bitter end!  Ayla: Ayla understand...  The screen flashes red.  Ayla: !?  Azala: Soon, stones of fire will rain down.  Flames shall scorch the land.   The burned plains will slowly freeze, ushering in a long, cruel ice age.  Mwa,  ha ha... what a treat!  You will wish you went along with us!  Mwa ha!  Ayla: Lavos...  The scene shifts to space, a giant fiery meteor is floating around.  It comes  to earth and crashes down on it.    Ayla: Ayla's word.  La means fire.  Vos means big...  The screen continues to flash red.  Kino is down below the castle they stand  atop.  Kino: Ayla!  Ayla: Kino!  Some Dactyls land nearby, Kino flies up on one as well.  Ayla: Hurry!  Lavos come soon!  All ride Dactyl!  Kino!  Hurry!!  Kino jumps on the dactyl with Ayla, who gets off and runs over to Azala.  Kino: Ayla!  What you do?!  Ayla: Come!  Azala!  Come!  Azala: Absolutely not!  The powers that be have spoken.  Ayla: ...  Kino: Ayla!  Hurry!!  Ayla jumps back on a dactyl.  Ayla: Azala... me not forget...  Azala: The future...  Ayla: Future?  What about future?  Azala: We... have no future...  The dactyls fly off, a meteor fireball strikes the Reptite base.  Frog: Through no fault of Magus does Lavos live!  Lavos hath fallen from the  sky in ancient times.  Ayla: Lavos huge!  Crono fight it?  Crono!  We go where Lavos fall!  Frog: Left unscathed, it will burrow deep within the earth.  Best to defeat it  now!  They enter where Lavos fell.  There is a small gate there.  Frog: 'Tis a Gate?  Ayla: Lavos very fast!  Deep under earth already.  Frog: M, mayhap Lavos be the cause of this timewarp?  The one in Magus's  Castle was immense.  Ayla: What wrong, Crono?  Fight Lavos!  Go in here.  Yes?  They go through the gate and come out in the same area they just left of  course, but the wind has picked up a lot.  Frog: Wh, where art we?  'Tis strange...!  Ayla: Where this, Crono?!  The ice age Azala spoke of seems to be in full effect.  The world is covered  in ice, the year is 12,000 B.C..  A good deal of the ground is covered with  domes which transport everyone to the sky, where there are other villages on  floating continents.  In one village, there is a boy prophesizing the death of  a party member.  Others speak of the land people and the Queen.  Since there  is an obvious nearby castle, chances are the Queen resides there, so that's  where Crono heads.  In one of the bedrooms are Janus and Schala.  Janus: Schala!!  Schala: Oh, you're back Janus!  Is something wrong?  Janus: The black wind...  Schala: You feel it too?  Don't worry, it'll be alright.  Now, hold onto this.  Janus: What is it?  Schala: It's a kind of amulet.  If something should happen, it'll protect  you.  I wish I could be with you always... But mother has other plans.  Janus: She's NOT our mother.  She looks like a mother, but inside she has  changed.  Schala: ......  Still I can't... Janus, I'm sorry.  Aid: Excuse me, Highness.  The Queen asks for your immediate presence at the  Ocean Palace.  Schala: All right.  Well, Janus... I'll be going.  Schala sees Crono.  Schala: Oh!  Who might you be?  Aid: Miss Schala, please hurry.  If you're late, I'll be punished!  Schala: Oh yes, I'm sorry.  Schala runs off to a strange door.  It opens with the aid of her pendant.   Crono tries to use Marle's pendant, but the door doesn't open.  Ayla: Strange.  How come?  Frog: 'Tis a mere DOOR that keeps us bound, hand, foot and tongue!  As it turns out, Schala's pendant is made of Dreamstone.  Nearby is a Mammon  Machine which charges up Dreamstone.  Crono charges Marle's pendant and  returns to the door.  The door opens this time.  Ayla: Ayla go!  No fear, Crono!  Frog: What doth challenge us now?    Inside the room is the Queen, Schala and two others, a prophet and Dalton, who  is a high ranking soldier.  Queen: Who are you!?  How did you get in here?  Prophet: Your majesty... They are the evildoers I warned of.  Queen: How DARE you think you could oppose me, you... foreigners!  You're  worse than the Gurus!  Fools!  Dalton, take them away!  Dalton: Yes ma'am!  By your leave...  Golem!  Dalton summons a Golem and a  battle ensues in the throne room.  Whether or not Crono wins the battle, he'll  be captured anyway.  So just to save time we'll lose O_o.  Queen: Mwa, ha, ha... Fear not!  You won't die... immediately, that is!  But  by the time we're through with you, you'll be begging us to end your  suffering.  What a delicious diversion!  This prison is much cooler than the one in 1000 A.D...  In fact, Crono and  crew are just suspended in some energy field.  Soon, Schala and Janus come in.  Janus: Hmph!  Idiots... What will you do, Schala?  Schala: Let us rescue them.  Janus: I think it's useless.  Besides, if they escape, you'll be in trouble.  Schala: Don't worry about me.  They just might be able to rescue the Gurus.  Schala releases the energy barrier.  Schala: Are you alright?  Quickly, escape from the palace!  And if you can,  please rescue Melchior!  He was sent to the Mountain of Woe for opposing the  Queen.  Please!  You have to help him!   Prophet: I'm afraid I can't allow that...  Your meddling tires me.  You'll...  just have to disappear!  Schala: You mustn't!  Prophet: .....!  Janus: Stop!  Prophet: Okay...  I'll spare them.  But in return, you WILL cooperate,  Schala!  Now, show me how you came here.  They lead him to the cave.  Prophet: Hmmm... so you came in through here.  Now Schala!  After I throw them  in, I want you to seal the portal shut.  Schala: N, no!  You can't make me!  Prophet: Obey me!  Their lives are at stake!   Schala: I... oh, all right...  The Prophet opens the gate and it takes them all.  Schala seals the gate with  her pendant.  She is sad.  Schala: Please forgive me...  Crono and company return to the cave in 65,000,000 B.C.  Frog: 'Tis true, he hath spared us.  But something is amiss.  Ayla: They take energy from Lavos.  Lavos not get weak?  Frog: Thou hast seen elsewhere the crest on the doors that pendant opens,  correct?  Frog remembers back a building in 2300 A.D, a mysterious door in a dine,  Frog: A curious crest is engraved here.  Some unknown power keeps it  sealed.  'Tis time to depart, eh, Crono?!  They head back to the Mystic Mountains and take the gateway to The End of  Time.  From there Crono will head through Area 32, the Sewer Access to the  Keeper Dome, where the door in question is.  Crono uses the pendant, it  shimmers.  The Door opens.  In the room are many sparkling stars which talk.  ???: Huh...?  Belthasar: To those who opened the door...  I am Belthasar, the Guru of  Reason.  I once lived in the Kingdom of Zeal.  A great disaster in Zeal  somehow threw me into this era.  To my surprise, Lavos exists here, and, I  suspect, in other periods as well.  Aeons [Eons] ago, Lavos descended from the  heavens.  Burrowing deep into the world's core, he began to consume our  planet's energy, and grow stronger.  Crono goes to the next sparkle.  Belthasar: Lavos disappeared briefly when he was summoned away by a mighty  wizard who lived in Guardia, in the year 600.  In 1999, Lavos claims this  area, and reigns from high atop Death Peak.  Lavos continues to  replicate......  like a giant parasite, he is consuming our world.  Next sparkle...  Belthasar: Force to live here, I continued to conduct research on Lavos.  But  I am growing old.  And it's impossible to keep sane in such trying times.  So  before I lose it completely, I shall safeguard my data, and my ultimate  creation...  Next sparkle...  Belthasar: How I long to return home... But I have grown frail...  So you,  YOU, who have opened the door!  I leave things in your hands.  Only by  mastering time, itself, do you stand a chance against Lavos.  Next one...  Belthasar: The odds will be against you... But you are true heroes.  The world  is in your hands.  Open, now, the last door, at take what you find there.  My  last invention...  My Wings of Time.  There is another sealed door, the pendant opens it.  There is a ship inside.  Frog: This... moves through time?  Ayla: !!  What this thing?  A Nu will enter the room.  Belthasar: Scared you, didn't I?  It's me...... Belthasar.  I copied my memory  into this thing.  What do you think?  Anyway, there's something I need to  explain.  Namely, how to transcend time!  Press the Y Button for the time  gauge.  Then use the L&R buttons to select an era.  Oh, yeah!  Before you go,  why don't you... [he falls asleep]... name my time machine! [Name selection  screen].  By default it is Epoch.  Hop aboard!  Crono jumps in.  They all fly off to wherever the first time, as it starts a  chat.  Frog: What's happening?!  Ayla: It great!  It fast!!!    ???: Epoch's capable of THIS?!  They'll eventually go back to 12,000 B.C., since they had been locked out.   The cool air system is down, so they'll have to use the ground system.   They'll pass through towns with people who don't use magic, and are confined  on the ground by those who can.  Soon they'll head up into the skies to rescue  a Guru which was talked about.  Frog: Ah, 'tis where the Guru of Life remains imprisoned.  Ayla: Crono!  Look!!  The place the Guru is held vanishes and is replaced by Giga Gaia... a boss.   Once defeated, the object holding the Guru returns.  Frog: Old man Melchior!?  Melchior: Indeed, I am Melchior.  Have we... met before?  More importantly,  can you tell me anything about the Ocean Palace?  I see... The Queen has  degenerated to that degree... The more energy the Mammon Machine absorbs, the  further the Queen degenerates.  Her spirit has been stolen by the infamous  immortal, Lavos.  The chamber begins to shake.  Melchior: We must flee!  The seal has been broken!  The mountain will collapse!  Back in the non-magician area, near the mountain, the villagers realize this  too.  Man: Elder!  The Mountain of Woe is about to crumble!!  Child: Mommy, the mountain's gonna fall!  The mountain, which was floating the sky, held by chains, is released from the  chains.  The mountain falls into the sea.  Back in the nearby ground village  Melchior explains.  Melchior: Lavos sleeps deep underground, while consuming the energy of this  planet.  If the Mammon Machine is brought closer to him, he may awaken!  We  must hurry before it's too late!  Man: Elder!  Schala is here!  Melchior: What?  Schala's here?  Schala enters the room with Janus.  Elder: Miss Schala... why have you come to such a miserable place?  Schala: Stop degrading yourselves!  We Enlightened Ones were once the same as  you.  The only difference is that we are under Lavos's control...  Janus: What a filthy hovel.  Schala: Melchior... After the Mountain of Woe fell, I thought I would find you  here!  Melchior: Is it safe for you to leave the palace?  Schala: That no longer matters.  The Ocean Palace is now operational!  Melchior: Then all is lost!  Schala: But without me, the Mammon Machine won't work.  I have turned my back  on that evil device!  I've kept the Skyway open.  Hurry!  You must stop... my  mother!  Voice: Why don't we keep it right there...  Dalton enters.  Schala: Dalton!  Dalton: Tisk, tisk my dear.  Your presence is required elsewhere!  Melchior: Dalton!  Leave her alone!  Dalton: Ah!  The geezer speaks!  Silence, old man!  Dalton hits Melchior with a fireball and dashes at Schala.  Melchior: Argh!  Dalton: You'll come to the Ocean Palace with me.  Do anything funny, and  Schala's dust.  Got it?  Janus: Schala!  Dalton smacks Janus.  Dalton: The Queenâ€™s children all seem to have a problem with authority, don't  they?  Crono and crew draw weapons.  Dalton: Stay back.  The life of this woman means nothing to me!  Shall we get  going, Schala, dear?  Your mother awaits!  Dalton teleports himself, Schala and Janus out of the area.  Ayla: Old man.  Okay?!  Melchior: I'm all right.  But we must save Schala, or else...  Elder: Impossible!  Even though it's coming from YOU, Melchior...  Melchior: If the Queen is allowed to fulfill her scheme, all life as we know  it, is doomed!  Crono steps up to Melchior.  Melchior: You're willing to challenge the Queen?  Crono nods.  Melchior: You've done so much for us... and I don't even know your names!  Frog: Worry not thine head.  Thou hath fixed the Masamune!  Melchior: What ARE you talking about?  Ayla: Crono!  We go now.  Melchior: Wait, take this with you.  It's made from the same red stone as the  Mammon Machine.  With it, you can destroy the Machine! [Crono gets Ruby Knife]   Crono rushes back to the Zeal Palace and busts into the throne room.  Dalton: Phooey!  Why is the Prophet allowed inside while I'm stuck with guard  duty?  Ha!  There you are...  I let the Prophet go, knowing he'd mess up  sooner of later.  But I've no use for you anymore.  You're history!   A battle ensues.  Dalton: N... nooooo!  I'm going to be immortal!  I CAN'T be beaten now!  He runs and leaves behind a transport gate, which moves Crono and crew to the  Ocean Palace.  Nearby is Mune.  Mune: The black energy grows... Something scary is waking up!  The scene shifts.  Deep inside of the Palace is the Queen along with Schala  and several guards.  Queen:  Schala, raise the power of the Mammon Machine to its limit!  Schala: ......  Queen: Schala!  You dare disobey me?!  Schala: All right, mother...  The Mammon Machine is brought to full power.  Queen: Oh... what bright splendor!  The incredible power of Lavos!!!  Schala: Aagh...  Prophet: ......  Crono will work through the palace and run into Masa.  Masa: The ancient Red Rock has been passed down through the ages.  From it, a  magic pendant and a knife were made.  We embody Melchior's dreams, sealed,  within the knife...  Now hurry, if you plan to confront the Queen.  We're  counting on you!  Masa leaves, the palace shakes.  The scene goes back to the room the Queen and  Schala are in.  Queen: Ahh, I can feel it!  The pulse of eternal life!!!  Ha, ha, ha...!  Schala: D... dark... force... wild energy...!  Aughhh!  Schala falls.  Prophet: ......!!  The room flashes red.  Guard: Th, the Mammon Machine!  Your majesty, it's too dangerous!  Schala: Mother...!  Queen: Don't stop Schala!  We're almost there...  Immortality will be ours!   Zeal will have the glory it deserves!  Queen: Mwa, ha, ha... Too long I've waited...!  Crono continues to work down to the main room of the Ocean Palace.  Dalton has  retreated back into this area as well.  Dalton: You made it THIS far.  Maybe I underestimated you...  But this is the  end!  THEY will take care of you!  Come, GolemTwins!  He runs, summoning two golems to fight Crono.  Dalton: They beat the GolemTwins!?  All right, this calls for the GolemBoss.  The palace shakes and everything has a red tint to it.  Dalton: W, what's this strange force?  Could this be... Lavos's energy?!  I've  got a bad feeling about this...  All my work will be in vain if I expire  before I'm immortal!  This is your lucky day!  Bye-bye!  Dalton teleports away.  Crono and crew dash forward into the hall of the  Mammon Machine.  Frog: We shan't allow thee to meddle with Lavos, Queen!  Ayla: Ayla come!  Where strong beast?!  Schala: You're...!  Help!!  Prophet: Schala!  Queen: What are you doing Schala?!  I need your help here!  The machine is now violently overloading with power.  Frog: Crono, use the old man's knife to stop the Machine!  Ayla: Crono!  Use Red Knife!!  Crono holds up the knife...   Masa: Here we go Mune!  Mune: Ready, big brother!  The knife, which is actually the masamune, strikes into the center of the  machine.  Frog: T, 'tis... the Masamune?!  The machine is now very much overloading.  Queen: Th, the Mammon Machine!?  Prophet: It's coming...!  Schala: N, no stop!  That sword alone can't stop it!  The room turns white and then black.  Lavos appears, a large shelled  creature.  It quickly makes work of Crono and the party.  The Prophet gets  between them.  Prophet: I've waited for this...  He removes his robe... It's Magus!  Magus: Iâ€™ve been waiting for you, Lavos.  I swore long ago... that I'd destroy  you!  No matter what the price!  It is time to fulfill that vow.  Feel my  wrath, Lavos!!  Queen: What do you think you can do? Hmph!  A false prophet...  You'll be a  snack for the great Lavos!  Schala: Mother, please stop!  This power can only end in ruin!  Queen: Get away from there, Schala!  The almighty life force of Lavos lives in  all of us...  You are a part of it!  You cannot change fate now!  Oppose me  and I will destroy you also!  Schala: Heeelp!  Queen: Come Prophet, feel the power of Lavos!  Magus is attacked.  Magus: Ungh!  Aaah!!  My powers are being drained!  Unghh...  I won't... be  beaten!  I survived the darkness to defeat you, Lavos!  Magus gets up and frees himself from the energy draining beam.  Magus: Take this, Lavos!  Aaugh!!  Magus attacks, but it seems to do nothing.  Magus: Wh, what...? It doesn't work?!  Aughhh!!  Magus is knocked to the ground.  Queen: Foolish one!  Your measly power can't touch Lavos!  This is from me to  you!  You shall enjoy eternal life... as part of Lavos!  Vwa, ha, ha, ha...!  Crono and crew try to get up.  Frog: Magus!  Thou art mine to defeat!  Frog falls.  Ayla: Stand up, Crono!  Ayla no like lose!  Ayla falls.  Crono gets up entirely.  He walks nearer to Lavos.  Queen: Haven't given up yet?  What do you hope to do?  You challenge Lavos  with that battered body of yours?  Mwa, ha, ha...  See the power of Lavos and  feel his wrath!  Crono begins to cast Luminaire, but the energy draining beam gets him.  Frog: Desist Crono!  Ayla: Crono!  Crono vanishes from existence.    Magus: I can't... beat him.  Lavos...!  Frog: Argh...!  We must plan our escape!  The Palace crumbles!  Ayla: This bottom of ocean!  What can do?  Schala gets up.  Schala: The last of my pendants power will send you to safety.  I know you  can't forgive her but...  please don't hate our mother, or our kingdom.  I'm  so sorry!  Now, off you go!  Magus: ......!  Schala teleports Magus and the rest of the party away, leaving herself behind.  Schala: ...... Crono...  Lavos bursts out of the oceans and flies upwards into the sky.  Lavos  annihilates Zeal Castle along with everything else on the floating island.   Everything falls into the oceans.  The oceans result with a massive tidal wave  which approaches the mainlandâ€™s.  Ayla and Frog awaken in the elder of  Algetty, the ground village, home.  Frog: N... oooooo!  Crono..., Crono...!  Ayla: Crono!  Nooo!!!  Crono!  Frog: Crono!  Elder:  Um!  Your'e [You're] awake!  You were delirious.  Frog: Crono!  What hast thou done with Crono?  Elder: We found no one else...  Frog: First Cyrus, and now Crono...  Ayla: Where is this?  This Earthbound Village?  Elder: This island was the only refuge left, after the Ocean Palace disaster.  Frog: 'Tis a pity...  Ayla: Melchior!  Where Melchior!?  Elder: When the disaster struck, an eerie, black portal materialized.   Melchior tried to save Janus, but he was also dragged in.  Ayla: A black portal?  Like one we step thru?  Frog: That maiden, Schala.  Whither hath she gone?  Elder: I don't know.  No one has seen her since.  Ayla: Where Epoch?  Epoch alive?  Elder: Your ship is quite sturdy and safe.  It's almost as if it followed you  here...  Oh, this must be yours.  Elder gives Frog the pendant.  Frog: 'Tis the pendant Crono kept.  Elder: It was at your side, like a guardian...  Frog: Crono...  Elder: Take all the time you need to rest.  I will be in the commons.  They follow him to the commons area.  Elder: All rested up?  Soldier: Bow, and pay homage to our new liege, King Dalton!  Soldiers come in attacking, Dalton appears.  Dalton: You there!  What's wrong?!  You're lucky to be alive!  The old crone  and the pesky Gurus are gone.  I now rename Zeal, the Kingdom of Dalton!   YOU!  You're alive!?  Ah!  That vehicle outside must be yours!  It's just like  the one Belthasar was building...  I've decided you don't deserve such a  splendid toy!  Henceforth it shall be my personal chariot!    Frog: Come again, Sir?!  Dalton: You'll have to come with me.  You might start a rebellion or  something!  And now, as a token of my esteem for you... take this!!  Dalton attacks with a fireball, but it bounces off.  Dalton: What!?  Grrrr.  Ha!  How's this?!    He uses a substantially more powerful fire attack.  Dalton: Mwa, ha, ha!  Enjoy a little taste of my true power.  The party is captured.  They're all in the same cell.  Frog: Huh...?  Ayla: Where this?  Lucca: !?  Our equipmentâ€™s gone!  Ayla: All stuff, GONE!  Frog: Confound it!  The money, too!!  Ayla: Ayla fight!  Get all weapons back!  Destroy bad man!!  They climb a ladder out of their prison cell...  Only to find out their  thousands of feet in the air!  Frog: We're going up!  Ayla: Sky!  Sky!  This Sky!  As it turns out, they're on an airship. the Blackbird.  They climb back down.  Ayla: !!  Breeze come in here.    They climb into the air ducts she was referring to.  They'll wander around  getting all of their items and soon escape onto a wing of the Blackbird.   Frog: Something cometh!  A gate opens up and a Golem Boss appears.  Lucca: He's...!  The golem will run away before long.  Lucca: Phew...  Dalton: Mwa, ha, ha...  It's complete!  I've done it!  He has remodeled the Epoch into an ugly ass machine.  Dalton: See these beautiful wings!  Now THIS is a King's throne.  I now name  it...  The Aero-Dalton Imperial and THEY'RE gonna be my first victims!  Aero- Dalton Imperial, engage!    Crono's music plays.  Dalton: No, no, no, no...!  Stop the music!  The music stops and plays bad guy music.  Dalton: Ha!  There we go!  Ready for takeoff!  The docking bay door on the Blackbird opens.  Dalton: The Aero-Dalton Imperial!  We have lift-off, Houston!!  It heads outside and flies up near Frog and company.  Ayla: Look!  Frog: Epoch's...  It's flying?!  Dalton: It's not Epoch!  It's the Aero-Dalton Imperial!  Mwa, ha, ha, haha!!   You are excess baggage!  Make like the wind and blow outta here...!  The Aero-Dalton opens fire.  Dalton: Mwa ha!  You are like insects to me!  Ayla: Epoch... go... now!  Frog: Cheerio...!  They all jump up onto the Aero-Dalton.  Dalton: You, you...!  A battle ensues.  When he is hurt, he'll summon a GolemBoss, but be sucked  into the gateway instead!  Lucca: Is Epoch okay?!  Frog: That groundling thief!  Ayla: Epoch, okay?  Lucca: More importantly, did he change the controls?  Frog!  Hit the Y button,  quick!  The ship fires a hole into the blackbirds wings.  Lucca: Well, then try the X button!  The blackbird has been destroyed.  Men on ground: Yea!  Justice!  Dalton got what he deserved!  Elder: Whoa!  That ship can fly!  Lucca: Phew, now I get it!  Frog: Fantastic!  We are actually in his debt!  Ayla: Epoch in good shape!  Epoch... become bird!!  Lucca: It needed a remodel anyway!  Frog: Dead or alive, let's go find Crono...  They land near the last settlement on the ground.  The villagers speak of  someone who came through looking for them.  Nearby, Magus lurks on the North  Cape.  Magus: So, it's you...  Frog: Magus!  Frog draws his sword.  Magus: Behold.  Everything's at the bottom of the sea.  Gone is the magical  kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people.  I once lived  there... But I was another person then.   There is a flashback to the main room of the Ocean Palace.  Gaspar: Hmm...!  A dimensional warp!  Belthasar: This power is beyond human control.  Melchior: No...!  We'll be dragged into the warp.  Janus: Schala!  Schala: No Janus!  Stay away!  B, but!?  Lavos appears and forms a rift under Melchior.  Melchior: It, it's a...!!  Another is formed under Gaspar.  Gaspar: A Time gate!?  And another under Belthasar.  Belthasar: No!!  Another one under Janus.  Janus: S, Schalaaa!!!  Schala: Janus!!  Everyone put into a rift comes out somewhere else.  Guru Gaspar: Th, this is...  Hey...  Nothing here...  This must be... the End  of Time.  Janus pops out near Ozzie and is taken prisoner.  The scene goes back to the  present.  Frog: So!  Thou art... thou art that filthy urchin!  Magus: ...  Ever since Lavos's time portal stranded me in the Middle Ages...   I have waited to even the score.  You interrupted me just when I had summoned  Lavos to my castle.  How ironic that, having been drawn into yet another  portal, I would end up in this age.  Being from the future, my knowledge of  the past enabled me to convince the Queen that I was a mighty oracle.  But no  history book could have prepared me for what happened here.  Unimaginable is  the power of Lavos.  Anyone who dares to oppose... it... meets certain doom.   At this rate, you too, will meet a hideous fate.  Just like that poor fool,  Crono!  Frog: ...!  You dare to insult him?!  Magus: He's history!  Play with fire and you get burned.  Frog: Magus!! Hold thy tongue!  Magus: You wish to fight me?   We'll do both options here, as they are greatly different.  [Yes]  Frog: [To rest of party] Stand back.  Magus: ...  I never imagined that we would settle our score in this dusty old  era.  Come, let us finish this charade!  If Frog wins.  Frog: Cyrus, I hath avenged thee!   Magus: Defeat me, and you will break the curse on Frog.  If... you want... to  bring Crono back... find Gaspar, th... the Guru of Time...  Magus dies and leaves behind the amulet.  Now for the other options.  Magus: You wish to fight me?   [No]  Frog: Vanquishing thee will neither return Crono nor Cyrus.  Magus: ...  Wait.  I'll come with you.  Frog: Treachery!!  Magus: You know, there just might be a way to bring him back.  Frog: Nonsense...!?  Magus: Gaspar, the Guru of Time, knows how to restore lose or misplaced time  streams...  Magus may at this point be renamed...  Anyone with any common sense would put  him in the party at this point.  They'll head to the Epoch to visit Gaspar in  the End of Time.  The game has other ideas though.  Frog: !?  Magus: That's...!  Something rises out of the ocean, it is very large.  Frog: The Ocean Palace hath risen?  Surely, it doth beckon us!  Ayla: Me hate!  Ayla not like boat!!  Magus: ... The Undersea Palace?  This is impossible...!  Bleh, for now they'll just go try to save Crono, so they head off to the end  of time.  They'll talk to the old man near the lamp post.  Old Man: Hey, where's that healthy kid with the radical haircut?  ...  This is  terrible news...  I have nothing to give you but this song.  It's  called... "Memories of Crono".  I wish I could lend a hand...  Magus: Only the Guru of Time can help us now...  Old Man: Hey, where have you been?  ...  So that's your story...  And just  LOOK at you now... You've become quite formidable!  Magus: Heh?...  Old Man: The Guru of Time, eh...?  Heard of him, of course, but what do you  want with him?  Frog: We've heard he might be the one to bring our Crono back...  Old Man: To bring back lost loved ones...  It's what everyone wants...  Crono  must be proud to have friends like you.  They try to leave.  Old Man: Hey.  Here.  Take this with you.  He reveals an egg shaped object.  Ayla: Egg! Ayla hungry, want eat!  Old Man: Let us call this Chrono Trigger.  It is pure potential.  By  unleashing a specific course of events, it can have a powerful effect on  time.  As the one who made the Epoch, your Wings of Time, how to hatch it...   Like any egg, it represents a possibility...  It may or may not... hatch.  But  the Chrono Trigger gives you the potential to get your friend back...  The egg  will have an effect equal to the effort you put into your search.  No more,  and no less.  Don't forget that.  As long as you keep Crono in your heart, the  day you are dreaming of shall arrive...  Magus: I get it... it's you, isn't it...?  Frog: Wh... what?  So......  The art Gaspar, the Guru of Time!  Old Man: Um... well...  I believe that's what they used to call me...  ages  ago...  They go to 2300 A.D. to speak with Belthasar.  Belthasar: On Death Peak you will find the power to restore life.  But to  active this power, the deceased must be important to the space-time  continuum.  And you MUST have a clone identical to that person.  Only then,  can a Chrono Trigger work its magic.  Need a Clone?  That magician, Nolstein  Bekkler could whip one up in the wink of an eye.  Bekkler loves festivals.   Find a festival, and there, too, you shall find Bekkler!  Being as there has been only one huge fair throughout the entire game, the  party goes there.  Bekkler runs the house of horrors.    Bekkler: Welcome to Nolstein Bekkler's lab.  The spine tingling show is about  to start!  So!  You want a Crono Clone?  Normally I'd never do this, but today  I'll make an exception.  Challenge me, and I'll give you a clone.  The longer  you stay in the game, the lower my price will be.    They'll play a mimic game.  The clone is deposited at Crono's house.  They  head there next.  Crono's Mom: Oh, hello!  Is Crono okay?  Frog: Uh... aye!  He be in fine health!  Crono's Mom: I hope he's behaving.  Tell him to be good, all right?  Frog: ... Madam...  Crono's Mom: Yes, dear?  Frog: By thy leave, mayhap we taketh this doll?  Crono's Mom: Go right ahead, dear.  They get the clone.  Crono's Mom: Stay out of trouble now.  They head back to 2300 A.D. once again and head to the Keeper Dome.  Belthasar: Enough.  The time has come for you to attempt Death Peak.  It's the  only chance you have of reviving your friend.  The last program I've  Implemented in this creature's memory banks will help you up the mountain.   Stand back.  The Nu enters the next room.  Three little things come out and execute a  program.  Belthasar: The 3 entities you saw will help you climb Death Peak.  This ends  my message.  Now I must ask you for a favor.  This creature has executed its  program.  Please let him sleep.  The switch is on his stomach.  They shut off the Nu and proceed to Death Peak.  Several Lavos's shells try to  slow them from reaching the top, but fail.  Long later they'll reach the  summit.  Marle: So, this is the summit of Death Peak!  All who fear the night and stand  against the darkness... Please give us strength!  She releases the Egg.  Frog: Crono!  The pendant reacts.  It sends power towards the Chrono Trigger Egg, which  reaches into the sky.  Marle: it, it shattered!!  But... We've come so far!  Frog: Despair not... Fate be not malleable.  Marle: Please answer me!  Don't leave me!!!  Crono--!!  Something dark covers the sunlight.  Everything goes back to the Ocean Palace,  just moments before Crono was eliminated.  Time is not moving.  Magus: A time freeze... I never thought it possible.  Frog: Like stone statues.  'Tis eerie...  Marle: Crono...!  They walk up to Crono.  Marle: We'll just exchange the Clone for Crono.  They do just that.  Marle: Crono?  it's Crono...!  Crono?!  You're alive!!!!  Frog: 'Tis an eerie place.  Let us withdraw quickly.  Magus: Save the hellos for later!  We've got work to do.    They "leave" and "return" to the Death Peak summit.  Marle: Crono!  Welcome back Crono!!  Frog: How art thou feelin, Crono?  Crono looks around.  Marle: We...  We knew this day would come.  Marle jumps down on the ground and hugs Crono.  Marle: You mustn't...  You can't do that ever again!  Frog and Magus disappear from view.  Marle: While you were away...  A lot of things happened.  First, we... and  then...  After that we..., but... Crono!  Are you even listening?!  There's so  much you have to know.  They all return to The End of Time.  Old Man: So!  Looks like you were successful!  No, don't thank me.  I didn't  do a thing.  I just gave you a place to begin...  If you really want to thank  me, make me a member of your team!  By the way, the Wings of Time has come  looking for you.  It seems to have a heard and mind of it's own...  You wish  to fight Lavos, correct?  Many paths lay open to you.  You may use that  bucket.  Or fly the Wings of Time to The Day of Lavos...  Or there's the Black  Omen, which floats in the sky above your world.  Lavos is somehow connected  with it.  It's up to you to decide when and where to fight Lavos.  By now you  must realize you are the only ones who stand a chance against him...  However,  you will not be alone.  I have had vague glimpses of events, people and places  that will empower you...  In the Middle Ages, a woman's sheer determinate  brings a forest back to life...  A fugitive in the Middle Ages, Ozzie,  maintains an evil hideout...  There's a task to be done in the Future, where  machinery originated.  And there's a very special stone that can shine its  light on each generation, from the distant past to the far future...  There's  the ghost of a lofty knight, slain by Magus in the Middle Ages, who haunts the  present...  There's an object in the Middle Ages that sparkles like a  rainbow...  One of you is close to someone who needs help... Find this  person... fast.  Just as you touch the lives of every life form you meet, so,  too, will their energy strengthen you.  Fail to live up to your potential, and  you will never win...  I am sorry that I must simply witness the coming  spectacle from my vantage point here...  What he just said refers to almost all of the side quests in the game.  In  actuality, the bucket to Lavos has  been open for quite some time now.    Frog enters the main party, if not already.  They'll get some tools for a  blacksmith in 600 A.D. to begin repairs on the Northern Ruins.  Unfortunately,  they can't fix the areas in which monsters are, which is where the party comes  into use.  Once cleared out Crono will pay the man to repair more areas of  it.  One of the new areas has a sole gravestone in it.  It reads "Cyrus, the  fool who challenged Magus rests here." Frog: Cyrus, I hath returned.  I shall honor my promise to thee!  He whips out the Masamune and holds it up.  The room turns blue and Cyrus  comes out of his grave.  Frog: Cyrus...  Cyrus: Glenn...  Thank you... for making the journey here.  Frog: Dear Cyrus...  Thou must... think ill of me.  Cyrus: On the contrary!  You have come far, my friend.  When Magus defeated  me, I thought of all those whom I had left behind.  King Guardia, Queen Leene,  and of course, you...  Frog: Cyrus...  Cyrus: Your skill land dedication is superior!  I can rest now, knowing that  everyone is in good hands.  Good bye, my friend!  Frog: Cyrus, wait!  I...  Cyrus vanishes.  Cyrus: The Queen...  Look after Queen Leene.  Alas, and farewell... Glenn.  Frog: Cyyyruuus!!!  I'm so sorry, Cyrus.  The Masamune acts up.  Frog: The Masamune?!  It floats up from his hands.  It turns white.  Masa: Heh heh.  Mune: That's it!  That was special!  Masa: Quite.  I guess it means that a Hero's power comes from within.  Mune: Mucha metaphysical, man.  Masa: Like, MIND over matter, Mune!  Frog: My... mind?  Mune: Now for a yummy, full-on test!  Masa: It's thrasin' time!  They collide with each other and the Masamune powers up.  Frog: 'Tis flowing with strength and vigor.  Ahh!  'Tis the true identity of  the Masamune!!  Cyrus, I promise to fulfill your wishes!  'Tis a sad  farewell!  Onward, all!  This completes the quest, though there are more items to reach.  While in 600  A.D., Magus has a quest to be done.  Ozzie has built his own fort!  They enter.  Ozzie: Come on in!  This's the Great Ozzie's place.  What the...!  Whoa!!   You... you're the great Magus!  Magus: You're doing well, Ozzie!  Ozzie: The nerve!  Deserting your fellow Mystics to serve these humans!   You're a traitor!  You're not out King!  Why did you desert us?  Shocking as it may be, Ozzie runs into the next room. He'll have a little  trap set up, too!  Ozzie: You pesky, low down, good for nothings!  Ooh!  I'll have you begging  for mercy.  Flea!  Flea appears.  Flea: You sent for me?  Well, if it isn't Sir Magus.  Who'd you bribe to get  in here?  Traitors like you deserve a beating.  Oh great Ozzie, stand back,  and let ME take care of these cretins.  Ozzie: I'm counting on you, Flea!  Shock of all shocks, Ozzie goes into the next room.  Flea: Get ready for a SLAPPING good time... get it?!  Flea loses.  Flea: OH!  Just you wait!  We'll teach you a lesson!  Flea runs into the next room.  Ozzie: Howdy!  You're nothing but common thieves!  Anyone who tries to steal  my treasure is looking for a VERY cruel death!  He cranks up some monsters.  Ozzie: And away we go!  They land on a conveyor belt and fall back down... oops!  Ozzie: Oz...  Ozzie's in a pickle!!!  Outta here!  This time he doesn't run... rather he teleports away.  As luck might have it,  he is in the next room.  Ozzie: You STILL haven't give up?  Well, how about a good thrashing.  Slash!  Slash appears.  Slash: Yooouuu rang?  Ozzie: Slash, don't let me down!  Ozzie runs.  Slash: At first I really didn't want to slice and dice ya, but now it sounds  kind of fun!  Ready?  Slash loses.  Slash: Ouch!  He runs off too.  Ozzie is in the next room with another toy of death.    Ozzie: Come on, sweethearts!  Don't you want the treasure box?  Probably  filled with goodies!  A little green imp walks in.  Imp: Found the treasure!!  It gets hit by the blade Ozzie is guarding the chest with.  Ozzie: Oz...  Ozzie's stumped!  Outta here!  Ozzie runs into the next room.  Slash and Flea are in it too.  Ozzie: Heh heh.  Not so fast, friends.  I'm not going to make it that easy for  you.  Ozzie Pants!    Flea: Flea Vest!  Slash: Slasher 2!  Ozzie: These unique items make us INVINCIBLE!  The three items named were the three Ayla can Charm [steal] away from them.   They all lose.  Ozzie: What in the...!  Ozzie runs, again.  Next room.  Ozzie: Magus!  You lied when you said you wanted to create a world of evil!   You used me!  Magus: Oh, how dreadful.  Say, can you hear that?  It's the sound of the  Reaper...  Ozzie: I can't lose!  What would become of my Mystics?  I MUST win!  There are switches behind Ozzie, the first time they are hit the party falls  down a floor.  They run back up and a little kitty cat runs up and hits a  switch.  Ozzie: N... no!  Not THAT switch!!  Ozzie falls to his death.  Frog: That stupid fool.  They all leave, this quest is done.  The next quest is for Lucca.  They'll  head to the Sun Palace in 2300 A.D.  The Son of the Sun attacks, when it is  defeated it runs off into another room.  It turns into a stone.  Lucca: This is the ancient Sun Stone?  It doesn't seem to have an ounce of  energy left in it.  We could probably recharge it with sunlight, but that  would take aeons [eons].  They take the Stone.  They fly to 65,000,000 B.C., that seems like eons  enough.  They place it in the Sun Keep, which is in another area of the world,  but has a large pillar of sunlight hitting it.  Magus: The Sun Keep... Where the sun never sets.  They place the stone in it.  Magus: Now, let us go.  They head back to 2300 A.D. and enter the Sun Keep.  Magus: The Moon Stone is gone.  Seems like it's been gone for 1300 years or  so.  Let's get back to the present.  They head to 1000 A.D.  They confirm it was just taken and fly around.  The  Mayor's Manor is giving off some strange light emissions.  They enter.  The  mayor claims to know nothing, but everyone in the house claims of his greed.   They'll buy some jerky in a nearby shop and give it to a woman who lived in  this house in 600 A.D.  This teaches her children to share, which will remove  the greed from the man in 1000 A.D..  The man will give it to them now.  They  fly it back to the Sun Keep in this era and go to 2300 A.D. to pick it up.  Lucca: Amazing!  With THIS much energy I can make a powerful weapon!  Let's go  back to my house now!  They do just that.  Lucca: I'll modify the Sun Stone to extract its energy... then, we'll just  vacuum pack it into a cartridge...  She plays around with a machine in her home.  Lucca: And it's finished!  She plays around with it, and obtains it as her best weapon.   Lucca: Sometimes I amaze myself!  Taban: Take a look Lucca!  I borrowed a bit of the Sun Stone to create  something nifty!  He gives her Sun Shades.  This ends her quest.  Robo's quest takes place in 2300 A.D., he'll join the  main party.  They'll enter the Geno Dome.  Robo plays with a control panel.  Computer: Who enters here unbidden?  Oh...  Welcome home R-66Y.  Or should I  say, Prometheus?!  You dare to defile this place with humans?  I haven't seen  them in ages.  Let me... welcome them.  Come closer...  A door opens.  They go in.  Computer: let's see just what you can do...  Many battles happen.  Computer: Not bad... for humans.  But can you find your way to me?  They'll work through an essential maze.  After a while Another Robot will  appear.  Robot: Welcome home, Prometheus.  Robo: Atropos?  Atropos: yes, it's been awhile Prometheus.  You can stop pretending now and  join us.  Marle: Pretending?  Atropos: Mwa, ha... Unlike the other R-series, Prometheus had a special task.   To live with humans and study them as a species.  Marle: No!  Atropos: Tell them, Prometheus...  Robo: ......  Atropos: Now step back Prometheus.  We'll get rid of these humans, then go see  Mother...  Marle: Robo......  Robo moves back, Atropos comes in to attack, but Robo blocks it.  Atropos: What are you doing Prometheus?  Robo: I won't allow you to hurt them!  Atropos: You are indeed defective.  They have tampered with you.  I'll destroy  them, then fix you.  Robo: Atropos, you've changed.  Atropos: Indeed.  Mother remade me to eliminate humans more efficiently!  Step  back, Prometheus!  Robo: My name is Robo.  Atropos: Prometheus!!  Atropos knocks Robo back, the rest of the party arms for battle.  Robo: Wait!  Stand back and leave this to me.  Atropos...!  Atropos: Prometheus!!  A one on one battle ensues.  Atropos: P, Prometheus?  It's been... ages...!  Robo: Atropos?  Atropos: I'm damaged?  What happened?  Robo: Atropos!!  Atropos: My memory bank...  Mother must have done something nasty when she  reprogrammed me...  Partial memory... restored...  I'm sorry... Prometheus...  Robo: Atropos...!  Atropos: This... is for you... You can... plug this... into your circuits...   Please... take care... of it...  Good... bye... Pro... metheus...  Atropos dies.  Robo flips a switch to a blocked room.  Computer [Mother Brain]: Listen well, humans.  Lavos's children will one day  have to leave to seek new planets, and prey.  This world COULD sustain them...  if humans were not around...  We robots will create a new order... A nation of  steel, and pure logic.  A true paradise!  Our species will replace you...  So  stop your foolish struggle and succumb to the sleep of eternity...  A few rooms later is a conveyor belt which is hauling things into some sort of  death chamber.  Marle: What IS this?!  We have to do something!  She gets shocked by the machine.  Marle: Aaa!  Robo: Let us stop the machine!    He runs to a computer terminal.  Robo: It's too well guarded.  We have to destroy the central computer.  The control room is nearby, Mother Brain appears.  Mother Brain: You did well to come this far.  I am the Mother Brain of the R-Y  series factory.  Come Prometheus, you must once again join us.  I'll reset  your circuitry and erase your memories.  Then we'll dispose of these filthy  humans.  Robo: ......  I'm sorry but... I cannot afford to lose anything else...  Not  my precious memories, or my irreplaceable friends.  Mother Brain: You would betray ME, to stay with these humans?  You would turn  against the family of robots?  Robo: Humans have taught me much.  Crono, Marle, Lucca, Frog and Ayla...  I  will not betray my friends.  Mother Brain: Fo!  Hu, hu, hu!  This is rich...!  Don't make me laugh!  YOU,  have emotions?!  I'll show you just how human you've become!  She attacks and loses.  Mother Brain: Prometheus... Why?  Robo gets his best gear and runs up to the control panel.  Robo: All machines in the factory have been shut off for good.  Marle: Robo......  Robo: Let's go!  The next quest begins in 600 A.D. in Choras.  A man named Toma hangs out in  the bar.  Toma: Hey Magus, I've finally got a lead on the Rainbow Shell.  But there's  something odd going on...  Oh, can you hang on to this for me?  If I don't  return, come to my grave and pour this on my headstone.  Gee, isn't this  morbid?  Needless to say, he never comes back.  They'll go to 1000 A.D. and find his  grave stone.  Magus pours the pop on the grave.  Toma appears.  Toma: Magus, long time no see.  I've located the Rainbow Shell.  To the  Northwest of this cape is a large island called the Giant's Claw.  You can  find the Shell there.  But beware!  There are many beasts about!  Time to  shove off.  You guys are a riot a minute!  See ya!   Of course, the Giant's Claw he is talking about is in 600 A.D., so they go  there.  Near the entrance is a note from Toma, it reads:  Those holes!  What if I jump into them on purpose?  Yes!  I'll start back at  the beginning and...  They'll continue walking, it is the Tyrano lair, they're in Azala's throne  room!  Marle: Is this the Tyrano Lair?  Ayla: Lavos fall and Tyrano Lair buried underground forever!  Deep in the cave/Tyrano base is Rust Tyrano, a huge version of Black Tyrano.   It will lose and reveal a path not seen millions of years ago.  There is a  shell above.  Marle: THIS's the Rainbow Shell!  They all lift it, but it falls back down.  Ayla: Heavy heavy!  Can't carry.  Castle people help?    They head out and to Guardia castle.  King Guardia: Hello!  You're always welcome here.  What can I do for you?  Marle:  Well...  King Guardia: I get it.  You want me to keep that huge shell safe here until  the next century, right?  Leene: I ask for the sake of Magus.  Please carry out their request.  King Guardia: Done!  I shall obtain the shell and store it in the castle, as a  national treasure.  Knight Captain!  Knight Captain: Yes, Majesty!  King Guardia: Go and obtain the Rainbow Shell, and bring it back in one piece!  Knight Captain: At once, Sire!  Marle: Thank you, your Majesty!  And Queen Leene too, of course!  Guardia Castle in 1000 A.D. is very different.  Almost every door is blocked  by guards.   Guard: No entry allowed!  Marle: Let me through!!  They get out of the way, Marle and the group enter to find a trial in progress.  Chancellor: Had any of you heard of the Rainbow Shell?  I too, had no idea  until I found this...  It's an ancestral will.  It says, "Unveil the Rainbow  Shell to the people at the Millennial Fair." King: What are you talking about?!  We have no family heirlooms here!  Chancellor: So this is a forgery?  Why does the defendant deny the people a  glimpse of the Rainbow Shell?  Because he no longer HAS it!!  He sold the  heirloom for cash!  Witness, please!  Marle runs into view.  Chancellor: Wh, what is it, Nadia?  We are conducting a trial here.  Marle: Father!  King: Nadia!  The Chancellor is trying to frame me!  Chancellor: He hurls insults!  Confirm your innocence with proof!  Marle: Proof?  Chancellor: Yes.  If he hasn't sold the heirloom, it should be in the castle.   Show me the Rainbow Shell and I'll accept his innocence, heh, heh...  King: Chancellor!  What kind of trickery is this?!  Chancellor: Remove them!  Guards remove Marle from the court room.  They won't let Marle back in.  Ayla: Take Rainbow Shell!  Save Marle's father!!  Marle: What ARE you saying?  It's a lie!  There IS no heirloom!  Ayla: Remember Marle?!  We ask old king save shell! Rainbow Shell here now!  Marle: Aha!  The Rainbow Shell we gave to my ancestor 400 years ago is still  here.  It's probably in the basement!  They rush down, a guard is dead near the entrance.  There are two Gnashers  nearby.  Dumb: The boss is itching to avenge the grudge that's been in the family for  13 generations!  Gee hee!  Dumber: He's gonna frame the king!  Ga haw!  Marle: So there IS a plot!  Let's hurry!    The scene shifts to the courtroom.  Merchant: I confess.  I bought it from the king.  He said he needed the cash.  King: Liar!!  I've never even seen you before!  Judge: Order in the court!  Merchant [To Chancellor]: Heh heh.  Was I convincing?  Chancellor: Perfect!  The scene goes back to Marle and crew rushing through the basement.  They find  the shell sitting in storage.  Marle: The Rainbow Shell!!  Ayla: Something here!  Paper here, paper!  Marle: To Marle...?    It reads: Dearest Marle, I know things are tough between you and your father.   But nothing can break your bond of blood.  Neither words of anger, nor great  distances.  Someday, when you have children, you will understand.  This  special bond is part of a family tree which links us together.  -Queen Guardia  XXI, Leene.  Ayla: Ayla know about leaving nest!  Time pass, grow big, leave nest!  Ayla  leave nest!  Dactyl leave nest too.  Marle leave too?  Big change!  Leave  nest!  Have baby!  Baby grow big!  Leave nest too!  Marle: Father!  Hang in there, we're coming!  Ayla: Sure you ready leave nest?  Not too big yet.  The scene is back to the court room.    Judge: Members of the jury... If he is guilty, stand to the left.  If  innocent, stand to the right.    They proclaim guilty.  Marle runs back up to the door of the room.  The guards  still won't let her pass.  Marle: You won't reconsider?  Soldier: No, Princess.  Marle: There is one way... It's a bit rough, but just follow me!  The final decision is four to one in favor of guilty.  Judge: The verdict is in!  Guilty!!!  Chancellor: The Guardia line ends here.  This domain shall be mine!  Take him  away!  Voice: Wait!!!  Chancellor: Who is it?!  Marle climbs a stained glass window behind the Judge.  Marle: FATHER!!!  She jumps through it.  King: Nadia!  Chancellor: Princess!  Control yourself!  You're too late!  The King has been  found guilty.  Even kings are subject to our laws.  Marle: No, this was a set up!  Chancellor: Nonsense!  The King's a crook!  Marle: But the treasure is right here!  Chancellor: Impossible!!  Marle: Your little scheme is over, Chancellor!    Chancellor: Grrr... I mean uh...  Marle: Huh?  Chancellor: Hee hee hee!  It's not the plot you think!  I'm here to avenge my  ancestors!  The King escapes the room.  Chancellor: Super, ultra, presto... TRANSFORM-O!!!!!!  He changes into Yakra XIII, the descendant of the evil in the Cathedral in 600  A.D.  A battle ensues, but Yakra is defeated.  The king re-enters the room.  Marle: Father...  I...  King: No, don't say it.  I was wrong to be so stubborn.  Marle: No, I didn't even think about how you felt.  Um...  I know it in my  heart, but the words just come out wrong.  King: I too, have that problem.  I thought you left me, but realized that it  was I, who abandoned you.  Marle: But I'm here now.  We'll talk about everything that's happened.  About  Crono, and mother, and...  King: Your mother...  How sad!  It has taken me so long to understand what  Aliza meant with her last words. "Someday when Nadia grows up, she will bring  her beloved to meet you.  Welcome him warmly.  It will be a day you remember  forever." Marle: You... heard her last words?  King: Of course!  You were so young!  You ran around saying "Daddy, it's fun  having all my favorite people here!" Seeing you so happy, she felt reassured  and she left us quite peacefully.  Marle: So that's how it was...  King: Yes, why?  Marle: I used to call you Daddy?  King: You did.  Marle: I'm sorry... Daddy.  I'm really sorry for doubting you.  They hug, how cute!  A while later they are in the throne room.  King: I'll let you exit the castle, BUT!  You be careful, now.  Take care of  her!  Ayla: You no worry!  Ayla protect Marle!  Melchior: It's my turn now.  He busts into the room.  Marle: Melchior!  Melchior: Can't let you run the whole show.  Let me make some weapons from the  Rainbow Shell!  Finally time for me to do somethin'.  Watch and learn!  They'll head down to the Rainbow Shell.  Melchior: This is a very rare!  As armor, it deflects magic!  I can make you 1  Prism Dress, featuring maximum defense.  Or I can make 3 less-effective Prism  Helms.  Which would you prefer?  He'll make whichever.  He'll make a weapon out of the Sun Stone.  The real  chancellor was locked up in a treasure chest... what is it with these guys  anyway?  Chancellor: Phew, finally!  That beast, keepin' me locked up in here...!   Princess Nadia!  Your friends, I presume?  Wait, I don't have time for this.   I must prepare for the Moonlight parade!  This quest is done.  They leave.  The next quest starts at Fiona's Villa in  600 A.D.  This one only occurs if the lady in 12,000 B.C. who was ordered to  throw out a seedling instead was told by Crono and crew to secretly plant it.  Fiona: My husband Marco is finally home!  I... I'm so relieved!  Marco: Don't worry.  I'm home for good.  Fiona: The desert monsters are draining the life out of the soil here.  This  Mystic seedling could revive the forest, but I can't plant it.  Too many  hungry monsters lurking about.  In the second 'floor' things pop up from the sand.  Marle: What was that?  Ayla: They make forest into desert!  Marle: But how can one find a monster that roams the inner earth?  They attack it and win.  Marle: At least Fiona will be happy!  They head back to her home.  Robo leads the party.  Fiona: Thank you for routing the beasts!  Unfortunately, it'll take centuries  to revive the forest.  I wish I could live long enough to see my wish come  true!  Robo: You can come for me when the job is done.  May I stay behind and help  Fiona?  [Alright]  They journey ahead to 1000 A.D. and the area has been replaced by a forest.  A  shrine has been built in Fiona's honor.  Robo is in the shrine.  Lucca runs up  to him.  She turns him back on.  Robo: Systems reactivated.  Wh, where am I?  Ahh...  Lucca, how nice to see  you.  For you, it was a quick hop, but for me, 400 long years have passed.   The effort was worth it!  The forest has grown back!  Now, let us celebrate  our 400th year reunion!  They have a camp out in the forest.   Robo: After 400 years of experience, I have come to think that Lavos may not  be responsible for the Gates.  Marle: What do you mean?  Robo: I have come to think that someone, or something wanted us to see all  this.  The different events over time, that we have witnessed.  It is almost  as if some entity wanted to relive its past.  Ayla: Ayla know!  When people die, elders say, see whole life pass by!  Frog: 'Tis true that mortals do relive their most profound memories before  death claimeth them.  Yet those memories most often are sad ones.    Robo: Thinking things like "If only I had done this," or "I shouldn't have  done that..." triggers unpleasant, old memories.  Marle: Will that happen when our time comes?  Lucca: Probably... who knows?  Marle: Is there a point in time you'd want to return to, Lucca?  Lucca: No... not really...  Marle: I'm sorry, was that something I shouldn't have asked?  Lucca: It's ok, it's just something I don't like to think about too much.  Frog: Lavos playeth an integral role in the fortunes of this Entity...  Magus: So who is this Entity?  Robo: It is unknown, whose memories these are.  It may be something beyond our  comprehension.  Our journey may come to an end when we finally discover the  identify of the Entity.  Shall we turn in for the night?  They sleep, but Lucca wakes up.  She walks away from them all and enters a  Gateway.  It drops her off in her home.  Lucca: Did I make it back... to that moment?  Lucca is eight years in the past, her mother is about to go dusting off one of  Taban's machines.  Lara: What IS this thing?  Taban says to keep away from it, but it's so  dusty.  I'll just...  She starts dusting.  Lara: Dear me!  My skirt... it's... I'm STUCK!  Lucca!  Lucca, HELP!  Lucca, from eight years ago runs up to her.  Young Lucca:  I can't pull it out.    It turns on.  Lara: !! Lucca!  Enter the password!  Stop this machine!  Young Lucca: But I don't know it, mommie!  Big Lucca shuts it off, the password was of course, Lara.  Young Lucca: Thank goodness, mommie.  Lara: Lucca... Lucca...  Lucca's mother is no longer crippled.  She goes back into the Gateway and  comes out next to Robo.  Robo: Lucca, you've got a kind heart.  You're always thinking of others.  This  is for you.  It's a piece of amber I created using the sap from a tree in my  forest.  It took 400 years and a lot of pressure to make!  I hope you'll find  it useful.  He gives her Green Dream.  Lucca: Robo... you're so sweet.  The final side quest is that of the Black Omen, the massive tower which flies  above the ground in all time periods.  It is entered from 1000 A.D., just  above Melchior's house.  They jump off of the Epoch and land near a door.  They'll fight their way in.   Just inside is Queen Zeal.  Queen Zeal: Fools!  Haven't you learned your lesson?!  We are immortal!  We  shall live forever with Lavos, who devours this planet even as he sleeps.   Within 999 years he'll become the ruler of this world.  The Black Omen is a  path which leads to Lavos.  It is a shrine which provides us with limitless  power.  As long as the mighty one reigns, your dreams are hopeless!  She summons a mutant.  Queen Zeal: You should sacrifice yourself to the mighty Lavos!  HAAhahahaha!    She leaves them to battle the mutant.  The mutant will lose.  The party will  walk around for quite a while as Black Omen is huge.  Eventually they'll run  into an even bigger mutant!  They'll beat this one too.  Only a short distance  away is yet a bigger mutant, what fun.  Business picks up though.  A Lavos  spawn tests its might against the party next.  As they head forward, there are  images of all of the party members in some sort of stasis cell.  Queen Zeal: Behold, my pretties!  Destiny, in its most brutal form.  All the  dreams that might have been.  All the happiness, and sorrow, you might have  experience.  Gone forever!!!  For you there will be no tomorrow!  The Dark  Omen transcends time and space, waiting for Lavos to awaken!  Destiny has led  you here.  And here you shall rest forever, unless you can defeat me, and  smash the Omen!  Come, dear friends.  Perhaps I can persuade Lavos to share  his dreams with you!  Did I say dreams?  I meant his eternal nightmare!  She attacks and loses after a tough fight.  Queen Zeal: Argh!  My powers don't seem to work here!  Wait!  I'll simply toss  you into the Mammon Machine!  You'll be one with the Omen, Lavos... and me!  They immediately fight the Mammon Machine.  The Queen appears on top of  something huge, probably the Mammon Machine.  She isn't very happy right now.  Queen Zeal: You cretins...  I plan to live with Lavos, and control the  universe forever.  You will not get in my way!  Magus: Idiots...  Nothing can live forever.  Zeal... A pitiful woman, duped by  Lavos!  I, myself, will bring an end to all of this!  Queen Zeal: Prophet!  You are doomed.  I haven't forgotten what you did at the  Ocean Palace.  You will now forfeit your life.  She will attack and be rather unhappy when she loses.  Queen Zeal: How dare you insects come after ME!  Oh, almighty Lavos, lend me  your power!  Mwa, ha, ha...  At last, Lavos awakens!  Compared with him, you  are like germs.  But, I... I shall obtain immortality!  She vanishes.  The Black Omen begins to sink under the water.  Lavos busts out  from under the water.  Lavos's shell attacks the party, he'll mimic various  bosses throughout the game.  After several mimicking, he'll finally attack as  himself.  His head will be defeated.  Ayla: Lavos down!  Ayla No1!!!  Marle: But THIS couldn't have done him in...!  Magus: We'll get to the bottom of this, Lavos...  They enter the hole in his shell where his head was.  Marle: We're in pretty deep...  Ayla: !!  Lavos smell... STRONGER!!  Magus: No turning back now.  Since there's only one way to go, they go it.  Soon, quite soon, they reach  Lavos's Core.  Magus: Finally... You have met your match, Lavos!  Marle: This... is... Lavos!  Lavos is defeated.  But, it isn't over yet.  The final form of Lavos appears.  Magus: ......  So... since the dawn of time, it has slept underground,  controlling evolution on this world for his own purpose.  Marle: Are you saying IT'S the reason we're all here?  Magus: We were created only to be harvested.  All people and all living  things...  It's over for you...  Your life ends here!  ---Endings---  There are 12 endings in Chrono Trigger, 13 if you want to count losing to Lavos as an ending.  They are all gained by defeating Lavos at various stages of the game.  The endings dialogues, unlike the game, are not affected by what  characters are in your party, with the of a few minor details in the first  ending, such as not having Magus at all.  I'll add them as I do them!  1. Normal ending - Gotten if one does the entire game.    2. Development Team - Ending if Crono and Marle jump on the right Telepod at  the fair and fight Lavos right off the bat.  Game+ mode is the only feasible  way to do this.  3. Frog and Leene - his ending opens when Marle, Crono and Lucca return from  600 A.D. for the first time.  It is accessed from the right Telepod of Lucca's  invention.  4. Sleeping Ending - This ending is available after speaking to Spekkio and  the man near the lamppost in the End of Time.  Use the bucket to battle Lavos  in 1999 A.D.  5. Robo's Love - This ending only takes place after finding out that Tata is  the legendary hero, but before getting the Hero Badge.  6. Slideshow 1 - This ending happens once Tata gives Crono and company the  Hero Badge.  7. Sprites - This ending is obtainable after the Gate Key is gotten back from  the Reptites in 65,000,000 B.C.  8. Avenger - May be seen after the Masamune is repaired and right after frog  rejoins the party.  9. When Reptites Ruled the World - Obtained after beating Magus but before  Azala.  10. The Prophet - Obtained after defeating Azala in the Tyrano Lair.  11. Tales of a Teenage Drama Queen - Watch Schala use her pendant on the door,  but do NOT power up Marle's.  12. Crono-Less - Defeat Lavos after Crono dies but before trying to revive him.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) Normal Ending -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The Leene  bell tolls, Crono is asleep in his bed.  Soldier: Crono... Crono!  Crono!!!  It's time to rise and shine!  We have a  little surprise for you!  He opens the curtains.  Soldier: Your stay of execution has been cancelled.  We must now carry out  your sentence.  Crono is taken to Guardia Castle [1000 A.D. - Present]  He kneels before the  king.  King: We've been looking for you, Crono.  Where did you take my daughter?  Marle runs in.  Marle: Daddy, don't!  Crono hasn't done a thing!  King [To Chancellor (or The Lawyer, Pierre if the Chancellor is still in a  chest)]: She says Crono has been a perfect gentleman, but...  What do you  think, Chancellor?  Chancellor: Crono's deeds have had an enormous impact on the kingdom!  Marle: Chancellor, how could you?!  Please!  Just listen to me!  We had to...  King: Save the future, right?  Marle: Huh??  Frogs music plays.  Doan enters.  Doan: You saved the future, and gave us hope.  The King of Guardia from 600 A.D. enters.  King Guardia: You fought Magus's troops, and brought peace to the kingdom in  the year 600.  Kino enters.  Kino: Crono beat Reptites!  Marle is beside herself.  Marle: Wh, what's going on here?  Lucca comes out from behind the throne.  Marle: Lucca!  You brought them here, didn't you?  King: Our kinsmen told me all about your incredible mission.  Marle: Kinsmen?!  You mean these're MY ancestors... and descendants?  King: Here I was fussing about my kingdom, and my daughter, and you were  saving past, present and future!  Now, for a true victory parade!  Tonight we  celebrate... you!  Now Marle, go out and enjoy the last night of the fair!  Marle and Crono visit the fair together.  They watch a show.  Blue Imp: Come along with Crono, our Hero.  Princess Nadia is finally home!   At last, Guardia is back to normal!  A moonlight parade begins.  Lights, balloons, dancing.  Wow, this fair has  everything!  The entire party assembles near Lucca's invention at the north  end of the fair.  Lucca: Well everyone, this is it.  Frog: Each to thine time.  Robo: The Gate has grown weak...  Lucca: We've got to say our goodbyes before the Gate closes.  Marle: You're all leaving?  Ayla: Crono was strong.  Marle too!  Ayla have fun!!  Marle: You're my distant ancestor.  So you'd better have tough kids or I'll be  in trouble!  Kino: Heh, heh!  No worry.  Ayla VERY strong!  Marle: Right!  Hey... what do you mean by that?  Ayla: Kino dummie!  We go now!  Kino runs through the gate.  Ayla blows kisses and does as well.  Frog: 'Tis a feisty crowd!  But they are thine kin, and 'tis of consequence.   Queen Leene awaits.  Your majesty, we too shall take our leave.  King Guardia 600 A.D. enters the gate.  Marle: Mr. Frog...  Frog: Long farewells ne'er were necessary.  Marle: Right!  Besides, actions speak louder than words!  She plants a kiss on his... um... cheek.  Lucca: Yeah.  Don't these things end with the princess kissing the frog?  Frog hops through the gate, Magus runs up to it.  Marle: So... you're going to search for Schala?  He runs through it as well.  Robo: Lucca, I will miss you.  Marle: What's wrong Lucca?  Aren't you going to say goodbye to Robo?  Robo: She knows.  Marle: Knows... what?  Lucca: Robo was born in a bleak future.  When we defeated Lavos, we changed  history.  Robo... may not exist in the future.  Robo: Ha ha.  Please relax.  The new future has a place for me!  Lucca: Darn it, Robo!  Don't pretend you don't care when you're really sad!   It just makes things worse!  Robo: Lucca, YOU have taught me these emotions.  Thank you.  Marle: Tears don't become you, Lucca!  Robo'll be there in the new future!  Robo: Good... bye.  Robo bumps into a machine.  Robo: Caution!  Oil has washed over my sight sensors.  Sight diminished...  They laugh.  Robo waves and goes through the Gate.  Lucca: Do you remember that talk we had?  Marle: You mean about whether our lives flash by before we die?  Lucca: Yeah.  I get the feeling that the Entity is finally at rest.  Marle: Yes, I feel that too...  Time travel... how exhausting!  Lucca: We should dismantle the Epoch.  Its job is finished.  Crono's cat runs up to the gate, followed by his mom.  Crono's Mom: You naughty thing, come back here!  Look, Crono!  Your cat's  running away because you haven't been feeding it!  The Cat goes through the Gate.  Crono's Mom: Hey, come back here!  Crono's mom goes through it too, the Gate seals.  Crono tries to get to her but is too late.  Marle: Oh, great!  Crono, that Gate will never open again!  Lucca: Well it looks like we have no choice but to go after them!  Marle: Go after them?!  But the Gate's...  Lucca, don't turn off your brain,  yet!  Lucca: I forgot!  We have a Time Machine!  Nya ha ha!  A Guardia Soldier enters.  Soldier: Oh, Princess, the King asks for your presence.  They run down a screen to the King.  King: I'm so happy!  Now there's no reason for you to go away anymore.  I have  a gift for you, to commemorate this day, Princess Nadia.  He brings up a lot of balloons attached to a bell.  King: This is Nadia's Bell.  It will ring out across the land.   He goes to hang it up.  Lucca and Crono run.  King: Marle... where did you go?  Could someone please lend me a hand?  Marle: Daddy...  I hate to say this but...  I can't sit around doing nothing!  She runs off too.  The Epoch is heard blasting away.  Taban enters near the King.    Taban: Phew!  made it just in time!  Shall I fire one off?  King: Uh, no Taban.  Actually, I could really use your help...  Taban lights fireworks which light the sky while the end credits play.  All of  the characters are shown doing various actions during them and the Epoch flies  around.  The End!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2) Development Team -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  Crono and  Marle arrive at the End of Time.  There are several Gates open, each leading to many different people.  Each body here is a member of the Chrono Trigger  Development team.  In no particular order, this is what they say.  Development Team: Good job!  You've finished the hardest version of the game!   This is the development room for the Chrono Trigger game.  Take a walk around  and hear what the team has to say...  Keizo Kokubo: Well I hope everyone can say it was a learning experience!  When  you complete your rounds, come back to see me.  Kazumi Kobayashi: I've lost 22 pounds because of this game.  You'd better be enjoying it!  Yukio Nakatani: Will you be my friend?

Koichi Ebe: Wow, you just jetted through the game huh?  Let me throw you a  kiss!  Akane Haruki: Feed me!  They've kept me locked up for so long!   Tetsuya Takahashi: If you thought this was tough, get a load of Final Fantasy  2.  Hasui: Shh, I'm in the middle of something good here!  Toshiaki Suzyki: Aaack!  I'm so tired... No, I'm hungry... No, I can't  decide... Ack!  They've made me into a zombie, working on this game...  Katsuhisa Higuchi: Legendary programmer seeks that special someone.  Waiting  for those cards and letters.  Shun Moriya: I've been working on this ROM for 24 hrs!  Aaah!!  Someone save  me... I'm getting sucked in!  Ken Nartia: Love was in the air... But then... the boat sank.  Sigh...

Yusuke Naora: Well are we having fun yet?  Tsutomu Terada: Hey don't mess with the monsters I created!  They kinda grow  on you after a while you know?  Makota Shimamoto: Can you do it?  THE 9999 damage point strike!  Hiroshi Uchiyama: That's a good costume you go on there, Kid.  Wait!  It's  really YOU, isn't it?!  Kaname: Like, does this mean we're finally free to go home?  Yasunoir Mitsuda: Well, it's my turn to go on a journey!  Keita Eto: It'll cost you 10,000,000G to fix a broken map.  Kazuhiro Ohkawa: Congratulations!  Now wasn't that fun?  Yoshinori Ogura: Well I'm glad they gave me a bit part in this game...  Shinichiro Okaniwa: Gee, you know they kept us locked up for a long time.  My  hair's THIS long as a result!  [He is speaking from the sprite of Magus]  Matsuzo Itakura: Did you figure out the Poyozo Dance attack?  See you in the  next game.  Yasuyuki Honne: Phew, what a relief it's over!  Shinichiro Hamasaka: Good job guys!  Yasuhiko Kamata: Isn't 32 megs great?  The graphics become incredible.  It was  painful at times, but it sure was fun!  Mami Kawai: Oops!

Kato: Every night will have a day.  Even forever has to come to an end.  I  think...  There is a note on a table: Don't look for me... - Hiroko Yamamoto.  Keizo Kokubo [after everyone else is spoken to]: Well then, open the Gates to  the Dream Team!  The nearby gate opens.  There are more people inside.  Akira Toriyama: Heeey!  Sasuke!  Kikka!  Pop's working on games like this!   Hey are you guys watching?  Isn't this great?!  Nobuo Uematsu: [this sentence is listed backwards in the game] I have nothing  better to do than read this.  [now normal] Now run out side and play, boys and  girls!  Yuji Horii: One of these things in not like the others... A stapler, Mothra,  and the Olympics.  SO... which one is it?  Kazuhiko Aoki: Guess what!  I hit the 100,000 yen jackpot!  Hironobu Sakaguchi: Boy, it used to be that I'd get thinner after each game.   Now I'm gaining weight instead.  Ack!  I must be getting old.  Cheers!  You  made it to one of the endings!  You're now a member of the Dream Team!  And  since you blew through the game so fast, we have adjusted the credits to suit  your style!  The credits roil entirely in under ten seconds.  The End!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) Frog and Leene -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  They are spit  out at the Millennial Fair.  Everyone at the fair is accusing Marle of wearing  a disguise.  Marle: Something doesn't look right...  Let's return to the castle!  They are now in Guardia Castle.  Marle: Father!  What's wrong with the townspeople!?  King: Where have you been, Nadia?  First, calm down.  And why those clothes?  Marle: Everybody keeps saying that!  What do you mean?  King: What ARE you babbling about?  You needn't keep dressing that way!   You're just in time!  We found this 400 year old wedding album in the treasury.  The King hops away a bit.  Marle looks and is in shock.  Lucca: Marle!  No!  Tell me you didn't...  Marle is again freaked out.  While the roll, Frog and one of Marle's ancestors get married in the Cathedral.    Marle: Nooo!  This can't be!!  The End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4) Sleeping ending -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.   The Credits roll.  A Nu and a Ribbit [a frog] are playing around.  The Nu  tries to sleep, the Ribbit wakes it up and the Nu chases the Ribbit around.   The Ribbit loses him and sneaks back onto the screen to sleep.  The Nu catches  it and chases after it again.  This goes back and forth throughout the entire  credits.  The end.  What a lame ending!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5) Robo's Love -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The credits  roll.  Robo is a future building.  He walks around and is run into by another  robot, just like Marle and Crono collided in the beginning of the game.  They  walk off together.  They sit atop a mountain looking out over the land, how  romantic.  The scene shifts to the Guardia Castle [600 A.D.] Throne Room.   Tata is on the throne.  He runs out of the castle and into Magus's Lair.  He  battles monsters throughout the place.  Hero Tata: Magus!!  But Magus isn't sitting on the throne!  Crono and his friends are!  They laugh  at Tata. The end.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6) Slideshow 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The credits  roll.  During them, Crono, Marle and Lucca come out of a closet in the Medina  Village 1000 A.D., which is where a Gate exists.  They laugh.  Ayla and some  other cavemen chase Reptites around a forest.  Magus stands at a cliff near  Ozzie.  Guardia's army stands in front of its own castle.  Frog wanders around  in a forest of his own.  Robo runs across the screen and beats on his chest,  then falls over.  He waves goodbye and brings up the message, The End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7) Sprites -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The credits  roll.  Various sprites of almost everyone and everything in the game are shown  throughout them.  While it is quite dull, it is neat seeing all of the sprites  so close together.  The End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8) Avenger -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The scene is  in Lucca's house.  Lucca is repairing Robo.  Lucca: Phew...  You're pretty stubborn.  Robo: My apologies, Lucca...  Lucca: It's not your fault.  We're the one's who created weapons...  [Looking  at Crono] Man, that fool sleeps a lot.  We should make him help us!  Marle: No!  Let him sleep.  He fought long and hard.  Lucca: Phew... all right.  Frog: ......  Marle: Where're you going?  We just got cozy.  Frog: Gotta take care of some business...  Frog trips over one of Lucca's books.  Marle: Tee, hee...  Everyone laughs at him.  The credits roll.  The scene shifts to Magus's lair.    Slash: Finally, we've got someone who wants to die young!  Flea: Har har, this is hilarious...!  So you think YOU can take us...?  Frog enters the lair.  Ozzie:  Y, you're!!  Frog kills Ozzie. He walks to Magus's main room and enters it.  Magus: Neuga, ziena, zieber, zom... Now the chosen time has come...  Exchange  this world for...!  So you came...  We wizards and humans have brought about  our own ruin...  Except for you and I, this world is populated by cretins...   The one who wins this battle... will rule the world...  No, make that RULE THE  FUTURE...  Frog: So that's the story...  But who cares.  but there is some merit to fight  you!  Magus: Hmmm... You have the Masamune...  Let's see if you know how to use  it...  If you're prepared for the void!   They fight to Magus's excellent battle theme while the credits continue to  roll.  Magus is defeated, Frog stands atop of his lair on the statue of the  dragon.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9) When Reptites Ruled the World -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  Crono's Mom: Crono.  Crono!  Wake up, Crono!    The screen appears, Crono and his mom are Reptites!  Crono's Mom: It's time to rise and shine!  Dreams are for sleepers, son!  She opens the window.  Crono's Mom: Dear me!  I'd forgotten how beautiful Leene's Bell sounds!  You  were so excited about the millennial Fair that you didn't sleep well, did  you...?  I want you to behave yourself today.  Now, get out of bed!  She leaves the room, Crono gets up and walks around the town.  Everyone in it  is a Reptite.  Eventually he walks to the fair.  Everyone there except for a  select few individuals are also Reptites.  He bumps into the Reptite Marle, in  essence, this scene is identical to the opening scene of the game, except  most everyone is a Reptite!  Azala falls down under the sign proclaiming The  End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10) The Prophet -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The credits  roll.  During them, A scene of Frog approaching a strange statue occurs.   Magus, as the prophet is with Schala and Queen Zeal near a gate.  Tata and  Frog are in the same pub, probably where Frog dropped the Hero Badge.  Magus  spends most of the ending walking around with Janus and Schala though.  Other  scenes of Taban and Ayla having a drinking fest happen as well.  Lucca burns a  dinner at Crono's house.  Magus walks alone in the Ocean Palace.  Magus: If history is to change, let it change!  If they world is to be  destroyed, so be it!  If my fate is to be destroyed... I must simply laugh!!   I'm coming, Lavos!  Sounds of Magus and Lavos fighting happen.  The End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11) Tales of a Teenage Drama Queen -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lavos is defeated.  There is a brief flash of all time periods.  The End.  Marle: What!  This's ending already?  Lucca: that's what that word usually means!  Marle: But things were just starting to get interesting!  Lucca: Well, come on folks, let's do the ending thing.  Marle: ROLL THE CREDITS!  But first, let's remember all the fun things we did!  Lucca: Okay!  Let the ultimate slid show begin!  Marle: First, let's see a close up of Leene Square!  Enter Steel Runner.  Lucca: There's the Steel Runner.  Marle: I've never understood why anyone would want to run for 3 hours at a  stretch.  Lucca: Forget that!  Can you imagine what the inside of that armor must smell  like?  Marle: What a lovely thought, Lucca.  Let's get on with the show, OKAY?!  Exit Steel Runner. Enter Guardia Soldier.  Lucca: Next let's visit Guardia Castle, your home.  Marle: Goodness!  VERY nice scenery!  Lucca: But of course, my dear!  Marle: I guess you never took a shot at him, right?  Say, didn't he just wink  at you?  Lucca: RELAX, Marle!  Exit Guardia Soldier.  Enter Pierre.  Marle: Hey!  It's Pierre!  Lucca: Wouldn't want anything to do with someone like HIM.  Too shifty... He  should be put on trial!  Exit Pierre.  Enter Fiona.  Marle: Come on, Lucca.  Live it up a little!  Let your hair down!  Get crazy!!!  Lucca: Yeah, thanks PRINCESS.  I'll take that under advisement!!  Marle: There's the seed.  Hope it grows...  Exit Fiona.  Enter Johnny.  Lucca: Theeeeeere's Johnny... Mr. Speed himself!  Marle: Someone ought to tell him to take a permanent pit stop.  Look at that  hair!  Lucca: Hey, check it out.  He's really a tricycle!  Pass him!  Marle: Try again when you learn to RIDE.  Exit Johnny.  Enter Cyrus.  Lucca: There's that stuffed-shirt Cyrus!  Marle: He IS pretty handsome, though...  Lucca: But WHERE does he buy his clothes?  Marle: Hey, did you hear?  He plucks his eyebrows!  Lucca: You've GOT to be joking!  But... he's still a hunk!  Exit Cyrus.  Enter Toma.  Marle: Hi, Toma!  Now HE'S definitely my type.  Lucca: Aw, he's just a flake.  Marle: Probably has a dozen girlfriends.  Lucca: Actually, I see him as more of an intellectual!  Exit Toma.  Enter Kino.  Marle: What about him?  That Kino guy?  Lucca: Total Neanderthal!  Throw him a bone!  Marle: But he's honest.  That's kind of attractive.  Lucca: He walks like a DUCK!!  Exit Kino.  Marle: Well, he'll never hurt anyone.    Lucca: he's really very gentle, isn't he?  Enter Crono.  Crono: What ARE you two doing?!  I though you said something about a little  slide show?  Lucca and Marle are in shock.  Lucca: Crono!!!  Marle: So, we got a little carried away!  Lucca: Where do you want to go next?!  Marle: Some place fun!!  Crono: How about into the now?!  Lucca: Now, as in the present?  Marle: Okay!  Back to the present!  Exit Crono and Marle.  Lucca: So I guess we don't need a Gate Key anymore, right?  Hey!  Wait a sec!!!  The End.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12) Crono-less -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If anyone has the script for this ending I would appreciate it.  Feel free to  email it to Jason@lelando.net .  I'll of course give full credit to anyone who  is able to provide that information to me.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
