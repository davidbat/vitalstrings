Giant        anteater - myrmecophaga tridactyla.  Also known as the        ant-bear.
Order - Edentata - comprised of mammals including tree sloths, anteaters, and armadillos. Family - Myrmecophagidae
Giant anteaters range throughout      most of tropical America from northern Argentina to Guatemala      and Honduras. Anteaters live in tropical savannas and forests of     these regions.
 
The anteater has an elongated snout.          The sticky substance of its tongue traps insects. It eats up         to 30,000 ants, termites and other insects each day.
The claws of the anteater's front feet are hooked backward and         serve the animal for ripping into ant and termite nests.
Anteaters seldom spend more than a couple of minutes feeding      at any one nest. Only a few thousand insects are removed at one     feeding and then the nest is abandoned to repairs. The anteaters      circulate around their territories, feeding lightly here and      there, never destroying any one nest and, therefore, never eliminating      any of their food base. Termites and ants recover losses very      rapidly.
Anteaters have a good sense of smell,     but poor eyesight.
The anteater is toothless. The order name Edentata means     "no teeth."
The anteater's body is from 4 to 6 feet     long, with course hair and a long, wide tail. They weigh from      40 to 85 pounds.
The giant anteater walks clumsily on the      soles of its back feet and on the in-turned claws of its front     feet. The claws are curved inward to keep them from being dulled.
Adults are normally solitary.
The mother        anteater carries her single offspring on her back for a considerable        length of time, even though the baby anteater is capable of a slow gallop        four weeks after birth.
The        anteater can fight off a jaguar of puma with its sharp        claws.
Tamandua -  Lesser anteater - tamandua     tetradactyla.
The tamandua is a tree-dwelling relative      of the giant anteater.
The habitat is in the Amazon basin, in      the wet and dry forests northern South America.
The tamandua has short hair and is either      tan and black or it is entirely black. It lives in trees where      it feeds on ants and termites. The tamandua wraps its long, prehensile      tail around branches to keep from falling while eating.
