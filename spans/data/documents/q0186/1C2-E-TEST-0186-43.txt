What Animal Has No Teeth or Jaws, But Can Still Eat?
There are many animals without teeth, but almost every animal has some kind of jaws it can open and close to take in food. Except the anteater!
This strange-looking creature from South America appears to have no mouth, for his snout is shaped like a tube and contains neither teeth nor jaws.
Then how does the anteater eat? . . . With his tongue! The anteater’s tongue is very long, sometimes over a foot in length, and very sticky. The anteater searches for an ant hill, rips it open with his paws, and licks up dozens of ants with a single swipe of his tongue. Then the anteater sucks his tongue back into his tube-like snout and swallows the ants in one gulp!
A creature that eats only ants may seem harmless, but the anteater is strong and vicious. He has sharp claws on his front feet and a sharp spine behind those claws that can punch a hole in an animal’s flesh. And the giant anteater may be as big as a bear!
