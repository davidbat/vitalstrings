No special status
Aardvarks are widespread, however, they have been exterminated in many agricultural areas. They are vulnerable in all settled areas and endangered or extinct in areas with a high concentration of people. They are often hunted by farmers and ranchers who find their hole digging inconvenient or dangerous. Cultivation and pesticide use has resulted in the elimination of their food source in some areas. ( Kingdon, 1997 ; Knöthig, 2005 )
Other Comments
Recent studies based on DNA sequence analysis have placed aardvarks in a taxon referred to as Afrotheria. Other animals in this group include elephants , hyraxes , sirenians , elephant-shrews , golden moles , and tenrecs .  Afrotherians are thought to have originated and evolved in Africa. Fossil records and morphology are beginning to support the molecular evidence. The order to which aardvarks belong, Tubulidentata , is unique because it is the only mammalian order that is represented by a single species. ( Lehmann, 2009 ; Tabruce, et al., 2008 )
