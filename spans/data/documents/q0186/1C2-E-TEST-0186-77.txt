Yes. The fox loves to eat rabbits, bugs, fish etc. However, a small fox might be frightened...

Foxes are generally omnivorous and though they prefer meat, they also eat nuts, berries and any sort of fruit. It is not uncommon for them to eat vegetables and even grains. Many species of fox (especially Red Foxes) tend to prefer living close to human settlements especially farms. They are smart animals and realize that this is a hunting haven for them as they have access to mice, rabbits as well as the farmer's poultry and crops.
Gifted with a keen and good judgment of smell and hearing foxes make superb hunters. Those living in the wild tend to be better hunters. They easily uncover birds' nests or animal burrows and dens. They eat almost anything including eggs, frogs, lizards, earthworms, insects, and if desperate for a meal even decaying animal flesh. They are generally nocturnal hunters and often bury any uneaten food so that they can come back for it when they are hungry.

Contrary to popular belief , Red Foxes are omnivores, meaning they will eat both meat and vegetation. They are also scavengers, so they will eat dead animal remains. Their diet include just about anything smaller than themselves, including berries, grapes, acorns, chipmunks, squirrels, lizards, rabbits, birds, and fish including crayfish ("craw dads") and clams. The starving red fox will even eat a skunk or a snapping turtle, if necessary.
