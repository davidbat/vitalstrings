A sloth has tiny ears and doesn't hear very well. But it has great          eyesight, a good sense of smell, and is sensitive to vibrations.
SLOTHS
Perhaps my favorite animal found the rainforest is the sloth.          Costa Rica is home to two of the five species of sloth, the two-toed (Chollepus          hoffmanni) and three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus).
The sloth is the slowest mammal on Earth. It takes a month          for a sloth to move 1 kilometer!
Sloths are arboreal animals, which means that they spend          most of their lives hanging upside-down from tree branches. They eat,          sleep, mate, and give birth upside-down in the trees. They hold onto tree          branches with strong, curved claws that are on each of their four feet
Sloths are herbivores. They eat leaves, tender young trees,          and fruit. But it's hard to find time to eat during the sloth's busy schedule          that includes sleeping about 15-18 hours each day.
The main difference between the two-toed and three-toed          sloths (besides the number of toes) is that the three-toed sloth is diurnal          and the two-toed sloth is nocturnal. Both of the animals are about 1.5          - 2 feet in length. Both species have a stumpy tail.
Everything a sloth does is slow. It chews slowly, blinks its eyes slowly,          and definitely moves slowly. Sloths have a low metabolic rate and a low          body temperature (91Â°F). This allows them to eat very slowly (and          only need a little bit of food), and they don't require much water, because          they don't expend much energy. It takes nearly a week for a sloth to digest          one meal.
Sloths are related to anteaters, a group of mammals known as edentates.          Anteaters and other edentates don't have teeth. However, sloths have small          teeth which they use to chew up their leafy food.
