Animals have to eat their food in order to get energy to live.  Different animals eat different types of food.  An animalâ€™s mouth, teeth, and even body structure all help it to eat a certain type of food.  You can often figure out what types of food an animal eats by looking at its body and mouth.

Herbivores are animals that eat only plants and plant material.  Herbivores are usually smaller than carnivores.  Herbivores may eat leaves, berries, roots, or even  tree bark.  They usually need to eat often during the day in order to have enough energy.

Herbivores have teeth that are rather flat.  They need to chew a lot in order to break down plant materials into very small pieces.  Having flat teeth helps herbivores to chew easier.
