About Ants
Ants are insects of the family Formicidae and belong to the order Hymenoptera. They are thought to have evolved from wasp-like creatures sometime between 110 to 130 million years ago and then evolved after the rise of flowering plants. There are an estimated 22,000 different species, out of which only about 12,500 have actually been classified.
