[ edit ] Taxonomy and phylogeny
The giant anteater is classifed in the family Myrmecophagidae with the tamanduas .
The giant anteater was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name Myrmecophaga is Greek for "anteater" while its specific name tridactyla is Greek for "three fingers". [3] Zoologist Alfred Gardner has tentatively proposed three subspecies; M. t. tridactyla, M. t. centralis and M. t. artata. [4] The giant anteater is grouped with the semi- arboreal northern and southern tamandua in the family Myrmecophagidae which in turn is grouped with the family Cyclopedidae (whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater ) in the suborder Vermilingua .
Anteaters and sloths belong to the order Pilosa which is grouped with the order Cingulata ( armadillos ) in the superorder Xenarthra . The two orders split from each other 65 million years ago ( mya ) during the Late Cretaceous . Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene . The silky anteater emerged around 30 mya in the Oligocene while the giant anteater and the tamanduas split 10 mya in the Late Miocene . [5]
The fossil record for anteaters is generally sparse. [6] Some known fossil anteaters include the Pliocene genus Palaeomyrmidon which was closely related to the silky anteater, Protamandua of the Miocene which was the sister taxon to the clade that includes the giant anteater and the tamanduas, and Neotamandua which was a sister taxon to Myrmecophaga. [7] Proamandua was larger than the silky anteater but smaller than a tamandua. The feet do not appear to be specialized for terrestrial or arboreal locomotion but it may have had a prehensile tail. Neotamandua was larger than a tamandua and smaller than the giant anteater. Its tail was unlikely to have been prehensile, and its feet were intermediate in form between those of the tamanduas and the giant anteater. [6]
The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. It is likely that anteaters were originally adapted to arboreality [7] and the evolution of the giant anteater may have been aided by the expansion of open habitats like savanna in South America and the availability of colonial insects like termites. [6] Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene . [6]
[ edit ] Description
Mounted giant anteater skeleton
The giant anteater is recognized by its large size, elongated muzzle and long tail. [8] It has a total body length of 182–217 cm (5.97–7.12 ft) and weighs 33–41 kg (73–90 lb) for males and 27–39 kg (60–86 lb) for females. [3] This makes it the largest living anteater. It also has a mostly grayish coat color that is peppered with white. The robust forelimbs are white with black bands around the wrists. The hind limbs are dark colored. Thick black bands with white outlines stretch from the throat to the shoulders where they end in triangular points. [3] The tail is mostly brown. [8] The hairs that make up the coat are long, especially on the tail which looks larger than it actually is. The anteater has a stiff mane along the back and a small hump at the base of the neck. [3] Its tubular snout takes up most of its head. At the end of the snout are its tiny mouth opening and nostrils. Its eyes and ears are also relatively small. [3] Being over 30 cm (12 in) long, [9] the head of this species is particularly elongated, even when compared to other anteaters. [10]
Unlike other mammals, the necks of anteater species, especially this one, are thicker than the back of their heads. Despite its poor eyesight and hearing, [8] the anteater's sense of smell is 40 times greater than that of a human. [11] The giant anteater has a fairly low body temperature for a mammal, at 33 °C (91 °F) compared to 36–38 °C (97–100 °F) for the typical mammal. [11] This explains why the animal has such a dense coat despite living in a tropical climate. [3]
The giant anteater has broad ribs. Despite its specific name, it actually has five toes on each foot. With the front feet, three of the toes have extremely long claws while the other two are reduced in size. [3] These claws can reach 10 cm (3.9 in), [9] forcing the anteater to walk on its knuckles . [12] It shares this trait with the platypus and the African apes; gorillas and chimpanzees . The digits that support most of the weight are elongated at the metacarpophalangeal joints and bent at the interphalangeal joints . [12] The animal's tricep helps power the flexion of the digits with the long claws. [13] The hind feet have claws on all five toes. These claws are shorter, thus allowing the anteater to walk plantigrade . [3]
[ edit ] Feeding anatomy
Giant anteater with tongue projected
The anteater has no teeth and is capable of very limited jaw movement. Having underdeveloped masticatory muscles and lacking a digastric muscle , the anteater relies on the rotation of the two halves of its lower jaw, which are held together by a ligament at the tip, to open its mouth. [10] Jaw rotation also allows the animal’s slender tongue to protrude. The tongue is typically 60 cm (24 in) [3] and is triangular posteriorly, rounded anteriorly and ends in a small rounded tip. [10] It is covered in backward-curving papillae and coated in thick, sticky saliva secreted from the animal's enlarged salivary glands. [9] These properties allow the anteater to collect insects with its tongue.
The tube-like rostrum and the small mouth opening restrict the tongue to protrusion-retraction movements. [10] During feeding, the tongue can move in and out very rapidly at around 160 cycles per minute. The anteater relies on specially arranged muscles to make quick protrusions with the tongue. These muscles are located around the hyoid , which is long and flexible in this species. The animal relies on the orientation of the head to aim the tongue. [10] When fully extended, the tongue can reach the length of the skull. The buccinators allow the tongue to slide back in without losing attached food but tightens the mouth to prevent food from slipping out as the tongue protracts. When retracted, the tongue is held in the oropharynx by the hyoid muscles and the secondary palate and prevented from blocking the animal's respiration . The distance in which the tongue can retract is aided by the long sternoglossus muscle, which is formed from the fusion of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus and is unattached to the hyoid. [10] Thus, the tongue has a direct anchor to the sternum . [14]
When feeding, anteaters swallow at a much higher rate than most other mammals, doing so almost continuously. [10] Before being swallowed, the insects are crushed against the palate. [9] The anteater's stomach, similarly to a bird's gizzard , has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind the insects; a digestive process assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt. [15] In addition, the stomach also uses the acid content in the ants to digest them as it cannot produce acid on its own. [9]
[ edit ] Distribution and status
Giant anteater in the Pantanal region, Brazil
The giant anteater is native to Central and South America . Its known range stretches from Honduras to northern Argentina . Its fossil remains have been found as far north as northwestern Sonora , Mexico. [16] It is generally absent from the Andes and is extinct in Uruguay . [2] It may also be extinct in Belize , Costa Rica and Guatemala . [2] The species lives in a number of habitats, including both tropical rainforests and xeric shrublands , [8] as long as enough ants and termites are present to sustain it. [17] Anteaters are dependent on these social insects and cannot survive without them. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, due to the number of regional extirpations. As of 2010, the total population has declined by 30 percent over the past ten years. [2] In 1994, around 340 anteaters died due to wildfires at Emas National Park in Brazil . [18] The animal is particularly vulnerable to fires due to its slow movements and flammable coat. [3]
Human-induced threats to the anteater include collision with vehicles, attacks by domestic dogs and habitat destruction. Hunting is also a threat and the anteater is commonly hunted in Bolivia , both for sport and subsistence. The animal’s thick leathery hide is used to make equestrian equipment in the Chaco while in Venezuela they may be hunted for their foreclaws. [17] Anteaters may also are also killed for safety reasons as they have a reputation as a dangerous animal due to their defensive behavior. In reality, anteaters are typically placid and pose no threat to humans. [3] However, in April 2007, an anteater at the Florencio Varela Zoo near Buenos Aires , Argentina mauled a zookeeper, slashing her abdomen and legs with its sharp front claws. The zookeeper was admitted to the hospital in critical condition and died following leg amputation surgery. [19]
The giant anteater remains a widespread species and can adapt to numerous habitats. Some populations are stable and the animal can be found in various protected areas in the Amazon and the Cerrado . [17] CITES lists this species under Appendix II. It also receives protection from some Argentine provinces as a national heritage species. [2]
[ edit ] Behavior and life history
[ edit ] Social spacing
Anteater moving though vegatation
Giant anteaters live in home ranges which vary in size depending on the area. At Serra da Canastra National Park in Brazil, female anteaters have home ranges of around 3.67 km2 while males live in home ranges of 2.74 km2. [20] In other parts of Brazil, anteater may need at least 9 km2 and anteaters from Venezuela have been recorded living in home ranges as large as 25 km2. [20] The species mostly lives alone. Exceptions to this include females with dependent young and courtships between males and females mating season.
Females appear to be more tolerant of each other than males are. As such, there is more overlap in female home ranges and males are more likely to engage in agonistic behaviors . [20] Agonistic behavior can come in the form of slowing circles and chases or actual fighting. [11] Circling anteaters may emit a drawn out harrr sound. When in combat, they slash at each other with their claws and have been observed wrestling to the ground. [3] Anteaters communicate their presence, status or sexual condition with secretions from their anal glands. They also appear to be able to recognize each other's saliva by scent. [11]
[ edit ] Activies and movements
Anteater sleeping
The home range of an anteater can encompass several habitats. A 2007 study of anteaters at the Brazilian Pantanal found that the animals generally forage in open areas and rest in forested areas. Forests are warmer than grasslands on cold days and cooler on hot days. [21] Anteaters can be either diurnal or nocturnal . A 2006 study at the Pantanal found that the anteaters are usually nocturnal, being active during nighttime and early morning, before retiring to shelter as the ambient temperature raises. [22] On colder days, anteaters start and end their activities earlier. They are sometimes diurnal during winter. [22]
At Serra da Canastra, anteaters are typically diurnal. [20] Giant anteaters typically rest in dense brush but may also use tall grass on cooler days. They do not burrow but instead dig a shallow cavity for resting. [23] The animal sleeps curled up with its bushy tail folded over its body. The tail serves both to conserve body heat and as camouflage. [23] One anteater was recorded sleeping with its tail stretched out on a sunny morning with an ambient temperature of 17 °C (63 °F). This may have served to absorb more of the sun’s rays for warmth. [23] Giant anteaters are good swimmers; even swimming though wide rivers. [3] They have also been absorbed to bathe for unknown reasons. [24] This species also has some climbing abilities and have been recorded climbing both termite mounds and trees while foraging. One individual was even observed hanging on a branch vertically. [25]
[ edit ] Foraging and predation
The giant anteater is an insectivore ; feeding mostly on ants or termites , depending on which is available. In areas that experience seasonal flooding, like the grassy plains of the Venezuelan llanos ; anteaters mainly feed on ants as termites are less common. [11] Conversely, anteaters at Emas National Park eat mainly termites, which occur in high density on the grasslands. [26] At Serra da Canastra National Park, anteaters appear to switch between ants and termites seasonally, eating mainly ants during the wet season (October to March) and termites during the dry season (May to September). [11] Anteaters rely on scent to track down prey. [8] The animal uses its long foreclaws to dig up ant or termite nests and inserts its long, sticky tongue to collect individual insects. An anteater spends 40 seconds feeding at a nest. [3] It may visit up to 200 nests in one day and as many as 300,000 individual insects may be consumed. [15] The anteater is typically driven away by the chemical or biting attacks of the soldier caste. [8] Some species of termite rely on the durability of their mounds for protection and many individuals are able to escape while the anteater is busy digging. [26] Both types of defense ensure that an anteater does not deplete an entire colony. [11] [3]

Other insects consumed by anteaters include the larvae of beetles as well as western honey bees which have located their hives in termite mounds. Bee products have nutritional value and anteaters may actively select termite mounds with bee hives. [11] Captive anteaters have been fed mixtures made of milk, eggs, mealworms and ground beef. [3] An anteater may dig for water when the water table is lower than the ground surface. Waterholes dug by anteaters are used by other animals as well. [24] Giant anteaters may be preyed on by jaguars and pumas . They rely on their sharp foreclaws for defense; rearing up on their hind legs and slashing at the attacker if cornered. [3]
[ edit ] Reproduction
Giant anteaters mate from May to July. [3] During courtship, a male tends to an estrous female, following and sniffing her. During this time, male and female pairs have been observed feeding at the same ant nest. [20] Gestation usually lasts around 6 months with a single young being born. The young are born with eyes closed and begin to open them after 6 days. The mother carries its young on its back for up to a year. [3] The young’s black and white band aligns with that of its mother, which serves to camouflage it. The young communicate with their mothers with sharp whistles. The mother grooms their young during rest periods and a single grooming bout can last an hour. Grooming peaks during the first three months of the young’s life and declines as it reaches 9 months of age, ending by ten months. [3] When nursing, the young suckles with its tongue. It begins to eat solid food by three months and is fully weaned by ten months. The bond between mother and young starts to weaken by the eighth month and the young becomes independent by nine or ten months. [3] Anteaters are sexually mature around 2.5–4 years. They have been recorded living up to 16 years in captivity. [8]
[ edit ] In culture
The anteater is the UCI mascot.
In the mythology and folklore of the Amazon Basin , the giant anteater is depicted as a trickster foil to the jaguar . In one Shipib tale, the anteater challenged the jaguar to a breath holding contest underwater, which the jaguar accepted. After the two removed their pelt and submerged, the anteater jumped out of the water and stole the jaguar’s pelt, leaving the jaguar with the anteater’s pelt. [27] The anteater was considered a humorous figure due to its long snout. One Yarabara myth tells of how an evil ogre named Ucara was punished by the sun, who transformed him into an anteater. [27] The Kayapo people have masks of various animals and spirits, including those of the anteater, during naming and initiation ceremonies. It is believed that women who touched the anteater masks or men who stumbled while wearing them would receive death or mental illness. [28] During the Spanish colonization of the Americas , the giant anteater was one of many animals taken to Europe for display. At first, Europeans believed that all anteaters were female and mated with their noses, a misconception corrected by naturalist Félix de Azara . [29]
Salvador Dalí wrote that the giant anteater "reaches sizes bigger than the horse, possesses enormous ferocity, has exceptional muscle power, is a terrifying animal." [30] Dalí painted an anteater in the style of The Great Masturbator . It was used as a bookplate for André Breton , who compared the temptations a man experiences in life to "the tongue of the anteater must offer to the ant." [30] The 1940 Max Fleischer cartoon Ants in the Plants features a colony of ants fighting off a villainous anteater. Released during the Phoney War , the film may have referenced France’s Maginot Line . [31] An anteater is also a recurring character in the comic strip B.C. . This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the University of California, Irvine team mascot. [32] The Flash cartoon Happy Tree Friends features a nerdy blue-gray anteater named Sniffles . In the Stephen King mini-series Kingdom Hospital , the character Antubis appears in the form of an anteater. Unlike a real anteater, Antubis has razor sharp teeth. [33]
