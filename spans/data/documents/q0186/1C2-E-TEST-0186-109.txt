Great news everyone! A giant can of SPAM will be dancing around outside during the Meat Show on May 4th. The ingredients for the costume (gold foil, 10x2ft printed SPAM label, giant cardboard box) are ready to go. I’d hoped to have everything out of my living room and a picture of the completed piece by now but, since assembly requires a large amount of spray adhesive, we have to wait for the wind to die down outside before we can get it together. Or go to Erika’s studio and make it there. Either way there is going to be a dancing SPAM can at the show. That is what I want you to take away from this.
This is news, too: We got our house re-financed. I know that’s not a particularly difficult thing for most people to do but our bank, the Fuck Shit Piss Bank, likes to make things extremely difficult and expensive for people, even if you have stellar credit ratings and have paid off a third of your mortgage in 6 years. Thinking about the process kind of ticks me off  so, really long story short, we ended up going to a Credit Union and they refinanced us right away, like a normal lending institution would. Thanks Credit Union! So long, Stink Bank!
So, everything is moving right along and going swimmingly. As I was writing this post, the Fire Inspector popped into the store, which was a surprise. Fire inspectors are supposed to be a surprise (hence the term “surprise inspection”) but they’re not, really, because they always show up around Easter. I’m just surprised when anyone comes in here. I got a verbal pat on the head for having my gas tanks chained up and he did not cite me for anything. Yay!
Time is flying by and I have to go pick dandelions for the iguana’s supper. I’ll post more about meat when the art starts coming in.
