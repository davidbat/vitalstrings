Aardvarks live in Africa.  They are a large species of mammal.  They have large ears, strong claws and a pig-like snout.  Their large ears provide them with an excellent sense of hearing.  Aardvarks live in burrows underground during the day.  They emerge at night to feed.  They find termites and ants to eat using their sense of smell.  Aardvarks' large ears fold down when they go into their burrows.
