Ty Beanie Babies - Ants the Anteater
This is a funny story. My boy had a small anteater that he loved and took with him everywhere. On the way home one day he asked me to hold "antie". Since I had several things in my hands I somehow dropped it. He was devastated. I told him the people at his therapist's office (where I dropped it) were looking for it and would send it to us. Meanwhile I figured it was a goner so I ordered this one thinking I would replace the lost one without his knowing. Well what a surprise when I got it this one is much larger than the one we lost! What was I going to say that it grew up while it was lost???? But to my rescue, the next week when we went to our appointment, the original was returned to us by a miracle. Then I presented the new larger one as an additional surprise. Now "antie" has a big brother to keep an eye on him. Whew that was a close one.
