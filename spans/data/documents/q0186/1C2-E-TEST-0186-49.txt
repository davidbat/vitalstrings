JennOfTwoNs You clearly no nothing about marinading.

aningeniousname It don't matter how long you marinade them they are malarial.
Unless you are going to marinade them in some kind of quinine solution I would advise strongly against it.
Three nipples in has been known to be fatal.

JennOfTwoNs You're just trying to use the old "fatal nipples" ploy to get out of being dinner.
Bah! That trick is as old as a Warner Brothers anvil. Tell it to someone who isn't wise to your wily aardvarkian ways.

aningeniousname Well if you are prepared to take a chance and play Aardvark nipple roulette with your life that is up to you, but don't say I didn't warn you.
The World health organisation has classified my nipples alongside Malawi and the Mekong river delta region of southern Vietnam as the world's three  biggest malaria hotspots.
I have had all the celebrity UN ambassadors trampling all over my nipples and talking to people who live in the adjacent area about how dangerous a threat to life they really are.
But I said if you are willing to take a chance "Go ahead punk, pick a nipple"

JennOfTwoNs You might as well just hold up a sign that reads "Wabbit season." It smells of desperation.

Since I just got back from Paris, I think the solution is to bang it all to hell with a giant mallet to tenderize the meat and then serve it filleted, pan roasted, with a red wine reduction.  For sides, some nice potato puree and a green salad.

aningeniousname Everyone knows you can't actually BBQ an Aardvark because we are highly flammable due to the fact we share 69.2 per cent of our DNA with olives. Throwing an Aardvark onto an open flame could take your face off.
