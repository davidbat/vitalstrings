I eat grits nearly everyday
They haven't killed me yet!  LOL! ;)
Serioulsy, Put a corn kernnel near an ant bed and then come back in the morn to see if it is still there.  I'll bet it is.  A grit is a piece of a kernnel.  Why would an ant eat a piece of corn?  They eat meat and bugs.  How many corn fields have been ate up by ants?  None.  The ants take the grits below the bed and allow them to rot. They allow the grits to mold and feed the mold to the larve.  This myth was busted years ago, but lives on in the minds of many.  I wish it were true.  There would not be an ant in the Southern US of A!!!  :)
