The Bee is a remarkable animal - they do not have ears, but they have an excellent            sense of smell with chemoreceptors in their antennae. Bees see colours            differently than we do. They are insensitive to red but detects ultraviolet            light which is invisible to us.
Beetles
Found            in Tasmania, Bettongs weigh up to 2kg (4.4lb) and have a life expectancy of 3-5 years. Their            diet includes seeds, roots, bulbs and insects. Bettongs breed throughout            the year, with the young spending the first 3 months in the pouch.
Once              common Australia, the Bilby is now classified as              vulnerable. The only other species, the lesser bilby, is extinct.              Males are twice as large as females, growing to 55cm (21in) and weighing              up to 2.5kg (5.5lb). Their large ears help keep them cool.
Birds do not sleep in their nests. They occasionally nap in them,              but sleep in other places.

American              Bison
The Bobcat ,              although it does not bear the family name is a distinct species in              the Lynx genus. Adult bobcats weigh about 12kg. Kittens have a weight              gain of 25g per day and are weaned at about 12 weeks, becoming independent              of its mother at about 10-12 months of age.
Bongo
The              African, or Cape Buffalo is a member of the " Big              Five ", with the elephant, rhino, lion and leopard. Weighing 700kg              (1,500lb), they are unpredictable, and dangerous if cornered. They              have been known to ambush men and are often accused of deliberate              savagery, but are placid if left alone.
Most            abundant in Southern Africa, the Caracal is often referred to as the African Lynx or Desert Lynx, but is not            related to the lynx. It grows up to 1m (3ft) in length and the male            weighs up to 18 kg. It can survive for long periods without water, obtaining            its requirement from the metabolic moisture of its prey such as small            buck, sand rats and rock hyrax.
The            large, wild, elk-like Caribou ,            weighing up to 300kg (660lb), is found above the tree-line in arctic            North America and Greenland. Caribou, related to the reindeer, have            unique hairs which trap air providing them with excellent insulation.            These hairs also help keep them buoyant in the water.
Cats
The Cheetah is the fastest land animal at 95 km/h (60mph). Unlike other "big            cats" it does not roar - however it does purr and make high pitched            yelps, barks and chirruping sounds. They are found in Africa and in            some parts of Asia.
