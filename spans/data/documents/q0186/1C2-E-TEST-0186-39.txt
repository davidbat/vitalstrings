Giant Anteater is (6 ft) long including the tail; the Silky Anteater is about (14 in.) long; the Collared Anteater is about (4 ft) long;
They eat mainly termites, They get their food by opening nests with their claws, As the termites are swarming around it draws them into its mouth with its fast moving tongue covered with sticky saliva. They also have small spikes on their tongue that help keep the ants and other insects on the tongue while they get swept into the anteater’s mouth.  Kinda gross but amazing at the same time! Their tongue can be flicked up to 160 times or more per minute. A full-grown giant Anteater can eat around 30,000 ants and termites a day.
