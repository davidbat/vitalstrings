Description :
Giant anteaters are primarily          found in the savannahs and grasslands of Central and South America. These          animals are gray with distinctive black and white markings, and their          narrow bodies are about the size of a large dog. Anteaters are covered          in coarse hair, which helps to protect them from insect bites. Anteaters          lack teeth and their jaws can only open half an inch. Their chief distinguishing          characteristic is an extremely long, cylindrical snout, which the anteater          thrusts directly into ant and termite colonies when searching for food.
Anteaters are efficient eaters,          with long sticky tongues that can flick in and out of their mouths at          a rate of up to 160 times a minute. They can consume up to 30,000 insects          a day. Giant anteaters get most of the water they need from the insects          they consume. This species prefers large ants, such as carpenter ants,          which have neither heavy jaws nor chemical defenses. They will not eat          fire ants. In captivity, anteaters are fed a variety of foods, including          insects (waxworm larvae, mealworms, crickets, and termites), a high-protein          gruel mixture, and snacks such as avocados, mangos, oranges, and yogurt.
Giant anteaters prefer open,          grassy areas, with some trees. Although this species of anteater doesn't          climb trees, they reportedly can climb out of enclosures with ease. Anteaters          walk on the sides of their paws with the claws tucked inward in order          to keep the claws sharp.
Anteaters are not social          creatures. In the wild, they roam singly, except for mother-young pairs          and during the breeding season. A female giant anteater gives birth to          one baby each year. The mother carries her offspring on her back for up          to a year, even though a baby anteater is capable of a slow gallop one          month after birth.
Anteaters have an excellent          sense of smell, which they use to locate their prey. They also have good          hearing but terrible eyesight. They will sleep up to 15 hours a day. While          sleeping, they cover themselves with their long, fanlike tails. Depending          on the temperature and the humidity of the area, these animals may be          active both day and night.
The principal predators of          the anteater are members of the cat family, such as the puma and the jaguar,          but humans pose the greatest danger to this threatened creature, by the          systematic and ongoing destruction of its habitat.
