What do wolves eat
What do wolves eat?
Wolves are carnivores (meat eaters).  If food is scarce, wolves will eat  other foreign foods. Wolves' diet  ranges from big game to little game and some little critters.
When it is time to eat the food the alpha male and the alpha female would eat  first.  After the alpha male and alpha female eat, the remaining pack  members will dig in. Alpha male and female get the  most food.  The other wolves in the pack get less food.
Wolves eat there food very fast to avoid it from being stolen. That makes the  chances of losing their meal less. They eat the best parts of the carcass first, then  the wolves will come back later for the other parts. They will cache (hide) the food in the snow or the icy soil, which  will help preserve it.
Wolves can eat every five to six hours when there is plenty of food or they can live  on scraps for two weeks if there is less food.
Wolves eat several large animals such as moose, deer, elk, caribou, and musk  oxen. Wolves will also eat smaller animals such as beavers, rabbits, hares, voles,  fish, muskrats, lemmings, raccoons, shrews, woodchucks, shellfish, ground  squirrels, mice, and birds.
A male wolf eats about twenty pounds of food in every kill that equals eighty hamburger patties.
