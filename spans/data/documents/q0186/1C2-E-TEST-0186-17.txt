Basically, because there's a lot of them, and so they represent a pretty major food source in most environments.
Critters that eat mostly ants and termites are called myrmegophagous (which literally means "ant eating"), and they can be pretty successful.
There are myrmecophagous critters throughout the tropics.  In addition to the anteaters of South America, there is the aarvark and aardwolf of Africa, the pangolins of Africa and Asia, and the echidna and cute little numbat of Australia.
