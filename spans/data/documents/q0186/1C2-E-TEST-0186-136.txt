What does An Aardvark Look Like?
Glad you asked...
An aardvark looks like a pig with a long snout. They are sometimes referred to as anteaters, though technically, they aren't. These mammals have four legs, thick skin, and a long tail. Aardvarks can be found in Africa and love to burrow.  You can find more information here: http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/si...
