In a week the average African lion will eat about 15 to 28 kgs. While the range may seem wide, this is because a lion only eats  about every three to four days, meaning on average their “daily” intake of meat is about 5 to 7 kgs. A lion can eat up to 25% of their own body mass, but usually only kill and eat enough to sustain themselves. In a year the lion kills about 15 animals, the young lions kill more animals yearly however due to their killing weak animals just for the fun of killing.
