I currently take adderall and it makes me not hungry. I have been on it for a little over a year and now I am starting to feel hungry.  Does this mean I need to raise my dose? I feel like I cant focus as much and I am putting back the weight that I lost from adderall and I want to know if this is normal? Thanks!:)
As time passes the side effects tend to happen a lot less and your weight on meds also tend to swerve about, but if it’s not as effective as it was before then raising your dosage is probably an option? Another possibility is that you need to detox your body a bit. If you take some time to stay off your meds for say, maybe a week when you don’t need them, they could start working like how they did before once you start taking them again.
But no guarantees. I’d see your psych about it.
