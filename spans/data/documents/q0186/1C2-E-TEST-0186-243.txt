Lufthansa Miles And More
What does signing up for their credit card get me
For the purposes of comparison, where more than one card is offered I will select the one with the best benefits.
BA: 1000 miles with their standard American Express card, or 6000 miles with their American Express premium card, which has a £150 annual fee. Spend £10k/year and redeem your miles to get a free flight for your companion. This is not enough to even get you one return flight in economy, anywhere.
Virgin Atlantic: 3000 miles with standard American Express card or 6000 for their Amex premium card, which has a £115 annual fee. Spend £5k/year and receive a free premium economy upgrade on an economy booking. Sadly, this does not come close to being a substantial contribution towards a flight. The cheapest economy return is 40000 miles. Next!
BMI: 20000 miles on the standard Amex, or 24000 miles on their premium Amex, which has an £85 annual fee. This is equivalent to a pair of return economy flights anywhere in Europe.
Lufthansa: 5000 miles and no annual fee on their American Express. This is not enough to earn any flights.
Winner: BMI is easily the most generous, with the second-lowest annual credit card fee, and a pair of return economy flights just for opening an account.
What will I have to show for an annual spend of £5000
BA: 7500 miles. Not enough for even a single return flight in economy.
Virgin Atlantic: 10000 miles. Not enough for anything.
BMI: 10000 miles. Enough for one return flight to Europe zone 1.
Lufthansa: 7500 miles. Since airport taxes aren’t included in their scheme, and you can settle them for 15000 miles, this would only cover half of only your airport taxes.
Winner: BMI, again. Two years of average spending and you have a pair of flights.
How many return economy flights will I need to make to earn a pair  of economy returns to the same destination? (I’ll use Dubai for this  comparison where possible)
BA: A pair of economy returns would be 80000 miles. A pair of full price flights earns you 6800 miles. Therefore you’d need to make the journey 12 times, or spend £53333 on your credit card.
Virgin Atlantic: A pair of economy returns requires 80000 miles. A pair of full price flights earns 6800 miles. Therefore you’d need to make the journey 12 times or spend £40000 on your credit card.
BMI: A pair of economy returns would be 80000 miles. A pair of full price  flights earns you 6800 miles. Therefore you’d need to make the journey  12 times, or spend £40000 on your credit card.
Lufthansa: A pair of economy returns would be 80000 miles. A pair of full price  flights earns you 6800 miles. Therefore you’d need to make the journey  12 times, or spend £53333 on your credit card.
Winner: None. They’re all the same.
Overall winner: BMI
