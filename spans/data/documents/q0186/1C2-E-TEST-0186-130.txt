ANTEATING MAMMALS, MARSUPIALS AND MONOTREMES
There are quite a number of mammals that have adapted to eating ants or termites. I will look at each family separately and discuss the adaptations each has made for their special diet.
The order Xenarthra includes the anteaters, sloths and armadillos. (They were previously grouped in the order Edentata along with the pangolins and the aardvark, but since they are not related, they have now been placed in separate orders.) There are four species of anteaters in the family Myrmecophagidae, namely the Silky Anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), the Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), the Northern Tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) and the Southern Tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).(1)
The Silky Anteater is the smallest of all anteaters, only 360-450 millimeters long and weighing less that 500 grams. It lives in lowland rainforests of South America, almost exclusively in trees. Like all anteaters it has a tubular mouth, although not nearly as long as the others. It has a long sticky tongue, with many tiny hooks on and sticky saliva. It flicks its tongue in and out quickly eating mainly tree dwelling ants and termites that get “trapped” on its sticky tongue. They do not have teeth, but rather strong stomach muscles, that contract tightly to help digest its food. They also have two long claws on each front paw, which they use for climbing and defense and a long prehensile tail that aids them in climbing. (2)
The Giant Anteater is the largest of its kind. It inhabits many different habitats from grassland to rainforest in Central and South America. They can reach a length of over two meters and can weigh up to 60 kilograms. They have an exceptionally long nose and tubular mouth, with and even longer sticky tongue, which they use to extract termites out of their nests. They use their long sharp claws and strong forelimbs to break open termite mounds, to get to their food. They do not have any teeth, but again their stomach is adapted to digest its food through strong contractions, aided by little stones they occasionally take in. They also have unusual articulations in the vertebra of their lower back, which provide support when they use their forelegs for digging. They also use there strong claws for defense, by standing on their hind legs, using their tail as a counter-balance and slashing out, even killing predators this way. (3, 4)
The tamanduas are smaller and have an even larger range in habitat. They also climb trees and have a prehensile tail that aids them in climbing and acts as a counter-balance on the ground in much the same way as the Giant Anteater. Their nose is not as long as their giant cousins, but they too have the adapted sticky tongue, that they flick out eating mostly ants and termites. Sometimes they raid bees’ nests eating the larvae and honey. They too have long, strong claws and powerful forelimbs as well as the special joints in their backs that aid them when using their front legs for digging and breaking open termite mounds. (4)
The order Pholidota contains the pangolins or scaly anteaters. There are eight species between Africa and Asia. They all have large plate-like scales, which fit over each other like tiles on a roof. If threatened they roll themselves into a tight ball, their razor sharp scales acting as their defense. They too have a relative long sensitive nose and a very long sticky tongue. There forelimbs are powerful but their claws are so long that they have to walk on their hind legs, using their long tail to balance. But this frees them to use their strong forelimbs to dig and break open termite mounds, much in the same way the American anteaters to. They also hang from branches in trees and use their claws to break away the bark to get to ants nests. They are mainly nocturnal and use their acute sense of smell to find their prey. (5)
The aardvark is of the order Tubulidentata. As the order suggests they do have teeth, but these are unusual. The aardvark is only found in Africa. They are nocturnal, sleeping during the day in excavated termite mounds. They exclusively feed on ants and termites and again have a suitable long sticky tongue. Their head is elongated with a tubular mouth adapted for its habit of eating ants and termites. The nose is a round disk, hence the name aardvark. They have powerful front legs used for digging and a very keen sense of smell to find food. They do not have claws, but rather flattened shovel-like nails. (6)
The numbat ( Myrmecobius fasciatus ) is the only marsupial that almost exclusively feeds on termites. It does not have the powerful forelimbs and long claws of the other anteaters, but it does have a sticky tongue, a degenerate jaw with dysfunctional teeth, a pointed nose and an acute sense of smell. Because it cannot break open the termite mounds, it has to synchronize its feeding time with the activities of the termites. It is thus diurnal and uses its sense of smell to locate the termites’ underground galleries leading to their feeding grounds. These are shallow and the numbat is able to reach them easily, even without having long specialized claws. (7)
The echidnas fall in the order Monotremata. The Short-beaked Echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is an ant and termite eater and has all the adaptations for its specialized diet. A long snout and tubular mouth, toothless jaw, long sticky tongue and powerful limbs with long claws for digging. They have coarse hairs and spines and roll up into a spiny ball to protect themselves. (8)
