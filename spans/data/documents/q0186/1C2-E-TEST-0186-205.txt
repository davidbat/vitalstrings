If you are going to keep such a beautiful wild creature, no matter what its circumstances, PLEASE, feed it the right foods. You are doing it more harm than good.
Pua will never ever survive in the wild now thanks to you nor will she survive long feeding her chemical cheese, even as a treat.
Not sure how you came about owning her, but the living conditions are deplorable, unsafe, and nothing indicates anything of a natural environment for her. She probably survives off the cockroaches and termites your house must provide.
