Most ants eat a wide variety of foods, although some have specialized tastes. Fire ants feed on honeydew, sugars, proteins, oils, seeds, plants and insects. Pharaoh ants  feed on sugars, proteins, oils and insects. Crazy ants  like sugars, protein, and insects; carpenter ants prefer sugars and insects. Ants use scouts to locate food. When a scouting ant finds promising food, she carries it or a piece of it back to the nest. Some ants leave scent trails that others can follow to the food source. Ants require water and will travel some distance for it if necessary. Workers are able to bring water to the colony in their guts.
Despite their name and where they are found, Florida carpenter antsdo not eat wood (as is the case with termites) but excavate galleries in it to rear their young. They feed on honeydew from sucking insects and household food scraps and do not damage sound wood to any extent.
