Ant enemies
Ants  main enemy are humans. We destroy their      nests and habitat, and kill them with insecticides, and sometimes, in some      places, we even eat them. By the way, some people say that ants have a lot      of protein, so, just think it over.
There are also a few anteater animals, such as the tamandua from South America,      sometimes called 'anteater bear' (not a bear at all, but definitely an anteater      marsupial). There is also a very funny type of spider that has managed to      look like the ants, and so disguised, it manages to eat the silly ants that      fall for it.
