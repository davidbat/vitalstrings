The Silky Anteater or Pygmy Anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) is the smallest of the anteaters. Its total length is between 36 and 45 centimeters. Its other distinguishing features are its short snout, soft golden brown fur, prehensile tail and two very enlarged claws in each forepaw. It is nocturnal and arboreal, and feeds on large amounts of ant in the trees, between 100 and 8000 ants a day. If the Silky Anteater feels threatened, it stands in a defensive posture, standing on their hind legs, holding its forefeet close to its face so they can strike, with its sharp claws, any animal that tries to get closer to it.
