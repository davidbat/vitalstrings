The cat species purrs due to its unique ability to use its laryngeal muscles to pass air over it's voice box while both inhaling and exhaling. The opening and closing of the valve in the vocal chords produces this purr. A cat's purr is usually thought to represent happiness and contentment. However, some studies indicate a cat will purr when distressed.
Dogs don't have the same physiology, but can indicate their contentment with a rapidly wagging tail and a quick, "come play with me" bark.
