We all know cats purr when they are happy, but they have also been known to purr when injured or giving birth.  Some scientists believe that stressed cats purr to reassure or comfort themselves, kind of like having a mantra.  As for the how...I think that may still be under debate.

Originally no one could work out how the purr was achieved, but I then came across an article that said they had a loose area inside their throats a bit like a violin string/s that loosens more when they're relaxed and happy, and vibrates as they breathe.
Somehow with all the feline autopsies carried out, I find it strange they didn't find this out sooner. I think a few specialised books on cats now have similar explanations but I'd have to visit them again to check.
