Cats purr when happy or distressed. - Flickr User tambako
Cat purring is one of the many reasons to love felines; their purr seems to indicate that they're content, and this feeling is passed on to its human owners.
Domestic cats are known for their purr; the low rumbling noise can always be felt, even when it can’t be heard. Humans usually interpret cat purring to mean the pet is happy, but why do cats purr also when giving birth, dying, or enduring an injury? Many studies have been done, and there are a few accepted theories as to why and how cats purr.
How Cats Purr
The purr of a domestic cat is familiar, but Cheetahs, Wild Cats, Pumas and Bobcats purr, too. Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars do not purr.
How do cats purr? Most scientists agree that the purr is produced using both the larynx (voice box) and the diaphragm. Interestingly, the purr is produced during both exhales and inhales. Meowing only occurs during an exhale. The purr’s frequency is between 25 and 150 Hertz. The frequency may be the key to understanding why cats purr.
Why Cats Purr
Kittens begin purring when they are only a few days old. Animal behaviorists assume that the kittens are trying to signal to their mother that they’re present, and that they’re okay. Often, the mother cat will purr in return, reassuring the kittens, as well. When a cat purrs while a human is petting it, it may be communicating this same feeling of contentment and reassurance.
