Cats can purr when they're happy or nervous. Look at other examples of his body language. Are his ears relaxed, eyes closed? Laying down? If so, he's just happy to hang out with you, and is expressing it by purring!
However, if his eyes are dilated and he looks tense, chances are he's feeling nervous.
Hope that helps.
