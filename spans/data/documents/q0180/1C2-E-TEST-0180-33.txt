Why do cats purr?
Many of us associate a cat’s purr with them being happy and contented. However, studies show that this is not always the case. Some cats purr because they are experiencing traumatic moments and even life threatening ones. It has been said that cats make a purring sound even when they are dying. A cat’s purr can range from around 25 to 150 Hertz and according to science, sound frequency within this range can actually stimulate the growth of the bones as well as healing.
If you are a cat owner, you may have also noticed that your cat actually purrs when it is being stroked and petted when it is relaxed. As mentioned earlier, purring may also be evident in a sick, injured or dying cat as it serves as a signaling mechanism between mothers and kittens . Thus, it has been said that purring is used by cats to express a specific intent.
In another study, it has been found out that cats purr not only during threatening situations but also during times that there is food. However, it has also been found that this type of purring is of higher frequency thus it is different from the normal cat purr. It can be said that cats purr to attempt friendship, too.
An amazing fact about a cat’s purr is that many experts have become confused as to how it is done, as cats do not seem to have a part in their body that can produce this sound. It has been said though that a purr is produced when the vocal chords twitching the muscles around the larynx. When this happens, the glottis is dilated then constricted and air vibrations are produced when the cat inhales and exhales. The purring sound differs from cat to cat in terms of the loudness and the tone of the sound.
