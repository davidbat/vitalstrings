Campus Cats
After doing lots of research on the subject of feral cats lately, I've become more and more disappointed with Australia's efforts to solve the problem. Don't get me wrong, there are wonderful small non-profit groups out there conducting TNR programs and doing all they can to help, and my recent interview with Erica from CatRescue outlines this. But we still need to do so much more to make an impact. And I'm not the type of person to sit back and say "why isn't anyone doing anything?" if I'm not doing anything myself, so stay tuned on my very exciting upcoming project that will assist not only homeless cats, but street cats too.
Today's post isn't about what I'm doing however, its about what the University of New South Wales, located in Sydney, is doing. Campus Cats Coalition  is a group of volunteers, dedicated to improving the lives of the feral cats that live on the grounds of UNSW.

The volunteers consist of students, staff and community members, and together they spay/neuter the cats, where possible find them a loving home, or return them to the uni grounds. When they are returned they are cared for and fed for the rest of their lives.

This is such a wonderful example of a successful Australian TNR program. Countless studies have shown that traping/spay-neutering/releasing is the single most effective and successful method of stabilizing, maintaining and eventually reducing healthy feral cat colonies.

The UNSW's goal is to promote community awareness of the responsible care and treatment of animals and they enforce my belief that "all life should be valued and treated with dignity and respect".
