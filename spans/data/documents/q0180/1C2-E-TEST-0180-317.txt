Why do cats' eyes glow?
The Answer:
Cats , dogs, and         many nocturnal creatures appear to have glowing eyes because the back of their         eyeballs include a special reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum. This helps animals (cats in this         case) see better in low light by working like a mirror on the retina         to reflect the light back through the eyes, giving them a second         chance to absorb the light. The colors seem more visible at night         because the pupils are dilated wider than during the day, allowing         more of the tapetum lucidum to be visible.
Humans don't have this layer. That partially explains why when         you get your developed photographs back the subjects have red spots in         their eyes. This is caused by the light from the flash traveling         through the pupil and illuminating the blood-cell rich retina at the         back of our eyes.
The secret behind so-called "red-eye-reducing cameras" is that         they use two quick flashes instead of one. The theory being that the         first flash will cause the subject's pupils to restrict and let in         less light, while the second will be used for the actual         picture.
