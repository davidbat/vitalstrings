The reason why cats purr is unknown, although the pleasant noise is associated      with pleasure and comfort. However, the question "Why do cats purr?" is      really not such a simple one, since they also purr when they are sick or      afraid. In these cases, cats purr to comfort themselves, as Elizabeth von      Muggenthaler has described purring as "a natural healing mechanism".      Perhaps more studies will show that endorphins or other hormones are releasd      in the cats body as the result of purring. If so, when we ask "Why      do cats purr" we are observing a phenomenon in which the cat is trying      to affect a cure for itself rather than simply responding to stimuli.
Another answer to the question "Why do cats purr" is that purring      is an appeasement gesture. When animals do not want other animals or humans      to hurt them in self-defence and want to show the potential predator that      it is harmless and not worth attacking, the animal will show some kind of      appeasement gesture. Among dogs, this takes the form of submissive movements,      such as bowing the head. Cats purr to show the observer that the cat is      really kittenlike and will not bite them (although it is not unheard of      for cats to attack after they finish a round of purring.)
In addition to the question of why cats purr is the question of how they      purr. The sound is created by the movement of air spasm through the diaphragm.      Kittens first purr when they nurse milk from their mother, and this is      one of the reasons purring is associated with comfort and security. Older      cats purr to recreate this warm and secure feeling.
