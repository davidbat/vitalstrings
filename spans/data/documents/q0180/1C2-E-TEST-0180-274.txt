Cat's                    Purr CD:
An Exceptional Natural Health Tool
By                    Ben Kim, D.C.

Back in                    1999, a chiropractor friend sent me an article that described                    the healing properties of a cats purr. Although it perked                    my interest, I wasnt compelled to do any further research                    at the time, probably because I didnt have any friends                    or family members who had cats, and my life circumstances were                    such that it was impractical to have one myself.
I had forgotten                    about my friends article until about a month ago when                    I began to listen to a CD called Cats Purr, made                    by Chet Day. After listening to a 30 minute track of Cats                    Purr, I was so impressed with how it made me feel that I                    have since made it a regular part of my daily routine.
For years,                    many veterinarians have observed that cats tend to heal much                    quicker than dogs and other animals following surgery. Scientists                    attribute this unusual healing capacity to purring. A cats                    purr produces a wide range of sound frequencies, some of which                    can stimulate growth and repair of bones and muscles, and others                    which can provide a pain-relieving effect.
In the Cats Purr CD, Chet has used advanced audio technology                    to layer together the healing sounds of his own cats purr                    with soothing classical music. He has also blended in sounds                    from nature that are so real and relaxing, listening to it reminds                    me of how I used to feel when I would regularly pray and meditate                    on the shores of the San Francisco bay.
I am super                    grateful to Chet for spending the years and thousands of dollars                    that he did to create this exceptional health tool. If youre                    looking for an effective way to manage stress, feel more peace                    of mind, and experience better quality sleep, I highly recommend                    that you give Cats Purr a try. Not only do I use                    it when I pray or meditate, I also like to listen to Cats                    Purr while I work on the computer, as I have found that                    it helps me feel more clear-minded and focused.
If you                    have been reading my natural health articles, you know how important I believe emotional balance and peace of mind are to your health.                    While there are many ways to work on improving your emotional                    health, there are few concrete tools that I have found to be                    truly effective. This is why I am very glad to have discovered                    this unique health tool and to recommend it to anyone seeking                    to experience better health.
Cat's              Purr owner              Rikki L. writes...
I                  LOVE the cat's purr CD. The first time I played it, I used headphones                  on a Sunday afternoon when I needed to take a nap; I heard probably                  about 3/4 of it and then fell into a very deep sleep for a couple                  of hours.
After                    that, I started using it every night for about 3 weeks now and                    it soooo works. I don't even use the headphones and most times                    I am asleep within 5 minutes -- tossing and turning in the middle                    of the night is a thing of the past, completely gone.
Even                    if I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom,                    (which I used to dread because 50% of the time it would mean                    my mind would just take on a life of its own with random thoughts                    that would keep me awake for hours!) I am able to fall back                    to sleep immediately. Love it! Love it! Love it! I think my                    dog does too.*

You'll              love the Cat's Purr experience if...
You'd                like to experience peace of mind that's next to impossible to find in our hectic world...
You'd                like to improve the quality of your sleep at night while probably reducing the number of hours you need to                spend in bed...
You'd                like a tool you can use any time to turn stress into a                state of relaxation that's the next best thing to deep sleep...
You'd                like to expand your creativity to the point where you have more ideas for projects than you have                time to do them...
You'd                like to experience a peaceful meditation...
Then Cat's Purr is for you.
In              the Beginning...
You              might be wondering how I came to create this powerful CD.
Well,              I've been a student of guided imagery and the science and practice              of meditation since 1980. Since July of 2001 I've been deepening my              knowledge of binaural beat sound technology.
I've              spent literally thousands of dollars on sound wave and music technology              and have been making CDs for my family and myself for years now.
CDs              that just kept getting better and better.
Cat's Purr is the culmination of my studies and my creations in sound technology              and it costs less than a dinner and a movie for two.
The              First of Four Audio Layers Features Delightful Cat Purring
On              this CD, I've included sixty minutes of joyful purring from our cat,              Lucy. Of the more than 50 stray felines my wife Ellen and I have cared              for during our 32-year marriage, Lucy has the strongest purring engine              we've ever heard.
Seriously,              when you hear Lucy's purr on this CD, you'll almost believe she's              lying on your chest, a furry bundle of contentment and happiness who              wants to share her good vibes with you.
Layer              Two Offers Haunting Classical Music that Reduces Stress to Practically              Zero
In                addition to Lucy's purr, I've embedded on this CD a specially-licensed                rendition of Erik Satie's enchanting Gymnopédie No.                1.
Played                by classical pianist Robin Alciatore, this haunting interpretation                of Satie's solo piece for piano will stay with you long after you                remove the headphones.
Those                familiar with Satie's work know that Gymnopédie No.                1 is one of the world's most relaxing and stress-reducing                pieces ever written for piano... or any other musical instrument,                for that matter.
Layer              Three Features Compelling Natural Sounds
The              third layer on Cat's Purr features              several sounds from nature -- the cleansing downpour of a summer rain,              thunder and lightning, and a warm crackling fireplace. Thanks to NeuroImagery technology, these sounds are so sharply rendered you'll swear you're              experiencing them in reality rather than on a recording.
Layer              Four Brings on the Binaural Beats
The fourth                and final layer on Cat's Purr features an inaudible                but highly functional binaural beat track that will gently help                your brain generate soothing theta waves and attain a mental state                where you'll experience self-healing, deep relaxation, enhanced                creativity, and a wonderfully pleasant feeling of overall well-being.
All              four of these layers weave
together into a harmony where the
result is much greater than the sum of the parts.
Note                  from Chet: I devoted over two years of study and developmental                  research as well as thousands of dollars in audio equipment and                  licensing fees to produce this CD, but, frankly, the time and                  expense has been well worth it to me now that this first CD project                  is finally done.
From all                    the user feedback received to date, I know Ive created                    something very special with Cats Purr:                    an audio experience that'll help you reach levels of relaxation                    and bodily well-being you never before dreamed possible.
Cat's                    Purr listeners think this CD is special... *
Got                    my Cat's Purr CD today. It is wonderful. It is worth every penny that is charged for it. I love it/you. Thank you so                    much for putting all the work, money & effort into this.                    This is just what I have been looking for.
I love                    the music in it. This CD is fantastic! Some other relaxation/stress                    reducing tapes depress me. They have flutes & stuff in them & seem soooo mournful.
I just                    purely enjoy listening to your CD. It really is absolutely fabulous.                    Pure enjoyment.

Chet,                    as you might (or might not) recall I have mentioned several                    times that I just "can't" listen to meditation tapes.                    I get antsy or can't find the time. Well, I LOVE the cat's purr!                    I look forward to putting in my ear phones. I listen right before                    I go to sleep and I will be working my way up to finding "awake" time to listen. The kitty, the rain and the piano are wonderful.                    You did good.
Hugs,                    Bev S.
Thank you                    so much for the Cat's Purr CD.  I just love it - what a                    wonderful cat!  I've slept so well the last 2 nights, way                    better than I have for months.  What will it do after months?

Chet,                    my copy has already arrived and it is truly awesome,                    I have used it at night but also it plays in my room while I                    work and read. Once again, I have the pleasure of enjoying and                    growing from your many hours of research and hard work. Thank                    you so much.

Dear Chet:
I just                    wanted to testify to the awesome power of Cat's Purr.                    I was put through the ringer last year with tons of stressful                    events (stolen vehicle, hospital visits, bad job, etc.) and                    have been anxiety-ridden for quite some time. My family gently                    asked me to try medication again (tried in the past and had                    too many side effects to mention), but I refused.
Enter Cat's Purr.
I have                    been listening to it every night right before I go to bed and                    I cannot tell you how relaxed it makes me feel! While I am listening,                    I say positive affirmations in my mind. Before I know it, the                    hour is up and I am ready for bed. I                    sleep so soundly and wake up the next morning refreshed and                    ready to go.
I have                    definitely noticed a dramatic decrease in anxiety and I am better                    able to cope. Thank you for creating this wonderful CD!
I think                    more people need to be made aware of Cat's Purr because the only side effects are good ones - feeling great,                    greatly reduced anxiety and sound sleep!
I forgot                    to mention earlier that I am also feeling                    more confident in myself and my self-esteem is improving.                    For someone who has spent the past 10 years feeling down about                    herself, that is truly a miracle.
Thank you                    again, Chet. You truly have created a winner here!
--                    Carol Major
Dear                    Chet,
Just                    wanted to drop you a line thanking you for cat's purr. This                    CD is great and works great too. I'm going through some "stuff" right now and this is just what I needed. I grew up with cats                    but nowadays try to get a place to live that allows pets. I                    miss them and found the CD very comforting. Great healing effects.                    Very relaxing. Thanks again. Love your site and recipes too                    by the way.
--                    Sheila H.
I                    did listen last night and slept like a baby (in fact I fell                    asleep with the headphones on and didn't take them off for a                    couple hours afterwards when I finally realized they were still                    on my head!) I'm curious to see what the long-term effects are.

The Cat's Purr Experience
Imagine... you're            lying on a comfortable couch in a cabin in the woods.
A                cat rests on your chest, purring softly, joining you in an afternoon                nap during a rain storm.
You                hear the purring and the rain on the roof, and then someone adds                a log to the fire and the sound of crackling and popping embers                fills the air.
The                storm intensifies outside.
You                hear thunder approaching.
Lightning                strikes nearby and the air literally shimmers with healing ozone                and powerful energy.
While              you're listening to all of the above and your body is enjoying a state              of profoundly healing relaxation, you will also experience on a deeper              level...
an                opening and expansion of your creative self
deep                peace and a quiet stillness that will astonish you
How              Much is One Full Hour
of Rejuvenating Pleasure
This              remarkable CD features two tracks, each of which runs for 30 minutes.
The                first track, entitled Fireside, offers up a NeuroImagery audio experience that blends
our cat Lucy's powerful and comforting purr
classical                    music
sounds                    from nature
binaural                    beat technology
The                second track, entitled Catnapping, features a half                hour of gentle rain, cat purring, and continued binaural beat encouragement                of theta brainwaves. This track is best listened to after the first                track
Another              Satisfied Cat's Purr Listener...
Chet, for                    the past few months my husband has had trouble sleeping. About                    the 3rd night after your CD came he was awakened by a late night                    phone call. I had not told him about the CD prior because he                    thinks I'm a little weird. I am a massage therapist and do several                    kinds of energy work which he is unable, unwilling to comprehend.                    Therefore he puts all the things that I experiment with in the                    same category.
Anyway,                    after about 20 minutes of his tossing and turning I said I have                    a CD in the player that I think will help you to sleep...want                    to try?
He was                    a little skeptical and laughed when I told him it was a cat                    purring. He stopped tossing and turning within 5 minutes. The                    next morning when I asked him how he slept, he said, "I                    slept like a log, I don't think I moved all night. I have not                    slept that soundly ever."
It was                    the deepest sleep that he thought he had ever had. So now he                    is a regular user. And it has worked this well without using                    earphones.

And              One More...
I thought                    I'd drop you a note about a nice experience I had with my new Cat's Purr CD. I had some sort of 24-hour bug                    last weekend. By Monday I was over the worst of it, and really                    needed to get some rest. I just couldn't seem to settle down,                    though, since I was still feeling so headachy, sore and uncomfortable.                    You get the picture.
I remembered                    my new CD and popped on my headphones to listen. Somewhere in                    the second track I just dozed off and finally got some much                    needed rest. I felt much restored when I woke up a couple of                    hours later... thanks!
--                    Joan H.
P.S. That                    cat of yours sure has some loud purr!
 
And              One More...
Thank you                    for your quick shipping of the Cat's Purr CD.                    I am so thankful that I ordered it and that you spent the time                    creating it (and that you offered it at a reasonable price).
Last night                    was the first good night of sleep I've had in over a week. I                    had a biopsy done on Monday and have been on pins and needles                    waiting for the results. I have not been sleeping well.
I put the                    CD on last night and fell asleep quickly and had a good nights                    sleep. My dogs woke me up around 3 am for a bathroom break.                    During this past week I would stay awake worrying about the                    'what ifs' that are facing me. But, even without the CD on,                    I fell back asleep and woke up naturally at 5 am.
I'm going                    to tell others about your CD and probably will be back to buy                    more.

Here's              a review of Cat's Purr from a best-selling natural health journalist...
Author              of the best-selling Health on the Edge: Visionary Views of Healing              in the New Millennium, Larry Trivieri writes:
Chet                    has spent a number of years researching the benefits of guided                    imagery, mind/body medicine, and sound technology to improve                    health. All of this led to the creation of his Cat's Purr CD,                    which features the sounds of his purring cat overlaid with classical                    music, the healing sounds of nature, and binaural beat technology.
I've                    been experimenting with the CD for a number of weeks, listening                    to it with headphones, and the results are consistently relaxing.
I                    often find myself also flooded with waves of creative insight.
I                    commend Chet for this product and am happy to recommend it.                    (Note: I derive no financial benefits for doing so.)

P.S. I've had                a few people write and object to the price of Cat's Purr.                My response to them is simple -- if a good night's sleep and improved                peace of mind isn't worth $25 to you, then you probably don't need Cat's Purr anyway!
