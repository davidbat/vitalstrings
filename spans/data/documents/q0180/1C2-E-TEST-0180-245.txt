My Kitten Will Not Purr. She Is Over 12 Weeks Old And I Just Gave Her Mom Away. Is It Normal For Her Not To Purr?

Cats purr for a variety of reasons--fear, excitement, and happiness to name a few.  Some cats purr all the time while others seldom purr.  It varies widely for each individual cat.  If your cat is eating, drinking, has a normal energy level, is not sneezing, coughing, and does not have nasal discharge I would not worry.
The next time your kitten sees the veterinarian for the final kitten vaccine let them know your concern.  They will do a full exam to assess health.
