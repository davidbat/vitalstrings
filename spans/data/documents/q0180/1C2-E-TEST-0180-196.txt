I have two who will awaken you with purrs (they are very loud-Snarf & Sidney) and then there is Munchkin he tries to purr but cant.  It comes out more like a shallow weeze.  He had to get breathing treatments as a small kitten and since then, to this day, he cannot purrr like the other cats.  We know what his "attempted purr" sounds like, and we think its special.
I agree with many others who have already posted about this, but I find the purr very interesting and I dont know if anyone really knows WHY or HOW a cat purrs...But I will take it as a sign of affection or their way to show me a smile.
