Cats have something called a hyoid bone in their throat, which they vibrate to produce that purr. Your large cats, like lions and tigers, don't have it, so they don't; however they do roar, which small cats cannot do. (Would you really like to have your housecat going around roaring? Siamese cats are bad enough.) They do it when they are happy, but they also do it because it makes them feel better, so if they're under stress, or in pain, they will purr then, too. It must be nice to have a built-in feel-good device that never runs out, that nobody can pass a law against.
