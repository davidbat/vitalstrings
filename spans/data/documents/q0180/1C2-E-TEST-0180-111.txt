The reason cats purr and how they purr is one of life's great mysteries.
I've seen several documentaries, read studies and talked to my Vet about it and they all say the same thing.
People can GUESS as to why and how a cat purrs, but NOBODY can give a definitive answer.
A cat will purr when it's happy, BUT a very sick or dying cat will also purr to comfort itself.
The purring even when sick or dying comes from long before they were our house pets.
When they were in the wild they didn't dare show that they were ill, because they'd become the prey instead of the predator, that instinct is still in our little house cats today.
Edited to add: I'm not in any way saying that your kitten is sick, I'm just saying that there are many different reasons why a cat purrs.
