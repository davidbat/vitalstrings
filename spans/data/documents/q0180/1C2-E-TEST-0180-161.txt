Hi Sarah!
What is the prettiest thing about our friends, the kitties? their purring! Purring is  a sound that is made only by the domesticated cat, so the ferals do not purr... even they could  physiologically do it because purring corresponds to vibrations of the muscles of the larynx and diaphragm. They say also that the Big Cats can also purr, but the zoologists still discuss the reasons, or psychologic reasons that make a cat to purr. Usually, and any cat-lover knows that a cat will purr when it is satisfied, and very happy. So the purring will show reassurance, lack of hostility and submission. A cat, any cat, must learn how to purr and this usually happen while they nurse and the mother purrs back. But some ones never develop this behaviour even when they are well cared and loved by humans.
Thanks for asking NEWTON! Tell your friends about us!

Recent studies suggest that cats will purr for a number of reasons.  Dr. Rodrigues is absolutely correct in her answer.  In addition, it seems that cats will also purr when under stress or even under pain.  However, the  purr is mostly likely a product of that discussed above.
