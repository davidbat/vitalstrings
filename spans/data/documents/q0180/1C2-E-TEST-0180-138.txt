Isn't it weird that people still argue about how cats purr?!
Yes it is in a way. Cats have been around humans since Egypt times but it seems there are still so many mysteries about them.

it is absilutely true that they purr when not feeling very good. i remember my cat purring when we were visiting a vet and some injections had to me made. apparently that was because of a stress.

Hey Everyone,
I have read most of the posts here about purring, and I cannot say I've had the same experiences with my cat.
My cat has been once very sick, eventually having to spend five days in the vet when my home efforts instructed by the vet failed. She was one sick baby. She had Hepatic Lypidosis (for those who know what that is). She was feeling very very badly. She NEVER ONCE purred during these times. I remember her trying to purr when I pet her while she was corning herself in the kitchen corner to isolate.
Then while in the hospital on day three, I managed to talk her into hobbling onto my lap from the second floor vet cage (I was sitting on a high stool). When I started petting her she started to purr.
My little sweetheart doesn't purr when she's not feeling well. She purrs when she is filled with love and when she feels safe.
