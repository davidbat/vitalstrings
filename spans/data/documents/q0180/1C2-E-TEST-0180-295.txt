"Thank you so much for developing such a wonderful product! When we moved to our new home, four of our cats started to spray in the house. They now enjoy their own 'kitty cottage' and wonderful fenced in area outside. We love the fence as it blends into the landscape. We are happy and our cats are happy! Life is good!"
