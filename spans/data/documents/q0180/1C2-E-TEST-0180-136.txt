Maybe he is just one of the quiet purring cats. I have 4 of them, their "motors" as I like to call them, range from very quiet, barely audible, to very loud and can be heard across the room. It could also be the breed of the cat itself, some are louder than others, like the Maine coon for instance, rather loud motors.
Next time your cat is affectionate with you, turn down any appliances that might be making noise, and continue to keep the cat happy, and then listen very close to his head and neck area. I'm sure your kitty does purr, just happens to be one of the quieter breeds. Hope this helps.

My cat is half ferile and does not purr but he meows, i have seen a programme on the telly that says this is common only with half ferile half domestic cats, and has something to do with their hiding from predators in the wild, therefore they make very little noise. No-one really knows why this occurs.
