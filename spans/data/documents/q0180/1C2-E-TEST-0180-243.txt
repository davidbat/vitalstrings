Hi Tyler,
Cats meow when they need attention. Nope, nope,.... I mean when they DEMAND  attention!  Have you noticed that they don't always need it, but ask for it  anyway?
Purring is most important in communication between a mother and her  kittens.  It is a sound that does not carry too far and therefore does not  alert other animals that may be a threat to the kittens. Kittens are able  to purr and take milk from their mother at the same time, which  communicates to the mother that everything is OK.  The mother also purrs to  send the same message to her young while they are feeding.
Purring may also be used to communicate peaceful intentions and  satisfaction with the present company. If a cat purrs in your presence,  then it is saying that it is comfortable to be with you.  Purring is also  used in a variety of other situations, sometimes even in its moment of  death.
If you would like to know more about cat communication then I would highly  recommend Catwatching by Desmond Morris.  Your public library  ought to be able to get hold of a copy.  The book answers many frequently  asked questions about a cat's behaviour. Although the book was not written  specifically for your age, it has been written to appeal to as many people  as possible and I think you will be able to make use of it.
