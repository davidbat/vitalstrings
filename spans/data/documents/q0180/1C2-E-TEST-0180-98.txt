Dear  :
Cause they're funny wittle cuties. Yes they are. Yes they are!
Actually, no one knows why they purr, except, presumably, the cats themselves. In fact, no one really seems to know how they purr either. You might assume that it's some kind of vibration in the larynx, as one science columnist suggests.
However, others, such as biologist Kelleen Flanagan of the MAD Scientist Network , subscribe to the notion that the sound is created by the vibration of blood vessels.
But regardless of the method, the question remains: What causes cats to purr, whether voluntarily or involuntarily? At this point, theories are all we've got to go on. Carol Merkle, in a paper titled "Behavior and Language of Cat" , offers some possibilities that she culled from print and online research. These include the oft-cited happiness as well as pain, fear and the more subtle "waiting for happiness."
