My Carly didn't purr for the longest time...not for Years. But in her old age, she sometimes will now purr...and it's not very loud, but it happens.
One time, though, she started purring loudly, and it was as though she couldn't stop:  she even drooled a bit, and I had to wipe it up.  Then I began laughing a little and she gave me this look, and jumped down from my lap, in high dungeon. That made me laugh harder, (don't even think she didn't know she was being laughed at...) and and so she did her absolutely Worst & Mad behaviour:  she turned her back on me and sat on the carpet right in front me in her 'hunching' mode!
She thinks this is doing just something terrible, I guess.  Anyway, it's her most vengeful behaviour. (Isn't she a sweet softy?)
