Why do cats knead?
/_res/mp3/cat_behavior_kneading_cats.mp3
When kitty begins working those paws like she’s stomping grapes with Lucy and Ethel, you might wonder where this deep-seated need to knead comes from.
One reason for the behavior stems from kitten-hood - kneading mama’s teats stimulated milk to flow freely. Since kneading as a kitten was followed by a reward, your adult cat naturally continues this behavior in the hope of more good things to come.
Another reason for kneading in cats is territorial marking. Your cat uses scent glands in the pads of her feet to mark the boundaries of her territory. So as your cat kneads, she is leaving a personal eau de feline all over you and your living room furniture.
