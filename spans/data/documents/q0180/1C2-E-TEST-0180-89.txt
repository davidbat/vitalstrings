10. Why do cats scratch stuff?
#1 - Why Do Cats Purr?
It is understood that cats purr when they are happy and contended. But there are also other reasons such as:
- During tense moments or when they are scared, hurt and even near the death. Scientific research suggests that purring releases endorphins, which are natural analgesics that reduce pain during the healing process.
- Purring often occurs during nursing. The mother often purrs, reassuring the kitten using this tactile, resonant communication. They communicate through the vibrations of purring. A popular theory is that a purring mother can communicate with newborn kittens that are deaf or blind. Kittens learn to purr soon after birth and so their mother can feel them against her body without having to move around looking for them.
Veterinary Perspective - When a cat is purring, it is almost impossible to hear the cat's heart or lungs very well, making examination of vital signs difficult. Cats generally stop purring if they're near the sound of running water. This is why, vets turn on the faucet in the exam room in an attempt to get the cat to stop purring.
