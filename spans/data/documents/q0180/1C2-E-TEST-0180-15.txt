I’m sorry, but this is bull crap… and wrong.
It have been a scientific mystery for ages how cats purr. No one really knows how, but we do know that house cats and lions purr differently. Lions only purr when the breathe out, not in (or the other way around, but not both in and out like small cats do), so it doesn’t really relate to the heart. However, its not a mystery WHY they do it, but it doesn’t have anything to do with its heart beat and the fact that you are near it to “attack” (That is just stupid. If a cat thought that you might attack, what good with purring do? If it suspect you have bad intentions, it will obviously run off or attack you first).
Cats purr to calm themselves for whatever reason. Either they are calm because they are relaxed, or they calm them selves actually to de-stress (opposite to a faster heart beat), and you will actually find injured cats purring, not because they are happy, but because they try to calm themselves.
