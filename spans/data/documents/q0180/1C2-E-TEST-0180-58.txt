Why do Cats Purr?

Most of us human folk associate the sound of a noisy, rumbling purr with a contented kitty. But there may be other reasons your cat revs like an engine. And some may surprise you. Here's what I found out, courtesy of an article by Franny Syufy (prominent cat writer extraordinaire), and a little help from Scientific American.
Cats purr, of course, when they're getting love and attention. But surprisingly, they also purr when they're under extreme duress. If your cat has been (heaven forbid) suddenly hurt or injured, it's wouldn't be uncommon for her to start rumbling.
Why? According to studies, the measurable Hertz of a cat's purr is somewhere between 25 and 150. And it's actually been found that sound frequency within this range can stimulate bone growth - and even healing. Many scientists believe this is a cat's way to sooth herself and kick start that healing process. Others believe that a cat's purring helps her release natural endorphins, which can help reduce pain.
Purring is instinctive in cats. In fact, mother cats purr when they give birth, and their kittens purr right back. And cats will often start rumbling when they're relaxing or about to go to sleep. Syufy surmises that it's something of an "ohm" for cats - a mantra they use to meditate and relax.
Regardless of the reason, it's undoubted that a cat's purr is something special - just like those furry felines that we call pets.
