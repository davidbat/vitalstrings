I can purr sometimes, but only on the exhale, like you said. Sounds gross but helps to let a little saliva fall into the back of your throat without actually swallowing it. XD I can’t purr with a dry throat. I’ve tried purring for my kitteh, but he seems to be unimpressed.
So many gorgeous kittehs in this video, I wish I could love on them but I know I’d just end up as a kitteh treat.
