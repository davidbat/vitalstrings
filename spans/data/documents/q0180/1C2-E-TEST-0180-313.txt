Listen while you read!
(Yo! This is T. Mills and Jeffree Star BITCH!)*
She had real nice style, and wings on her back, wings on her back, wi-wings on her back
She had swag like mine, and ones in her crack, ones in her crack, one-ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass, so I hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit-hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat
I had my first stripper at the age of 16
Had me feelin' like the club was the place to be
I swear I couldn't wait till she got off the clock
So, we could go back to her spot and she'd hop on top
She would dance to rap, but listen to rock
We'd be fuckin' to Kiss
And then I'd switch it to Pac.
She would drive me around and pay for my shit
And I never got jealous of the dudes that she hit
I got private dancers in the VIP, champange rumor, co-workers were mean
Took me in through the back so I chilled till 3â€²
And when the club closed, back to her W-Suite. HA
And I thought she was so right for me
Truth be told, spent every night with me
Talkin' on the phone, never tryin to fight with me
I almost thought she would spend her whole life with me
She had real nice style, and wings on her back, wings on her back, wi-wings on her back
She had swag like mine, and ones in her crack, ones in her crack, one-ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit-hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat
Bitches love me like my name's Justin Bieber
Deep throat so good, give every boy a fever
Wake up every morning feelin' like P.Diddy
Why the fuck is there money in my grandma's pussy?
Legs around the pole, hickey marks on my neck
Cum say hey to my Hello Kitty cervexx.
I'm a rollercoaster ride, you know I'm good
Got with Adam Lambert, even fucked Tiger Woods
(Owww What?)
My mouth is V.I.P, weave like Beyonce, lips like Jay-Z.
I'm 'bout to do a back bender, make you go POP!
You wanna lick this? Lipgloss & Lollipop
Sorry, I'm so dirty, so d-d-dirty
Show me your wee wee
The fucky sucky fucky fucky happy happy ending
(Hiyah... Whatever)

And when I had the pussy, I made it purr like a cat, purr like a cat, purr-purr like a cat
I had, I had, I had those ones in my hand.
You had, You had, You had this need for a man.
I had, I had, I had those bills in my hand.
You had, You had, You had this need for a man.
You were so untamable
I Just had to figure you out.
I'm glad you let me figure you out.
You were different from the rest of them
You were better then the rest of them.
You were so untamable
I'm glad you let me figure you out.
I Just had to figure you out.
