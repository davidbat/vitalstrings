I took my cat to the vet once and she loved it. (??)  She was jumping up and down in the examining room and we couldn't keep her still.  All the while she's purring so loud you can hardy hear yourself think.  I said to the vet, "now that's a happy cat". and the vet says, "cats don't purr because they're happy" and I said, "I don't know, she looks pretty happy to me" and the vet appeared annoyed.  Sorry, that was a happy cat.
