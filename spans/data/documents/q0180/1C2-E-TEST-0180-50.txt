Why Does My Pet Eat Grass?
For as long as there have been domestic cats, possibly longer, one question         has come up time and time again - Why do Cats Purr? To this day, no one         can say for certain, but there are a number of popular theories.
Some are quite convincing, some are verging on the ridiculous, there         are even a few that go way past ridiculous and well into the crazy ramblings         of the stereo-typical feline obsessive. (...and I'm not talking about         me with that last one, despite what you may have heard!)
In this article we'll discuss some of the more popular theories - maybe         your own experiences can add to the already extensive volume of speculation         on the subject, if so we'd love to hear about it.
Purring to show contentedness.
We all know the scene. A cat curled up on a lap, enjoying a fuss and         purring away without a care in the world. Contentedness is the most likely         reason given by the general populous when asked 'Why does a cat purr?'         - but most cat owners realise there's more to it.
There are a number of other occasions when a cat can be heard letting         out a loud purr, so although contentedness may well be one of the reasons         for purring, there must be others too. This theory also doesn't fully         answer the question of 'why?'- Why would a contented cat have any reason         to demonstrate their contentedness?
This leads us to the second theory; maybe the reason they show their         contentedness in this way is their affection for those around them?
Purring to show affection
Cats will often approach their favourite people purring loudly and proceed         to nuzzle, nibble, drool and roll all over them, in a great show of affection.         Undoubtedly in this instance the purring is part of the affectionate         behaviour.
Although proof still remains elusive, it is fairly logical to draw the         conclusion that the purring here is an audible means of communicating         that affection, as if to say 'I love you'.
Purring To show passiveness
Blowing the satisfaction theory out of the water, cats can often be         heard purring after a serious trauma, accident or injury. In fact it         seems that the more imminent death is the louder they will purr. This         is certainly not a show of contentedness or affection, and a much more         reasonable explanation would be to demonstrate passiveness.
The common thinking is that this might be a message to a carer translated         as 'please look after me', or to a predator saying 'please don't hurt         me any more'.
The healing properties of a Purr
My favourite theory, possibly because I'm an idealist or possibly because         it is the most scientifically explainable, is that purring has healing         qualities and cats take every opportunity to get a bit of healing.
Unlike the other theories, this one also doesn't preclude any of the         other situations in which you might encounter a loud purr.
Cats purr at a frequency of between 25Hz and 150Hz. Low frequencies         such as these have been proven to have strange effects on the physiology         of most animals.
Effects range from altering mood to the involuntary relaxing of muscles         to increasing the speed of recovery from an injury. One of the most compelling         effects is that some low frequencies can, over time, increase the strength         of bones.
It is well noted that cats are tenacious and tough little critters,         surviving illnesses and injuries that would have killed a human many         times over. They can fall from great heights or consume deadly poisons         and recover without showing any lasting effect.
One of our cats even seems to enjoy the odd meal of hazardous substances,         to the point that we now lock away anything we know to be toxic.
In conclusion
In conclusion, there are still no firm conclusions! All of the above         theories, and some others, certainly have some merit. My own feeling         is that purring has more than one purpose; these may include all of the         theories mentioned here and more.
Either way, purring is certainly an endearing quality and just one more         reason to love your cat.
