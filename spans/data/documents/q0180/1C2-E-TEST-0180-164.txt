Your Questions About Why Do Cats Purr
Lizzie asks…
How, or Why do cats Purr?
I cant really figure out how, or why cats purr. Im mainly asking because Im curious if there was some way a human could be able to purr just like an actual cat?
Hcg Diet answers:
The most popular scientific explanation involves communication between the brain of the cat to the voice box. When the brain communicates happiness, the muscles in the voice box begin to vibrate. As air passes through the vibrating muscles and creates the sound we call purring.

Hcg Diet answers:
WHY ? – cats purr to relax themselves. Purring releases endorphins which act as tranquilizers and pain killers. Some cats will purr simply for the endorphin ”rush”. This is why lions are so miserable and roar a lot. Lions cannot purr.
HOW ? – cats have a flexible bony plate just under their larynx. If they extend that plate forward against their windpipe it will vibrate when air is inhaled or exhaled over it. The vibration affects nerves in the cats throat that send signals to produce the endorphins.

i want to know why cats purr
Hcg Diet answers:
Cats purr when they are content.  You can compare it to sighing or groaning out appreciation when someone gives you a backrub.  It’s also a sign of love which usually goes along with the cat “cleaning” you with it’s tuna tounge!  *
