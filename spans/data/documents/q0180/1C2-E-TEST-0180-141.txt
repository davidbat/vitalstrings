Why do cats purr?
Although we do not know exactly how the purr is produced, we do know roughly why cats produce this little continuous snore. Like all other felines, they purr when they feel a strong emotion. We have the tendency to associate this purr with contentment, but it not systematically the case.
The purr is a way of communication between the felines, and with the males: it expresses the recognition of supremacy.
Indeed, cats do purr when they are very frightened, or hurt. And consequently: purring stimulates the production of endorphin, the calming substance for the organs.
