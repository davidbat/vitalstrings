My Cats Don't Purr...Do Yours?
My cats don't purr, and I’m trying to assess whether this is the norm for many cats or whether my two are unusual.
When Muffin was younger, she would purr upon occasion – but I haven’t heard her purr for well over a year now. She’s now 18 months old. She’s very skittish and always has been. She hates to be held or sit on my lap, although she enjoys being petted (when she’s in her cat tree and such). Still, she never purrs.
When Abby was a baby, she would purr a LOT. She’s now 15 months old. Abby likes to sit on my lap, although she tends to stay for only a few minutes. Then something will catch her attention and she’s off. When she’s sitting on my lap, she will occasionally purr (maybe once a month), but otherwise she never purrs either.
So, am I alone here? Or are there many others with cats who don’t purr or rarely purr? If your cat does purr, do he/she do so mainly when on your lap or at other times?
