All the cat lovers enjoy it when a cat purrs. Why do they do it? Scientists think it is a kind of “homing device” used by a mother cat to help her newborn kittens (whose sight, hearing and sense of smell are all underdeveloped at that time) locate her when it’s time to nurse. Purring is a kind of “dinner bell” to young kittens. A mother cat purrs, the kittens fasten on, and the purring stops. No one can be sure, but it appears that from “kittenhood” on they associate purring with pleasure.Your contented cat may purr in your lap or lying near you, but you won’t hear (or feel) him purr as he/she lies contented in the sun. Purring is never a solitary act; cats only purr in the close proximity of a human or another cat. Cat experts think purring indicates not only contentment but also submission. That is, purring is the kitten’s signal to his mother and the adult cat’s signal to his owner that “I’m all yours.” No wonder cat lovers take such pleasure in it.
