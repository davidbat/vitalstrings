Lions can purr too. The reason a cat doesn't roar is because only four cats can roar: The lion, tiger, leopard, and jaguar. Roaring is made possible by a special two-piece hyoid bone in the throat. All of the non-roaring cats have a one-piece hyoid bone.  This is why a cat can't roar.
It is said that a lion's roar can be heard 5 miles (8 km) away.
