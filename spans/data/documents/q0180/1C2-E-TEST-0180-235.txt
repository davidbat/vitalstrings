About The Purr
Hi-my Best Friend Had A Female Cat That Didn't Really Purr. She Would Sometimes Open Her Mouth  And Give An Almost Silent Meow. She Was An Indoor Spayed Cat But Previously She Had Been Rescued From A Rather Crowded Difficult Situation And Had Apparently Mis-carried A Litter. She Would Only Allow My Friend The Pleasure Of Her Services As A Sometime Lap Cat. Maybe Some Cats Have A Very Low Purr-but I Almost Think They All Do Purr. As You May Know-they Purr To Comfort Themselves When Sick Or Scared Too. I Read That In The Magazine "cat Fancy" A Very Worthwhile Magazine To Subscribe To.one Of My Cats Is Quiet And Hissy Toward Me Other Cat But At Night-hours Before The Rooster Crows ( No-i Live In A Town-no Roosters!) My Cat Will Sneak Over To Be With Me Alone And Purrs Away. I Guess It Goes With The Personality. Hope You And The Furr Ball Are Doing Well. Peace  Susanswatlin518
