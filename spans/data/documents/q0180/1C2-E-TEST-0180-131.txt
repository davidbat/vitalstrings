Cats often purr when being petted, becoming relaxed, or when eating. Female cats are known to sometimes purr while giving birth. Domestic cats have been reported to purr when injured, sick, in pain or dying. Purring may be a signaling mechanism between mother cats and nursing kittens. One theory is that it is not a sign of showing love but attempting friendship, for example, when a cat is nervous (at a Vet perhaps) it may purr to avoid being hurt. German ethologist and cat behaviorist Paul Leyhausen interprets it as a signal that the purring cat is communicating that it is not posing a threat.
