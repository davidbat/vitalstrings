Why do Cats                  Purr?
by                  KittyKondo.com
All Cats purr, some more or less than others. Scientific        research reveals that all cats purr at the same frequency of 25 cycles per        second. However, it is still a scientific mystery on what exactly causes        the purring sound in cats. There are many theories as to what causes the        sound of a cat's purr. Some believe that purring comes about through the        cat's cardiovascular system, not the lungs or throat.
   Cats purr perhaps when they are in a state of enjoying or        contentment. Newborn kittens purr as a sign of health and their mother        uses purring to reassure her litter that all is well.
