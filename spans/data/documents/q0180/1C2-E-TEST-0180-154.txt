How Do Cats Purr?
Indeed, how do cats purr? Cat lovers and scientists alike have asked that question for a long time. And thanks to many studies, we are closer to knowing exactly how cats purr.
It was once believed that the cats purr was caused by the blood rushing through the vena cava. But now scientists believe that internal laryngeal muscles are the real source of cat purring.
So how does it work? How do cats purr? The internal laryngeal muscles are in charge of opening and closing the glottis, which is a fancy name for the space between the vocal cords.
When the glottis closes and opens quickly, it allows air to flow rapidly between the vocal chords. This action causes the vocal chords to vibrate, which in turn causes the purring sound.
Interestingly, all this activity happens after a "neural oscillator" signals the brain to open and close the glottis.
Why do scientists think that the laryngeal muscles produce the purring sound? They have found that cats with laryngeal paralysis do not purr.
