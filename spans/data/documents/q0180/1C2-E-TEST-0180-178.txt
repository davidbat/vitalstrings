How do Cats Purr?
Glad you asked...
A cat's purr was once thought to be created by blood rushing though the inferior vena cava, but scientists now believe that the purr is created by movement of the internal laryngeal muscles.  You can find more information here: http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/...

Then again, this answer might help you...
Cats purr because the muscles in their voice box vibrate, which is triggered by their brain.  Basically, when the cat is inhaling and exhaling, the vibrating voice box acts as an on-and-off device as air flows through, producing the purring sound.
