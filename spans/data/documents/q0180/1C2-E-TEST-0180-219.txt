Cats are one of the most sought pet to have in a home. Domestic cats are   very amicable and express themselves through a fascinating way; purring.   But why and how does a cat purr? Purring in cats consists of alternative   impulses of sound, arising in the larynx. Each individual sound is caused   by rapid variation of air pressure after left and right voice ligaments   are separated. Larynx muscles are stimulated by nerve impulses coming   from twenty to thirty times a second. With this, voice ligaments close   up and air pressure rises. When this stimulation of muscle stops, voice   ligaments move apart and make the released air to produce a sound. This   sound is the purr that we hear from the cat. Purring is heard from a cat   when the cat is injured, anxious, or just showing signs of contentment.   A purr is first heard in a kitten who is suckling milk from his mother.
Small cats are able to easily produce the purr, but so can some big cats.   Lions, tigers, leopards, and cheetah are able to purr. Jaguars on the   other hand aren't able to purr due to the difference in how the nerves   stimulate the larynx. Whoever the big cats that are able to purr can only   produce   it during exhalation and in a less common vocalization than in the domestic   cat.
The frequency of the cat's purr falls within the range of 27–44 Hz but   can extend up to 150 Hz.
