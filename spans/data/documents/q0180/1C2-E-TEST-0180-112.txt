The Purr
I was delighted to discover not too long ago that purring, one of my favorite feline behaviors, is an ability given not only to our housecats, but to many wild cats as well! Can you imagine sitting next to a super-sized purr? Though I guess a cat doesn’t have to be big to purr big! But back to our wild friends . . .
Who Can Purr?
All cats except for those mentioned in the roaring section above can purr. This includes mountain lions (also known as cougars, panthers, or pumas), cheetahs, bobcats, lynxes, and smaller cats like the ones mentioned in this post .
Roaring cats may be able to make sounds similar to purring, but they are unable to purr continuously in the same way that other cats can. For example, instead of purring, big cats may “chuff” as a greeting.

Why Do Cats Purr?
To express affection, contentment, and friendship
To communicate with kittens/cubs. Kittens/cubs are also able to purr shortly after they’re born – this interaction between mother and babies is meant to reassure and mutually express that all is well.
When nervous or threatened, cats may purr as a sign of submission, to let their opposition know they mean no harm.
When in pain. Purring releases endorphins that act as a natural aspirin. If you’ve seen a momma cat give birth, you may have noticed that she purred throughout the process.
When otherwise injured. Sound frequencies in the same range as a cat’s purr have been known to improve bone density and promote healing! So perhaps in certain situations the cat’s purr is an attempt to self-heal. I can say from personal experience that a purring cat is good therapy for its human, so it makes sense that purring would be good therapy for the “purrer” as well!
Purring Videos!
Although the videos below aren’t quite the same as being near a purring cat of any size, they sure are sweet. Check them out!
