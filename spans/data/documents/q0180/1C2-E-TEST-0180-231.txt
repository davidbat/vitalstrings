one of my kitties went from purring all the time as a kitten to purring infrequently as an adult.  She's still healthy, she's happy in her home, she just doesn't purr as often.  When she does though she's obviously very happy.
It is a good idea to make sure your kitty has had a checkup recently.  There's so much that can happen to make her uncomfortable that you'd never see.  Cats are experts at hiding their infirmaties.
Otherwise, has anything else changed in your kitty's life?  New pet?  cange of address?  new people in the house?  all of these can cause stress and a change in how the kitty is feeling.
