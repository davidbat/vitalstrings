Noisy cat hits purr-fect pitch in world record bid
Smokey could be named the world's loudest purrer if the record is confirmed
A cat from Northamptonshire has made an official attempt to become the world's loudest purrer.
Smokey made the record attempt in front of four independent witnesses at her owner Ruth Adams' home in Northampton.
Smokey was tested by a music expert from Northampton College who found her purr reached 73 decibels - 16 times louder than the average cat.
The evidence will now be submitted to the Guinness Book of Records for verification.
Mrs Adams said: "Guinness has very strict criteria and the college has been very helpful in supplying the specialist recording equipment needed to measure Smokey's purr and for arranging the official witnesses.
'Top form'
"Smokey is actually quite camera-shy so I was very conscious not to upset her during the record attempt, so we kept it all kept very calm and low-key."
Witnesses to the 12-year-old cat's attempt were Daventry MP Chris Heaton-Harris, veterinary nurse Kaye James, Diana Johnson from Cats Protection, and British Airways captain Alisdair Tait.
Ray Meadham, curriculum manager in music at Northampton College, said: "You don't get asked to help out with a world record attempt every day so of course we jumped at the chance.
"We had a few test sessions at the college's studios before deciding to make the attempt in Smokey's home environment where she felt more at ease and would perform at her best.
"The recording equipment we used to record Smokey's purr included a Rode microphone, Logic music software and a category 1 sound meter which measures decibels - it's the same equipment music professionals use.
"Luckily, Smokey was on top form and rose to the challenge."
