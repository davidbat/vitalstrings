Does a Cat Purr Only When It's Content?
The other theory suggests that a cat's purring comes from vibrating blood vessels as opposed to the voice box.
Although scientists may debate the manner in which a cat's purr is physically produced; studies regarding the results of the physical act appear to be less debatable. Studies have shown that domestic cats' purring is produced consistently at a pattern between 25 and 150 Hertz. And the same studies have shown that a frequency within this range can improve bone density and promote healing.
Mythology Behind Cats' Nine Lives
Mythology, and a common legend held among vets, suggests that a cat is able to reassemble its bones when placed in a room with all of its parts. Like any aspect of mythology, this one might require some facts in order to properly assimilate the meaning of such a statement.
The domestication and breeding of cats, as opposed to their canid counterpart like dogs, has occurred relatively more recently which may have left their bones and muscles lacking the capacity and strength that their counterparts have developed over time. And purring may very well be a low energy mechanism cats have developed in order to stimulate bone growth and healing.
Remarkable Aspects of Cats
Two interesting facts to consider regarding domestic cats and their remarkable ability to 'bounce back' may be in order: although a cat cannot meow and nurse at the same time, a cat can purr and nurse at the same time; and, purring apparently does not seem to be a learned behavior as kittens start purring within a day or two of birth.
