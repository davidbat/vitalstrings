Yes, it is unsual to have a cat that does not purr. Newborn kittens at the age of two days are able to purr while they nurse. It is possible that the cat has some damage or defect in the nerves from the voicebox that vibrate the vocal chords. This could also be a genetic defect, result of an illness or infection, etc.. If you have been able to detect her "purr mechanism" even occasionally, there may be no underlying physical cause. The cat may just may prefer vocalizing by meowing. Apparently it does get your attention. =)
