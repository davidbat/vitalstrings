My Matilda purrs (very softly) once a month, she is a very peculiar cat, coming from a feral mother… i was afraid she was not happy with me but i convinced myself she is only special and does not need to purr all the time, like her sister, who does it every night before bedtime.

I have 3 cats.  All 3 purr, but the each have a different individual purr.

@ Gabi, my one year old kitty had the same problem, but vet couldn’t find anything wrong and the stool sample I brought was clean.  I think I will try the wellness and see if that helps.  Thanks for the tip.

I have a 3 yr old rescue that picked me for her new mom about 2 yrs now.  She has never purred or meowed.  The only sound from her is the occasional squeak when she is real excited or wants my attention.  She sounds like a squeak toy!  LOL!
She is heathy and appears to be happy so I just figure she is just the strong silent type!

Purring for some cats is a way to calm themselves.
The sound helps to calm them.  Kind of like humming or whistling when you are afraid.    My two foster kittens had to go to the vet because they picked up a respiratory infection.  First one then the other.  In both cases the Vet couldn’t really hear much over all the purring noise.  Any comments anywhere about the Pet ear thermometers.  I just ordered one so I can check my dogs and cats temperatures.  I get nervous at the vet watching the rectal thermometers being used.  I keep thinking what happens if it breaks.  I think my old vet used a digital rectal thermometer.
