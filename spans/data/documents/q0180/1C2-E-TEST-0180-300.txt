It takes quite the cat lover to tolerate a feline that drowns out TV shows and telephone conversations.
Ruth and Mark Adams of England think that their cat, Smokey, could very well be the world's loudest cat .  According to the Daily Mail, the cat's noisy purr clocks in at 92 decibels up close and 80 decibels when five feet away.  92 decibels is equivalent to a lawnmower or hair dryer and the average cat purrs at 25 decibels , the Telegraph reports.
So is Smokey the world's loudest cat ? Guinness has a category in place, but hasn't received any entries until now.  "If Smokey can purr at over 80dB it would be an astonishing feat," a spokesman told the Daily Mail.
Take a listen to Smokey for yourself and decide if you think he's the world's loudest cat .
