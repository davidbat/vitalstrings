You often see it when you is nursing your kittens or when you provide social contact via petting, stroking or feeding. The purr varies between different species and breed of cat, in terms of tone, decibels (loudness), amplitude, and frequency. Cats not only purr when relaxed, happy, comfortable but also during giving birth or when injured or sick.
Many many cats also purr when they are afraid or in pain. That helps explain why females may purr during labor and why some cats  purr when they are being examined at a veterinary clinic or when they are recovering form an injury. So it is believed that to make purr sound there are variety of reasons, based on the circumstances at the time.
