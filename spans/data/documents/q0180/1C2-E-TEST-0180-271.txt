When we lived in Spain(Double Yuck) in the 1970's we adopted a kitten that was the same way. I guess cats can be mute too. Must be something goofy in the genetics. The only way I could get him to"squeak" was to give him a squeeze, which I do not recommend. He never did talk, and lived to be about 13 or 14...You might be able to teach him sign language for cats! Mine never learned how either. I think it was cause he didn't "apply" himself..Ha ha..Best wishes.

This happened to a cat I had when I was young. As a kitten he could meow fine, then he got a bit older and it dispareared. He looked like if was meowing, but nothing would come out, just a wisper. There was nothing wrong with him, in fact his meow came back for a little while a few years later, then disappeared again. So it's not necessarily anything to worry about if there doesn't seem to be anything wrong... It's just a little odd! Hope that helps!

Every Cat is different, Some meow just to talk - some because they are hungry or want something.  Most of my cats didn't meow when they were very sick - just looked miserable.
By any chance do you have any plants in the house?  There is a diefenbachia that causes temporary paralysis of the vocal cords.  Never had it happen - don't have that plant. But my hubby sure jokes about it when they get "mouthy".  Just jokes - would never actually do that!  The plant is also called "Dumb Cane"

She may be doing it intentionally as you have brought a kitten in the home. The second possibility is that she may be sick for which symptoms are not clear to you at the moment. Change of environment can be another reason for that but I still suggest you to go to the vet.

For the first two years my cat didn't make a peep, even if you accidentally stepped on her tail.  Now she won't shut up, especially if she wants to play fetch in the middle of the night.

You should get that checked out. The cat could be very sick or could of hurt something in its throat or it has something stuck in its throat.
