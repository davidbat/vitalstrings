Why                     does your cat wash your hair or face?
The first                   thing a                   kitten                   experiences, even before it can see, is its mother                   licking and                   washing.  Grooming is a demonstration of love and caring.  So, if your cat                   occasionally                   washes your hair or licks your face, he is showing you                   his acceptance                   and                   caring of you as a fellow feline.

Why                       does a cat "knead" or "make biscuits"?
When                     a kitten is nursing, it typically kneads its paws                     against its mother,                     either                     as a sign of contentment or to encourage the milk                     flow.  When the                     cat matures, it kneads to show its contentment and                     pleasure.

Why                     does a cat go to the visitor who doesn't like cats?
When one cat                   is                   threatening                   another, it stares boldly, sometimes hisses, and                   frequently moves in                   toward                   the other cat.  Usually, the person who doesn't                   like cats avoids                   looking                   at it, doesn't talk to it, and sits quietly, hoping to                   be ignored by                   the                   cat.  The cat, therefore, sees the person's                   behavior as                   "cat-friendly"                   and practically inviting.

Why                     does your cat push its head against you? 
This is                   called "head                   butts".  This is a cat's way of showing affection. Some cats                   will turn their                   head,                   and push it against a human (or another cat).

Why                       does a cat do a stiff-legged hop/touch against a                       human?
That                     is the cat's body language of saying, "hey, hi                     there, how ya doin'?"

Why                     does your cat rub up against you?
Cats have                   scent                   glands along                   the tail, on each side of their head, on their lips,                   base of their                   tail,                   chin, near their sex organs, and between their  front paws. They                   use                   these glands to scent mark their territory. When the cat rubs you, he                   is                   marking you with his scent, claiming you as                   "his."  Too, he is                   picking                   up your scent. Cats rub up against furniture or                   doorways for the same                   reason                   - to mark the item as "his".  (Urine spraying is                   also a                   territorial                   marking, by the way.)

Why                       does a cat sometimes wash its fur immediately                       after being petted?
There                     are two theories on this behavior.  One theory                     proposes that the                     cat                     is getting rid of the human smell.  The other                     is that the cat is                     furthering                     the pleasure of his association with you by tasting                     your scent.

Why                     do some cats suck wool or clothing?
There are a                   couple of theories                   on this:
The cat was                   weaned                   too early                   and the scent of the lanolin reminds the cat of his                   mother, or 
The cat has a                   lack                   of fiber                   in his diet.

Why                     does a cat walk sloooowly, looking straight forward                     when passing                     another                     cat?
All cats are                   territorial                   to an extent - the range of a particular inside cat                   may extend from a                   small                   space in a room to the entire house, depending on                   their hierarchical                   ranking                   in the family. When a "superior" cat confronts on                   "inferior" in the                   hierarchy,                   it will stare at and/or move in for a face-to-face                   confrontation.  When a cat wants to show that it doesn't want to get                   into an argument,                   it will make a wide, slow path around the other cat,                   usually avoiding                   even                   looking at it.

Why                     does a cat use a litterbox?
In feral cat                   colonies, subordinate cats cover their waste, while                   dominant ferals                   leave it conspicuously uncovered. Most indoor cats                   bury their waste,                   possibly to display subordination to their humans.                   Sometimes in                   multi-cat households, however, the dominant cat will                   leave waste                   uncovered to indicate his status.

Why                     does a cat scratch outside the litterbox, instead of                     inside it?
The cat has                   probably                   had                   several unpleasant experiences of getting his feet                   soggy or dirty -                   make                   sure the litterbox is cleaned out frequently.

Why                     does a cat purr?
Usually, a                   cat purrs                   because                   it is content.  A mother cat purrs to let her                   kittens know she is                   nearby, and kittens purr in response to their mother's                   grooming.  Older kittens purr to entice adults to play.  Some adults will                   purr                   to show an aggressor that they are non-threatening.                   Take note, however,                   that some cats will purr when frightened or in pain.

Why                     does a cat sometimes scratch the floor as though he                     is trying to bury                     his                     food dish?
It may be a                   holdover                   of                   the wild trait of burying food for later.  Or, it                   may be that he                   is                   trying to tell you that the food is not to his liking.

Why                     does a cat attack human's ankles?
Kitten play                   always                   involves                   mock battles, with surprise attacks, pounces, and                   leaps.  The                   kitty                   is basically trying to play, as he would with another                   cat.  Direct                   him to less painful game play - chasing balls, cords,                   and so on.

Why                     are some people allergic to cats' fur?
It's not the                   cat's                   fur that                   causes allergies. It's a protein (FEL D1) in the cat's                   saliva. When a                   cat                   grooms itself, it deposits this protein on its fur                   (and the protein                   then                   may be transferred to upholstery and carpets).  Some cats                   have                   less (or more) of this protein.  There is no way                   to predict                   which cat in a litter, if any, will be less                   allergenic, though                   females                   seem to be the lesser allergenic.  Bathing a cat                   to reduce the                   amount                   of protein in the cat's fur has traditionally been                   recommended, but                   research may be tending to negate that                   conclusion.  Instead,                   wiping down the cat using a damp microfiber cloth to                   remove visible                   dander may be more effective.  I've also been                   told that a product called Allerpet, rubbed into the cat's fur, can help                   reduce the dander.

Why                     does your cat turn his/her back on you after a                     scolding, or if you've                     been                     gone for a while?
Typically, a                   person's body                   language when reprimanding a pet includes staring or                   other overtly                   "aggressive"                   behavior.  The cat usually responds in a                   submissive fashion.  In a sense, it is telling you he has surrendered to                   you, as a fellow                   cat,                   and is discouraging attack.   (By the way,                   you will get                   better                   results from a cat if you enforce his positive                   behavior instead of                   reprimanding                   any negative behavior.)

Why                     does your cat bring you dead or dying creatures?
There are at                   least                   four differing theories on this behavior: 
- Your cat is                   bringing you                   a present, in appreciation for you feeding it or as a                   sign of affection.
- Your cat                   realizes                   you are                   a totally incompetent mouser and is trying to educate                   you.
- The cat is                   bringing her                   prey home to where it is safe, where she usually eats.
-                     The cat is simply trying to make                     sure you have fresh food.

Why                     does a cat play with its prey?
Cats are                   attracted                   by movement,                   so if a stalked prey keeps moving, the cat's desire to                   attack continues                   to be  stimulated.  If the cat gets very                   excited over the                   stalking/killing,                   he may continue to play with the prey after it is                   dead.

Why                     do some cats put their toys in their water or food                     dish?
Cats look                   upon their                   food                   area as part of their territory, and that particular                   area of their                   territory                   usually doesn't change from day to day - so the cats                   are likely putting                   their favorite toys away in a "safe" place.  Some                   cats will                   consistently                   put away their toys when they're through playing with                   them - you might                   try putting your cat's toys in a small basket near one                   of his favorite                   spots and see if he will put them away on his                   own.

Why                     does your cat take a small bite on your arm or cheek                     and hold on for a                     few seconds?
Some cats,                   when they                   are                   very happy and feeling extremely affectionate toward                   the Big Unfurry                   Cat,                   will gently take a piece of  human skin between                   their teeth and                   hold                   it for a few seconds.  Think of it as the feline equivalent of                   kissing.

Why                       do cats roll over on their backs?
Cats                     roll over on their backs for a variety of                     reasons:  if your cat                     flops                     down in front of you and rolls over on his back for                     a belly skritch,                     it's                     a sign of his complete trust in you that you won't                     ever hurt him.  Other times, he wants to play.  If the cat is                     female and in heat,                     it's a form of foreplay.  It's also a part of                     their social                     standing.  Domesticated cats don't display this                     as much as wild                     ones do. Wild cats have a very similar social                     structure to that of                     wolves.

Why                       does a cat lick photographs or plastic bags?
It                     has been speculated that they are tasting the slight                     "odor" that                     emanates                     from these products.  They may also enjoy the                     texture of the items                     on their tongue.

Why                     do some cats go crazy over catnip, but others ignore                     it?
The response                   to                   catnip is                   the result of a gene in the cat; if the cat doesn't                   have the gene, it                   cannot                   physically react to catnip.  Some cats will react                   to catnip by                   rolling                   around on the floor in delight, others will just                   quickly eat it up and                   wander off, while others will ignore it completely.

Why                     does a cat sometimes "sneer" when smelling                     something?
When a cat                   curls                   back its                   upper lip and looks like it's sneering, it has just                   discovered an                   interesting,                   usually intense odor and is smelling it more                   deeply.  Called                   "flehming,"                   it is drawing the odors into an organ (Jacobson's                   organ), in the roof                   of                   its mouth.

Why                       do cats sometimes scratch at windows?
It                     may be that they are verifying that there is                     actually a barrier between                     them and whatever they see outside.

Why                       does a cat hate getting wet?
Actually,                     many cats enjoy water and at least one breed is                     known to enjoy fishing                     and swimming.  But, it has to be on their own                     terms - being picked                     up by two human hands and dunked in a sink full of water is not on the                     cat's "own terms."

Why                     do some cats insist on drinking from a dripping                     faucet?
Cats - like                   most                   other animals                   - prefer their food and water fresh, and running water                   is most                   appealing                   for that reason. Too, the motion of water coming out                   of a faucet is                   probably                   appealing to their sense of hearing and sight.  Another likely theory is that c
ats                   can’t see where the water level is with still water,                   and they don’t like sticking their face in it.  So some cats test the water level with their paw                   first, and others drink from alternate sources where                   the level doesn’t change, like the drip, the toilet,                   or the bathtub puddles.

Why does a cat hide when it is sick or dying?
Instinct                     tells a cat to hide where a predator can't find                     them.  When a cat                     is ill, it may think it is being stalked - so it                     hides. Too, it wants to avoid any further threat to                     its well-being.

Why                       does a cat spend so much time grooming?
Besides                     the obvious purpose of hygiene and the social                     aspects, grooming helps                     cats                     cope with confrontation or 'embarassment' (you may                     have noticed that if a                     cat accidentally falls off a chair, the first thing                     he does is                     nonchalantly                     wash himself, as though he intended to get down in                     the first place.)

Why does a cat frequently demand attention when you're                       on the telephone?
The                     cat, since it can't see the person you are talking                     to, presumes you are                     talking to him, and is responding to what he                     perceives is your                     conversation                     with him.

Why                       does a cat scratch the furniture or a scratching                       post?
While                     some people think a cat scratches to sharpen its                     claws, that is                     probably                     inaccurate.  There are typically two reasons                     for scratching:  the cat is marking its territory (cats have sweat                     glands between their                     paw pads, and scratching leaves their scent on the                     clawed object); or,                     the cat is "filing down" its nails and removing the                     outer layer

Why                       does a cat suddenly bite or hiss at a person after                       it's been petted for                       a while?
If                     a person persists in touching a sensitive area (such                     as the cat's tail,                     ears, or belly), the cat might give a gentle nip to                     as a way of staying                     "stop."  Too, some cats can tolerate                     pleasurable stroking only for                     short periods of time; again, he may communicate                     "stop it" with a nip                     or                     cuff of his paw.

Why                       do some cats insist on tipping over their water                       dish, or take food out                       of the dish and drop it on the floor to eat?
Most                     cats do not like to eat or drink out of bowls if the                     sides touch their                     whiskers.  Also, if a bowl is too deep, the cat                     may take the food                     out for convenience.  A wider, shallower bowl                     will probably                     eliminate                     this behavior.

Why                       does a cat chatter when he sees a bird?
When                     a cat kills prey, it bites down quickly several                     times.  The                     "chatter"                     is simulating the cat's behavior at the time of                     attack.
Alternatively (according to a visitor): it's pure                     and simple                     frustration. When a cat is stalking or killing a                     bird, they're almost                     invariably completely silent. It's when they are                     shut off from the prey                     that they chatter.  Another reason that cats                     "chatter" when they                     see a bird is because they are attempting to imitate                     a bird call to                     lure in their prey from out of reach places.

Why                       is a cat able to land on its feet from a fall?
When falling, the cat swivels its                       body in mid-air, so that it is facing the                     ground, and lands                     with                     its back arched to absorb the shock. Cats use                 their tails to                 right themselves and                 have very flexible bodies that allow them to swivel in                 mid-air,                 but the most important part of cats landing on their                 feet has to do                 with                 their very complex inner-ear that allows the cat's brain                 to know                 exactly what direction is up and what direction is down                 so that the                 brain can send the appropriate signals to allow the cat                 to land on all                 four feet. The complex                 inner-ear also aids them to                 maintain balance                 when jumping, landing, and walking on very narrow                 spaces.

Why                       do cats like crinkly sounds?
Crinkly                     sounds are similar to the high-pitched noises of                     rodents, birds, and                     crickets,                     so the crisp, crinkly sound of a crumpled piece of                     paper or walking                     into a paper bag stimulates the cat's "prey response."

Why                       do cats chew on plants?
It                     could be that the grass helps the cat get rid of fur                     swallowed while                     grooming,                     or that grass provides fiber or vitamins and                     minerals not found in                     meat.  Some plants are poisonous to a cat; others                     are okay for nibbling.
