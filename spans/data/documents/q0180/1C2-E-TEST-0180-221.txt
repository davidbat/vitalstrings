Question:
Why and how do Kittens purr?

Hi Jamie! that is a question from a feline fancier i guess...since i am one too! Let's see:
All big cats as lions, and tigers roar, but the little feline ones meow...and they purr too. Some zoologists( i'm not!) say the big cats can purr too and probably they do, but it will be a very loud purring!  Actually purring  is a low, continous, rattling hum and is interpreted as a expression of pleasure and love. It has nothing to do with the meows, the vibration frequency is far lower than that of vocal chords. Little is known about the physical mechanism involved in purring, zoologists say that the muscles of  the voice box shake (or vibe) to produce this long deep sound with the diaphragm. The inhaled stroke is the louder and rougher, and the exhaled one is smoother and seems to be continous. Probably that the kittens learn to purr from their mama, calling the babies to nurse, because when they are very young their senses are very undevelloped, but still they  can feel a vibration (purr) from the mother.
The cats purr at different situations, as a greeting to humans, while eating or nursing....some purr others not...
Purrr...thanks for asking NEWTON!

In reference to larger cats, my daughter is a vet student and traveled to  Africa to study some of the bigger cats such as the lion and cheetah.  She  mentioned that all the big cats purr, and this purr is rather loud.
