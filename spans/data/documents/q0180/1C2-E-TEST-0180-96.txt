Why Cats Purr
by Julie Corsi
 
For cat owners, the greatest pleasure is in that feeling of contentment                  cats share with us. We feel calmer and more peaceful when that                  purring bundle of warm fur climbs into our lap. We may not always                  hear the purring – a soft vibrating rumble – but we can feel it.
Ever since the Egyptians started worshipping the cat, philosophers,                  scientists and cat lovers worldwide have wondered why cats purr.
It is commonly believed that cats purr when content. However,                  cats also purr when they are severely injured, frightened or giving                  birth. So if cats were purring solely out of happiness they would                  not purr when injured, especially as the generation of the purr                  requires energy, and an injured animal will generally not expend                  precious energy needed for healing on an activity not directly                  connected with their survival. Since the purr has lasted through                  hundreds of generations of cats, there must be a survival mechanism                  behind its continued existence.
A kitten is able to purr by the second day of life, and although                  he can’t meow and nurse at the same time, he can purr and nurse.                  And the mother cat often purrs back, probably to reassure the                  kitty.
There are many theories to explain how the purr is generated.                  One study determined that purring involves activation of nerves                  within the voice box. These nerve signals cause vibration of the                  vocal cords while the diaphragm serves as a piston pump, pushing                  air in and out of the vibrating cords, thus creating a musical                  hum.
Domestic cats and some wild cats, like pumas and mountain lions                  (almost any big cat that cannot roar), are all able to purr. A                  scientific research study recorded the purrs of five species of                  cats - cheetah, puma, serval, ocelot and the domestic cat. The                  purring of the subject cats was recorded to be at a frequency                  between 25 and 150 Hertz. Medical investigators have shown that                  sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote                  healing in humans as well as other animals.
The durability of the cat has facilitated the notion that cats                  have "nine lives." Purring may provide a basis for this                  feline mythology. Cats do not display as many muscle and bone                  abnormalities as their more strongly selected carnivore relative,                  the domestic dog. Perhaps cats' purring helps alleviate the dysplasia                  or osteoporotic conditions that are more common in their canid                  cousins.
After a day or night of hunting, purring could be likened to                  an internal vibrational therapeutic system, a sort of "kitty                  massage" that would keep muscles and ligaments in prime condition                  and less prone to injury. Additionally, the purr could strengthen                  bone, and prevent osteodiseases. Following injury, the purr vibrations                  would help heal the wound or bone associated with the injury,                  reduce swelling, and provide a measure of pain relief during the                  healing process.
Cats are often used as "therapy animals" in convalescent                  hospitals, or in retirement residences. It is an accepted fact                  that cat owners have lower blood pressure, especially in older                  people.
