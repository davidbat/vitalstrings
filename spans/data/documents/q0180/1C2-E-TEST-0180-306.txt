I was a little worried that my cat wouldn't like it since he thinks he is a dainty little thing with sensative paws but he proved me wrong. I guess when you gotta go...nothing else matters :) It is very flexible and soft to the feet and does catch the majority of the litter that comes out of the box. the holes are deep enough that if you happen to step on the mat in bare or stocking feet, it deosn't feel like you are walking on sharp bits of gravel. I didn't have a problem with the "rubber mat smell" as some of the other responders said they had but then I have the box and mat near an outlet with an oil diffuser plugged in...it seems to work in hiding the "smell." It is thin enough that you can put the litter box off center and it won't tip or shift the litter or make you cat feel like he has to brace himself. I do wish they had other colors than just gray but like I said, it works great.
I would recommend this to a friend!
