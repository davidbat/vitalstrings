Some purring theories
Purring is just one of the many different ways by which cats communicate.  There seems to be an ongoing debate as to the actual cause of the purring.
-"False" vocal cords: Cats possess vocal cords as well as another set of cords commonly called false vocal cords.  When air is inhaled and exhaled, one false cord runs against the other, creating that purring sound.
-Muscle contraction:  This theory says that some of the cat's laryngeal muscles contract in a special way and cause a buildup of pressure.
-Turbulent blood:  Turbulence is created when blood flow increases through the heart's main veins.  It's most turbulent when the main vein constricts as the blood passes through the chest area.  The swirling blood, say some researches, creates a rushing, whirling sound that 's amplified by the diaphragm.  Some experts say that after it travels up the air passages and into the head, specifically the sinus and the skull, the noise becomes purring.
