cats as therapy animals
Some time ago, an email from a reader asked "Do cats purr when they are alone?" This question led me to a fascinating exploration of the physiology of a cat's purr. Truthfully, I don't know if cats purr when they are alone. It seems likely that they do, if one understands a little about why cats purr.  It is almost certain that both this mother cat and her nursing kittens are purring.
Most experienced "cat wranglers" now know that cats don't purr only when they are content and happy. They also purr during tense or traumatic moments. When suddenly and violently injured, even at moments near death, a cat will often purr. It is thought now that purring releases endorphins (morphine-like substance) which help relax the cat and ease pain. Another theory postulates that the range of frequency of a cat's purr strengthens bone density and facilitates healing.  It is not too far a leap to consider that this healing ability of a cat's purr may also benefit humans. Certainly, it is a well-known fact that the sound and vibrations of a cat's purr helps lower humans' blood pressure.
