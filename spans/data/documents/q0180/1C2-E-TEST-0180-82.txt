Why do cats purr?
As any cat owner will tell you there is nothing lovelier then when your cat jumps on your lap, starts to knead and begins to purr. Now that signals not only that your cat is extremely content but also that you have been initiated in her cat family (as you may or may not remember cats picks us rather then the other way around). At least that was the case when it comes to our family cats.
Purring is one of the most common sounds cats make however it still remains a mystery to scientists and not a lot is know about it. Kittens that are very little, will start to purr while they knead their mother's chast and nurse. Some cat owners have explained it to me that this is why start kneading and purring once in our laps, as this reminds them of their mums and also to show they are content.  When kittens are very little, they cannot meow and nurse, they can nurse and purr. This is a sign to their mum that they are well and their mum will purr right back to reassure them. Cats will purr when they both inhale and exhale with a pause between breaths. Pressure builds up with the closing and opening of the glotis which results in the separation of the vocals cords and the purr is emitted.  While you can hear Misko purring in another room, my other female cat sometimes will purr but there will not be any sound, just a soft rumble that you can feel.  Some veterinarians claim that cat will only purr when they want to but the fact of the matter is purring still remains a mystery to scientists.
