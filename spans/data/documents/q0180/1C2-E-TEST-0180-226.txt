A Purring Cat Is More Than Just A Happy Cat
All domestic cats and most wild felines are are born with the ability to purr. Cats, from young kittens to senior citizens, purr when they are happy, such as when they are being petted, anticipating dinner, or snuggling on a warm, cozy bed. Many scientists and behaviorists believe the original function of purring was to enable a kitten to tell his mother that "everything is ok." This occurs during nursing. A kitten cannot meow and nurse at the same time, but can purr and nurse without a problem. The mother often purrs back, reassuring the kitten. This is why your cat purrs when petted, instinctively giving the signal "everything is ok," a message you can both hear and feel.
Purring is an integral part of the feline communication system and occurs for a variety of reasons. It is classified with the "murmur vocalization" group, which involves sounds produced by a cat while the mouth is closed. In addition to purring, this group of sounds includes grunting, calling, and acknowledgment murmurs. Domestic cats and some wild cats, like pumas and mountain lions (almost any big cat that can't roar), are all able to purr.
Scientists report that cats produce purring sounds by using the diaphragm to push air back and forth across vibrating nerves in the larynx. Purring occurs in a frequency range between 25 and 150 hertz. At the lower end of the range, that rumbling sound can resemble an idling diesel engine, which has a similar velocity.
Scientists also believe that when cats purr under stressful circumstances, they are reassuring or comforting themselves, much as humans may sing to themselves or hum when they are nervous. Frightened cats may purr to communicate submissiveness or non-aggressive intentions. A feral cat may purr to signal that he will not attack and other cats need not feel threatened. Older cats may purr when they play or approach other cats, signaling that they are friendly and want to come closer.
