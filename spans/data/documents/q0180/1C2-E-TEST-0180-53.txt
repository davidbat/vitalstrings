I bought this book as a gift to my sister. We both love cats and I have other "The Cat" books and the pictures are so cute. The facts in here are probably intended for children as it is a scholastic publishing, but still a cute book with entertaining pictures. Here is a description that I found when I googled it:
We cats can be awfully mysterious. We're often cute and cuddly. But our behavior is sometimes baffling, and we're not always purr-fect. Yet you still love us! So it's time for us to set the record straight. We're ready to answer your questions and give you the cat's meow on why we do the things we do. Why do we purr? Why do we climb trees? And do we really get fur balls in our stomachs? Inside, you'll find all the answers--fur sure!
