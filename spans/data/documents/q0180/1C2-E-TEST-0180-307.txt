Cat                  owners report that biting is the second most common behavioral                  problem –second only to inappropriate urination. This is                  because personality traits are as varied in cats as they are in                  people. Early experiences have considerable bearing on later aggressive                  behavior but genetic diversity is a greater cause of problem aggression.                  Some cat owners just accept the unique temperaments of their pets                  but others find aggressive behavior intolerable and search for                  a cure. Unlike other personality quirks, aggressiveness can be                  a real problem for owners and other pets alike. Cat bites hurt                  and can lead to infections.
Kitten                And Adult Aggressive Play Acting
Although we keep them as pets, Nature designed cats to use their                claws and teeth to defend themselves and to hunt. Even the most                finicky gourmet feline still has these natural urges to lay in wait,                stalk and pounce. They derive great joy in attacking feet, sleeping                owners and unwary birds alike. Cats love to explore, stalk anything                that moves, and bat and pounce on small objects that they pretend                to be prey. This activity is most pronounced in kittens during their                learning period but many adult cats still love to play hunt. If                you encourage this activity rest assured that it will eventually                get out of hand. Kittens that play attack one another quickly learn                the limits of biting and scratching. Their playmates bite back when                play gets too rough. But kittens adopted out at an early age transfer                the activity to their owners who don’t always let them know                when they have gone too far rough housing. Play aggression is easy                to recognize by the exaggerated postures that cats assume. They                crouch, flatten their ears, their pupils dilate and their tail swishes                back and forth while they stalk or pounce at the owner. Some cats                remain “kittens” in this respect well into their adult                years.
The                Solution:
As cute as it may seem at first, do not encourage rough play, scratching                and biting. Be sure this is a rule for all family members and not                just some. You can put a bell on the kitten’s collar so you                know where he is at and you can deny him his favorite pouncing places.                You can also clap your hands or use a loud noise when you see him                begin to stalk you. Some of my clients make a rattle from a tin                can full of pennies and shake it to startle the kitten and redirect                its attention. The problem with using startling techniques it that                they tend to make the kitten shy. I prefer to simply not encourage                the behavior and wait for them to grow out of it.
Territory-based                Aggression
The                Problem: aggressive cat bite scratch behavior                aggression
I have owned cats that have been intensely territorial - even more                so than dogs. In the wild cats are solitary hunters, each with its                own separate territory. Territory-based aggression usually begins                when cats are about a year or two old. Cats that go out of doors                often become intensely possessive of the area surrounding their                home. They let out a very distinctive cry if another cat should                venture into their space but usually ignore strange dogs, other                animals and people. Cats can become extremely upset over these incidents                and may transfer their pent up aggression to other housepet or their                owners. It may take them a half a day to calm down.
When                territory-based aggression occurs within the home, cats hiss, spit                and growl at their housemates. When outright attacks occur the aggressor                or dominant cat will be the one that jumps at another cats rear                lumbar area. When wounds occur they are on the tail and loins of                the more submissive cats and on the face of the aggressor. Cats                in this situation often urine spray mark the house to reassert their                dominance.
The                cues that cats give to one another can be very subtle. Cats that                live harmoniously with one another have learned to live with smaller                territories – such as a favorite room – or through sharing                space at different times of day. Generally, only one cat will be                on a prized object such as a sofa at one time. Sharing is very precarious                for cats so anything that disturbs the situation can lead to aggression                and fights. A new apartment, new furniture or even moving a sofa                or bed may lead to turf arguments. Adding a new cat to the household                always causes stress and battles over turf and authority. When we                are lucky, the cats work these arguments out over a period of months.
Territorial                disputes among cats can develop gradually in the home. The most                assertive cat in the household gradually begins to guard favorite                objects and space and threaten or attack lesser-ranked cats in the                house. Depending on the temperaments of the lesser cats, they may                make concessions and cease to frequent a given area or only use                it when the dominant cat is away. In these situations any of the                cats may begin hiding, urine spraying, excessive licking and grooming                or other stress related activity.
The                Solution:
When you add a new cat to the household introduce it to your other                cats in stages. Start with the new cat in a separate room in a carrier                for a week or two. Enough scent from the new cat will permeate the                house for your other pets to know it is there. Later, release the                cat but keep it closed off in its room. When you do introduce the                cats to one another do it for short supervised periods. Only when                you are sure that you have control of the situation should you allow                the cats to mix with one another. Even then, remember that it may                take up to a year for the cats to fully adjust to a new member of                the family. Give each cat a food treat to encourage good behavior.
If                cats get into a fight separate them with gloves or a bath towel                or blanket. If you were scratched or bitten scrub out the wound                until it stings from the water and then soak it in alcohol for as                long as you can tolerate. Take the separated cats to separate rooms                to calm down. If you are coming back with a cat from the groomers                or the vet leave them in the carrier for an hour before you release                it.
Punishment                never works in curbing aggression in cats. It simply makes the problem                worse. Your cat will become fearful or turn its resentment toward                you and the other cats. Instead, simply withdraw your affection                as soon as an incident occurs. Cats quickly learn that life suddenly                got more boring after they became aggressive.
With                the exception of hunting activity and maternal protectiveness, facial                pheromones can be very helpful in calming cats. Pheromones seem                to have a calming effect on cats and encourage a mellow, friendly                attitude. Synthetic facial pheromone is sold under the trade name                Feliway. It is marketed to discourage urine spraying but it is quite                useful in managing aggression. Be careful not to spray it on the                cat because the product contains alcohol. Instead, spray it on a                folded sheet of Kleenex and rub it on the sides of the head and                back of the cat once the tissue is no longer damp.
Be                sure your cat(s) have plenty of scratching posts to sink their claws                into and plenty of stuffed toys to attack.aggression
Keep                the toe nails of your cat clipped short. File them with an emory                board if the cat will let you.
Be                patient. Improvement takes time. A good way to socialize with your                cat is by brushing it down with a slicker comb. Be happy with small                successes and don’t push the cat too much. Try to read the                signals and body language that your cat is giving you before things                get out of hand.
Aggression                Toward Humans a
The                Problem:
Cats that threaten their owners usually have star-crossed beginnings.                If they were not adequately handled, petted and socialized when                they were between five and twelve weeks of age they may grow up                to be fearful, wary of people or easily upset and angered.
Cats                that are frightened assume a characteristic position. They crouch                with their ears laid back, their tails curled inward and they tilt                their bodies away from the perceived threat. They will likely lash                out and claw or bite anything that approaches them. This behavior                often occurs when the cat is in new surroundings or being approached                by a stranger. The cat’s eyes often dilate and they may hiss                and show their teeth. Their hair may stand on end.
The                Solution:
Begin to correct the problem as soon as it first occurs. Do not                wait until the behavior is ingrained in the cat’s personality.                The best time to get cats used to owners, strangers and children                is when they are still kittens. Take time to get kittens used to                being touched everywhere and introduce them to dogs and other cats                while they are still young.
To                accustom a cat to be touched, begin when the cat is relaxed and                content. Start off scratching and rubbing its head. Make no sudden                moves. Progress to stroking its back and the base of the tail. Talk                to the cat while you are doing this and watch for any signs that                the cat is becoming agitated. Finish this short lesson with a food                treat. Eventually the cat will enjoy being touched and handled.
Fear                aggressiveness in adult cats present a much harder problem. When                they feel threatened by strangers or a new owner it takes much longer                to overcome the problem. Let the cat get hungry and then have the                person hold the cat’s favorite treat. Do not let the person                approach the cat. Let the cat overcome its fear and approach the                person on its own terms to develop confidence and trust. If the                cat is too shy to approach have a member of the family with whom                the cat has a good relationship give the treat while the second                person is in the house. Over a series of weeks the visitor can be                closer and closer when the treat is offered.
Redirected                Aggression
The                Problem:
Redirected aggression is a phenomenon I see frequently in cats and                parrots. In this situation a strange person or animal upsets the                cat. But instead of showing aggression toward this new individual                the cat turns its wrath on the pet owner(s) or another pet. We see                the same event occurring in marriages when an agitated wife or husband                takes out his or her frustration on their spouse.
When redirected aggression occurs it can destroy the bonds between                cat and cat and cat and owner that took years to establish. Sometimes                it is not more than a stray cat passing by the window that sets                of such a confrontation. If a lower ranking cat becomes the object                of redirected aggression it may defend itself, leading to a serious                cat fight.
The                Solution:
First try to decide what the stimulus was for the aggression and                remove it. Lower the blinds on the window if a stray cat has approached                and shoo it away. If the aggression is directed at you leave the                cat alone until it calms down. Do not punish or yell at the cat.                If the cat is being aggressive with housemates place each cat in                a separate closed room. Turn off the lights in the rooms. Interactions                with a cat during this problem are counterproductive. If the cat                is highly agitated it is best to wrap it in a beach towel when handling                it. Calm your pet and praise it. Once the agitated cat has calmed                down, reintroduce the cats slowly. Place them far apart in a room                and stroke and praise each one. A food treat comes in very handy                in these situations. Remember, even faint smells of another cat                can trigger redirected aggression. That is why cats returning from                the animal hospital are sometimes attacked by their housemates.
Aggression                Due to Medical Problems
The                Problem:
If it is unclear why your cat has suddenly become aggressive the                first thing to do is to take it to see a veterinarian whom you trust.                Be very cautious placing these cats in carriers and under no circumstance                bring the pet to the veterinarian without a carrier. If a thorough                physical exam does not indicate a problem an X-ray might. In some                cats arthritis of the spine or limbs is the root problem. These                cats will often growl and hiss when picked up or handled. Other                cats develop neurological conditions that lead to sudden intense                pain. I call these sudden twinges of pain “ghost pains”.                Often it is the spine and tail that seem affected. The skin over                the spine of these cats may ripple during an episode.
The                Solution: aggressive cat bite scratch behavior                aggression
When arthritis is the cause of aggressive behavior I often try the                cat on aspirin therapy at 4-8mg/pound. Unfortunately I have found                that less than half the cats can tolerate aspirin even when it is                only given every second or third day. Cats do handle chondrotin                and glucosamine anti-arthritis supplements well and in a few cases                these drugs are effective. We do not know why cats develop ghost                pains but they often disappear when the cat is placed on birth control                medications such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depopovera). Some                of these cases may be a form of epilepsy. When I suspect this I                place them on a trial dosage of phenobarbital, a drug used to control                epilepsy. Still other cases turn out to have the “dry” form of feline infectious peritonitis, a chronic and terminal disease                caused by a coronavirus. I have heard that cats with severe dental                disease can show personality changes but I have never encountered                this phenomenon.
Non-Recognition                Aggression
The                Problem:
Occasionally in multi-cat households removing a cat for a period                of time leads to aggression on the part of cats that remained in                the household. The cats at issue are often returning from the veterinarian,                groomer or boarding cattery with strange odors still lingering on                them. With out the “right” odor the other cats do not                recognize these cats as the same animal that left. If the cats get                into a fight their relationships can take a long time to repair.scratch                behavior
If you do take your cats to the groomer or veterinarian take them                all along for the ride in separate kennels. Place the kennels side                by side until late in the evening before releasing the cats and                try to release them in a neutral area that the cats rarely frequent.                Feeding each cat a pungent canned treat before releasing him or                her also helps. Some of my clients mist feline pheromone spray into                the air these situations.
Your-Time-To-Pet-Me-Is-Up,                Biting
The                Problem:
Cats that seem immensely pleased by your petting only to suddenly                whirl around and bite you have always perplexed me. These cats purr                up to the moment they attack. Some say that this is due to the cat’s                short attention span. That there is a fine line between what is                pleasurable and what is annoying. Others think these displays occur                when a sensitive area on the body has been touched. Some cats will                beg for attention only to sink their teeth into you a few minutes                later.
The                Solution:
Release your cat at the first sign it has had enough petting. Some                signs that you are approaching the limits of the cat’s tolerance                are restlessness, tail twitching, flattened ears, twitching ears                and a tendency to move its head toward your hand. One can attempt                to deprogram these cats by feeding them a tasty treat just before you think they might attack. But I have found no solution for the                Dr. Jekel and Mr. Hyde cats whose tempers turn on a dime. I just                accept their idiosyncrasies and sterilize the cuts and scratches                with iodine and alcohol.
Dominance-based Aggression
The                Problem:
A few cats treat owners like another cat in the household and attempt                to dominate them in a peck order or hierarchy. These cats may growl                or hiss when you join them on the bed or attempt to move them. Some                will block doorways and show the typical signs of aggression such                as tail switching, dilated pupils, flattened ears, and hissing and                spitting. Signs of aggression between cats are often subtle. Some                owners misread the maneuvers of these cats as simple play. Cats                that are not dominant in these situations often loose their potty                training and look unkempt. Generally dominant cats are cats that                are highly territorial as well. Cats do not reach social maturity                until they are about two years old so sometimes this problem can                be late in occurring.
The                Solution:
The best way to handle these cats is to withhold love, attention                and treats until the cat is mellow and relaxed. Relaxed cats carry                their tails and head high. They stand high on their paws with small                eye pupils and a portion of the third eyelid showing. Punishment                only makes the problem worse. The use of pheromone mist around the                house can be very helpful as can food treats given at just the right                moment.
Maternal Aggression
The                Problem:
All mother cats are very protective of their kittens and may react                violently if they perceive a threat to the kittens. Some queens                react by moving their kittens around restlessly when they perceive                a threat. Others may attack people, other cats and dogs that they                normally trust or ignore.
The                Solution:
Disturb cats with young kittens as little as possible. Aggressive                behavior will subside as the kittens grow older. Let your cat give                birth in a low-stress environment without foot traffic or the presence                of other cats. If you must handle nursing mothers put a little tuna                juice on your hand first. Better yet, spay your cats.
Instinctive                Hunting Behavior
The                Problem:
First off, shame on you for letting your cat outdoors unsupervised.                Cats have a normal urge to kill small prey, be it wild birds and                rodents or the pet canary. It is unrealistic to expect them to change.                A cat on the prowl looks like a miniature tiger stalking its prey.
The                Solution:
Keeping your cat indoors solves most of these problems. If you have                indoor pocket pets be sure they are out of reach of your cat. Never                assume that because your cat usually shows fondness for a small                animal or bird that it will not one day treat it like prey.
Medications                For Aggression
When                you can anticipate short periods of stress in your cats diazepam                (Valium) is a very useful medication. I generally give an average                size cat 2.5mg. With time, cats become resistant to the effect of                diazepam so it is only useful for periods of a few weeks. Acepromazine                tranquilizers also work well.
I                have found that the antihistamine, cyproheptadine (Periactin) has                a prozac-like effect in cats. I give an average sized cat 2mg a                day. This drug can be given for long periods of time with no apparent                side effects.
Cats that are truly emotionally dysfunctional might benefit from                amytriptyline (Elavil 5-10mg/cat/day) or fluoxetine (Prozac 0.5-4.0mg/day).                I have not put enough cats on these medications to give you first                hand experience with these drugs.
