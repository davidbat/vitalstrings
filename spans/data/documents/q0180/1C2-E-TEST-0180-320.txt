ALL Of my Dogs are AKC reg, I do not register them any other way. My males DNA is on file. AKC is the Only Register that counts in the USA. UKC would be next. I will sometimes dual reg a dog so I can Show them at a UKC Dog show.
I Do Not and will not cross breed my dogs to another Breed for designer breeds so please dont ask.  Visit AKC @ WWW.AKC.Org
