What a beauty!
This has got to be one of the prettiest cats I’ve ever seen.
It’s called an Ocicat and is a large, athletic, exclusively spotted breed with a solid, long-legged body that is strong and muscular.
When fully grown, a female can weigh up to 12 lb (5.5kg) and a male up to 15 lb (7kg). Their legs are long and the hindquarters should be just slightly tapered and have a dark tip. The head looks a little like a wedge that has a broad muzzle and strong chin. Their beautiful almond shaped eyes are angled slightly upwards towards the ears and the ears are large and wide at the base and curved at the tips.
The Ocicat has a smooth and glossy coat that is tight, and sleek. Although the coat is short, it is long enough to show the bands of colour which are the hallmark of the breed.
There are several colour combinations; chestnut brown or light chocolate spots on a cream background, blue with slate blue spots, golden with cinnamon spots, bronze with tarnished gold spots, lavender with darker lavender spots and silver with black spots.
As for temperament, the Ocicat is intelligent and playful with a very sociable and gentle nature. They like to play retrieving games, will walk happily on a leash and respond well to training.
You’ll need a house with a garden or yard as outdoor play is essential since the Ocicat is a large cat.
Grooming is fairly simple, requiring only an occasional brushing.
