Why do cats knead?
When your cat kneads you with its paws ... it is reliving happy kittenhood              memories.
Newborns and very young kittens use the kneading motion while nursing.              This massaging movement has a purpose - it encourages the mother's              milk to flow to the kittens.
This cat behavior is an expression of pure contentment.
When your grown up cat is kneading, it is once again a relaxed                baby cat.
And although you have no fur or tail, you do care for and feed                  your cat, your lap is warm ... and for the moment, you'll do nicely                  as a much loved, substitute mother cat.
Cats happily purr when they knead. If your cat is drooling his mouth              is simply watering, as it did as a kitten when hungry and ready to              nurse ... and just as we sometimes do, when we smell a good meal cooking.
A prickly problem does arise if your cat chooses to knead              on you. Although unintentional on your cat's part, it hurts when a              cat is digging its claws into you. Extending the claws occurs naturally              when kneading. I have noticed one of my cats make an effort to keep              his claws tucked into his paws ... without much success.
Your cat means you no harm, but rather is paying you the highest              of compliments by allowing you to be the soft spot where              it kneads its paws. You can protect yourself by simply putting a pillow              or thick blanket between you and your cat.
That way you'll both be happy cats.
