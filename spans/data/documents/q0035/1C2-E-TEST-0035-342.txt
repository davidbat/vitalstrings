The Actorsâ€™ Group (TAG) was the first co-operative agency outside London. For over thirty years, it has represented actors working in theatre, television, film, radio and commercials.
In the last year, TAG actors have worked for theatres including The West Yorkshire Playhouse, Harrogate Theatre, Oldham Coliseum and Theatre by the Lake, as well as for regional and national touring companies. Our actors can be seen regularly on the BBC, ITV and Channel Four, and are often to be heard on the radio. We also represent actors for corporate and role play work.
TAG are members of the Co-operative Personal Management Association which was founded in 2002, working to further and promote the interests of its members, who are acting agencies located across the UK.
