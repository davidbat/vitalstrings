The Artist is a true work of art, according to the 69th annual Golden Globe nominations. The silent film helmed by Michel Hazanavicius has nabbed six nominations this year, leading a distinguished pack that also includes The Descendants and The Help, which both picked up five nominees. (The Ides of March and Midnight in Paris rounds out the top five nominees with four nods each.) It’s also a banner year for Clooney, who not only saw his film The Descendants get nominated for Best Drama, but picked up Best Actor (The Descendants), Best Director (The Ides of March), and Best Screenplay (The Ides of March) nominations as well. Who else is nominated this year? (Or, we should say, who else will be subject to host Ricky Gervais’ jabs this year?) See the full list of nominees here, and see who picks up the trophy at the ceremony Jan. 15! (Be sure to also check out EW’s Pre-Oscars Scorecard to see which films lead the awards season race!)
