Name: Steven Culver of Salisbury
What type of art do you create?
Acting.
Describe your work:
Actually, this will be my first time on stage since 1980. I did several shows in the late 1970s in high school, with the Possum Point Players and at Salisbury State.
When did you start making your art?
In 1974, I was in the eighth grade and played Noah Claypole in Laurel Senior High School's production of "Oliver!"
What inspires you?
I love Broadway musicals.  I especially enjoy the work of Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
What are the challenges of creating your art?
Having not done a show in more than 30 years, I was worried about remembering lines, but so far, so good.
Do you make a living through your art?
No. It is just for fun.
Do you have a job outside of your art?
Yes. I'm an accountant in the payroll department of Peninsula Regional Medical Center.
Who is your favorite artist?
There are so many people that I admire, it's difficult to pick just one. I like Angela Lansbury, Elaine Paige, Michael Ball, John Barrowman.
Where in the community can your work be seen?
I'll be played Vinnie in the Community Players of Salisbury's production of "The Odd Couple," June 14-16 and 21-23.
What do you think the Eastern Shore can do to improve its arts scene?
The Broadway in Salisbury program is great, but the touring shows that can come here are limited due to the lack of a real stage to perform on. It would be nice to have a theater that could house the more elaborate productions.
