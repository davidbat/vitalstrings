Welcome to the homepage of Global Artists.
Global Artists is a leading personal management company for professional Actors and Creatives working worldwide in the Entertainment Industry. These mediums include Theatre, Musical Theatre, Film and Television.
Within this site, you will be able to view Actors' photographs and credits, listen to audio clips, send fan mail, visit related sites, raise enquiries, find Actors by country using the 'Global Search' map, enquire about job opportunities within Global Artists, read up to the minute news bulletins and, for Actors and Creatives seeking representation, upload CVs and Photographs.
Global Artists represents two separate client lists, one for Theatre, Film and Television and one for Musical Theatre. The website provides clear information on a  list of Artists working in long term contracts, but does not provide an exhaustive list of our clients working in Repertory Theatre, Film and Television. This is due to the fast turnover of short term contracts within those mediums which require high levels of data entry.
We hope you find your visit both enjoyable and informative.
