CONTACT
inimitable is the Bristol-based agency representing a select group of actors, voice artists and presenters for  film, television, theatre and some commercial & corporate work, in the UK and worldwide.
the inimitables are highly skilled, experienced & superb to work with - inimitable spends time getting to know its clients and developing & managing their careers.
ACTORS and PRESENTERS
inimitable's actors and presenters tend to have links to the south west or west midlands - but all have bases in London for work in the capital.
inimitable expanded swiftly to represent actors and presenters, but remains true to its roots as a voice agency - so the inimitables all have exceptional skills in bringing words to life (be it on screen, stage or in the studio).
and it's inimitable's ethos that for much acting and voice work, it's better to use natural accents and tones.
the inimitables either attend recording sessions at professional studios under client direction - or inimitable productions directs and produces the audio recordings in-house.
