Tall Aussie Actor, Conan Stevens - "World's Biggest Action Hero"
Since I was 16 years old I have wanted to become an Action Movie Star . I joined the Army, I did Karate, some Freestyle Fighting, medieval fighting , and Pro-Wrestling to learn to fight both real and staged combat. I put on 78kg (171lbs) of muscle , danced with a national Ballet and wrote andÂ  co-starred in my own successful cinema release action/comedy movie. Besides a 7 year diversion due to a debilitating nerve injury and a few judicial / military coup delays, everything I have done has had this end goal in mind though I didn't know how to get there.
This website is a weekly chronicle of the struggles and experiences I have had from being a small time actor in Australia, my move into the more active Asian movie scene and my hopes to make a final breakthrough into the 'A' grade US International market - now achieved ( Game of Thrones )( Spartacus )( The Hobbit )  - and then onto starring in my own movies - and of course finally (after over 20 years) getting paid appropriately.
On top of all that I personally made this website and I write all the content to market myself Internationally , grow a grass roots fan base, to provide an income to help me survive between jobs and to help others follow their dreams by detailing how I went about it - completely ignoring the standard advice doled out in heaps by average achievers who live lives they dislike at best .
The website is now huge with more than 1000 pages of useful information on acting , fitness, muscle gain and living successfully - stay and have a look around if you enjoy the site BOOKMARK me and come back later.
Remember if I can make sky high childhood day dreams come true then you can too .
