As if you didn't have enough James Franco news this week , let's drop his name a few more times, shall we? The ubiquitous actor-director-novelist-host and mentor to super-intelligent apes is in negotiations to star in 'The Game,' MGM's adaptation of the best-selling book about picking up women. Franco would star as Mystery, the man who taught author Neil Strauss how to become a successful pick-up artist. The real-life Mystery went on to star in a VH1 reality series called 'The Pick-Up Artist,' which, given Franco's love of all things meta (he's playing himself in 'The Apocalypse' and taught a class on himself ), we wouldn't rule out as his next career move.
Brian Koppelman and David Levien will write and direct the film and Chris and Paul Weitz are attached to produce.
