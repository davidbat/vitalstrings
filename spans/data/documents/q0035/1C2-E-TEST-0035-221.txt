Case Study: Actor and Performing Artist Websites
An actor has two goals with a website; one goal is to interface with an existing fan base while another goal is to seek      new bookings and assignments. These goals at first glance appear      incompatible but can be integrated. The fans often want to know the      same information that producers and casting directors want to know; previous      movies, shows and commercials done, physical statistics and of course      lots of head shots and video clips.
Using a theme of XinJiang grasslands, we produced a light      and playful design. Of note are the butterflies with realistic 3D motion.      They can interact with the user and will run away from the cursor should      the reader need to shoo them away.
The all-important photo gallery was nicely combined with      a video gallery in one attractive interface. Displaying the images via      flash also helps reduce image theft as the right-click save option is      unavailable. Image zoom and pan allows hi-resolution photos to be used      without taking up a lot of screen space. The slide show starts automatically      and adjusts speed to accommodate slow internet connections. The viewer      can watch the show or directly select images and videos to view.
