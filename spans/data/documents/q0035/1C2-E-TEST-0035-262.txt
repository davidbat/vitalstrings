History of Hollywood Make Up I
History of Hollywood Make up
You will almost certainly have been struck                                         by the way Hollywood actresses are made                                         up, and with good reason, because it certainly                                         makes them glow.
It all began when make up artists first                                         entered the scene many years ago. Initially,                                         cosmetics were scarce, and actors would                                         spend hours and hours before they were finally                                         made up. If you’d like to know what                                         the first make up brands were, and the top makeup artists of the day, or Greta Garbo’s                                         make up tricks, among others, read this                                         article carefully as we retrace the history                                         of Hollywood make up.
The makeup artist’s craft began                                         to be increasingly recognised in the 1930s.                                         It’s important to note that makeup                                         artists were not highly considered from                                         the outset, because most of them were out-of-work                                         actors who took make up as a second option.                                         This becomes easier to understand if we                                         bear in mind that actors (be they theatre,                                         or early-movie actors) had to be able to                                         make themselves up.
Nevertheless, by the end of the silent                                         era, studios were beginning to hire people                                         to be specifically responsible for make                                         up, and this was the birth of the make up                                         artist. And characterisation was all the                                         more important in classic Hollywood where                                         little was known about make up (makeup artists were hired for movies only from the ‘30s)                                         and where products were scarce. But the                                         early days of this new profession were no                                         bed of roses, far from it –and neither                                         was it so for those unfortunate actors who                                         had to bear the agony of spending four hours                                         sat in a barber’s seat -.
This is how ever more make up artists began                                         to appear, in the steps of the Westmores                                         and Max Factor. The pioneers were: Cecil                                         Holland, Lon Chaney and George Westmore.
Cecil Holland, whose name until quite recently                                         was utterly unknown, was not only known                                         in his day as “The father of the make                                         up profession”, but also was credited                                         with being the first “Man of a Thousand                                         faces”, and with having handed this                                         title over to Chaney. Two of his most outstanding                                         creations were the ones he produced for                                         Bull Montana in THE LOST WORLD (1925) and for Boris Karloff in THE MASK OF FU MANCHU                                         (1932).
The Westmore dynasty were pioneers and                                         among the most important in Hollywood’s                                         make up scene during the silent era, when                                         George Westmore, a Jewish Cockney, set up                                         the first make up department in the history                                         of cinema, at the Selig Studios. Probably                                         some eighty percent of all movies made in                                         Hollywood in between 1930 and 1950, had                                         Westmore’s name among the credits.
Jack Dawn, for example, managed MGM’s                                         make up department for four years. His team                                         had good facilities, adjustable barber seats,                                         many mirrors and adequate illumination,                                         and demanded that it’s employees be                                         treated as artists, not technicians, despite                                         their craft being an extremely tough one.
William Tuttle started out as a Fox apprentice,                                         working under Dawn. Thus, he started out                                         sweeping and scrubbing floors, as Dawn was                                         a cleanliness freak. He typed, wrote reports,                                         ran errands and answered the telephone. “I would prepare all his make up,                                         all the colours, and that’s how I                                         got familiar with what make up the actors                                         wore. There was no established system for                                         young people to learn the trade. You’d                                         enter it bit by bit. No apprenticeship period                                         was agreed on; you just began when they                                         thought you were competent”, Tuttle                                         remembers. One day Dawn looked at the sketches                                         that Tuttle had made for Fox, and that was                                         when he thought he would make a good makeup                                         artist. He began by letting him help out                                         on tests. One day, the person in charge                                         of make up on THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (1935)                                         didn’t show up, and they sent Tuttle                                         on as a substitute until they could hire                                         someone else. He himself ended up taking                                         charge of work n that picture. When Jack                                         Dawn moved to Metro in 1934, he took Tuttle                                         with him.
Jack Pierce and Maurice Seiderman were                                         two famous makeup artists who worked during                                         the ‘30s, and thanks to whom the movie                                         market was revolutionised. Both sttudied                                         human anatomy in an effort to make their                                         characterisations more realistic. Pierce                                         was behind Boris Karloff’s transformation                                         in Frankenstein and Bela Lugosi’s                                         in Drácula. Pierce continued to work                                         on characterisation in all the films made                                         around the Frankenstein story that followed                                         the first version, such as: THE BRIDE OF                                         FRANKENSTEIN (1935), SON OF FRANKENSTEIN                                         (1939), THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942);                                         FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN (1943);                                         HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1945), etc. But he                                         also had the chance to show his creativity                                         by creating other monsters that have appeared                                         in the history of the terror-movie genre.                                         From the title character in THE MUMMY (1932),                                         to the one in WEREWOLF OF LONDON, etc. Seiderman,                                         for his part, was able to perfect the human                                         ageing process to such an extent that he                                         created 37 different “faces” for Orson Welles in Citizen Kane. The actress                                         Jane Wyatt was frankly overwhelmed upon                                         entering Universal’s make up dept.                                         for the first time.
Now let’s go over actresses’ make up, decade by decade; what was being                                         worn, and the new products...
