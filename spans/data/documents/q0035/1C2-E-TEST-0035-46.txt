well, no suprises here that the artist took it all away and brad pitt didn’t… snicker… i bet somebody told meryl that she’d win again which explains the colour of her dress. what idg was angelina tonight. yes the dress was pretty but girlfriend is so tacky she wore it again with the wrong shoes, no jewelry, and bedroom hair. i guess she must hate stylists. and she looked like she lost extra weight for this event. ed to the core, i used to defend her on this very site saying she isn’t trying to lose more weight but modelling in your youth can really warp the way you’re thinking. i bet she thinks those arms look great. and what was up with the leg exhibitionism? the only point of wearing a deep cut skirt is the excitement it brings to randomly see the leg while you’re walking around as usual. it’s tacky to bring out your leg like that, no subtlety at all. i can’t believe she’s hollywood royalty and acts like megan fox the trailer queene. anyway and she seemed more sad than brad pitt when he lost. i don’t think pitt believed he’d really win with that cheezy movie or maybe he got word his chances weren’t high. well now that this is over maybe this caricature brad with the gross hair and glasses will go away and maybe they will stop acting like their arranged relationship hasn’t drifted apart since a while.
