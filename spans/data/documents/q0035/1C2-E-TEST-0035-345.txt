Martin Dingle-Wall - Actor, Writer, Artist
COPS - LAC
WELCOME
This space is dedicated to my work, pursuits, beliefs and philosophies. 
As an Actor I have been lucky enough to be involved in some of Australia's favourite drama's including  HOME & AWAY (Flynn Saunders), SATISFACTION (Johnny Lake), UNDERBELLY (Les Kane), RESCUE Special Ops (Jake Hudson) and starring in COPS L.A.C. (Rhys Llewellyn) with U.S. success being enjoyed by my two recent Feature Film leads THE NOTHING MEN ('Official Selection' - SANTA BARBARA INTERNATIONAL Film Festival) & THE MAKEOVER ('Best Comedy' - NEW YORK CITY Film Festival).
Our company ALCHEMY Film Productions , in association with our U.S. partners, commences production on our next Feature Film DESCENDANCE this year, making this an exciting time for the many people this story will impact.
I would like to thank the audience members both at home and abroad that have been so supportive of my career with your time and energy by writing, blogging, or via whatever means you do. You are consistently generous and it means more than you may realize, so please accept my thanks and I do hope you enjoy my next offering.
Marty,
