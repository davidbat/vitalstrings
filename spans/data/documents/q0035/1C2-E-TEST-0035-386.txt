Bronze Edition 25
Ed Natiya
This is one of my newest pieces that I created during this past year!  Currently, It’s being cast into Bronze and should be completed by March 2011.  This version is the study size measuring 30″ tall.  This summer I will be starting a monument version of this dramatic piece.  It’s a very uplifting piece, one that I hope reminds all of us to never give up.  Gazing off the edge of life can be a fearful thing, but only those who confront their fears and  strive to reach beyond them will find something greater. I hope you will all take a “Leap of Faith” to see where your dreams will take you!  Happy creating, and Happy living!
