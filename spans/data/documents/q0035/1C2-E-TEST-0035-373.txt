RMK:  1st for Animation
Animated projects  generally require the talents of top actors to pull off the varied requirements involved.  So approximately 10 years ago, RMK expanded its roster to include the very best voice actors available.  The success that we have since achieved in the Animation sector and the quality of animated programs featuring RMK artists is testament to the fact that we’ve managed to attract the top performers in this genre.
These talented artists and projects include:
– Marcello Fabrizi and Rachel King , who voiced characters on the Emmy Award winning series,  “I’ve got a Rocket”.
– Stephen Shanahan , Lisa Bailey , Nikos Andronicos , Nick O’Rourke , Stephen Hunter and the aforementioned Rachel King all voiced lead roles in the series ‘CJ the DJ’ which picked up an AWGIE award from the Australian Writers Guild.
– Steven Shanahan is also currently recording his third series of ‘Bananas in Pyjamas’ alongside RMK animation and character voice virtuoso Troy Planet .
– Cecelia Ramsdale and Jacquie Brennan are now voicing their second animated series for Moody St Kids.  Having already completed over 50 episodes for ‘Flea Bag’, they are now engaged in voicing over 100 episodes of the new series ‘Shezow’.
– Shane Withington performs a multitude of characters in ‘Milly Molly’, a series which is produced by Pacific and Beyond.
Other RMK animation specialists include Jim Pike , Natalie Bond , Matty Morris , Damian Nicholas , Paige Walker , Markus Hamilton , Steven Burton and Ric Herbert , all who have worked on many animated projects for companies such as Southern Star, Kapow, Flying Bark, SLR Productions, ISH Media and Pacific and Beyond amongst others.
