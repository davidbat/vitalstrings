The cast for the second season of FX’s American Horror Story seems to get more impressive as development continues. The latest actor to join the fold is James Cromwell, who appeared in last year’s The Artist.

Deadline first reported that the Oscar-nominated actor is in negotiations to join the cast of the anthology series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The news was also confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter .
Season two of American Horror Story will star none of the lead cast from the first season and will have nothing to do with the story. Season two is set at an East Coast institution for the criminally insane. Oscar-winner Jessica Lange, who did appear in season one as a different character, will play the head of the institution. Cromwell will play Dr. Arden, who works under Lange’s character.
Last month , Big Love’s Chloe Sevingny joined the cast to play Shelly the Nymphomaniac. Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine will also star and Zachary Quinto , who appeared in season one, will also return as a new character.  Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe will also return.
Cromwell was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar for 1996’s Babe. He has also been nominated for an Emmy for guest roles on ER and Six Feet Under. He was also nominated for an Emmy for his supporting role in HBO’s RKO 281. His other credits include W., Secretariat and I, Robot.
