View Professional San Diego Actors For Hire!
Who is the Actor's Alliance?
We are a unique organization that has been serving San Diego Actors for over 20 years.  Without a doubt "theatre" is a truly collaborative art form -- one that involves a variety of creative artists, all of whom are important to the final product.  However, it remains true that there would be no final product without the Actors who bare their souls to tell the story.  Unfortunately it is often the Actors who have the smallest voice and feel the least "empowered".  That is why it has been our mission to serve, educate and promote the individual theatre artist.
Benefits of becoming an AASD member include:
• Access to the most recent auditions, arts jobs, classes, workshops & events
