About DramaWiki
The purpose of this site is to provide English readers a reference repository for Asian television entertainment that use the following Eastern Asian languages: Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Japanese and Korean. TV dramas, artists, singers, directors and screenwriters related to Eastern Asian language TV drama series are included.  Everyone is welcome to contribute here and add any information they may know about certain dramas or artists.  You will need to PM Ruroshin at the D-Addicts forum for an account before you can begin editing.  If you are new to the ways of Wiki , you may want to look at the Help page first.
Don't be afraid about layout or formatting. Information is the important factor for this site; other more experienced users can always clean up the format of a page for you.  You can also help out by expanding on existing stub pages.
The only restriction is that all content must relate to live Asian TV drama series that have Eastern Asian influences. This includes production or artists who appear in a live Asian TV drama series.
Please only contribute information, data and facts.  Discussions should only be about the editing aspects of an article. General discussions on a series story/plot or artists can be done in the parent D-Addicts forums .
