A part-time porn actor and his prostitute girlfriend are in custody, accused of the murder of a tattoo parlor owner who was brutally killed in his Florida home two months ago, the Tampa Tribune reported Friday.
Bisexual DJ Jason Richard Andrews, 27 -- who is also a “gay-for-pay” porn actor -- was arrested Thursday in Tennessee for the murder of Dennis “Scooter” Abrahamsen.
Andrews' girlfriend, Amanda Logue, 28, has also been charged in Abrahamsen’s murder.
The two met while on the set of a porn video in late 2009 and began a relationship in spite of the fact that Logue was married.

'Gay for pay' porn actor DJ Jason Richard Andrews.
According to police, Abrahamsen was found face down on a massage table in his home on May 16. His head had been bashed in, possibly with a sledgehammer, and he had been stabbed in the back.
Logue had been hired, according to police, to participate in a sex party at Abrahamsen’s Tampa home the previous night.
The two exchanged text messages, retrieved from Andrews’ blackberry by investigators, that implicated them in the crime.
"I'm so glad you're really committed to this take. Keep eyes for a knife, etc for me!" investigators said Andrews wrote.
Logue said she wanted to have sex "after we kill him," investigators said. Another text to Logue instructed her to get Abrahamsen “relaxed and face down.”
Detectives said $6,000, a laptop, a video camera, a digital camera and a Home Depot credit card were missing from Abrahamsen’s home.
