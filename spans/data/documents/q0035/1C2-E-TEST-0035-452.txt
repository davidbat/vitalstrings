Amitabh Bachchan was super impressed by Gangs of Wasseypur which released last Friday. Ever since the actor watched the film, his blog has been flooding with its reviews and strongly recomends the film to each and everyone.
On Friday, the film ran houseful in most parts.
“Quite undoubtedly the moment of the day has been the film ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ (GOW), which I have had the great privilege to see. Indian Cinema at its best, honest, stark and as painfully real as possible.
“For one that has been born and lived a major portion of his life in almost similar environment, or at least exposed to it to some degree, I found so much that I could well relate to. And that has led to the authenticity…,” Big B wrote on his blog.
“Anurag Kashyap has not done any fancy shot taking and allowed the visuals to flow as they would, were one to be living those circumstances in real time,” he wrote.
The film has stellar performances by Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadha and Piyush Mishra.
Praising Manoj Bajpayee, the 69-year-old wrote, “Manoj Bajpayee in particular, and of all the artists right down to the smallest in capacity and presence, has been beautifully done. No one looked or performed out of place. They just did enough and that was effective enough.”
“Importantly though, the film GOW touched and expanded on a topic that apart from the blood and gore and the violence educated us on a social issue which most of us may never have heard of. The disparities yes, on more social and moral levels, but also on a factor that concerns religion and the evil that exists within most of the polity even now about it.
“In all a glorious film and one that I would recommend strongly,” he wrote.
