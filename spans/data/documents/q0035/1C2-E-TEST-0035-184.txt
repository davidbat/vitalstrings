There are three essential unions for professional actors.  Actors’ Equity Association (AEA), Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA).  All three unions have a one-time initiation fee, plus annual dues, which are calculated based on your earnings under that union’s jurisdiction.  When you join the union you are no longer allowed to take a non-union role, so when you are just starting out it is usually wise to remain non-union for a while to gain experience by doing non-union roles.
Check List To Consider When Joining A Union
The three main unions for professional actors are: Actors Equity Association (AEA), Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA).
It is not a unions responsibility to find you a job or keep you in a job once you have found one.  Just because an actor is a member of a union does not mean he or she is any more talented, experienced or qualified to work than you or any other actor.
Some conventional wisdom about joining unions for a new actor is this: your goal should be to generate opportunities to build your resume and to develop talent and skills.  This is what the vast majority of non-union work opportunities will help you to do.  However, if you sign on with a union before taking advantage of these opportunities, they will be lost.
The goals of the union are to establish minimums for actors: minimums for work, minimums for residuals, minimums for conditions on a set and minimums for dues that a member will pay.
A major benefit of union membership is access to agents and casting directors through guild-sponsored seminars and showcases.
A phone call to the membership departments or a visit to the web sites of the unions will get you membership information with all the details about how to join and the benefits you get through joining the particular union.

Working in summer stock or at a dinner theater is a professional job, even though the theater does not work under union rules or offer union contracts .  But all Broadway theaters, major Off-Broadway productions, and the best known regional theaters, operate according to Actors Equity Association rules, so in order to act in such productions you will have to be a union member.  All studio produced, and most independent feature films, as well as television soap operas, series, and movies, require that you be a member of a different union, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).
The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) has some overlapping responsibilities shared with SAG, but represents a wider range of professionals in various entertainment categories, from newspersons to magicians. SAG is primarily concerned with wages and working conditions of performers working on film.
 
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA)
AFTRA is the easiest of the three performers unions to join, merely requiring you to fill out an application and pay the initiation fee.  The membership includes   actors, announcers, news broadcasters, singers (including royalty artists and background singers), dancers, sportscasters, disc jockeys, talk show hosts and others.  In addition, AFTRA is:
1.  A national labor union affiliated with the AFL-CIO,
2.  AFTRA represents actors and other professional performers in TV, radio, sound recordings, commercials, non-broadcast/industrial programs and interactive programs such as CD-ROMS.
