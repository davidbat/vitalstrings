The company was founded in January 2000 and rapidly established a strong client base and an excellent international reputation. Artists are provided with the best possible national and international opportunities to further their careers.
Over the last five years, a particular focus for the agency has been the consolidation of relationships with US Agents, Managers and Casting Directors.  There are now excellent prospects for clients to exploit the US Entertainment Industry.
Operating independently from the acting agency is SBA Voices, a dedicated department specialising in creating work opportunities for our voice artists.
Sue Barnett brings to the company 20 years experience at principal agencies in Australia and the UK.  She is supported by professional and experienced staff.
