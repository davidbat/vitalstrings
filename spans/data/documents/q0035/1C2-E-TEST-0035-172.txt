Here's what parents have to say about YART's Actors Studio:
Karsyn         really enjoyed it and was excited about it!  She said she had a lot         of fun!
Mason         was commenting last night on how your class had helped him with the         read-through, so we both want to thank you VERY much!  He         would not have gotten this part without the experiences you have         provided through OZ and the classes.

Thanks         again for all your help with Samantha's monologues... They did tell her they liked the way the Anne Frank monologue was         put together, and asked if she did it by herself.  Of course, she told them you helped her, which led into another         discussion about her theatre experience with YART and what roles she had         played.    Samantha         thinks the audition went well...**
The         kids talked about class all the way home...very happy and excited.  I truly appreciate what you are doing!
 
 
YART's Actors Studio is a unique opportunity for developing actors to learn the art of characterization and presentation.  Students are presented monologues and scenes, some familiar, some new, and are challenged to delve into the characters they are portraying.  Feedback is given back from their peers along with suggestions from John Greene, YART's Artistic Director.  Since the goal of each session is not a production, we are able to fully explore an eclectic selection of monologues and scenes without the deadlines and stresses of an actual production.  A recital at the end of each session gives the students the opportunity to show their parents what they have learned by performing a monologue or scene of their choice.  By deliberately keeping the classes small, we are able to address the needs of each student to help each one achieve his or her full potential as an actor.
Classes for younger students, currently 8 to 11, are held on Tuesdays from 6:30 to 8:30 pm in building 2000 of Our Redeemer Lutheran Church, 402 Aumond Road, Augusta, GA.
Classes for older students, currently 12 to 15, are held on Thursdays from 7 pm to 9 pm at the above location.
Cost is $240, which includes the $40 registration fee that holds a student's place in a class.
Call 706-210-8915 for more information.
