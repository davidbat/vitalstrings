Hypnosis Helps Character Actors - Reported by Henry Reed Ph.D.
 
Our          readers are probably familiar with the role of hypnosis in mediumship          as well as its use by channelers.
Hypnotic procedures have proven useful          also in uncovering hidden multiple personalities.
Now hypnosis has found          another, perhaps related, use: enabling actors to transform themselves          into the characters they are impersonating.
A          university drama instructor has reported the results of his research exploring          the use of hypnosis to inten­sify “method acting.” Using          a quite specific procedure, he has helped actors express nuances of character          that are outside their usual range of skills, enabling them to leave self          behind and to “become” their characters.
The procedure involves          hypnotic intensification of recognized acting methods first articulated          by Constantin Stanislavsky and refined by his student Michael Chekhov          (nephew of the playwright).
While          under hypnosis, the actor first learns to visualize him- or herself as          an object of contemplation, as if seen in a mirror, through a camera,          or from an X-ray machine. The actor then learns to discover “centers” of energy within his or her being, centers that animate the person’s          actions. (The description thus far may sound like learning to go out of          body and turn and witness one’s aura and psychic centers.) The third          step involves learning to visualize in great detail the character in the          script, to locate the character’s internal cen­ters that animate          the behaviors. The fourth step requires the actor to begin to imitate          the character’s behaviors by moving the character’s centers          to within the actor’s own being. The next step is for the actor to          learn to tell the difference between his or her own centers and those          of the character. Making this discrimination allows the actor to pro­ceed          to the next step: to set aside one’s own energy centers, making a          clean break that allows space for introjecting or “inhaling” the character’s energy centers. This ritual, highly focused through          hypnosis, leads to the final stage: the complete and manifest transformation          into the character.
Each          of these steps required practice to perfect. Once perfected, the actor          could readily enter a self-hypnotic trance and become the character. After          the performance, the actor reversed the process to return to normal functioning.
In          the reported study, actors who used hypnosis and those who did not appeared          in character before the judges, who were drama teachers familiar with          each actor’s typical range of expression, but who did not know the          actors’ con­dition while performing. Judges gave consistently better ratings and higher transformation scores to those who used hypnotic          enhancement techniques. The judges also noted that those actors showed          personality attributes not previously in evidence, thus demonstrating          extraordinary growth in the actor’s range of expression.
