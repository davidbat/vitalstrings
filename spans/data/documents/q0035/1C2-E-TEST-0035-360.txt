Bio
....  ......         ..      ..  .. ........       ..    Alex San DiNero, a multi-talented entertainer, born (Vantharat Tapanya) has balanced an acting career with a musical career.  Nero has worked on feature and independent films, including broadway theatre, musicals, tv shows, and commercials with titles such as Step Up 2, Full Circle, Collide, Auntie Mame, Basement Knokerz, State Farm Insurance, ECOMB (Enviromental Coalition of Miami Beach), Cherry Jem, Delivery Driver, Wachovia, etc.,.  Nero brings a powerful performance in each and every show with his dynamic personality both on and off stage. He lights up the crowd like a firecracker and is unique in his style of work.    Born in a refugee camp in Ubon, Thailand.  His family was brought to the U.S. and landed in Rochester, NY when he was two years old.  Within a few short years, his family migrated themselves to California where they found an incredibly large population of other Lao refugees who settled in San Diego.  His parents left San Diego to find a much lower cost of living in Fresno, CA where he spent his childhood growing up.   He was raised in a very heavy Lao culture with his parents and he being both first generation Lao in the United States.  Nero's loving parents, Aeth Tapanya and Vilayvanh Tapanya are very well known leaders in the Lao Buddhist Community in Fresno, CA and are currently actively involved with all the cultural events at the Lao Wat’s.    Growing up in a very populated Lao community, he learned to speak his native tongue by nature of his association.  However, he attended McLane High School where at that time, was teaching Lao as one of their foreign language classes.  He studied his native language and literature and, unlike many Lao refugees born or raised in America, he still has the ability to read and write in Lao.    After serving seven years on active duty with the Navy from the age of 18, Nero decided to settle in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area where he finished his last tour of duty at the Pentagon.  A decorated Veteran and hero during his tour, he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for his rescue work on the Emergency Team during the attacks of 9-11 on the Pentagon. He was one of the search and rescue workers in the fire and rubble digging out victims and survivors from the terrorist attacks.    Like his parents, Nero was a leader and networking guru while he was serving on active duty.  Involved in club promotions and parties all over the metropolitan area and living in the DC Metropolitan area exposed Nero to a new music culture and genre he had never seen before in Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, and REGGAETON!  He fell in love with the dynamics of its drum sounds and snares (Dembow) and wanted to bring the same passion to his Lao people.  Only…. in his native language.  After talking with several other Lao artists about adapting this Reggaeton genre into Lao, they seemed to be interested only in Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Rock.  So he decided to use his own ideas to bring the world and his Lao people up to speed on a new sound to the Lao urban music culture in America and internationally in which he likes to call..... LAOggaeton!
