Festival Season
WIth all the big music festivals this summer, don't get behind the wheel after a few drinks. And if you are having a big one, don't drive the next morning!
Our message
The RADD message is simple: If you are going to drink, don't drive.
Instead, plan ahead. Organise a designated driver, Pool your money to catch a cab,  stay at a friend's house or catch public transport.
Whatever you do, don’t get behind the wheel after you've had a few and don't let a friend get behind the wheel either.
