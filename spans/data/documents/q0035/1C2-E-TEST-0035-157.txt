In writing about painting I have said, "The more I risk today, the more control I gain tomorrow.  Oswald Chambers said, "When God speaks to you abandon recklessly, and, only then will you hear His voice more clearly." Blending them you get: "The more I risk today on God, the more I will gain of knowing Him tomorrow."
