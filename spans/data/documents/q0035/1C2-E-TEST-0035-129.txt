 TALENT AGENTS
What is a Talent Agent or Talent Agency ?
Representative        are agents , managers and        sometimes entertainment lawyers that work        on 5%-20% commission of your salary. Industry        professionals such as directors, producers and        casting director do not want to talk with the talent        in most cases and would prefer to talk with a legal        official that acts on the talent's behalf.
The        representative job is to submit the talent to casting calls , to book auditions and callsbacks , to        negotiate a contract, and to supply the actor with        all the information and tools that he needs in order        to do a good job.
 
THE AGENT'S JOB:
The role of        the agent is to find work for actors.  Legitimate,        reputable agents will only get paid after an actor        has been paid, and the rate is generally 5% - 10% of        the actor's gross salary.
While it is not necessary to have an agent or acting agency in order to get        work, it would serve you well to find an agent as        soon as possible.  Agents, with their industry        contacts and professional resources, will be able to        get you into auditions and interviews that you        otherwise may not ever hear about.
In addition to their resources and help in getting        you in the door, many agents will also represent you        to casting directors, help you in continually        developing your career, negotiate your contract for        an acting job, as well as protect you and help with        any disputes you may have with a producer.  For        their services, agents will take a percentage of        your gross salary, as well as expect you to be        professional and committed to your career.
Since agents are paid only when you get paid, it is        in their best interest to keep you working.  For        this reason, you should begin your search for an        agent as soon as possible, because it only helps to        have an ally in your search for acting jobs.
Remember, reputable agents never charge any kind of        fees or dues outside of their stated commission        charges.  If an agent tells you otherwise, find        another one. While it is possible to get work        without having an agent, you will find that you get        more opportunities when you have representation.
