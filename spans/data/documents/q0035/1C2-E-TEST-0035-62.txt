After the death of Marion Morrison, known as John Wayne, in 1979, President Jimmy Carter said that Wayne "was bigger than life. In an age of few heroes, he was the genuine article. But he was more than a hero; he was a symbol of many of the qualities that made America great."     The first section of this study concentrates on Wayne's style of work and sphere of action as an actor: The man who works for a living and is concerned with his audience and the constraints of his immediate environment. The second section examines the artist: the man who lives in his art, who disappears into his character as an archetype of human fears and desires. Analyses of films that have made Wayne a hero are presented in the third section. A comprehensive filmography is included. Numerous photographs.
