Personal                                  quote:
"Before I go off and direct a movie I always look at 4 films.                             They tend to be: Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, It's A                              Wonderful                             Life, and The Searchers." 
After                             being denied entrance into traditional film schools,                             Steven Spielberg entered California State University                             in Long Beach to study English. Steven Spielberg’s                             professional movie career began the day that he                             decided to jump off a tour bus at Universal Studios                             Hollywood and wander around the back lots.                             Apparently Spielberg found an abandoned janitors                             closet and turned it into an office..
