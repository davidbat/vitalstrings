Christopher Green
I am a writer and performer. My aim is simply to entertain. If I can make you think, feel or act along the way then so much the better.
I use comedy, theatre, live art, cabaret, and music to make interactive, experiential work from intimate gigs to large scale immersive theatrical happenings. I hope all my work conspires in the unified vision of the transforming power of entertainment to inform, provoke and inspire.
That's enough of that kind of talk. Have a nose around these pages and come hear some silly gags...
