'The Artist': What do the actors say in a silent movie? [video]

How different it must have been for modern-era actors John Goodman, Berenice Bejo and Jean Dujardin to perform in "The Artist," a black-and-white silent film about the dawn of the talkies. Add in the fact that Goodman doesn't speak French and Dujardin speaks only a little English, so sometimes they resorted to "gibberish" on set, the French actor says. Although, occasionally, they'd want to throw in some of the actual words from the title cards so their lip movements would match the words on screen.
In this video clip from the Envelope Screening Series Q&A with Times film critic Kenneth Turan, the cast discusses trying to improvise lines, the language of cinema and being careful not to curse.
