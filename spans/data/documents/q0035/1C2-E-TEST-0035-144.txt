3            Films by Norman Reedus (2006) ...
Three          visually stunning and very different films from the multi-talented filmmaker          / actor / cinematographer / photographer Norman Reedus are featured on          this box set.
THE            RUB - A shocking and grotesque fairy tale about the listnessness of            anonymous sex. The film's disavowal of conventional storytelling techniques            and stunning cinematography harkens back to the work of Wim Wenders            and David Lynch.
I            THOUGHT OF YOU provides a brief glimpse into the head of Miles Davis.            Preoccuppied by troubles at home, Miles drifts into the studio for a            rehearsal. Snapped out of his spell by a young man, Miles tells him            a story about a little boy meeting his grandparents for the first time.            This little vignette is just what Miles needed though, to get his mind            off the world and get back into the groove.
A            FILTHY LITTLE FRUIT is the story of failed comedian who finds himself            caught in an identity crisis. A nightmare within a nightmare within            a nightmare, the film ultimately ends with . . . .well, you'll just            have to watch!
