Davydov, Vladimir (1847 – 1925). In the Maly Theatre in 1922 g.Lish at sunset of his life Davydov came to the Maly Theatre, at the theater, which a student, Ivan Nikolaevich Gorelova (this is the real name of a famous actor) made him such a strong impression that the choice of future career for him was solved yet. Having broken with his family – his father was a soldier, did not think that his name "came on the scene, turned into a bauble, and fluttered on the fence on the dirty bills" – Davydov became a provincial actor (1867-1880 years).. His work is associated mainly with the St. Petersburg Theatre of Alexandria, was familiar to Moscow and the theater Korsch, where Davydov created Miser – Moliere and his famous images of the mayor, Famusov, Rasplyuev, and many latter-day tour. This first-class actor, the essence of his creative method was close to the art of the Maly Theatre. When Petersburgers participated in performances of this troupe, even though it was a juicy, bright and true consumer actor Varlamov, always clearly felt the difference of their "tone" manner of acting, an approach to the role of generally accepted in the Maly Theatre. Davydov was in the basis of their creativity successor of the same school of artistic realism, which is inherent in small theater, so it is well suited to it.

Davydov has always believed that "everything in the actor's art should be strictly and precisely designed. In his tales of the past ", he said:" The inspiration, encouragement give wings actor on stage, temperament makes his images lively and persuasive, but only the preparatory work for the premeditated plan provides an opportunity scenic artist in the creative process, in the eyes of the viewer, to strictly control every gesture, every turn, every sound of voices. " This is essentially a shepkinskie tradition derived by OT Samarin, which Davydov considered his teacher, and enabled him, despite their age, always cause a strong reaction in the auditorium. The inherent susceptibility of him alive, the interest in the surrounding reserve and creative forces were retained until the end of his days.
