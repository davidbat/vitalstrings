Tiny Versions of Famous Actors and Artists
by Jenni Chasteen
It’s hard not to imagine pop culture icons as anything but amazing, but obviously they weren’t always that way. Surely Audrey Hepburn wasn’t the picture of class and poise at age 6. And Andy Warhol was probably just “that weird kid” long before anyone ever thought of him as a genius. But still, when you try to imagine them as children it’s easy to picture little tiny versions of themselves, exactly as they were as adults. The Iconics photo series by Olga Laris was shot for the February 2012 issue of bbmundo magazine and showcases tiny versions of famous actors and artists. From left to right the kids are dressed up to look like Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, Audrey Hepburn, James Dean, Basquiat, and Frida Kahlo.
