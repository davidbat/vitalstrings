Catching Fireflies
Andô Hiroshige (1797-1858) is world                renowned for his masterpieces of graphic art. The album displayed                here provides a glimpse of a private side of the artist's oeuvre                not apparent in his published prints. Here a young woman stands                on a riverbank and waves an uchiwa fan to catch fireflies.                She will keep them in the netted cage on the ground to her left                and enjoy their charms at home. Hiroshige employs a moist brush                together with a light wash and accents in red and yellow to yield                an effective scene, both real and dreamlike in its mood.
Actor prints, considered ephemera at the time, were almost always                created to coincide with performances of a particular kabuki play.                The prints were inexpensive--costing about the same as a bowl of                noodles--and were intended to be sold immediately as souvenirs and                enjoyed briefly. While exploiting the public fascination with kabuki,                Ukiyo-e artists in turn served to promote the actors, who were viewed                as cultural icons, some with a "superstar" status. In some instances                artists were allowed to attend dress rehearsals in order to create                the most up-to-date portrait of an actor in the latest play.
Theatrical prints often focus on actors in a climactic scene in                a play--during a moment of epiphany or extreme emotional turmoil.                The actors are shown in a frozen position, or mie, a dramatic                pose often accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, essential                to kabuki theater tradition.
Rare Actor Print
This print is one of only seven known works,                all portraits of actors, by Kabukidô Enkyô (1749-1803),                the sole follower of the enigmatic Tôshûsai Sharaku                (fl. 1794-1795). Nothing was known of Enkyô until 1926, when                it was discovered that he also used the name "Nakamura Jûsuke                II"; under this name he was known as an author and kabuki actor.                It is likely that the subject here is Nakayama Tomisaburô,                a male actor who played female roles, as identified by an identical                print by Enkyô in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Kabukidô Enkyô.
