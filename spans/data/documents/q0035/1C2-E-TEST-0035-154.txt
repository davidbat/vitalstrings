How do film and television theatrical and commercial talent agencies present actors for clients?
Some agencies use thumbnails which are small version of headshot pictures. A good agency follows up with the clients to present talent resumes and experience as well as the agency's preference based on experience.  Many companies will present their actors website profile but remember, some wonderful agencies may not have their newest talent finds online.
Some sites will have links to free photos. They will present the actor images in internet portfolios. In these websites you will see free galleries of female and male actors. These women and men are represented by that agency and are available for work.
What's the best way to find a legitimate film and television, theatrical and commercial talent agency?
There are many talent agencies in the world. One way to start is to check a talent agency directory.  Legitimate talent agencies will be listed in talent agency directories. Be sure that the talent agencies directory you review has a way to rate the best agencies and to code the top agencies for you to review.  Looking for actors on the net can be a daunting task. Let the experts help you make the right hiring decision.
