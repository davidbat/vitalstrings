With years of hands on experience in printing headshots, promo cards, composite cards, retouching and color correction services, The Actor’s Photo Lab has become an asset for the working actor and model.  We are the only lab that caters to rush orders without any rush charges.  Not only do we provide high quality photo prints, but we also pay close attention to detailed needs of our actor clients.  For example, we print on paper that has no water mark on the back side allowing you to then print your resume with a laser printer.  In addition, we can also offer 8x10 resume papers that are the same size as 8x10 headshots to eliminate the need for trimming.  For more effective marketing solutions, we also have window envelopes for greater exposure of your photos that are submitted.  Ordering 8x10 headshot photo reproductions online has never been easier.  Simply upload your photos with contact information and one of our friendly customer service representatives will contact you via telephone or email to take your order.  We can setup your headshots with border, bleed, or a custom name setup and email you proofs the same day.  We also specialize in retouching to enhance your photos without changing what you look like.  Once you have approved the proof, we will start your reproduction order immediately.  We can prepare your order for pick up at our convenient Studio City location or ship anywhere to the continental United States.  With unsurpassed print quality and customer service and fast turnaround, The Actor’s Photo Lab is your best source for 8x10 headshot reproductions, promo cards, post cards, zed cards, business cards and other modeling and acting industry marketing needs.
