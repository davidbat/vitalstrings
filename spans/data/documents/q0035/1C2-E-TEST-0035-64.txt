French actor Jean Dujardin beat fellow nominees like George Clooney and Brad Pitt to win the Best Actor statuette for his role in the silent, black and white movie “The Artist” at the 84th Academy Awards held at the Hollywood & Highland Center in Los Angeles, California on Sunday (February 26).
2012 Academy Awards: Oscar Winners FULL List
Jean, who sat at the table with his co-star Uggie (the real star of the movie!), a 10 year-old Jack Russell, didn’t have to speak to win this Oscar, which is quite an accomplishment. The 39 year-old was certainly amused by the win as he proclaimed his love for America and added, “If George Valentin could speak, he would say: Merci! Formidable!” Congratulations!
