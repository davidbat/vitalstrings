+ That's it! You people have stood in my way                                      long enough. I'm going to clown college!

+ For whatever reason, God has blessed me                                      with the ability, put me in a position to                                      make these leaps and bounds. I'm fulfilling                                      my part of the bargain, which is to give back                                      and be a positive influence on others. That's                                      all you can do; take what you've been given                                      and spread it around.

+ You know one of the things about going from                                      modeling to acting is it's so much more fulfilling.                                      With modeling, you get your picture taken,                                      which is great, good for you, you know? But                                      in acting, you're able to reach in and show                                      a little bit more of yourself.
