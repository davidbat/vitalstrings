The 2012 Best Actor Oscar race was a tough one to call, with the 84th Academy Awards Best Actor category seemingly a two-horse race between The Descendants ' George Clooney and Jean Dujardin of The Artist .  Which would win? Natalie Portman (last year's Best Actress winner for Black Swan ) had the honor of opening the envelope and revealing the newest Best Actor Oscar winner is...Jean Dujardin.
The very talented and charismatic Jean Dujardin declared, "I love your country!," as he embraced his Oscar.  "Thank you to the Academy. It's funny because in 1929 it wasn't Billy Crystal but Douglas Fairbanks who hosted the first Oscar ceremony. Tickets cost $5 and it lasted 15 minutes. Times have changed. Thank you Douglas Fairbanks. Yes, Melissa, your grandfather's spirit inspired me for this role, and so many of you here tonight have inspired me."
Dujardin also thanked his director, his onscreen partner Berenice Bejo, and the rest of the cast and crew.  He finished up his speech by shouting out his thanks as his The Artist character might have done had he been the one receiving an Oscar.
