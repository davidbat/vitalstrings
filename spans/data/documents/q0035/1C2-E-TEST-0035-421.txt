Actors                     and Others for Animals is a California 501(c)(3) non-profit                     corporation dedicated to the promotion of the humane treatment                     of animals. Our main mission is to curb the pet overpopulation                     problem by subsidizing spay/neuter surgeries. Together with                     other vital services, we are there to help pet guardians                     living on a low and/or fixed income care for their beloved                     companions.
We                     are a community based animal welfare organization serving                     the greater Los Angeles area and surrounding counties. When                     it comes to hands on assistance for animals, we are unable                     to assist pet guardians outside of this region. Please check                     your local listings for other similar organizations in your                 area.
This                           site is dedicated to the cherished memory of
Jeanette Portenier
Her beautiful spirit will                                   be remembered as we continue to help animals                                   in need.
