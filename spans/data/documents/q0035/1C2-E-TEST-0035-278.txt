Some of these Mississippi                    writers are world famous while others are up-and-coming                    authors. All have contributed to the literary and cultural heritage                    of Mississippi. This web site, originally researched by the                    students of Starkville High School in Starkville, Mississippi,                    is now being updated.
In addition, Mississippi has a unique musical heritage. The                    original information researched by the students at Starkville                    High School has been retained but is being updated. Musicians who are native to Mississippi                    or who have spent a significant part of their lives in the                    state of Mississippi are included. Their music may be blues,                    country, classical, gospel,  rock 'n' roll, rhythm and                    blues, rap or popular.
This site now also includes Mississippi                    artists and Mississippi                    actors who are recognized in their respective                    fields.
