TCM Remembers the Actors, Directors, and Other Artists We Lost in 2011

Turner Classic Movies is not only a great TV station, but is also serves as an archivist.  Their moving year-end “Remembers” montages highlight not just the famous faces we lost, but the character actors, cinematographers, writers, and other cinematic artists who didn’t get publication-spanning obituaries at the time of their passing.  TCM has footage of all of almost all of the artists we lost in 2011 and they’ve once again woven a touching tribute.
In 2011, we lost some good ones including Pete Postlethwaite, Peter Falk, Cliff Robertson, Jane Russell, Elizabeth Taylor, Laura Ziskin, and Sidney Lumet.  As far as editing goes, I think the “TCM Remembers 2010″ video is better, but they’re both worth your time so I’ve included both after the jump.
