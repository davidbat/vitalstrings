NativeCelebs on Google+ . Add yourself as a way to find others interested in Native American entertainment. Google+ has just opened for company pages. Right now they're just barebones, but eventually you'll have the option to add more administrators to pages. The main news outlet for NativeCelebs will continue to be Facebook, but we've added the Google+ page already now that we can.

I'll post casting notices here up to several times a week, and remove the old ones. Will post on the NativeCelebs facebook page when I update the page. I usually don't include "any ethnicity" postings. Instructions for casting directors/producers below
New: A facebook group where anyone can post casting notices :
- will probably be more updated than this page, so check it and become a member if you're an actor or need to post a casting notice!
Also check out the document on that group , where I put casting resources as I find them, both regional and general.
Update August 4
