Background Info: One actor playing                  3 characters - middle-aged father, pre-teen son, and middle-aged wife.                  Very funny.
ANNOUNCER: [Appearing before the curtain.] Ladies and gentleman,                    we have been very fortunate in securing for this program a genuine                    imported quick-change artist who will act all the parts of the play                    about to be presented. Incidently, I may also say that the play,                    entitled "THE SON OF HIS FATHER'S WIFE," was written by the artist                    himself. Ladies and gentlemen, I present . . . [Real name of artist.]
SCENE: A room containing a table. Lady's wig on table.
CURTAIN RISES: Artist is standing at Center, dejectedly.
ARTIST: [Bass voice, looking at watch.] Eight-thirty PM, and my                    boy not home yet. My, how times have changed. When I was his age I was never out later than the next day. [Stamps foot.] Ah! I hear                    the front door slamming. It is my boy. [Faces Left.] Ah, Griswold,                    you are home at last. [Runs across to Left, takes hat from beneath                    coat and dons it. Faces Right. High voice.] Yes, father, I am home.                    But, Father, I have a confession to make. I am late because I stopped                    on the way home and robbed the First National Bank. [Runs to Center,                    hides hat beneath coat. Faces Left, bass voice.] What's this, my                    boy? You robbed the First National Bank? How times do change! When                    I was your age I never robbed anything larger than the United States                    mint. Griswold, what will your mother say? [Runs Right, dons hat.                    Faces Right. High voice.] I do not know what Mother will say, Father.                    [Runs Center, hides hat. Faces Left, bass voice.] We must keep it                    from her, my boy. She shall never know. [Runs Left, dons hat. Faces                    Right. High voice.] That's right. [Runs Center, hides hat. Faces                    Left. Bass voice.] Shhh! Your mother is coming now. [Runs Left,                    dons hat. Faces Right. High voice.] Where? [Runs Center, hides hat,                    faces Left. Bass voice.] There. [Points Left. Runs to table, dons                    wig. Dashes Left. Faces Right. Falsetto voice.] Ah, my boy, Griswold,                    is home. Josephus, our boy is a wonderful son, is he not? [Snatches                    off wig, runs Center. Faces Left. Bass voice.] Yes, Annabellizzy,                    Griswold is a son to be proud of. [Runs to table, dons wig. Turns.                    Falsetto voice.] Griswold, tell me. Are you hiding something from                    me? [Sniffs.] I smell mothballs. Griswold, something tells me. It                    must be a mother's intuition. Did you rob the First National Bank?                    [Removes wig. Dons hat. High voice.] Yes, Mother. I could not resist.                    Something seemed to pull me into the bank. Yes, Mother, I did rob                    the First National Bank. [Removes hat. Dons wig. Falsetto voice.]                    Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! My Griswold! You must return what you have stolen                    at once. How much did you take from the bank? [Removes wig. Dons                    hat. High voice.] These mother. [Holds out blotters.] Two blotters                    and a pen point. [Removes hat. Dons wig. Falsetto voice.] Oh! [Faints.]                    NOTE: On the last change he may wear the wig over his hat.
