We are Jim and Tamra Meskimen, actors and artists who perform in films, television and on stage with our improv comedy theater ensemble, The Really Spontaneous Theatre Company .  We are earnest in our dedication to bring enjoyment and life to the world through our comedy and aesthetics.
Jim is an impressionist comedian who provided the voices for the Internet sensations by Jibjab Media, This Land , DC Land , Second Term , Big Box Mart and others.  His impressions have been heard on The Tonight Show, The Boondocks, Pinky and The Brain, and in commercials for Pacificare and the Honda Element.
At this site you can discover what we are up to currently and what we have done in the arts.  Check out our information about our improvised man-on-the-street campaigns, our schedule of live performances, our latest film and TV appearances and even some of our original artwork. You can peruse our past columns of essays about topics we feel strongly about.
