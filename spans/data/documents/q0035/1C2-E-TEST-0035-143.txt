My Actors Theatre is...
Inspired By You!
I could not be more thrilled to have taken the helm of this amazing, nationally distinguished organization and to present to you my inaugural season as artistic director of Actors Theatre of Louisville. As this welcoming community has come together to show its love of the arts to me, I propose to share with you a season encompassing the same. This love, however, comes complete with family feuds, sibling rivalry, trepidation and fear-as all of the greatest love stories do!
Please Join Me for this Exciting Season and Make Actors Theatre Yours!
