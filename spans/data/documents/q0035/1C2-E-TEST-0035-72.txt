'Artist' actor Jean Dujardin: Oscar win took me 'out of my body'
By Randee Dawn
The bad news about winning five Oscars (including Best Picture) is that you just don't get to sleep that night -- the good news is you just don't want to, as the folks behind "The Artist" proved first thing Monday morning on TODAY. Ten members of the international cast and crew of the film all showed up smiling (and still clutching their Academy Awards) for a chat with TODAY's Ann Curry (despite the very early hour in California) and had nothing but happy thoughts to share.
"I was over the moon," said Best Actor recipient Jean Dujardin about his win. "I was ... out of my body. It's a new experience."
Producer Thomas Langmann also said their Best Picture win was "amazing." "Sometimes he (director Michel Hazanavicius) calls me the most stupid producer in the world, but now with this (Oscar) in my hand, I don't feel stupid at all."
Executive producer Harvey Weinstein, whose Weinstein Co. distributes the film, called "The Artist" "the million-to-one movie." He then added that they would be expanding the film's distribution to 2,000 theaters as of Friday.
"It says to every young filmmaker to do what you dream," he said.

And if Weinstein looked even more pleased than the actors, director and producer around him, he had particular reason: His company's film "The King's Speech" also took home the Best Picture Oscar last year, and also distributed "The Iron Lady," which earned Meryl Streep her third Oscar Sunday night.
"I like to choose interesting subjects," he said dryly. "A stuttering king and a black-and-white silent movie. I should have my head analyzed."
