About
Lee Gregory is a gifted singing actor with a beautiful, warm, and ringing baritone voice. He has a wide and varied repertoire, and is quickly becoming known for his ability to embody his characters. The Nashville Scene acclaimed his Mercutio as "performed with a resonant baritone that readily captured his character's arrogance and swagger," and Opera News praised his Mercutio as "... nearly ideal. He is tall and has a sizable voice that nimbly limned the Mab aria, justly applauded. His physicality captured Shakespeare's jokester quite well."

“Gregory excelled as a young, vibrant Nixon, mastering the tricky rhythms of the pop-inspired ‘News’ aria and the extended legato of ‘Fathers and sons, let us join hands,’ singing with consistent tonal beauty.”
