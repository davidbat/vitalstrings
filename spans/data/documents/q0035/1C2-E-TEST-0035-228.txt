The Artist’s Prosperity System  |  Nine Simple Steps to Elevate your Finances to a Work of Art
Artists are unique. Our creative minds work differently, and our relationship to money    should reflect this distinction. Tired of struggling financially, Abundance Bound founder   and actor Miata Edoga developed the Artist’s Prosperity System, a nine-step process that    addresses our community's financial challenges. We now teach the APS to artists through a variety of programs with one common goal: to provide results that afford us the freedom    to pursue our artistic dreams.
Click on the steps to see how it works.
It's broken.
Your choice to pursue your art is noble and inspiring.
Artists have a responsibility to this world. It’s not just about making a buck.
It’s a calling. It’s a craft. It’s a discipline. It’s a point of view. It’s a lifestyle.
Let’s lay it on the line.
Abundance Bound was founded by artists for artists. We’re big fans of folks like us.     And we want to ensure you—we—stay in this game as long as possible and continue to     express those creative urges that will impact the next generation. So much good can     happen in this world because of the creativity and ingenuity you bring to the table.     And so, with love, we really have to say...
It just ain’t gonna happen...
Seriously. If you don’t learn to handle your money—this very real, very significant     portion of your life—you are sabotaging your efforts toward success. You cannot sustain     this pursuit by praying for the next big break. You must get real. Stop being     misrepresented, misunderstood, and miscategorized all over the place, and stop     missing out on lots of other “normal” things, too.
