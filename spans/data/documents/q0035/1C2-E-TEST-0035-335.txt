Actors & Artists Making Connections
public             - created 12/09/03
Pursuing activity in the performing arts can mean two essential actions...network and query.  Receiving information you never knew existed, and asking about what you would like to know more about is part of this process.  The goals of this forum are to pass along useful (and hopefully previously unknown tips and information) to aid your artistic endeavors, to get members of the forum to network, and share valuable know-how.
