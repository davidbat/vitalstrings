The 300-plus lucky ticket-holders at the 2011 New Orleans Film Festival 's opening night screening at the Prytania Theatre on Friday (Oct. 14) weren't the only ones to get a first look at Michel Hazanavicius' crowd-pleasing modern-day silent " The Artist ." So did one of the film's stars.
John Goodman, in 'The Artist.'
Actor and local resident John Goodman attended Friday's local premiere as a special guest of the festival.
Goodman shot the film in fall 2010 but had yet to see it as it made its way around the film-festival circuit ahead of its theatrical release later this year. So there he was Friday, drinking it all in with the rest of the festival-goers, who gave Goodman a sustained round of applause when his name appeared in the opening credits.
In Hazanavicius' black-and-white charmer, about a silent-movie star struggling with the advent of talking pictures, Goodman co-stars as a cigar-chomping movie mogul.
He didn't address the crowd Friday, although he chatted with me about the movie last month in an interview ahead of his receiving of the festival's 2011 Celluloid Hero Award .
"The director, Michel, just had a great love of cinema that's very infectious," Goodman said. "On the script, I had this beautiful script with this storyboard in it and everything. It was just cool."
"The Artist," starring Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, is scheduled to open Nov. 23.
