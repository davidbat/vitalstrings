yup I'm a Fan of them. I even got the Famous Crossovers of them too.  Throught the FREAKING YEARS!!! ( you may Skip if like)
The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful
There have been several crossovers between The Young and the Restless and sister show The Bold and the Beautiful:
    1992
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) was the first major character to cross over to The Bold and the Beautiful. Sheila appeared on The Young and the Restless from 1990-1992 (returning as a guest in 1993, 1994 and 1995), and again in 2005-2006. She was on The Bold and the Beautiful from 1992–1998, with shorter-lived stints in 2002 and 2003.
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Molly Carter (Marilyn Alex) appeared several times after her daughter, Sheila, was revealed to be living in Los Angeles.
    1993
        The Young and the Restless: Eric Forrester (John McCook) called Lauren from his office to invite her to Los Angeles.
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) crossed over to confront Sheila Carter about the photos of his tryst with Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman), fearing that he would lose custody of his daughter, Colleen, if they became public. Although Brad's threats were enough to make Sheila give up the photos, Lauren later discovered that there was still more evidence proving their affair.
        The Young and the Restless: Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery) appeared on The Young and the Restless to inform Lauren of Sheila's marriage to Eric.
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Dr. Scott Grainger (Peter Barton) and Lauren Fenmore were vacationing on Catalina Island where they were shocked to find Eric Forrester and Sheila Carter also on a romantic retreat. The character Scott Grainger died during this crossover, but not before he forgave Sheila for her past and begged Lauren not to reveal their history to Eric.
    1995
        The Young and the Restless: Eric Forrester (John McCook) appears at his office in Los Angeles to inform Sheila that Lauren will be coming to town.
        The Young and the Restless: James Warwick (Ian Buchanan) made a brief crossover when he called Lauren from Sheila's dungeon. Brad Carlton also makes an appearance.
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman) crossed over to The Bold and the Beautiful, where she stayed until 1999, and briefly returned in 2002 and 2004. She had already appeared on the show several times prior to her becoming an actual cast member, mostly due to Sheila's crossover in 1992.
    1998
        The Young and the Restless: Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) crossed over to meet with Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) at his Newman Enterprises office in Genoa City, Wisconsin. In her effort to spice up the deal she's trying to work out, Brooke drops her jacket and reveals that she is wearing very little. Much to Victor's chagrin (and possible enjoyment), Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) and Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) walk in on the scene.
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) crossed over to meet with Eric Forrester (John McCook), Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss), and Thorne Forrester (Winsor Harmon). The Forresters were looking for a new scent to go along with Brooke's Bedroom Line, and thought that Jabot Cosmetics could help.
    1999
        The Bold and the Beautiful: Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) appeared to meet with Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang)...and to make Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) jealous.

Bregman) received an angered phone call from the husband of her employee Jacqueline Payne Marone, who demanded to know if the two had really gone out drinking the night before like he was being told.

In truth, Jacquie had told her husband this to help cover up her one night stand with Deacon Sharpe Sean Kanan.
