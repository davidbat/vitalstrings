Hunk Of The Day: Markki Stroem
_________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________ __________________
Man Central 1 is a non-profit organization resurrected by people who love winners and BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. Because of the little joys that we get from it, we burn our midnight candle and spent hours and hours in research, so we can come up with posts everyday and share the world the beautiful images of pageant candidates and their victories.
The new MAN CENTRAL 1 had made several changes. It is a sequel to what we started in Mancentral. But this time the scope becomes bigger as we feature models from around the world, actors and sports personalities too, men who occupies tv and movie screens, magazine covers, ramps and television commercials, music videos and all.
The new MAN CENTRAL 1 also is more daring and bolder. It will feature models, actors and pageant candidates in various stages of undress ... but we cautioned everybody including our Mancentral readers ... that all images will be done in good taste and to borrow a cliche ... will be done for the sake of art. Anything more than that and Man Central says NO.
Our goal here is to showcase the models and give them a little freedom to show-off ... and feed their ego. Maybe shed a clothes or two ... or expose a little skin here and there. But anything that borders on indecent and inappropriate exposures will not be tolerated. The models are here first to flaunt their bodies ... and secondly to wear beautiful clothes? To the prudes, this site is not for you. So you can switch channels right away ... the moment you see SKIN!
Let's give these models a little slack. And maybe more understanding about their work. By the way thanks to the HUNK OF THE WEEK and his PHOTOGRAPHERS and the people behind them for gracing our welcome pages.
