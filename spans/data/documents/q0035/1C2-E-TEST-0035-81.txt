Golden Globe Awards: Octavia Spencer wins Best Supporting Actress - Drama for 'The Help'
Dujardin, a 39-year-old French actor, beat nominees Brendan Gleeson of "The Guard," Joseph Gordon-Levitt of "50/50," Ryan Gosling of "Crazy, Stupid, Love" and Owen Wilson of "Midnight in Paris." The winners of the 2012 Golden Globes were named at a Los Angeles ceremony on Sunday, January 15.
"When I was starting out .. they said to me, 'You'll never do movies. Your face is too expressive. Too big,'" Dujardin said in his acceptance speech. "It's not my fault. My eyebrows are independent. No seriously, I have always followed my instincts and ... fight for my dreams."
Dujardin began his on-screen career in the late 1990s and aside from "The Artist," has starred only in French productions.
"The Artist" is a silent, black and white film that depicts the lives of a veteran actor named George Valentin, played by Dujardin, and a rising actress named Peppy Miller, portrayed by Bejo, in Hollywood in the late 1920s. Around that time, silent films began to be phased out and were soon replaced by 'talkies,' or movies with dialogue.
James Cromwell plays Valentin's driver, Clifton, while Penelope Ann Miller portrays the silent film actor's wife, Doris. The movie also stars John Goodman as producer Al Zimmer. Another star of the movie is Uggie, a Jack Russell terrier.
