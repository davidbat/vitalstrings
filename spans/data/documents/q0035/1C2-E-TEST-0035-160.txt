Actor Michael Showers, perhaps best known for his work as Captain John Guidry on the HBO series "Treme," was found dead in the Mississippi River early Wednesday morning. He was 45 years old.
According to local New Orleans paper the Times-Picayune , authorities said a steamboat captain spotted a body floating in the water near the French Quarter around 11:15 a.m. on Wednesday. The body was recovered from the river at 11:45 a.m. and has been identified as Showers.
John Gagliano, chief investigator for the Orleans Parish coroner's office, told the paper that Showers, who reportedly lived in the nearby Chalmette area, appeared to have been in the water for two days. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death.
In addition to his role on the Emmy-nominated "Treme," Showers had turns on other television series including "Breaking Bad" and "The Vampire Diaries." He appeared on the big screen as well, with roles in "Traffic," "I Love You Philip Morris" and this year in Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life."
