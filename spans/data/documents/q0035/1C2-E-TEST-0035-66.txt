The Actors Studio Australia
Acting Courses & Workshops (Sydney, Melbourne & Brisbane)
The Actors Studio Australia provides  professional industry-based vocational training courses in acting for stage and  screen. Our acting courses and acting classes are designed for artists seeking  professional careers in film, television and theatre.
The Actors Studio Australia has pioneered a revolutionary  truth-based approach designed to harness the raw power of honest communication,  real emotion and personal life experience to create a vivid sense of personal  truth in performance. Our groundbreaking technique builds on the work of a  collection of the world's most influential acting teachers of the modern era  including Lee Strasberg (The Method), Sanford Meisner (Meisner Technique),  Constantin Stanislavsky and others.
The Actors Studio Australia was established 10 years ago,  initially founded as a place of practice for professional actors seeking to  hone their skills. Today the studio runs up to 12 classes a week offering a  comprehensive, full-length professional training program. The studio has been  built on a strong ethos of providing a "no bullshit" approach to  training, offering a supportive yet challenging environment where excellence  and professionalism are carefully fostered at every stage in the process.
Our focus is on learning and craft. At The Actors' Studio  Australia we work on the underlying process of the actor. We illuminate in  vivid terms the framework of skills and technique concepts essential for the  actor to be aware of, and guide the actor through developing each essential  skill one at a time. Our net goal is to help actors build a genuine process, to  develop an extensive tradesman's knowledge of their craft and to build unique  artists of the highest calibre.
Classes are offered in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.  Our headquarters is in Sydney.
