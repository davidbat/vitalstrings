At the César ceremony, the French equivalent of the Oscars, in Paris on Friday night, the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma awarded The Artist with six of the ten Césars it was nominated for, including Best Actress, Best Picture, and Best Director.
However, Jean Dujardin was shafted for Best Actor in favor of Omar Sy, the star of the feel-good movie, Untouchables. According to Collider , Sy’s Wikipedia page shortly after winning asserted that he won an undeserved best actor award, a comment that was quickly removed.
Previously, according to the Associated Press , Dujardin already won the best actor awards at Cannes, the Golden Globes, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
For the eighth time, Antoine de Caunes presented the 37th annual ceremony. Collide described the ceremony as boring and uninspired.
Other films recognized at the ceremony include Pierre Schöller’s l’Exercice de l’Etat, Sylvain Estibal’s When Pigs Have Wings, Joann Sfar’s Le Chat du rabbin, and Philippe Le Guay’s Les Femmes du 6e étage.
The Académie also nominated Nicolas Winding Refn’s film, Drive, for Best Foreign Film, though it was not nominated for an Oscar.
British actress Kate Winslet took home this year’s honorary César. Michel Gondry, a French filmmaker and the one who directed Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, presented the award to her.
As reported by Collide, after receiving the award, Winslet said, “Michel was my introduction to French cinema.”
