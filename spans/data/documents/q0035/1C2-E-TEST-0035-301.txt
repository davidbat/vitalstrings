Get your 2012-2013 season tickets online now! Damselfly premiers July 20!
Wow! What a great season we've had this year. Please accept our heartfelt thanks to you all for your support in so many different ways. A special production is coming to HART this summer. Although not a part of our regular season, we are proud to introduce Damselfly to theater-goers in the Portland area. This show is written by Kim Sandstrom Hawksey, the founder of our theatre, and addresses many of the events that occurred around that time in her life. Please join us at this fundraising show, which is being co-sponsored by Mothers Against Medical Error (MAME). HART appreciates your support, and this is a great way to enjoy an evening of theatre while knowing that all of the proceeds are benefiting your community theatre!
