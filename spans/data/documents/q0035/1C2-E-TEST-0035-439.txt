From the Animation Podcast website:
Four things that make a reel work, in order of importance:
Believable performance: Not necessarily “realistic” but believable for the style of animation and situation. This is the  part that is hardest to teach. Do your characters show that they are  thinking, making decisions, judgments, choices on their own. Do the  expression, body posture and dialog shapes accurately reflect what is  being said (or what isn’t being said)? Over acting, bad acting,  unbelievable acting, and acting that does not fit the situation – those  are the the biggest turn offs.
Convincing physics: Do you know how to move  characters? Do they have weight? Will I believe they exist in a reality  that has gravity? Do they feel like they are built of flesh and bone and  not just filled with empty space? Are movements motivated by internal  forces – both mental and physical?
Entertainment: Do you have original ideas and ways  of solving problems that aren’t typical? Show us how you think that’s  different from the crowd. Do you pass over the obvious and make choices  that are surprising AND appropriate for the situation?
Polish: This is the bonus round. All of the above  are most important but if you can do them along with great polish – spacing, arcs, timing, slow-ins/outs, no pops or wonkiness, obvious care  in the details – then your work will stand above the rest.
You may look at your body of work and think that you’re missing some  of these things. Well, what is stopping you? You have the tools to  animate. You can carve out some time. Do it and animate something new  that gives us all of these things and your chances of getting the  position you want will greatly improve!
*Of course, this is my own opinion and I am not attempting to  represent Walt Disney Animation Studios. With that said, I have worked  there forever and I’ve seen thousands of reels and hired scores of  people.
