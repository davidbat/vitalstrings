Buck Taylor | Actor and Western Artist | Biography
Like             the windswept West Texas Ranch he now calls home, Buck Taylor’s             life and career begins at the end of a long and winding dirt road...
The             Real West is tough country where cattle and horses form the backbone             of the families that fight on to preserve their heritage and way of             life.
Born the son of a famous Hollywood             actor, Buck grew up on movie sets, watching his father, celebrated actor             Dub Taylor, appear with such movie greats as John Wayne, Tex Ritter             and Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.  He initially took a different             path, studying art at the University of Southern California, and, in             1960, trying out for the U. S. Olympic Gymnastic Team with the sponsorship             of the cowboy actor Big Boy Williams.
But the acting profession came calling.             It was deeply rooted in the young man, who, after all, had actor Chill             Wills help him take his first steps as a baby. Buck began his acting             career in the fifties working in television. He appeared in everything             from the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and My             Favorite Martian to the classic period westerns, including Have Gun Will Travel with Richard Boone, The             Rebel with Nick Adams and Bonanza. He is best             remembered for his eight-year run as Newly on Gunsmoke, which ended             in 1975. Buck appeared in other popular shows including Wagon             Train, The Virginian, Dallas,             and Walker, Texas Ranger.
In 1963 his movie career began with             an appearance in Johnny Shiloh.  Since his start,             Buck has worked nonstop for more than forty years with roles in such             films as Tombstone and in 2004, The Alamo and Grand Champion.
Preserving and celebrating the heritage             of the American West is the driving force behind Buck’s career             as a watercolor artist. On movie locations he found himself sketching             and painting during breaks in filming. He started in earnest at the             1993 National Finals Rodeo selling paintings and in less than a decade             became internationally famous for his depiction of western scenes and             figures. These paintings are sold through his website, private art shows             and festivals, and at exclusive galleries. His private commissions can             be found in the Loomis Fargo headquarters, DeLucca Liquor headquarters,             Franklin Mint, John Wayne Enterprises, the American Quarter Horse Museum,             the National Ranching Heritage Museum as well as in the hands of private             collectors, including Sam Elliott, James Arness, Roy Clark, Val Kilmer,             Roger Staubach, and Powers Boothe. He is also the official artist for             several rodeos and state fairs.
Buck’s art is an invitation             to explore America’s western past. The cowboys, Native Americans,             horses and homesteaders he creates are at once authentic and captivating.             Their faces and figures tell stories of the adventure, nobility, hardship             and sacrifice that characterized the claiming of the American frontier.             His paintings reflect a deep reverence and profound appreciation for             the contributions of the hard working men and women who first survived             and later prospered amidst landscapes both unforgiving and unforgettable.             In his work, drovers push longhorns up dusty trails; braves pursue buffalo             herds across vast prairies and horses race toward distant horizons.             Such memorable images pay moving tribute to one of the most colorful             and fascinating eras in our nation’s history. Buck once described             his West Texas ranch as his “church” and his artwork as             his attempt to honor his creator for the blessing He has bestowed upon             his children, his wife Goldie, and the land.
His spirit and artistic philosophies             came together on camera in 2003, when Buck assumed the starring role             as “Harry Dodds” a modern day rancher trying to hold on             to his family and ranch in the feature film Truce, released in the spring             of 2005. Playing a tough, gruff cattleman, with fellow actors Barry             Tubbs, Brad Johnson, and George Kennedy, Buck dominates the film with             his natural grace and charm.
With an artistic career spanning             fifty years both on canvas and on the screen, Buck has garnered substantial             acclaim. Recently Buck was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame             and received the "Spirit of Texas Award.” In 2000, he was             memorialized on the streets of Dodge City, “The Trail of Fame.” He has also received the “Golden Boot” award along side             Ted Turner and the “Spirit of the West” award with Jack             Palance and Roy Rogers. Additionally, Buck is recognized on “The             Walk of Stars” in California with his great friends Sam Elliott             and Katharine Ross and his star appears on the streets of Kanab, Utah             on “Little Hollywood.” Buck is in good company, with his             star placed between Ronald Reagan and Tom Mix. In 1981, Buck was inducted             as a trustee in the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum for             his role as Newly on Gunsmoke.
Buck has lent his name and financial             support to numerous charities including the John Wayne Cancer Foundation,             the Walt Garrison MS Foundation, the FFA Scholarship Fund, the Screen             Actors Retirement Home, the Ben Johnson Children’s Hospital and             the Frontier Texas Museum.
The future? More acting. More painting.             And more starring roles. The Fiftieth Anniversary of the landmark Gunsmoke television series was held in 2005, as was the reunion of cast and crew             of the cult classic Tombstone, in which Buck played             Turkey Creek Jack Johnson.
The recognition of his many talents             is overdue and well deserved. But to an actor like Buck, it is just             another stop in his long journey to the end of that winding dirt road             where the real West and the real Buck Taylor begin.
