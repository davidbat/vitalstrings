Most actor/artist support organizations are not-for-profit groups that assist actors, performance artists and theater companies with the varied tasks and advice that are needed to pursue career goals.  In most cases the title of a support organization may be descriptive enough (or recognizable enough) to allow one to grasp the organizations function and purpose.  But in some cases it may be necessary to read the brief descriptive blurb which will provide more detail as to what the particular support organization does and how it can help you.
 There are so many associations, organizations and support groups -- ranging from community-based organizations to national ones -- focused on the needs of actors and performing artists. What we have tried to do with this page is construct a comprehensive directory of such organizations (most are not-for-profit but not all), while focusing on those that we feel would be of greatest service to our audience. Of course, you are welcome to email submissions which you feel are worthy and were left out so that we may consider them.
