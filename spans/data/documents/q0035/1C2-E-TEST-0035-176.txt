 
Martin Hedin:  Songwriter, Musician,           Producer
A native of Sweden, Martin Hedin displayed a           precocious passion for music.  At two years           old, he sat listening for hours while his           father played classical records.  At four,           he could play most popular children's songs           on a toy marimba.  His parents gave him a           piano, which he played every day throughout           his childhood.
At age eleven, his parents bought him a drum           set.  At twelve, a guitar.  Martin recorded           his first rock songs on a double cassette           deck, making overdubs on overdubs, playing           all the instruments himself.  This crude           home recording system was ultimately           replaced by a keyboard and a computer.  In high school, Hedin           formed the band Illusion, which featured his           original songs.
Hedin eventually joined a band called Flow,           featuring Thomas Lejon on drums.  An innovative           progressive rock band, Flow never made it           beyond the studio.  As a student at the Academy of Music in Malmö , Hedin met           singer David Fremberg .  By 1999/2000, the two           would be among the founding members of the highly popular and           critically-acclaimed Swedish progressive           metal band, Andromeda .
Andromeda originated in 1999, when Hedin, Lejon, guitarist Johan Reinholdz and bassist Gert Daun began rehearsing.  After an extended           search for a lead vocalist, David Fremberg           finally joined the band, in 2000.  Fabian           Gustavsson played bass from 2005 to 2011.  Andomeda's           current lineup includes all of the original           members, along with bassist Gustavsson "Linus" Abrahamson .
Andromeda has released six albums,           including: Extension of the Wish (February           2001), II=I (August, 2001), Chimera (2006), Playing Off The Board (2007), and The Immunity Zone (2008).  The           band's recent release, Manifest Tyranny (2011), features           overtly socio-political songs such as: Preemptive Strike , Lies 'R' Us , Survival of the Richest , False Flag , and Go Back to Sleep .  Andromeda           keyboardist, songwriter and producer Martin Hedin elaborated on the ideas behind           manifest Tyranny in a November, 2011 interview conducted by Power of Metal webzine.
"Manifest Tyranny is a reference to the 19th           century expression “manifest destiny”, the           belief that the U.S was destined to expand           and to spread democracy and new technology.           The only thing that has changed is that you           don’t hear them call it “manifest destiny”           anymore. Check out a painting by John Gast           called American Progress – it expresses the           concept very well."
Preemptive Strike and Play Dead           are about the current U.S wars. Lies 'R' Us is about           excessive consumption.  Stay Unaware is about the corrupt banking system.  Survival of the Richest is           about the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.  False Flag is about 9/11, 7/7           and other false flag operations.  Chosen           by God is about the arrogance of the           ruling elite.  Asylum is about feeling like           an outsider.  Go Back to Sleep is about           waking up to a world where nothing is what           you thought it was.  Antidote is           about the swine flu vaccination scam."
"I           write about the things that bother me deeply           with the ways of the western world. It’s an           angry outcry against the injustices that has           become so common, most people don’t even           notice them anymore. I’d like to think that           this record could be a wake up call, the red           pill of the Matrix."
Andromeda continues to tour, with 2012           performances at Belgium's PPM Fest and the Fused Festival in England.  In addition           to performing Andromeda, Hedin currently           teaches at the Academy of Music in Malmö , produces for composer Kent Olofsson , and works on other           musical projects.
