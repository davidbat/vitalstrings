Tuff Gong Worldwide & Ziggy Marley Salute Legends Of Reggae Returns To The Hollywood Bowl Sunday, July 15
For the second year in a row, Ziggy and his band present a special evening honoring the biggest legends of reggae music, once again at the Hollywood Bowl on Sunday, July 15.  Joining Ziggy this year are special guests Toots & The Maytals, Maxi Priest, Freddie McGregor, and Bob Andy.
The Grammy-winning Toots & The Maytals, led by Toots Hibbert, are considered preeminent legends of reggae music, with their unique combination of gospel, ska, soul, reggae and rock. Toots is also featured as a guest artist on Ziggy Marley's "Take Me to Jamaica," from the album Family Time, and joined Ziggy on the Bob Marley Roots Rock Reggae Festival in 2004.
England's own Maxi Priest rose to fame with his trans-Atlantic chart-topping hit "Close to You" in the early 1990s but he has been making reggae music for nearly 30 years, and with over 10 album releases, has been crowned the "King of Lovers Rock" and is one of the world's most successful reggae solo artists of all time . . .
