I was a little perturbed when I heard the news that Bon Jovi would be promoting their 11th studio album , The Circle, by signing up to be an exclusive “artist in residence” at NBC for November. It sounds like this entails multiple performances on the Today show, a special on USA Network, and…an appearance on Bravo’s Inside the Actors Studio for Jon Bon Jovi. I’m all for creative marketing, but Inside the Actors Studio? I’ll admit, I’ve always thought Bon Jovi wasn’t a half-bad actor — in the past, he’s been relaxed and understated, with enough charisma to get him through the rough patches. But I’m having a hard time picturing what he and James Lipton are going to chat about: Serenading Ally McBeal? Playing Twister with Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City? Or, my favorite, Kathleen Turner admiring his ass in Moonlight and Valentino (clip below)? After that, I’ve got nothing. (Maybe they can talk about the totally convincing way he posed on a cliff in the “Blaze of Glory” video .) What do you think PopWatchers — is the NBC gig a good idea for the band? And is there some tour de force screen performance I’m forgetting?
