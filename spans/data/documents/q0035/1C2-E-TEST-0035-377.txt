Hugh Bonneville's TWENTY TWELVE to Premiere on BBC America 6/28  (TALK TV WORLD)
The BAFTA nominated docu-comedy series TWENTY TWELVE, starring BAFTA nominee Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey), joins BBC AMERICA's Ministry of Laughs comedy block just in time for the Summer Games. From executive producer Jon Plowman (The Office, Extras, Absolutely Fabulous) and writer John Morton (People Like Us), the series follows the team responsible for delivering the biggest show on earth: the London Olympics. Twenty Twelve premieres with three back-to-back episodes on Thursday, June 28, 9:00pm ET, then moves to its regular time slot on Saturday, June 30, midnight ET as part of the Ministry of Laughs comedy block. The first season will be immediately followed by season two.
Bringing together actors and creators of some of Britain's most iconic comedies - Twenty Twelve's cast includes BAFTA nominee Olivia Colman (Peep Show), Jessica Hynes (Spaced), Amelia Bullmore (I'm Alan Partridge), Vincent Franklin (The Thick of It) and Karl Theobald (Green Wing), and is narrated by David Tennant (The Spies of Warsaw, Doctor Who).
Twenty Twelve deals with such hot topics as how to phase the traffic lights across London to get people from west to east, which celebrities should be approached to carry the Torch and what to do when protesters leave large quantities of horse dung on the doorstep in protest at the equestrian events. From how to cope with athletes who want to help but are just too dull, to getting a busload of non-English speaking Brazilians from A to B, this crack team of experts is paddling hard beneath the water to make the Olympics happen in London in 2012. With 9 billion pounds to spend and plenty of time before the deadline, what can possibly go wrong?
