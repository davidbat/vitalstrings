Greg Finley | Actor-Performer-Voiceover Artist
He was born into show business in 1947, son of the late Los Angeles television and radio personality Larry Finley and cousin to late writer/producer Rod                 Serling, and is perhaps best known as a top Hollywood theatrical voice-over artist who has worked off and on-camera in over twenty-five-hundred movies and TV programs over the past thirty-five years. 
After graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1965, Greg enlisted in the Army where he rose to the rank of Captain and spent eighteen months in Vietnam in Special Forces. After his military service, he married a widow with four daughters and settled into his life supporting the family by selling automobiles in northern California. Two years later, his son Guy was born. After his marriage dissolved, he moved back to the Southland to pursue his dreams of becoming an actor. 
Very successful as a day player from the late '70s to the mid '80s, Finley began his voice-over career in 1981 as a writer/director/actor on the hit syndicated animated series, "ROBOTECH."  He remarried in 1982, and in 1983, about the time his theatrical voice-over career began to blossom, another son, Garrett, was born.  Over the next twenty-six years, he wrote literally hundreds of news reports, sports broadcasts, and weather spots for group ADR, and performed them in over two thousand Television Shows and Films. 
He's kept his acting chops strong over the years by Looping and performing on stage, and he's looking forward to getting back "on- camera." Greg is a past Board Member and President of his local Community Theater, an avid golfer, still in love after twenty-seven years of marriage to his wife Patti and still close to all of his children. He continues to work, happily, as a voice-over actor.
