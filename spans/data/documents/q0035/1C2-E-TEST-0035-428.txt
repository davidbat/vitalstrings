Short Term Housing For Actors
OAKWOOD
Most popular complex and very expensive since it is most widely known and referred to by agents. Furnished studios are about a $1,500 per month, 1 bedroom about $2400 per month. Location is isolated on top of a hill so only place to walk is around the complex. Heated pools, party rooms, etc. One plus is that during pilot season they offer a lot of acting classes for kids. Some areas of complex may be noisy -- long-term tenants include a lot of young adult actors and musicians. There has also been problems with drugs and bugs in past. Just make sure you get a unit in newly renovated building away from the party crowd.

Side Jobs For Actors
Depending on your financial situation, you may or may not need to find a job to pay your bills and rent in between acting jobs. Jobs with the flexibility to take time off for auditions and acting jobs are in high demand in Los Angeles due to the extraordinarily large number of aspiring actors in the area. Also, many employers in LA avoid hiring actors because they usually end up taking off too much time for auditions, etc., or quit with no notice when they do get booked on an acting job. So sometimes it is not a good idea to tell a prospective employer that you are an actor!
Doing extra work on TV shows and Films is an option, but there is a certain stigma attached to extras in LA. The saying goes, "Once an extra, always an extra!" For some reason, casting directors do not like to call in extras for acting work. Also, talent agents do not like their clients to do extra work. But it is a good way to get used to being on a set, learning about the different protocols of filming, etc. If you are interested in doing extra work, please visit the following blog:
