Hoping you can all help me find the right resort for us since we're new to New England. My husband and I ski and snowboard and we're going to one of the resorts in New England this year since we live in Nashua, NH (either for the holidays or January). We'll be going with my mom who doesn't ski and our son who will be turning one that month (grandma likes babysitting so we don't need those services).
I would like to stay at a resort that's set-up similarly to Snowshoe in West Virginia. Our hotel room there was two minutes from the mountain and there little village had restaurants, coffee shop, indoor pool, outdoor jacuzzi that was at most a five minute walk. That would be ideal so we all have our activities nearby especially since we'll be with a little one. We don't need anything too elaborate like spas, snowmobiling or sleigh riding, just something to entertain grandma and baby.
Is there anything like that in New England? I read everything Fodorites have recommended in the past regarding New England skiing and Stowe is most often recommended but it seems like you're either in the town or you're on the mountain. My husband and I lived in Utah the last couple of years and are used to skiing The Canyons and prefer their greens with a blue run to finish our day. We're lightweights only skiing 2 maybe 3 hours so if we have to choose, activities trump ski-in/ski-out. Any suggestions??
