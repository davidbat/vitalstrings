DCSki Lost Ski Areas
According to USA Today, the number of ski areas in the United States has dropped from 727 in 1985 to 485 in 2008.  There are around 30 major ski resorts active in the Mid-Atlantic region, from the northern tips of North Carolina to the northern tips of Pennsylvania. But over the decades, there have been many other ski areas in this region that have come and gone.
Through the help of readers, DCSki has uncovered information on 96 "lost" Mid-Atlantic ski areas.
The purpose of this page is to preserve the memory of these lost ski areas.  For some areas, we have extensive details including comments and photos from the original operators of the area.  For others, we have little more than a distant memory from a DCSki reader.  Below, you'll find a compilation of lost ski areas in the Mid-Atlantic. Click on a ski area's name to view historical details about the area.
