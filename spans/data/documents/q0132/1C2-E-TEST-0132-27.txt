A snowboarder checks out the trail map for Killington, one of the many ski and snowboard resorts near Boston.
What I love about Boston is that it is a vibrant city that’s easy to escape. Located in proximity to a lot of the different landscapes found in the Northeast, Boston is a hub for a variety of outdoor enthusiasts. For skiers and snowboarders, winter means it’s time to hit the slopes!
When I moved to Boston a few years back I had trouble finding a quick and comprehensive guide to skiing in New England. There are many sources for general information but there’s not one article that outlines all the info in one place. Until now.
In this article, I outline the best ski resorts within a 3-hour drive of Boston. Included are mountain statistics; links to snow reports, trail maps and directions from Google maps; lift ticket prices and specials for the 2010-2011 ski season. This is your one stop guide to a ski trip departing from Boston!
