I admire Goodman's writing, and know him to be a fine fellow through a number of mutual friends.
I take issue with some of his additions in this edition. What is lost when a guidebook editor includes the quieter backcountry skiing routes, that, until now, have required diligent poking around, asking of questions, and exploring online? A lot, I think. King Ravine is a great example. I skied it first a number of years ago. The careful exploration of the area, the discovery of such fabulous skiing, was all part of a process that was educational, challenging, and enlivening to the soul. That's lost now. King Ravine will be busier, too, if by simple dint of the fact that detailed information is now widely disseminated. I've skied in King Ravine every year for the past decade. I'll be interested to watch the uptick in numbers.
It's clearly his right to publish this information, of course. I just question his choice to do so. Those new backcountry skiers who are willing to dig around for info, explore areas and be amply rewarded have lost that opportunity. The steady erosion of opportunities to be rewarded in backcountry exploration is, I think, a loss for all of us.
Is that a hopeless cause? Not necessarily. When Backpacker magazine asked me for my favorite spots to hike as part of the omnipresent "favorite hikes" article, I selected a few, fabulous areas that already had significant traffic, but might not be well-known. The result? The truly quiet, beautiful spots are still just exactly that. They live on, as places for rich discovery by future hikers. It's possible, if we each exercise wise discretion.
Let me end on a positive note. I've seen an advance copy. I know it's a great guidebook, so I'll give it five stars. It's thorough, thoughtfully written, accurate and useful. I just hope that future guidebook editors everywhere will look in their hearts and consider the loss incurred when they shine a bright light on remote locales.
