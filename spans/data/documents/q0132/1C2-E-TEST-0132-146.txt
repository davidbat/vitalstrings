Nice town, great terrain and vibe.
Pricey. A zoo on powder days.
You wonder if the new lift going in at Stowe feels a lot of pressure, following in the footsteps of legends on the East’s most hallowed liftline. But this rookie has tools. It boosts uphill capacity by 60 percent, shrugs off ice and wind, takes up less room and eliminates the hike over to Nosedive and Toll Road. Stowe, “the classic New England resort,” makes a move in the survey standings too, up from no. 3 last year and creeping up on no. 1 Tremblant with Top 5 rankings in On-Mountain Food, Dining, Lodging, Off-Hill Activities, Après and Challenge. The “ski capital of the East” has always had the terrain, the history and the quaint steepled village. Now, with state-of-the-art lifts and the luxurious Spruce Peak slopeside amenities, readers find little to criticize. Well, price is an object (no. 36 for Value). And attitude comes up. (“A very high opinion of itself.”) But most readers rave. “The terrain, the amazing town, the great après/nightlife options…” says one. “Top notch on so many levels.” —J.C.
On-Hill Lunch » The Spruce Camp day lodge in itself is a cut above the usual cafeteria. But for the ultimate slopeside lunch, head next door to Solstice, the Lodge at Spruce’s gourmet restaurant.
Après Spot » The Mountain Road’s dimly lighted Matterhorn is still the classic, though the annoying cover charge is new.
What’s New» The FourRunner quad, after 25 years of service, has been replaced this season with a new, more robust Doppelmayr.
