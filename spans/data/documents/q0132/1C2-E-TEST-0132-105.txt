Ocean Edge Resort & Spa
Named one of top 10 "Best Beach Resorts for Families" by Parents magazine, the old fashioned Cape Cod resort offers an array of complimentary family activities, including clambakes, family outdoor movies at the Arbor Pool and beach fires with s'mores as well as croquet, badminton or soccer on the front lawn. The kids' camp, Ocean Edge Venture, is designed for children ages four to 12 and for a small fee kids may also participate in several craft programs, such as making a kite or tie-dying tee shirts. The historic resort is surrounded by 429 acres of seaside property and was originally the Nickerson Family mansion and carriage house built in 1890. Overlooking Cape Cod Bay, the mansion is in the National Register of Historic Places. The resort offers 335 guest rooms, including one, two or three bedroom villas. From poolside snacks to rooftop cocktails, guests can choose from a variety of dining options on-site and children of all ages may enjoy ice cream and smoothies in the beachfront cafe. In addition to a championship golf course, tennis courts, a fitness center and spa services, the property features six swimming pools, including two indoor pools open year round. Two of the outdoor pools and the beach area are staffed by lifeguards.
