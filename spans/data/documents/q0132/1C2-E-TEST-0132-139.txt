For the novice, the notion of strapping a board or a pair of skis to your feet may seem like one of the most foolish things you can do on a snow-covered mountaina sensation thats only intensified if you have daredevil skiers cutting you off or (worse) if you mistakenly end up on a double-black slope. The resorts profiled hereour ten favorites, plus others good for beginnersspecialize at lessening the overall learning curve with solid ski and board schooling, segregated beginners-only slopes, and well-groomed conditions thatll let you snowplow all you want until you gather your confidence and leave the green slopes behind for bluer pistes.
