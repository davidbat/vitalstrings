I have skied about every ski area in Maine and never skied Wildcat Mtn. before and it is a real nice Mtn. to ski and is great for intermediate skiers.  I will be back and I was not disappointed not one bit.  I went up the day they had the $9.00 ticket deal, couldn't pass up the chance to try the mountain, it was great and the views spectacular.  Next time I go I am bring the whole family. Thanks and Always Remember Keep Your Ski's Pointed Down Hill & Enjoy a Great Time, later Bruce
