Your favorite family-friendly ski resorts in New England
Now that the school is back, I can't wait to start making plans for Christmas ski-vacation, while there is still time to find good deals and availability.
Here is my wish list:
1. Lodging slopeside or walkable to the resort
2. Family activities, ski lessons, ice-skating, snow tubing, and other winter activities
3. Outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi
4. Close to restaurants and other activities
5. Under 2.5 hours from Boston, may be 3
6. A condo with one or two bedrooms and a kitchen
7. New Hampshire, Maine, or Vermont
8. Doesn't have to be the biggest resort, with the biggest price tag
9. Ski level beginner to intermediate friendly, kids are 3, 5 and 7 years old
I appreciate your input!
