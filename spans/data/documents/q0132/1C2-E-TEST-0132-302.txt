Summer Adventure Park Opens this Weekend!
Visit the Adventure Park for summer thrills! Opening June 23, the newly revamped Adventure Park has activities for the whole family! Check out our brand new off-road go-karts. Race down our dual zip lines that will glide you 40 ft above the ground and travel nearly 500 ft. Get your adrenaline pumping with a 30 ft free-fall into the Big Air Bag. And enjoy our Euro Bungy trampoline and a free skate park. The Adventure Park is open weekends 11am-4pm through Labor Day.
