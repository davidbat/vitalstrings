Amazing!It took until the 6th of December to see the worst film of the year.but then it was’nt as﻿ bad as “The Ninth Gate” or “Repulsion”or “The Pianist”,and dont even mention “Canage”No more Polanski movies for me.

God I hope this movie was reviewed on it’s merits and not the fact﻿ Roman was a child molester…

I thought﻿ this movie was terrible and find it very strange that so many people seem to like it so much. Good to see one guy on here agree with me at least. I would probably give it a 3,5 or something like that.

Well if it makes you feel any better Cenk, it was just called The Ghost here like the book – because once again US producers have nothing but contempt for their audience and﻿ assumed you wouldn’t get it otherwise.

The film was﻿ easily an 81/2 or 9. Inferior films have won best picture at the oscars the past two years. It’s one of Polanski’s best.

Totally inane review.  You provide no﻿ insight into the film.

“the ninth﻿ gate” from 1999, movie with great music, interesting story and very good actors. that film is a great example of atmosphere that only Polanski can make – 41% on rotten – no comment.

I give a lot of props to the Rotten Tomatoes guy.  He’s not afraid to say — “hey, I didn’t get the movie, it didn’t work for me.” Too﻿ many critics, when it comes to name directors, automatically overpraise their films.

Being “smart” is a matter of opinion in definition. I do not know what you are implying by saying “did you just step in﻿ your own shit just there?”
I did﻿ not “talk-shit” to lalalalllama… so I just don’t see any “shit” around as a reference to your question.

Yea baby….count me Atheist and proud of it; yea, I am too smart to be religious.

OK here’s the truth, Yeshua taught not to take oaths in that they come from the evil one (Matt 5), not to war (Matt 5) Paul taught not to war (Cor) or return evil for evil but to kill our﻿ enemies﻿ with kindness. They taught that true Christians have the Spirit of God and do not sin any longer (Heb 6-10). There isn’t a Christian among our secret society blood oath bound, liying, waring, moral free leaders, in the goverment or churches. May we all seek God, His Kingdom and righteousness!.
