Big Squaw Mountain Route 15, Greenville 207-695-1000
Big Squaw, a few scant miles from Moosehead Lake, had    (see note below) big mountain skiing with a classic New England    trail layout. An old double chair offered excellent terrain for advanced intermediates and experts    to the         summit (the    summit double chair at Big Squaw is closed until further notice -    without this chair this is a modest 800 vertical mountain - a nice day    trip if you live close by but not worth the drive for most). The lower mountain has a triple chair catering to intermediate and         beginner skiers with gentle, wandering terrain. The stunning views    from the summit (that    you have to hike for now) of Moosehead Lake and         Mount Katahdin in the distance are arguably the best in the Northeast! Squaw is not fancy,         it's hearty and unadorned, with a very low lift ticket price!
