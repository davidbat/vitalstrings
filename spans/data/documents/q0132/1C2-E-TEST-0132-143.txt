Sunshine State
0
For two weeks at the end of May, the WME film crew set out to film one last segment for their upcoming film, Flow State. Due to a low snow year across the board, they chose a location guaranteed to have big, snow covered mountains: Svalbard, Norway. Launching from the town of Longyearbyen, a mere 600 miles shy of the North Pole, the crew set out for a sailboat based expedition of the surrounding fjords. In a land with more polar bears than people, the team explored new terrain and made numerous first descents along the way.
