Thank you all for joining us this past winter. Despite record warm temps this season brought lots of fun and we enjoyed seeing you and your families out enjoying the snow we had. Everyone at KB is stoked for next season and preparations are underway to make it one to remember! Have a wonderful summer, see you on the trails, the LAX field or out on the  water! -ACM
 
The Kissing Bridge Jr. Race Team is taking applications for a limited number of spots on our Club Race and Travel Race teams for skiers ages 7 and up who are ready and willing to participate in the sport of ski racing and learn basic skill sets will make them better skiers in and out of the race course. If you have ny questions please contact the Race Program Director Andrew Minier at andym@kbemail.com . The video below highlights the 2012 race season for our younger racers. A big thanks to all our dedicated racers and parents, I look forward to seeing you all soon as our Spring and Summer activities keep the stoke going until the snow returns! -ACM
