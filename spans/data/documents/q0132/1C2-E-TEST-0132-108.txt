NEW YORK (AP)  Skiers want nothing but to be on the slopes this time of year. But what if they bring friends or family along who don't ski?
Shermans Travel — shermanstravel.com — a publisher of travel deals and destination advice, has come up with a list of 10 of the best ski resorts in the world for nonskiers, from the Alps to New England to the West. They are:
• Austria's Bad Gastein , home to 18 natural hot springs in addition to challenging snow bowls and high-altitude views. Shermans Travel recommendation for value lodging: Haus Hirt Hotel & Spa.
• Megeve , France, where no one hits the slopes before 11 a.m. and lunch can take hours. Local Michelin-rated eateries include Flocons de Sel, La Ferme de Mon Pere, and the hidden Domaine de la Sasse, reached by a 20-minute hike on snowshoes.
SKI GUIDE: Resort profiles, snow conditions, more
• Mont Tremblant, in Quebec, Canada, where skiers love the wide runs and nonskiers love the pedestrian-friendly village with good food and great apres-ski. Value lodging recommendation from Shermans: Chateau Beauvallon.
• Park City, Utah , which has terrain for every skier, and attractions for nonskiers like the Kimball Art Center, shows at the Egyptian Theatre, and the annual film festival at Sundance each January.
• Sierra Nevada — no, not the mountain range in California and Nevada — the one in Spain. Yes, skiing is possible in a sunny, Mediterranean country. For activities off the slope, head to Grenada, an hour from the Pradollano ski village.
• Stowe, Vt., offers New England charm for skiers and nonskiers alike, including 50 restaurants, a half-dozen wellness centers and spas, and for those who are shy of the slopes but don't mind cross-country, the Nordic Center at Trapp Family Lodge, with 90 scenic miles of trails.
• Sun Valley, Idaho, which offers sunny slopes on Mount Baldy for skiers and the Western charm of Ketchum for nonskiers. Pay your respects at the grave of Ernest Hemingway or spend the afternoon at galleries, spas, and boutiques.
• Taos, N.M., with sun and steep slopes for skiers, plus 80 galleries, seven museums, A-list restaurants like Joseph's Table for everyone else. Shermans Travel value recommendation for lodging is the Historic Taos Inn.
• Whistler Blackcomb , where the Peak 2 Peak gondola will take you between the summits of Whistler and Blackcomb whether you're skiing or just sightseeing. Shermans says the village is also known for its rowdy nightlife.
• Zermatt , Switzerland, a fantasyland in the shadow of the Matterhorn, where the streets are lined with glitzy shops and glam clubs but are otherwise quiet, thanks to the ban on gas-powered cars.
