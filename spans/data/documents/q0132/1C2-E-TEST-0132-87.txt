Killington VT is the largest in terms of vertical drop, trails, lifts, and acreage. Killington is only the second highest peak in Vermont. Mt. Mansfield is higher. That's also the mountain where you will find Stowe, however the top of Killington's K-1 Gondola tops-out higher than Stowe's Four Runner Quad lift.
Sugarloaf, ME (4,237') does have the only lift serviced area above tree-line in the Northeast and it is just higher than Killington's lift. Whiteface NY has a higher lift terminus than Killington at 4,386'. Killington is only 4,215'.
