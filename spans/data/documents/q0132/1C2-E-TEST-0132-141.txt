Breckenridge
The new Free Ride system in Breckenridge links the ski resort to the town, offering frequent bus service throughout the community and to the bases of Peaks 8 and 9. I used this service last year and it was MUCH superior to driving…especially the day we had 9″ of fresh. The Main Street Express also runs through Breckenridge’s dining and shopping district. An express bus is available between Keystone, A-Basin, and Breckenridge.
Salt Lake City, Utah
Amtrak’s California Zephyr stops in Salt Lake City (at 4 a.m. coming from the West Coast, but the fare is cheap. From Chicago, the train arrives at midnight). Call (800) 872-7245 or consult the Amtrak Web site . If you’re staying at one of Salt Lake’s many ski resorts, you don’t need a car: most lodges have free shuttles to get you to the slopes or to visit neighboring restaurants.
If you stay in Salt Lake City, you can take the Utah Transit Authority light rail (UTA TRAX) from downtown and transfer to a UTA ski bus which takes you to any of the Cottonwood Canyon resorts. This is convenient and very affordable. The rail cars and buses are remarkably clean. It costs $6 round trip for a Ski Pass. Ski buses have different daily weekday and weekend schedules so be prepared to make transfers and pay close attention to bus schedules associated with going up and down the canyon. They start at 6:53 a.m. and stop around the city and at 10 different hotels. If you’re heading to Alta (okay, I’m bias) or Snowbird plan about an hour for total travel time.
