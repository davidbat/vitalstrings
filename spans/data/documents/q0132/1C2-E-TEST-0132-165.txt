JAY, Vt. (AP) â€” A Vermont ski resort's expansion plans include converting offices in a main building a country store-style setting with a deli.
The outside of the Austria Haus building at Jay Peak Resort would be redesigned and the interior of the old dining room and kitchen inside would be renovated.
The Caledonian-Record reports (http://bit.ly/KQoXV7) the building sits between two new hotels, the Tram Haus and the new Hotel Jay and conference center. It's the last original building on the Tramside ski area.
The resort has started the permit request for a new expansion, including new trails, townhouses and condos, a hotel and other features.
