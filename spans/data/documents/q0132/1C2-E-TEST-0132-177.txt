Most of the New England colleges are nearish to ski areas - mostly those in Massachusetts and points north. But even in CT, the schools are near ski areas. Depends on how big you want the skiing to be, and how close you want to be to the resort.
Most New England schools have ski clubs. UMass Amherst even used to own a cabin, I think it was at Killington, and might still.
If you want colleges that are within, say, 30-60 minutes of a ski area, then I'd suggest:
-University of Vermont
