Update:  Went there again this weekend and damn!  DO NOT miss the East Bowl area.  It's a hike for snowboarders, but the deep pow pow and natural jumps are soooo worth it!  Love this place!
********************
Burke Mountain is a great place to snowboard and ski.  I recently spent a weekend there and had a blast.  The snow was great, nicely groomed, and I don't think I waited longer than 2 minutes in any lift line.  It's kind of a mom n' pop mountain-- not commercial at all, like a lot of other places in VT/NH.  It's really chill and lots of fun.
One thing to note is that a lot of their intermediate trails might as well be black diamonds, compared to other ski places up North...they are super hard and steep.  But still fun, if you like that kind of thing!  And the green trails are really really easy, but there aren't many of them, and none of them run from the summit.
Another thing to note is that if you're renting, apparently they only have step-in bindings for snowboarders...my friends that rented did not enjoy them at all.  So if you don't have your own gear, you may want to rent off-mountain.
Other than that it's good times all around.  And the condo we rented, which we could snowboard right onto the main trails from, was beautiful and had amazing views of Franconia Notch.
