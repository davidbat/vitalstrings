Stowe, Vermont
One of the most renowned and picturesque ski resorts on the map, Stowe offers traditional New England charm and the biggest vertical drop in the area. Stowe's two ski areas are Mount Mansfield and Spruce Peak.  The latter actually backs onto Smugglers' Notch's terrain. As a result, Stowe is amongst a handful of American resorts that have a lift-link to another resort. Stowe offers over 90 shops and 60 restaurants to make sure that visitors do not trek too far away during their stay.
