Bretton Woods (New Hampshire)
What it lacks in challenge, Bretton Woods makes up for in beauty. Located in the Mount Washington Valley, Bretton Woods is owned by the Mount Washington Resort. Built at the turn of the 20th Century, the resort's Victorian Hotel can be seen from many of the resort's trails. Stickneys Restaurant offers food and ambiance far superior to those of typical ski resort cafeterias. This is the perfect place to make a new skier fall in love with the sport.

Mad River Glen (Vermont)
Some skiers have no interest in high-speed lifts, upscale lodging and restaurants or quaint shops. Instead, they prefer challenging terrain that is free from snowboarders. These skiers will enjoy Mad River Glen, one of the last remaining snowboard-free ski areas. It opened in 1948 and is famous for the Single Chair lift, which, in an age of high-speed six-packs, is another rarity. Mad River Glen has a cooperative ownership, which goes along with its counter-culture environment.
