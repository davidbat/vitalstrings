Snow tubing at West Mountain's Tubing Park gives you even more opportunity to play in the snow!
Snow tubing is very similar to a winter-time Alpine slide. Just add snow and specially designed snow tubes and its "tubes away" as guests glide effortlessly down the slide. With 6 tubing chutes FOUR, 700’ chutes and TWO, 1000’ chutes, the fun is never ending and there is no need for any special equipment or experience. The snow tubing park is located to the left side of the face slope, and features two dedicated lifts that will carry guests to the top time and time again!
West Mountain is one of the few New York ski resorts to offer this fun family-oriented winter recreation. So get dressed in warm clothing and get ready to experience snow from a whole new perspective at West Mountain's Tubing Park!
