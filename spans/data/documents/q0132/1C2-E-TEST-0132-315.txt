Top 20 Family Ski Resorts
Each year, FamilySkiHub.com publishes its Top 20 Family Ski Resort list. This list is comprised of what we consider  to be the premier family ski locales in the country. There are certainly some great family ski locations that didn't  make this list, so we encourage you to try as many different resorts as you can. Really -- can skiing not be a fun  family vacation? We say no.
The list was made up of several criteria: Quality kids' programs, variety of lodging, options for non-ski activities, a  variety of ski terrain, value and relative ease of travelling. In addition, we tried to have some geographical  balance so people in most parts of the country could be within a short trip of one or more resorts.
