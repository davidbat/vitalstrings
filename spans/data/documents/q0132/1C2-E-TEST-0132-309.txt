I recently was working on my personal Top 10 music albums  and realized that I had about 25 of them. Selecting the best of anything is a  very difficult task and there are always issues about categories and  popularity. But, really? No Rocky Mountain National, Denali, Glacier National,  Crater Lake, Bryce Canyon, Acadia, etc.  They needed to name a Top 25 rather than a Top 10.
Hunting in the Parks
In a related issue, currently there’s legislation under  consideration called HR 4089 or the Sportsman’s Heritage Act. According to  writer Kraig Becker, this bill would open most of the park system to hunting,  trapping, and recreational shooting. HR 4089 was passed by the House of  Representatives in April and is still to be considered by the Senate, and of  course if there are different versions of the bill passed, the legislation  would then go to a conference committee where it could be completely  transformed.
The National Parks Conservation Association examined the  legal aspects of the bill and it was discovered HR 4089 would require each of  the NPS units to do their own individual study to determine if hunting and  trapping would be applicable in the different parks, respectively. There are  397 units within the NPS system, so it could be a field day for researchers to  analyze the issue in all of these parks. The NPCA also stated that the bill  would allow the use of off-road vehicles if needed by hunters and trappers.  Most parks do not allow the use of 4-wheeled drive vehicles off of the  pavement. Stay tuned.

Can XC Skiing and/or Snowshoeing be a Remedy for Anxiety and Depression?
There have been studies done  about exercise intervention for clinical populations diagnosed with depression,  anxiety, eating disorders, and even post traumatic stress disorder. This  research shows that there are beneficial effects that produce a statistically  relevant and significant reduction in these mental maladies. The following few  paragraphs provide info from some articles that covered the topic of using exercise as a  good strategy for therapists to employ.
In the 4th  century, Plato reportedly quipped, “For man to succeed in life he has been  provided with two means, education and physical activity. Not separately, one  for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together. With these  two means, man can attain perfection.” The CDC cites health benefits associated  with a range of physical activity and in its absence there can be an increased  risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, etc. Physical  inactivity may also be associated with the development of mental disorders such  as those listed above.
There is evidence for the  effectiveness of exercise training in patients with panic disorder impacted by  a number of psychological factors such as increased self efficacy, a sense of  mastery, distraction, and changes of self-concept. Can or will psychologists  prescribe such an exercise intervention as part of therapy for their patients?  It would seem to integrate perfectly with cognitive behavioral therapy  strategies such as situational analysis, self monitoring, homework activities,  and supportive follow-up to help compliance.
Physical fitness will also  improve self-esteem and as patients feel better about themselves they’ll  develop a more optimistic and energetic frame of mind. There is also an  association between aerobic exercise and increased alertness. The exercise  improves circulation and increases the availability of oxygen to the brain  while it also causes the body to produce chemicals such as adrenaline to  promote mental alertness. Fitness can instill a sense of pride and confidence  and allow the mind a pathway to escape from everyday stress. Biologically  speaking, exercise is said to cause the brain to release beta endorphins, which  are essential in relieving pain and create a sort of euphoric or light happy  feeling. This overall mood enhancement can be prescribed to help treat  depression and anxiety. Regular exercise will also invoke focus, determination,  and discipline, which are mentally strengthening.
Cross country skiing and  snowshoeing are the top forms of aerobic recreational activities. And aerobic  activities have been found to promote mental health, boost energy, improve  sleep, relieve tension and stress, and combat anxiety and depression. There is  a real proven link between physical fitness and mental health and well-being.  We should get moving on this!
How do we encourage more  psychologists to enroll their patients in outdoor fitness endeavors as part of  therapy? There will be benefits from such strategies at a wide range of levels  from getting someone out on rental snowshoes for 3 short weekly hikes to  training for a 50 km skiathon.
A strategy to bring together  xc skiing or snowshoeing and professional therapists can be developed. The  skier can create a prescription for a routine for skiing or snowshoeing a  number of kilometers a few times per week and the therapist can schedule  sessions or maybe even hold the sessions on the trails.  What would that be worth an hour including  trail passes? Maybe xc ski areas can sell transferable season passes to  therapists in a package? Maybe health insurance could cover the cost of and encourage such a winning strategy.

Winter Trails Users Should  Stop Hating!
XC (cross country) skiers  hate when snowshoers step on and mess up their groomed ski tracks and they both  hate snowmobilers; while snowmobilers don’t want xc skiers and snowshoers using  the trails that were paid for with snowmobile registration fees…and they all  are freaked out about getting tangled up with sled dog teams! All winter trail  users have the right to enjoy their chosen outdoor recreational experiences and  their commonality is that they do not want their rights restricted in any  way.  In the winter, trail encounters  between snowmobilers and other trail users must be expected. When these  encounters inevitably occur, people should respect each other’s love of the  outdoors and be considerate. That’s not a rule, an enforceable law, or a line  in a list of codified responsibility dogma. It is the way to live.
While the vast majority of  encounters between different winter trail users on the snow such as mushers  (dog sledders), snowshoers, snowmobilers and xc (cross-country) skiers are  friendly and respectful, there are some conflicts that occur and some resentment  that does exist. Additionally, unsafe situations such as collisions, reckless  behavior or poor judgment can occur. These situations can be compounded by  damaged trail surfaces, narrow passageways, conflicted trail uses or trail  congestion.
Other factors that may  contribute to a problem on shared trails include trail user speed, mass of user  or vehicle, sight distances, size of the group, users overtaking one another  silently or without warning, user skill and experience and user expectations  and preparedness. Add to that people’s different values and priorities and  their tolerance for others’ lifestyle choices and it’s no wonder that you have  a recipe for possible conflict.
In the Other Person’s Shoes
The most obvious way to  prevent conflicts on the trails and promote safety for those who share the  trails is to learn and understand each other’s perspectives. For example, many xc  skiers and snowshoers are not aware that snowmobilers must pay a state  registration fee, which is allocated to trail grooming. Snowmobilers have  worked hard to secure landowners’ permission to develop and use their networks  of trails. If xc skiers do not want to mix with other trail users they have the  option of skiing at “skier-only” commercial ski centers that groom specifically  for skiing, where snowmobilers are not allowed. And there are state and  national park areas that restrict snowmobiling, too.
But snowmobilers may not realize  deep-rooted resentments that many xc skiers have for the motorized trail users.  Some skiers and snowshoers regard their solitude in nature as holy. They may  feel that mechanized trail use is inappropriate and are angered by the  inefficient two-cycle engine noise and exhaust. Snowshoers and xc skiers  lifestyle perspectives may prevent them from ever being aware of the sheer joy  a youngster experiences when (s) he rides a snowmobile for the first time.  Certainly, there is enough room and plenty of miles of trails so that all trail  users can be satisfied. And perhaps there are areas with separate trails that  are primarily allocated to specific uses.
Mutual Understanding
Snowmobilers and other trails  users can facilitate mutual understanding through the process of communicating  and collaborating. The Lyme-Pinnacle Snowmobile Club in the western central  part of New Hampshire  has discovered some success in sharing the trails. While it is unusual, the  club membership is comprised of one-third xc skiers. They regularly share the  trails and they pitch in and help maintain the trails in the off-season, too.  And there is more than one report of a lost xc skier or snowshoer, who was glad  to see a snowmobiler, who provided safe transport back to the trailhead. Perhaps  it’s time trail users get into each other’s shoes and try each other’s  activity. Work on joint projects such as trail maintenance, repairing a warming  hut, deciding where routes are successful and where they are problematic.
What to Do at a Rendezvous?
The NH Fish & Game OHRV  Operation and License Statute states: Any person operating an OHRV shall yield  the right-of-way to any person on horseback, foot, ski, snowshoes or other mode  of travel on foot; provided however, that such persons traveling do not  unreasonably obstruct or delay OHRVs on the trail. The law also states that the  maximum speed limit unless otherwise posted is 45 miles per hour.
There may be a code, trail  etiquette, or laws of the land for snowmobilers and other trail users when they  come upon each other, but what really matters is that people just use common  sense. For example, obviously snowmobilers should be prepared for anything when  approaching a blind curve, which suggests slowing down, being aware and keeping  the sled under control.
Upon hearing the approach of  a snowmobile, xc skiers or snowshoers should get off the trail in a place where  they can be easily seen. They should give the snowmobiler room to pass, and be  more wary if there are many people in either party. Skiers and snowshoers  should also keep control of ski poles to avoid the sled as it goes by.  Traditional yield rules and signage ask the machine operator to yield, but it  is just much easier for the trail user on foot (or ski) to step off the trail.
XC skiers that use snowmobile  trails often employ the skating method of skiing. This technique crosses the  trail in a perpendicular fashion, substantially more than the traditional  diagonal ski technique. The skater splays each sliding ski outward at an angle  to glide longer and faster. This is usually a more encompassing exercise and  snowmobilers should be aware that skating skiers might not be able to hear an  oncoming machine very well. Their level of exercise and the sound of wind and  sliding skis on crunchy snow can impair hearing somewhat. That is one good  reason that snowmobilers, who may have newer quieter machines should not assume  that other trail users will always hear them coming.
Mushers (dog sledders)  recommend that as they approach head on, other trail users should get to the  side or off the trail and let the sled dogs pass by. It’s best to try and  communicate about each other’s intentions. Keep in mind that the sled dogs will  try to keep to the inside of the trail on a curve to find the shortest path, so  you should not automatically think that pulling off to the right is always the  best option.
Interestingly, horseback  riders suggest that other trail users talk it up when they come face-to-face.  It is important that the horse understand that you are a person and not some robot  contraption. Luckily, seeing equestrian enthusiasts on the winter trails is a  rare occurrence.
People familiar with the  trail sharing issue will often refer to the fact that there are very few  problems on the trails. A common phrase is that problems occur with “less than  one percent” of trail users. There is also concern about young people and  others, who might act recklessly or are using snowmobiles for the first time.  Skiers, who ski on the snowmobile trails but are not aware of the issues  discussed in this article, are of particular concern, too. We must try to reach  all of these “one-percenters” to prevent tragic consequences and keep the  trails safe for all to use.

Adaptive XC Program on Wheels
The New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA), a regional group  of xc ski clubs has developed an adaptive xc ski program to increase access to  adaptive xc ski programs, events, equipment, and education across New England. Adaptive programs adapt ski equipment and/or  techniques to optimize them for individuals with mobility or intellectual impairments.
The NENSA Adaptive Program works with existing adaptive  sports organizations to support xc ski offerings or it can help a club or community  initiate a new program. Additionally, the NENSA Adaptive Program coordinates  with ski clubs and teams as well as running programs for veterans and others in  the region.
There are weekly programs in at Weston Ski Track, MA and Pineland Farms in New Gloucester, ME for veterans. These programs offer regular  opportunities for experienced and aspiring adaptive xc skiers to hone their  skills and the two xc ski areas have machine-made snow to guarantee the  programs. NENSA Adaptive can also orchestrate xc ski instructor training for  adaptive purposes.
The program includes an adaptive xc ski shop on wheels  trailer to help with learn to ski clinics. The trailer carries up to 8 sit skis  for mobility impaired xc skiers and 20 sets of regular xc ski equipment and can  be brought to scheduled events and festivals to welcome people in need of  adaptive services.
Some of the xc ski resorts that have hosted NENSA Adaptive  Program include Weston Ski Track, MA , Pineland Farms in New Gloucester, ME ,  and Craftsbury Outdoor Center in VT,  Sports Associates at Gaylord Hospital in CT and Adirondack Adaptive Adventures in Lake Placid, NY  are other organizations that are involved with the program.
For information regarding the NENSA Adaptive Program or to  get something going contact program director Eileen Carey at Eileen@nensa.net , 207-514-3230 or visit www.adaptive.nensa.net/.

Backcountry Access - A New Service at XC Ski Resorts
A recent visit to Bolton Valley  Nordic Center in Vermont  afforded me an up close look at the newest sensation in cross country skiing –  backcountry access at a commercial xc ski area. Bolton  boasts having 62 km of high elevation backcountry ski trails including steep  winding trails through birch glades, mellow trails for touring, and plenty of  powder turns on the way back down.
In mid-February while much of  New England was wondering when winter would  begin, Bolton Nordic with its base elevation of 2,100 feet has fresh snow and a  reliable, plentiful base. The facility has 26 km of groomed trails, too. The  rental equipment includes backcountry gear for either xc skiing or snowshoeing.  The famous Catamount Trail is amidst Bolton’s  trail system and there seems to be no limit to interest in this market segment.  In fact, the grand daddy of xc ski areas, Trapp Family Lodge now offers 2,500  acres and 40 km of trails in the backcountry, too.
At Bolton Nordic’s eastern  side, the Bryant Ski Trail takes skiers uphill on an hour trek to the Bryant  Camp Backcountry Cabin (2,690 foot elevation). Not much to the building but it  is a destination that opens into various trails further up the terrain. By the  time I arrived in the late morning the trails were packed by previous skiers. I  had a few chats with other skiers, who donned gear ranging from lightweight xc  skis to heavy telemark gear with climbing skins, wide waxless skis with BC  boot/bindings, and I even dodged a snowboarder careening down the packed trail  on a split decision snowboard.
I had a conversation with a  couple of skiers, who admitted to taking the Wilderness Lift at the adjacent  Bolton Valley alpine ski area to ski from the Peggy Dow’s Trail to the Nordic  area’s backcountry terrain and the Heavenly Highway Trail where I met them. I  skied further up the Highway and then turned on to an aptly named trail called  Devil’s Drop, which was really a downhill powder run with switchbacks.
Clearly, you want to ski  these trails on a day with good soft snow conditions. The trails are well  marked and with skiers dropping down into untracked lines through the trees the  upper trails can be a bit confusing. It appeared that after skiing around a few  times it would be more comforting as one becomes familiar with the upper  trails. There is an overlook named Stowe View and another trail where you can  reach a destination named Olga’s Falls. The Bolton-Trapp Trail uses the  Catamount Trail (Vermont’s lengthwise winter  trail) between the Bolton   Nordic Center  and Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe and this reaches the highest point on the  Catamount Trail at 3,310 foot elevation.
The west side of the Bolton trails covers another entire area to ski and  looking at the map contours it is appealing for some downhill fun. The  backcountry area also has some delineated glade areas on the trail map and one  would imagine that there could be much more of these cleaned areas to give  skiers more to enjoy.
Trapp Family Lodge offers  guided tours in the backcountry for $35 hour and there is a 3-day package with  rental equipment, skill lessons, and a full day tour for $250. Bolton has  backcountry rental gear for $30.
Uphill Transport for Skiing the Glades
About a decade ago, alpine ski resorts came to the  realization that gladed areas (skiing in the trees rather than on the groomed  slopes) between trails offers great fun to skiers. They have created safe  glades on gentle terrain by eliminating underbrush, smaller trees, and rocks so  there is more room for skiers to pick their way through the forest (somewhat)  safely. Glade areas for advanced skiers offer steeper terrain and more  obstacles.
Call me a heretic, but I feel that the time has come for xc  ski area operators to accept that there are many skiers who would like to  access these backcountry stashes without having to climb and get so tired.  Clearly there is a portion of the skiing population who would pay for transport  up to higher elevations to access these areas so they can enjoy the downhill  runs. For a few extra dollars above the trail pass, such transport could be  provided with an industrial snowmobile (which most resorts already use) pulling  an attached trailer with seats. And maybe the snowmobile driver can stop at the  top to take some photos of the skiers as they take off down the terrain. Skiers  can purchase the photo documentation back at the lodge and get the photos  emailed to their computer or phone so they can show their weekend adventure to coworkers  on Monday morning at work.
I imagine that xc ski resort  operators might feel that such a service is the domain of alpine ski  resorts…but xc ski areas could offer a more natural service within the context  of xc skiing and snowshoeing. People like high places and the product supplier  companies have recently produced a proliferation of off-track and backcountry  equipment. This type of xc ski resort service has arrived.

First Person - Lapland Lake is Finn-tastic!
On a preseason visit to  Lapland Lake XC Ski & Vacation Center in Northville,  NY, I was given a true taste of Finland. This  is cross country skiing Finnish style from the resort owner, Olavi Hirvonen to  the authentic woodburning sauna and the two resident reindeer on site.
Olavi and Ann Hirvonen have  operated Lapland Lake  for more than 30 years and visitors’ testimonials speak to their friendly,  caring, and personal customer service that is Lapland Lake.  Actually, the resort is tucked away in the town of Benson  situated 60 miles northwest of Albany  in the 6-million acre Adirondack Forest Reserve.
In February 2010, Olavi  celebrated the 50th anniversary as a member of the 1960 US Olympic  Team in Squaw Valley. He participated in two  events and in the 50-kilometer distance he finished second among the US skiers. His  performance was marred by a broken ski, which compelled him to proceed 1.5  miles on a single ski before he was able to obtain a replacement. Olavi applies  that compulsiveness to overseeing the trail grooming and after winter storms he  has the Lapland staff clearing twigs and  branches off of the trails. Olavi works in the rental and repair shop,  certainly a labor of love for the octogenarian, while Ann focuses on most of everything  else.
The kids line up to spin on a  sled upon the frozen pond, where a Finish experience called Napa Kiikku  has the kids on a sled that is attached to a  pole protruding through the ice. The “Ski-like-a-Finn” lesson package helps  first timers to get the hang of xc skiing with rental gear, a trail pass, and a  lesson. And from the looks of it, the trails are mostly on comfortable level  terrain so that skiers need not climb too much or worry about out-of-control  downhill experiences. There are a total of about 50 kilometers of trails with  nearly 40 km that are groomed, 2.5 km lighted for night skiing and some  panoramic views of nearby Woods Lake.
I sampled a small comfortable  cottage called a “tupa” for overnight lodging and walked through the Lapin  Tupa, which is a bigger dwelling that can be rented as private rooms by  couples/individuals or shared by a larger group. The tupa where I stayed had  electric heat, two bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen, a small family room, and  a woodstove. And when the snow is abundant, skiing from the front door and  around the property will have you shouting tervetuloa (greetings) to others.
The Finnish Line Lodge is  Lapland Lake’s main facility in a two-story building that literally rose from  the ashes as it burned to the ground years ago, was rebuilt and now houses the  retail store, rentals, fireside lounge area, and upstairs at the Kuuma Tupa  snack bar for soup, chili, or a beverage. The Tuulen Tupa Grill is a dining  room that has lunch and a catered dinner menu and it is slated for redecoration  by the Hirvonen’s daughter, who is studying interior design and will undertake  the project during her college break.
Lapland Lake welcomes people to cross country ski and snowshoe  from kids and seniors, to ladies and teachers in weekly group programs that are  scheduled. It has received the 2011 Certificate of Excellence from Trip Advisor  among other recognition awards in the past. Ann Hirvonen stopped during our  tour of the area and revealed that this was the spot she liked to stand at  night to look at the twinkling lights of the tupas in the winter - knowing that  people are enjoying it makes running Lapland   Lake all worth it to her.  You’ll say tavataan ladulla or “see you on the trails.”

Snowmaking at XC Ski Resorts Becomes Imperative
Trapp Family Lodge steeped in tradition in Stowe, VT  has been added to the ever increasing list of cross country (xc) ski resort  snowmakers. That’s right, they’re making machine-made snow at Trapp Family  Lodge. In fact, a list of xc ski area operators have dabbled in snowmaking over  the years is now at about 30 xc ski areas. The list includes Breckenridge Nordic Center in CO; Craftsbury Outdoor  Center in VT; Frisco Nordic Center in CO; Mountain Top Resort , and Trapp Family Lodge in VT; Bretton Woods and Great Glen Trails in NH, Pineland Farms in ME; Weston Ski Track in MA; Royal Gorge in  CA; and Soldier Hollow in UT.
Why did Trapp Family decide to invest in a snowmaking  operation? The availability of less expensive and portable snowmaking systems  are main motivations, but other business-driven issues are relevant too such as  filling lodge rooms and fulfilling season pass holders’ desire to extend the  ski season beyond Mother Nature’s whim.
Twenty years ago, one industry consultant dubbed the xc ski  resort quandary as “precipitation roulette,” and some business-oriented reasons  to install snowmaking include operational security to guarantee skiing  programs, and staffing; competitive advantage against other xc ski resorts that  do not have machine-made snow’ and guaranteeing snow cover n important holiday  periods (which can represent more than 30 percent of annual winter business).
The necessary elements of a snowmaking operation include  cold temperatures, water, high pressure, power, and system components such as  piping, pumps, compressors, and snow guns. The power requires both manpower and  energy supplied by electricity or fuel. There are many industry horror stories  about the night hours and difficulty of the work associated with snowmaking for  xc skiing. Getting the snow to efficiently cover a narrow corridor trail is  also a challenge. Many operations simply cover a field and then move the snow  to the trails.
Pineland Farms in Gloucester,   ME is making snow this year  because it wanted to ensure its ability to host local school and club race  programs and a one kilometer loop has been created with the intention to cover  a 5 km loop. Soldier Hollow in UT made snow to cover 2.2 km of trails and 4-6  lanes on the tubing hill while snowmakers used machines to make snow on 2 km of  trails at Craftsbury Outdoor  Center in VT.
But the most significant issue has always been the  investment required for many xc ski businesses that are small and seasonal. It  is now at a point where operators at Mountain Top Resort in Chittenden, VT  decided that snowmaking was a higher priority than selling retail products at  the xc ski center. Snowmaking supports so many aspects of the business from  rental operations and ski lessons to dog sledding and snowshoeing, In terms of  the guest perspective, winter guests expect to book travel to a destination and  get the experience that was desired…and that includes snow! Who knows, perhaps  there will be a day sometime soon when snowmaking will be a basic aspect of xc  skiing at commercial resorts.

Grand Opening Planned at Newest XC Ski Resort
The newest cross country ski  center in Vermont is the Strafford  Nordic Center in east central Vermont.  It is operated on two locally owned farms with scenic and varied terrain. The  20 km of groomed trails for classic and skate skiing are set on rolling fields  and wooded trails. The Strafford Nordic Center Grand Opening celebration is  scheduled for December 31st.
Strafford Nordic was created  to accommodate the need for local xc ski trails, use the land for its fullest  potential, and integrate community support and participation. The proprietors  including Jeremiah Linehan, Rhett Emerson, and Earl Ransom were raised on the  land now being used for the xc ski center and they want to make it the best  skiing experience for their guests.
Jeremiah Linehan was a Nordic  Combined competitor, who participated in regional, national, and international  competitions. Rhett Emerson grew up on the Tamarack Hill Farm, which is known  as a top rated equestrian training center. Earl Ransom was born and raised on  the Rock Bottom Farm, and he is founder and owner of Strafford Organic Creamery  a working organic dairy farm and producer of organic ice cream.
A variety of racing and  training programs are in the planning stages beginning with the Turkey Trot  race on the trails in November. A biathlon shooting range is also under  construction at the center and will be opened soon.
A recreational After School  Program will be run thanks to the support of the Strafford Athletic Association,  which is also supporting free rental equipment at the center for Strafford kids  under the age of 18. These are great examples of community involvement at Strafford Nordic Center.  Best of luck and jubilant applause from XCSkiResorts.com!

New Owners at Garnet Hill Lodge in NY
Garnet Hill Lodge in North River,  NY (Gore   Mountain area) was  acquired by new owners on December 9 and the change was celebrated at an Open  House on December 17. New owners Don Preuninger and Mindy Piper are from nearby  Johnsburg and Minerva, respectively and they’re raring to go.
The Garnet Hill Lodge is a rustic mountain lodge with the  charm of a country inn. It’s in the southeastern central region of the Adirondacks, which was the home of the now inactive Hooper  Mine that was established in 1893. The mine delivered the ore of the “Adirondack Ruby,” also known as garnet (the January birth gemstone). Many of  the businesses around North Creek and the Gore Mountain  area have counter top displays with homemade jewelry adorned with garnets.
The cross country skiing and snowshoeing at the Garnet Hill  Lodge is unique with its Tailings location on the property that is a  multi-level open area sculpted with hills, open slopes, flat areas, and  mountain vistas. Accommodations are in the lodge and in a loghouse and various  cabins, too. There are about 70 miles of trails near the lodge and there’s  backcountry skiing in the Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area.
The plan is to open the Garnet Hill Lodge during the  holidays. Presently there are new rental and retail cross country ski and  snowshoe products being received daily while trail improvements are underway, a  snowcat is getting a refurbishing makeover, and Chef Andrew prepares his menu  of fine cuisine.

2013 Ski for Light Week Planned
Ski for Light, Inc. is an organization founded in 1975 to  teach blind, visually- and mobility-impaired adults how to xc ski, in an  atmosphere that encourages participants to recognize that they can usually  accomplish much more, both on the snow and back home in everyday life.
Each year Ski for Light, Inc. conducts a week-long event  where blind and mobility-impaired adults are taught the basics of cross-country  skiing. The  SFL week at Snow Mountain Ranch in CO attracted 289 people and  68 first-timers including participants and guides. The location of the event  changes from year to year in an effort to spread the Ski for Light philosophy  and idea to as many parts of the country as possible. This winter the week was  at Soldier Hollow near Provo,   UT and in 2013 the scheduled week is Jan 27-Feb 3 at Shanty Creek Resort near Bellaire, MI..
During the Ski for Light week each disabled skier is paired  for the entire week with an experienced, sighted, cross-country skier who acts  as ski instructor and guide. The disabled person skis in tracks or grooves in  the snow, while the guide skis along side. The guide offers instructional tips  and suggestions, support and encouragement, and describes the countryside.
The blind and mobility-impaired adults, who attend the Ski  for Light week, come from all over the U.S. and from several foreign  countries. Many of them come to Ski for Light with a desire to become more  physically active and fit, and to find recreational opportunities that are  lacking at home. Most of the SFL skiers discover, in the process of learning  how to xc ski, that they can accomplish much more than others have told them,  and much more than they themselves believed. They leave Ski for Light with a  sense of accomplishment and motivation that carries over to every aspect of  their lives back home.
The volunteer guides, who attend Ski for Light, are a very  special group of people. They pay the same event fees as disabled skiers so  that they can share a favorite activity with someone who would otherwise not  have the opportunity to participate. Most of these guides discover that in the  process of giving of themselves they are getting as much or more back in  return. Many of them return to each event, year after year.

1960 Olympic Nordic Event Legacy
The Squaw Valley Winter Olympics held in 1960 led the way to  many technological advances that shaped today’s operation and broadcasting of  the Winter Olympics. The Nordic event venues built in Tahoma, CA  are now covered with dense new growth as all of the structures, which were  temporary, have been removed. The land located on Route 89 about 10 miles south  of Tahoe City  on the west side of Lake Tahoe is now the Ed  Z’berg Sugar Pine Point State Park.
The Nordic venues and practice areas for the men’s 50 km, 30  km, combined, and relay races were held in the General Creek and McKinney Creek  areas, which were privately owned when the Squaw Valley Olympics was in the  planning stages. These games were also the first time that the biathlon and  women’s 10 km were included at the Olympics. The 57 km of trails were developed  in 1958 and completed in 1959 for a test run championship.
The 1960 Winter Olympics were the first time the winter  competitions were ever nationally broadcast on TV. This was also the first time  that sno-cat grooming vehicles were used to mechanically groom the race  courses. Tucker Sno-cat machines towed agricultural choppers and tines to “tenderize” the snow conditions. They had yet to think of track setters in today’s  terms, so skiers set the tracks by skiing behind the grooming machines. The  downhill sections were raked by hand.
Another first was the use of electrical and manual timing.  To keep spectators abreast of the competition, interval times of the racers  were taken along the trail and were phoned to the stadium area where they were  announced to the spectators and posted on the scoreboard.
Since there are few remnants from the Nordic events  remaining, there is now an effort to reinvigorate these “forgotten Olympics” in  a partnership with the state park to reestablish the trail network, construct  interpretive panels and trail markers, and develop a museum of historical  artifacts. Currently there is an Olympic exhibit at the Reno  Airport and there is some signage at Sugar Park   Point State    Park. For more information there is a book by  David Antonucci entitled “Snowball’s Chance: The Story of the 1960 Winter  Olympic Games,” which is filled with information and photos.

US Nordic Combined Team Winners Talk with           XCSkiResorts.com
The Winter Olympics were first held in 1924 and 86 years passed before the           US had a gold medalist cross country skier standing on a podium at the famous           quadrennial competition. Bill Demong of Vermontville, NY was the man to           attain the gold amongst a team destined to gather hardware in the 2010           Vancouver Olympics. In past games, American cross country skiers have had as           much promise, but they have not delivered as expected, until the 2010 US           Nordic Combined Team stepped up to the podium with individual gold and silver           medals and a team silver medal. Johnny Spillane, Bill Demong, and Todd           Lodwick had previously won world championships (Demong in 2009) and were           internationally ranked 8th, 10th, and 13th respectively in the Nordic           Combined World Cup standings last February.
Johnny Spillane broke the ice with a silver medal in the first competition           for the team at the new facility built for the games outside of Whistler,           British Columbia. He appeared to have the gold in hand but he was caught from           behind by a Frenchman with only 4 tenths of one second remaining to the           finish line. The French guy was born in the USA and lives in Missoula, MT. It           was also tough luck for American Todd Lodwick, who led that race for 95           percent of the time and then ended up in 4th. His comment, "Fourth place           sucks." American Bill Demong, who started in 24th position after his           jump, made it back to finish in sixth place. Add it all up and the Americans           had three finishers in the top six and things bode well for the team           competition in Nordic Combined later in the week. Spillane commented, "I           spent too much energy catching the racer ahead, who it turned out was already           dead on his skis." Spillane said that he was so spent that he didn't           even remember entering the stadium or being passed. "Obviously, you want           to win the gold, but what counted was that I was satisfied with my           performance." He also spoke about "added pressure in the team           competition compared to the individual races because it is more for country           and your teammates."
Spillane and his wife had a baby girl last July and he also had a knee           operation in the summer. The baby and the rehabilitation will slow his           getting back into the competitive fray until late January. He realizes that           with a baby that "it will be tougher to be on the road so much and hard           to keep motivated this year."
Bill Demong is a goal and plan oriented fellow and after the Olympics he           took a couple of weeks reflecting and decided to "enjoy and continue           success with the team and individually and try to defend my           championships."
Demong's story is made for TV. After winning the gold in Vancouver in the           Nordic Combined big jump, he proposed marriage to his girlfriend and then was           selected by the US Olympic Team athletes to carry the flag in the closing           ceremonies. "It was a whirlwind of a few days but a perfect ending to a           perfect Olympics," commented Demong about the "pretty hectic and           exciting" time immediately following his triumphs. But why no Wheaties           box cover? Demong said "those things are predetermined before the games           even start."
A few years back his career was hanging in the balance after a serious           accident in a swimming pool. "Fracturing my skull was the turning point           in my career as it gave me a year off to recuperate and redefine why I wanted           to ski and what I wanted to get out of it. I like to get my angry out and           chase people." And then in the 2009 World Championships in the team           competition, Demong made headlines for misplacing his racing bib amidst his           racing outfit. The US team was disqualified in that competition but his           teammates were quick to forgive him. After the incident, he not only went out           and won the big jump world championship, but later in the month he took gold           at the King's Cup in Vikersund, Norway, which is considered one of the           highest honors in Nordic Combined competition.
Do Olympic Athletes Turn those Medals into Cash?
The Nordic Combined Olympic medal winners have been very busy since the           Vancouver games. Both Spillane and Demong spoke of their trip to army bases           in Iraq and they've done plenty of fund raisers to help various causes and           ski programs. Spillane said, "It was so busy for 3-4 months and now it           is calming down. For sure you make money, but it is not six figures." He           commented that "it is a small window and there are not as many           opportunities as I thought. The ski team helps with training but does not           line much up financially" for these athletes and it sounds like there           was very little lined up in advance.
Demong also said there were more opportunities after winning Olympic gold           but he pointed to the nonfinancial opportunities that are very meaningful           such as supporting a renovation of Dewey Mountain where he grew up skiing,           and developing a new company. He wants to take advantage of "new venues           that were opened up so he can build something long term and make a           difference." Both skiers spoke of their development work with younger           skiers as "giving back to the sport."
There was some sniping at the Olympics about the weather advantage for some           of the jumpers in Nordic Combined events and upon being asked about it Demong           commented, "It seems that at every event the weather causes whining, but           it evens out. The best skiers usually win." And it also seems that Bill           Demong taking an individual gold medal and a team silver medal was indeed the           best Nordic Combined skier at the Vancouver games. Congratulations!

Ski For           Heat Warms Hearts & Homes in Vermont
Vermont is known for long, cold,           and snowy winters and the Ski for Heat program is a FUNdraiser to warm hearts           and homes for some less fortunate people, who live in towns across this rural           state. Ski for Heat provides direct and immediate assistance to help low           income families stay warm by for example, purchasing fuel to burn in the           furnace. This year the Ski for Heat xc ski pledge program was held at Wild Wings in Peru, VT on January 29th and raised about $20,000.
As a sign of the economic times, "the number of people seeking           help is increasing exponentially," said Central Vermont Community Action           Council (CVCAC) staff person Sarah Phillips. Money is raised by participants,           who cross country ski or snowshoe in the program. They solicit "per           kilometer" pledges or direct donations from family, friends, businesses,           and organizations.
The Ski for Heat program has been           operating in southern Vermont at Wild Wings in Peru, Vermont for 12 years           where it has raised about $220,000 for fuel assistance. While this program is           a typical pledge-style fundraiser, helping low income families stay warm in           the winter is central to the issue of energy equity in an economy that is           squeezing those who must choose between food, heat, and other essentials.           Skiing participants can feel that they are supporting their neighbors-in-need           by their efforts as the money comes from within the local region to support           local people. Program founder, Martha Robertson says, "We make the           program as easy as possible to participate…there's no registration fee and no           specific minimum requirements of donations or time. Program donations come           from local businesses, families, and individuals. For many businesses, it is           just good will."
The Ski for Heat program is           sponsored by Clark's Quality Foods and other businesses. Skiers or snowshoers           come and go as they please. They keep track of the kilometers that they ski.           Last year, Robertson's program not only received the Governor's Award for           Outstanding Community Service, but former Vermont Governor Douglas and his wife           visited Wild Wings to participate on snowshoes.
The Ski for Heat Ski-A-Thon appreciates that Chuck Black of Wild Wings donates the use of the trails for the day,           which means there is no charge to ski. Rental equipment is discounted for           participants, too. The Bennington-Rutland Opportunity Council helps with the           program to direct funds to people that need it. All donations           up to $5,000 were matched dollar-for-dollar by CVPS Shareholders (the           regional electric company).
There's no need to be a "hot" skier to Ski for Heat. Why not help some neighbors keep warm           this winter? For more info check with the xc ski areas or www.skiforheat.org

The Case for Skiing at Commercial XC Ski Resorts
Is there a difference between cross country skiing at a  commercial center and “in the woods?” Are people aware about the difference  between designed trails at a commercial xc ski area compared to cross country  skiing in a field, in a local park, or on a trail in the forest?
One of the greatest obstacles for xc skiing growth is the  common notion of a lone xc skier going into a narrow dark trail as if the very  isolation in the woods was the goal. Interestingly, some ski areas have  marketed that isolationism, but there are a few things that focus on the average  recreation enthusiasts’ experience that are offered on designed trails at a  commercial xc ski resort.
Often trails that are built by loggers and the government  parks’ people have long straight ascents and descents and they are boring. Most  average skiers are very afraid of the speed of a long downhill. Instead, trail  designers such as John Morton of Morton   Trails recommend  undulating and twisting trails that spark interest on every turn and also help  slow down the speed. Destinations, scenic vistas, and accomplishment upon  arrival make great sense on xc ski trails and these are characteristics of what  well-designed trails should provide.
Most commercial xc ski resorts charge a fee between $15 and  $29. For that fee the patron (hopefully) get a business operation and trails  that:
* are designed for xc skiing or snowshoeing in harmony with  the environment and are skier-friendly;
* are regularly maintained or groomed, and include tracks  and a lane for skaters;
* can be expected to be free of debris or fallen trees and  provide consistent skiable quality;
* are signed with available and understandable maps;
* have quality rental equipment that enhance the activity  (easy to use and help the average skier to control themselves);
* offer ski instruction in various forms (kids, women,  group, private) with an area for the learners where they are not embarrassingly  in front or back of the lodge;
* include a food and beverage service;
* offer special organized programs for school kids, older  folks, etc;
* has a facility where people can change clothes, get warm,  or socialize;
* includes a friendly helpful staff, who can share local  information;
* has ski patrollers to help, if necessary; and so on.
Yes, admittedly many people can xc ski out their back door  in the backyard, on a local golf course, or on a trail in a nearby forest and  it is very convenient to do so. But commercial xc ski resorts offer a different  skiing product. New Hampshire’s Jackson Ski  Touring Center, emulated by hundreds of xc ski resorts across North   America could be thought of as quintessential because it provides  a perfect example of most of those services and amenities.  The investment required to supply the list of  services above is no small number (snowcat grooming machines and such), but Jackson has something more  and it is called the “culture of xc skiing.” This is why Jackson can be considered one of the true  meccas of xc skiing.
Of course, the major issue with noncommercial cross country  ski trails is about snow conditions. The whim of the weather rules the snow and  without trail grooming and trail maintenance, the snow can be to hard packed,  icy, sticky, too deep for nonpowder skiers, or too inconsistent to offer a good  experience.
The statistics have shown over many years that less than 20  percent of xc ski outings are at commercial resorts. Skiers that experience the  other 80 percent of the xc skiing outings are missing out on the list of  services above and many of them are not even aware that those services exist.  It needs to be spelled out for them and an effort needs to be made to  differentiate commercial ski area experience from backyard skiing.

Bohart           Kids Science Program is AWE-some!
Bohart Ranch in Bozeman, MT has developed a unique program with the Montana Outdoor           Science School called Adventures in Winter Ecology Ski Program (AWE). Bohart           has offered a half day Nordic Adventure Ski Program since 1983 but the desire           was to provide more in-depth ecology instruction and environmental awareness           to kids.
Bohart is very proud of the success           of the AWE Program, which has grown exponentially in popularity and has been fine           tuned during the past 9 years. An aim of these programs is to expose kids to           an awareness of their outdoor environment and introduce them to a sense of           responsibility as stewards of our environment, while also exciting them about           the lifelong activity of xc skiing.
The AWE program gives kids the           opportunity for hands-on field exploration with a guided focus that compliments school ecology curriculum. Topics such as animal fur and           feathers, adaptations, skeletons, snow, watersheds, and people of the snow           are typical. The cost is $14 per student for a full day program that includes           lunch or $8 per student for a half day program.
The Montana Outdoor Science School provided the curriculum and materials           based on state science standards and trained the Bohart instructors to           present the lessons. Many of the ski instructors have college degrees in           natural science disciplines. It seems natural that many xc ski instructors,           who enjoy being outdoors and love xc skiing also, have educational           backgrounds in environmental areas.
Program Director Theresa Leland commented, "For me the awe part of our           Adventures In Winter Ecology Program is the reward of seeing a sense of           wonder and awe on the faces of young skiers as we pass our passion along to           the next generation....and I love telling people about it! It is a lot of           fun."
The AWE programs are a popular field trip for parents, who volunteer to           chaperone and there is often a 2:3 ratio of parent chaperones to student           skiers. The AWE program is a great way to turn kids on to the outdoors and           learning and it can be copied at other cross country ski areas.

This winter, 4,373           kids participated in the Passport program.
The "FunPass" provides           coupons downloadable from the WinterKids Web site for pre-school to 4th grade           kids to cross country ski or snowshoe at commercial cross country ski areas.           This winter, 826 kids signed up for the FunPass.
The "Guide to Outdoor Active           Learning" engages teachers and students with active and scholastically           challenging outdoor winter lessons and games. It is a tool that incorporates           the respective snow sport disciplines and it meets state and national           educational standards while using the wonders of the winter outdoors to           deliver effective lessons in many subjects.
The "Active Academics           Workshop" brings the "Guide to Outdoor Active Learning" to           schools and provides an opportunity for teachers to see how physically           active, experiential learning may be incorporated into the school day. This           winter, 2,363 elementary school kids experienced Active Academics Workshops.
The WinterKids program has been           endorsed by Maine's governor, senator, Superintendent association, Principal           association, the National Association of Physical Education and others.           Teachers, scout leaders, after-school coordinators, rec centers, fitness           gurus, or others that are interested can get more info or initiate the           WinterKids program in a new area using the existing program materials for the           respective snow sport disciplines at www.WinterKids.org or 207-871-5700.

Adventure           Guides for a Great Winter Experience
These days, cross country skiing is           easy on groomed trails due to improvements in ski equipment and regular trail           grooming. But, the secret is that great winter ski experiences can be had as           a guided adventure in the backcountry.
Perhaps the term backcountry skiing paints pictures of avalanches and extreme skiing movies. The fact is that this type of cross country skiing can mean anything from a quiet morning tromp through the woods, getting back in time for a bowl of hot soup in front of the fireplace, to a challenging all-day trip to the top of the world. You can maneuver your skis up hills and then swoosh back down...but if you don't want any hills, you can ski over frozen snow covered lakes, alongside rivers, or through meadows.
Guides can virtually hold you by           the hand or offer a recommendation for a self-guided tour. They can suggest           appropriate equipment and clothing to make it a more comfortable experience           and they can offer ski instruction to a first timer. Expect an experienced           guide to help intermediate skiers master higher skill levels or lead advanced           skiers on more extreme expeditions reaching new heights.
Adventure guides can plan your trip           to match your skill level and desired intensity. The value of a guide is that           your comfort level is increased multifold. That is because the experienced           guide knows about trail and terrain selection to fit the skier level; he or           she knows technique tips to help successfully crossing terrain in different           types of snow conditions, but most of all the guide will give you personal           attention and help you to avoid backcountry calamity.
A resort vacation is great, but           while you're there take half a day with a guide to ski off into the untouched           powder where the snow is fresh and fluffy. The pace might be like a hiking           trip - where you can hustle along if you're looking for a killer workout, or           just take your time and enjoy the scenery. Most ski guides love to talk, too           - so expect some gab about local historical, geological or interpretive to           provide a more informative and interesting experience.

Fees in           the UnFriendly Skies
Travelers are experiencing fees for           everything under sun when they travel domestically by air these days. Recent           articles in First Tracks and Tripso.com point to the particulars of checked           bag fees EACH WAY for each traveler.
New info from the National Ski Club           Newsletter informs us that United Airlines baggage fee has been increased to           $20 for the first checked bag and $30 for the second checked bag...but if you           pay on line there is a $5 discount. The airline industry collected $1.1           billion for checked bag fees last year with American Airlines alone           collecting $278 million.
These fees are quite a hit to a           flying family of four…but there's more.
Southwest Airlines does not charge           fees for up to two bags that are checked and it has posted a chart on its Web           site that covers fees of the other airlines. Some of the airlines now charge           fees for phone reservations, curbside check in, priority seating (requesting           an aisle or window), oversize baggage fee (penalty for skiers and           snowboarders), first and second checked baggage, unaccompanied minor, meals,           alcohol, and beverage/snack. There must be jokes about using the restroom on           board (fee to pee?). And will fees soon be charged for even carry-on bags?
Why have the airlines instituted           these fees? Well, one answer might be "because they can," but the           corporation's common refrain is that the fees are needed as a surcharge to           offset the increased cost of fuel. Most people can accept that - remember the summer of 2008 when the cost of a barrel of oil topped $140? But, the price is           now below that for a barrel of oil, and there has only been one airline that           has eliminated some of the fees in correlation to the decline in fuel costs.
There are various "bailout" programs that are now marketed by vacation services,           whereby if you commit to a longer vacation that includes lodging and other           associated expenses or stipulations, a reservation service might offer a           limited discount to offset the airline fees.
Will more ski travelers opt to rent           gear at their ski destination rather than lugging their own equipment through           airport terminals and stuffing it in rental cars? Time will tell how people           react to this new round of increased travel costs.

Skijoring:           Enjoying Winter Trails with Your Dog by Louisa Morrissey
Skijoring is a Norwegian word that           means "skidriving." A team of one or more dogs pulls an xc skier           and the skier "drives" or directs the team as he or she skis           behind. In Scandinavia, skijoring has been done for centuries and it is           gaining popularity in the US. It is simple to learn and can lead to man           magical winter days for you and your canine friend. Skijoring will help keep           your dog fit and healthy and it can deepen and enhance the relationship that           you have with your dog. Learning to work with your dog and become a team is a           great reward that skijoring has to offer.
The Skier
The human aspect of skijoring requires skiing ability, dog training, and           handling skills. Any xc ski gear can be used for skijoring and classic or skating           ski techniques can be used. The type of ski selected depends on the           experience that your desire such as how fast you want to ski and how far you           want to go. Expect that a fast running dog on a groomed ski trail will be           very quick and skating might be the best choice.
If you are new to xc skiing, it is           recommended that you take ski lessons and practice prior to trying skijoring           with your dog. Ski ability requires that you are able to control your speed,           stop, and keep balance. But as previously mentioned, skijoring is a team           activity and you should expect to work as hard as your dog. It is not a FREE           RIDE!
Dog training and handling skills are equally important so it is useful if you and your dog have participated           in an obedience class together. Key elements include being positive, patient,           and consistent. Positive reinforcement is important with any animal training           and short simple sessions will yield great results. You want to feel           successful and gain confidence together.
The Dog
No matter the breed (above 30 pounds), dogs have a strong instinct to hunt as           a pack. While sometimes this instinct can result in unwanted behavior, when           carefully shaped and trained, it also enables your dog to pull. One of the           easiest ways to teach your dog skijoring is hooking him/her up with an           experienced skijoring or sled dog team. Another method that works is to have           someone ski slightly in front of your dog and call it, while you let it pull           you.
Some dogs may learn immediately and           others may take a little more work and encouragement, but keep things in           perspective.
Dogs need adequate water and it is           recommended not to run then on a full stomach. They can overheat in warmer           temperatures (above 40 degrees) and dogs with thin coats (such as pointers)           can get too cold. You might consider dog booties for abrasive snow conditions           (may take some getting used to) and for furry footed dogs, you should trim           the hair on their paws or used oils (Musher's Secret) to prevent snowballs.           If your dog is not regularly exercised, start with very short sessions and           work up from there. Consult a veterinarian for advice about ideal running           weight for the breed of dog that you own.
Skijoring Equipment
The gear for skijoring is lightweight and simple. Booties have already been           mentioned and a harness is necessary to connect you with the dog. A webbed harness when pulled to complete length stretches from your dog's neck and           chest to the base of his/her tail. A good fitting harness should allow a dog           to run and pull efficiently and safely. It is best to have an experienced and           knowledgeable skijorer help to fit your dog's first harness. A bungee lead (a           leash with a bungee cord sewn inside of it) is useful to prevent jerking           motions and ease the stress of pulling on your dog. You will also have a harness           around your hips and legs and these come in a variety of styles that should           fit so that you can move and ski efficiently. A safety release between your           harness and the line connecting you to the dog is very important.
Communication and Sharing
When you are ready to go, with a friend in front to encourage your dog, let           him/her start pulling and give the command "Let's Go!"
There are many commands you will           learn as a skijorer such as "whoa" or stop, "on by" meaning leave that irresistible distraction alone and keep going, "gee" means go right and "haw" means go left. "Come           around" means turn around. Taking a class in skijoring will help you get           started the right way.
While on the trails with your dog           please be aware of trail etiquette. Respect the guidelines at an xc ski area           and stay on the dog-friendly trails that are specified. Loose dogs can be an           annoyance and even a danger to both skiers and other dogs. Be aware of others           on the trail.
Louisa Morrissey teaches skijoring           clinics in Colorado. at Devil's Thumb in Tabernash, CO (970-726-8231); at the Canine Country School in Gypsum, CO             (970-524-1440); or by reservation at Gold Run               Nordic in Breckenridge, CO (970-547-7889).

Yellowstone Begins to Adapt
According           to a story in the Casper Star-Tribune in Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park's           largest concessionaire Xanterra Parks & Resorts is offering services           including more groomed xc ski trails, ice skating, and massage therapy at the           Snow Lodge. The company still has snowmobile tours, but winter business in           the park and the gateway town of West Yellowstone is undergoing a shift that           is less focused on resolving the long standing dispute about snowmobiles in           the park and more about adapting to a changing market.
Presently           720 snowmobiles are allowed in Yellowstone daily and all of them must be           accompanied by commercial guides. A third major study of the associated           issues has now created a permanent plan for snowmobile use in the park. The           business in the town has been dependent upon the snowmobile tourism, but the           national park should be a draw with or without the machines. The geysers and           wildlife are great attractions for winter enthusiasts and so is the access to           human-powered winter recreation such as snowshoeing, cross-country skiing,           and winter camping.
The           companies that provide winter snowcoach tours have increased fleets and the           snowcoach ridership has increased. At the same time, the number of           snowmobiles decreased 20 percent last year compared to previous years. It is           unknown whether the lack of snow last year was the prevalent factor causing           the downturn in business or if the politics associated with the battle about           snowmobiles had a negative effect. An updated report showed that since 2003,           visitor interest in snowmobiling in the park has been about 250 per day. The           National Park Service has reported that Yellowstone's air has improved           dramatically in the past few winters resulting from a decrease in snowmobile           traffic and increased snowcoach use.
There           is a new Old Faithful Express snowcoach service out of West Yellowstone with           few stops getting visitors to Old Faithful more quickly so they can have more           time to explore the trails before taking the return shuttle. There should           also be express skier drops at Seven Mile Bridge or at Madison Junction for a           14-mile ski back to the park's West Entrance.
The Rendezvous Trails in West Yellowstone has a           full slate of competition race events but town businesses and the park will           need to increase the volume of recreational events, programs, and special           offers as well as marketing efforts to encourage more winter awareness and           visitation to the region. It sure appears to be a great place for family vacations!
New           Info About Yellowstone Park From the Outdoor Industry Association
The           National Park Service established a new policy about snowmobiling at           Yellowstone Park. It defers the implementation of a final new policy until           the winter of 2008-2009, leaving the existing level of snowmobile use in Yellowstone capped at 720 machines per day for this winter of 2007-2008.
* Actual use in recent years has averaged from 250 to 290 snowmobiles a           day.
The policy decreases the cap on snowmobile use in Yellowstone from 720 to           540 machines when the new policy kicked in during the 2008-2009 winter and it           required that all snowmobiles and snowcoaches use the best available           technology aimed at reducing noise and emissions.
All snowmobiles  have to be led by commercial guides.
The Blue Ribbon Coalition has said it will sue in protest of the lower           snowmobile numbers and commercial-only rule. The conservation community is           likely to file suit as well. Conservation groups want snowcoaches to           transport tourists in the park. They cite government research that says noise           and air pollution levels are too high even with the reduced snowmobiling and           cleaner machines. The "sue you, sue me" blues continue and there           appear to be little interest for negotiating by the sides. Can't we share the           park?

Milestones of Modern XC Skiing in the USA
Since the time that wooden skis were found in a peat bog in Sweden dating           to 2,000 BC, there have been many milestones that brought xc skiing to where           it is today. Focusing on the USA, the forefathers of our recreation include           people such as Snowshoe Thompson, who delivered the mail in the Sierra           Mountains of California and JackRabbit Johannsen, who xc skied in northern           New York.
The editors of XCSkiResorts.com using various sources considered the           milestones and developed this list of the Milestones of Modern XC Skiing in           the USA in order of significance:
1. Development of synthetic xc skis in 1974.
2. Development of the waxless based ski in the early 1970's, most notably the           Trak ski with synthetic fishscales on the ski base to eliminate the need for           ski waxes. The waxless base gave the recreational skier grip on uphill travel           while also allowing gliding downhill.
3. Integrated xc ski binding systems, which provided substantial improvements           in simplicity of boot/binding interface and control in the mid 70's.
4. Bill Koch won the Olympic silver medal in 1976 and World Cup in 1982, the           first American to ever win at that level. The Nordic Trak exerciser used the           Koch image as a fitness icon in advertisements for years. In 2010, there was US Olympic medalists in Nordic Combined and in 2012 there was a World Cup winner in women's sprint.
5. The onset of the commercial xc ski area concept began in 1968-69 at Trapp Family Lodge . This brought designed, groomed,           and maintained trails making xc skiing easier and safer for the average           person.
6. The skating technique proliferated for a faster paced and higher           performance form of recreation.
7. Revolution Skis developed by Fischer led the way to shorter skis, which           were easier to use and consolidated ski sizing and simplified ski selection.
8. New lighter clothing with synthetic and breathable materials was more           conducive to xc skiing comfortably; company brands such as Mother Karen led           the way in the late 1970's.
9. Other technological advances such as the 2 Wax System that offered one wax           for cold temperatures and one for warm temperatures simplified ski waxing           while the BackCountry binding systems provided a beefed up boot/binding system           that provided substantially more support and control for backcountry           recreation.
10. Will the Nordic Integrated System (NIS) developed in 2005 change the           ski/binding interface? This system combines the ski and binding at           manufacture rather than at the retail store.

Smart Ski Travel Using the Internet
Here are some ski travel tips from Charles Leocha of SkiSnowboard.com, the           SkiSnowboard America and Canada guidebook, and MSNBC about booking a ski trip           or vacation using the Internet (we've incorporated xc skiing) - excerpted           from SkiPress Magazine.
1. Booking hotels - Leocha suggests to use Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz,           and Priceline to find packages that combine air, lodging, transfers or rental           cars, and lift tickets. If you are an xc skier or snowshoer, who does not           want to go alpine skiing or snowboarding, the lift ticket aspect is useless           to you. Additionally, it is unlikely that many xc ski resorts are involved           with these conglomerate Web sites and we think that you can get the best           price on lodging if you work directly with the resorts that are on           XCSkiResorts.com. But you could very well find great prices by combining the           other aspects of your trip (air and vehicle). Leocha recommends using           Sidestep.com, which compares packages from a collection of different Web           sites.
2. Booking flights - Use aggregator and meta-search engine Web sites such           as Sidestep.com, Kayak.com, or mobissimo.com. They search multiple airline           sites and offer info in an easily comparable format. None of these sites           include Southwest Airlines, so you need to go directly to Southwest.com for           the best deals that involve that airline. Leocha recommends that after           finding info about flights, book directly with the airline Web site to save           service charges that are added by travel agents and aggregators.
3. Rental Cars - Orbitz.com displays a great matrix of available rental           cars and you can usually get better prices at off-airport locations (they           require a shuttle trip from the airport to get there). Leocha also suggests           that Priceline.com has the best prices because of the "Name-your-own-price" booking engine. Be aware that you are not           allowed to change the dates of the car rental with this service.
4. Traveling with Ski Gear - Check with the airline about free luggage           limits when it comes to skis because some airlines now charge an additional           fee to transport skis. Leocha suggests that you take your ski boots on the           trip and rent the skis. This idea allows you to try different ski brands,           models, and higher performance skis. Of course, with xc skiing you need to be           aware of the different binding systems so if you have a Salomon boot or NNN           boot, you need to have the respective binding on the rental skis. Call the           resort ahead to double check about this issue.
5. Get the Facts - It's best to clearly understand what is included in           your ski trip. Does the package price include trail fees? Does the resort           offer breakfasts and lunch? Can you find out in advance about other services           that are available such as massage or swimming pool availability? Do you want           backcountry guided ski trips or do you like to ski on groomed trails, need           nearby alpine skiing?
We obviously think that starting with XCSkiResorts.com is a great idea to           compare resort alternatives. Create a list of places you've been and           destinations that you want to visit. For more info about the "meccas of           xc skiing," check out the recommendation lists on the XCSkiResorts.com           Top 10 Page. Have a great trip!

GREEN EFFORTS at XC SKI RESORTS
Many of the operators of cross country (xc) ski areas are eco-active, or           in other words they are exemplary of the "greening" of xc skiing.           They pay heed to ideals such as: protecting scenic values and wildlife           habitats, practicing water and energy conservation, reducing waste and           reusing products, designing and building facilities in an           environmentally-sensitive manner, managing forest and vegetation properly,           handling potentially hazardous waste properly and educating their clientele           and staff about environmental awareness and their eco-activity. Some common           themes among operators are evident, such as, wildlife sensitivity, using           biodegradable hydraulic fluid in snowcats that groom the trails, and trail           designing for streambed protection. These eco-active efforts are not           typically hundred thousand dollar investments, but xc ski area operators have           much to be proud of with many small but meaningful accomplishments.
Many areas are conducting environmental interpretive group programs and           many display trail signs to tell their environmental story. For example, a           simple idea that is done at Kirkwood Cross Country in Kirkwood,           California is the listing of recent wildlife sightings on its trailhead           blackboard. At Devil's Thumb Ranch in           Tabernash, Colorado, a geothermal heating system is used in the majority of           its new buildings. The system consists of glycol-filled pipes that have been           installed in the Ranch's on site lake. Heat is transferred to the glycol from           the water, and then heated to 105 degrees by compressors in each building.           The pipes are placed in the flooring providing radiant heat. The system uses           very little electricity.
The White Grass Ski Touring Center in           Canaan, WV is the recipient of the WV Environmental Council's 2003 Green           Entrepreneurs Award. The facility is heated soley with wood and used about           $2.50 worth of electricity a day. Environmental education is a key element at           White Grass as there are regular outings in the WV Highlands Conservancy and           the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge.
Craftsbury Outdoor Center in VT has incorporated sustainability in its mission statement and set an ambitious goal to be fossil-fuel free by the end of 2012. They use solar panels for electric, highly efficient wood-fired boilers for heating, and a solar hot water system. The food and compost system is working to minimize trash and help to grow food in the on-site gardens.
Want to visit a sustainable resort that practices what it  preaches? Nipika Mountain Resort in BC is off grid for its power. It uses  micro-hydro and solar. The furniture is built on site with wood from trees that  were killed by the Mountain Pine Beetle. The "Interpretive Trappers  Cabin" is loaded with info about wildlife, natural surrounding, history,  telescope, and more.
Ted Young of Boundary Country Trekking on the Gunflint Trail in MN will offset the carbon           produced on the Banadad Trail (such as snowmobile grooming) by investing in           reforestation in the area. They'll determine the cubic tons of carbon           emissions associated with trail maintenance volunteers' transportation to the           site and grooming machinery and other mechanical equipment used on the trail.           They will sequester a number of acres to match the amount of carbon taken by           red and white pines to derive a dollar amount value to contribute to the "Gunflint Green Up" tree-planting program. This is a planting           estimated at 75,000 trees! Boundry Country Trekking has a sustainability           statement and a comprehensive implemention plan at the             boundary country implementation.html that is tops in the xc ski world.
A photovoltaic solar power system, which is           producing as much power in a year as they consume was installed at Stump Sprouts in           Hawley, MA. All of the buildings are heated with and most of the hot water           comes from wood sustainably harvested from the woods adjoining the trail           system. All food waste is composted and they recycle about 2/3 of the           remaining waste. They try to serve as much locally grown food as possible and           grow most of their own produce in the summer. At estimated 40 percent of the           Stump Sprout guests live within 30 miles of the trails.
Soldier Hollow, which was the Utah site of all of the Nordic skiing           events at the 2002 Olympics has an 11,000 square foot lodge built with           recycled timbers as construction materials for building beams, columns,           perlins, siding, interior roof, baseboard, and casing. Approximately 90           percent of the wood used in the lodge was salvaged from a 1902 railroad           trestle that once crossed the Great Salt Lake. The bridge was no longer used           in the 1950's and a wood reclamation project extracted the materials from           under the water. Devil's Thumb Ranch has also rescued a Civil War-era barn           from Indiana to frame its Broad Axe Barn with hand-hewn white oak and beech           beams. In addition, the Ranch's roads and parking lots are constructed with           recycled asphalt from a highway construction project.
Other Eco-Active Examples
An inventive environmental idea at Sleepy Hollow Inn, located in           Huntington, Vermont runs its tractor on bio-diesel fuel, which is comprised           of any kind of vegetable oil. This reduces emissions such as carbon monoxide,           but it also provides better engine lubricity and is less expensive to run.           Sleepy Hollow also offers free skiing (one time) to anyone, who drives to the           area's trails in a hybrid, electric or bio-diesel powered vehicle. Maplelag in Callaway, Minnesota is an active           tree farm on the White Earth Indian Reservation where it has planted           thousands of trees and has created more than 20 ponds to benefit wildlife           there. Hardwood Hills in Oro Station, Ontario designed and installed a           septic system that recovers most of the water, which enters the system. The           water is filtered, diluted, and recycled for use in the snowmaking system. Devil's Thumb Ranch has installed EPA-approved           specially designed chimneys that minimize emissions from wood burning           fireplaces.
Cross country skiing brings people outdoors to appreciate nature - and at           such a slow pace, skiers can not help but be affected by nature's beauty and           spiritual wonder. Many xc ski area operators are committed to creating and           implementing innovative and effective environmental programs to enhance           eco-awareness and foster responsible stewardship of natural resources. It's a           natural symbiotic relationship!
Ski Walking - Get           Ready for the Season by Hiking with Poles
By Pete Edwards of www.SkiWalking.com
One way to prepare for the ski season - ski walking! And           it's a healthful fitness activity, too.
Dr. Christiane Northrup, author of "Mother-Daughter           Wisdom" and "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom," said "My           Ski Walking poles have been a terrific addition to my regular exercise program.           I love the way they incorporate my upper body during a walk, thus giving me           more strength-training and calorie burning for the time spent. I highly           recommend them to everyone!"
Ski           Walking, also called Nordic Walking, is the fastest growing fitness activity           in Europe. Over 760,000 Finns of all ages and all fitness levels are hiking           with their poles - that's 20% of Finland's entire population and millions are           Ski Walking all across Europe.
The Finns saw the success of their elite skiers           utilizing poles in the summer for Ski Walking and Hill Bounding. They also           saw how a hiker with knee pain could eliminate the pain while hiking by using           a walking stick and back packers complaining that their backs hurt until they           were given poles. So with some removable rubber tips over special carbide           ferrules, and the most comfortable xc ski pole straps they could find it was           discovered that the perfect length poles for recreational Ski Walking were           poles that put the Ski Walker's elbow at 90 degrees when strapped in and           standing tall.
Ski Walking not only provides a better aerobic and           cardio workout than regular walking, but radically reduces the pounding and           stress to the knees, hips and back. And folks with sore or new knees, sore or           new hips, back problems, MS, Parkinson's, running injuries including shin           splints, have all been pleasantly surprised by the benefits of Ski Walking.
How? By utilizing the correct length poles, we are           automatically forced to walk taller, with hips forward and the back           straighter. Better posture is biomechanically a good thing! Combine this           improved posture with the unique 4-Wheel-Drive action of walking with fitness           poles and there is a huge decrease in the stress put on the weight bearing           joints.
Marketing hype? No, Ski Walking really does burn up to           40% more calories than regular walking. Ski Walking produces up to a 46%           increase in energy consumption compared to regular walking (Cooper Institute,           Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports 2002 publication).
Perfect fitting poles are important. Quality 1-piece           fixed length poles are hassle free and user friendly - ideal for everyday           use. I had a participant in one of my Ski Walking clinics tell me that she           super glued her $140 titanium poles because she couldn't get them to stop           compressing while walking.
I've hosted 100's of folks in my Ski Walking clinics and           they all comment about how the poles really makes them stand tall (with a           straighter back), makes them feel their arms working and eliminates any knee,           hip or back pain they may have had prior to Ski Walking. I also coach runners           and occasionally a couple of my runners get painful shin splints and now they           can Ski Walk for over an hour - pain free.
The book "Nordic Walking for Total Fitness" by           Suzanne Nottingham and Alexandra Jurasin provides what the authors call a           portable workout that improves 7 key performance areas including strength,           coordination, visual skills, balance, agility, cardivascular fitness, and           muscular endurance.

Choosing a Destination XC Ski Resort
For people interested in traveling to xc ski resorts           this winter, here is info about making a destination selection from the           editor of XCSkiResorts.com.
In general, xc skiers select their winter xc ski           destination resorts using some rating system of how xc ski areas perform in           eight categories of criteria including trail quality and grooming, scenery,           food quality, staff friendliness and service, the ski lodge facility and           family issues. There is a great range of xc ski areas in North America and in           the eyes of xc skiers these characteristics delineate areas without concern           to whether the area is an inn, a ranch, a day area, a destination resort, or           a recreation park area. I've purposively avoided the issue of cost - whether           you like to travel to distant resorts or only travel within your region, you           will still compare the other criteria to select your destination resort.
The information below describes what a quality xc ski           resort is all about in terms of services and amenities at some of the leading           xc ski resorts in North America.
XC SKI TRAILS
Trail Quality relates to the skiers' comfort on the trails, even though those           skiers might be at different skiing or experience levels. The trail signage           should help skiers understand where they are on the area's trail network. And           signs should help skiers know the direction that will help them return to           their starting place. The trails should provide a skiing flow so there aren't           too many long uphills or sharp turns at the bottom of steep downhills. One           idea that is done at Lapland Lake in           Northville, New York that makes trails seem less crowded is to have skiers go           in the same direction (one-way). The result is that the trails never seem           crowded. Jim Richards of Maplelag in           Calloway, Minnesota said, "Feedback from the majority of our skiers let           us know that they preferred double-tracked trails over single tracks. And we           had overwhelmingly negative opinions about allowing dogs on the trails,           too."
Some of the best xc ski areas are just blessed with           great terrain for xc skiing. The location of Royal             Gorge in Soda Springs, California is perfect for xc skiing as the area's           land diversity offers flat, rolling and more challenging variety. And Jane           Dulaney, marketing kingpin at the area comments, "Our Sierra maritime           snow it consolidates well and is great for the base on our trails. This means           that skiers can count on excellent conditions when they ski there.
Trail grooming can make or break the ski conditions.           Olavi Hirvonen of Lapland Lake states, "We groom every morning unless we have to wait for the snow to dry out           or cool off - and I groom the way I like to ski the trails myself." Hirvonen gets the Lapland Lake staff out on           the trails after windy periods to rake and pick up the debris from trees like           fallen limbs and pinecones because "I don't want the skiers to have to           ski over the debris as it appears on the trails from the Springtime           melt."
One thing that most of the best xc ski areas share in common is that they           acquire and use the latest trail grooming technology to give them a           mechanical advantage. They do not skimp when it comes to using snowcats with           their grooming attachments to break up ice or powderize the snow into the           finest trail surfaces.
Without getting into the details of grooming machinery and           techniques, the personal pride of the area operators is paramount to the           trail quality issue. Brian Wadsworth of Lone             Mountain Ranch in Big Sky, Montana was a world class cross country ski           racer, who groomed trails for eight years at the Ranch. He was selected by           the Soldiers Hollow Olympic venue to groom the 2002 Olympic Cross Country Ski           competition trails. He knows grooming from a technical and a skier's           perspective. He knows the "best line tracks." But when he comments, "My goal is to be able to hold a World Cup race here any day of the           winter" it sums up his pride and commitment to the quality of the trails           at Lone Mountain Ranch .
STAFF SERVICE AND FRIENDLINESS
You know it when an area's staff is a great one - they seem happy to see you.           In most instances, areas that have veteran employees have them because it is           a great place to work. Most of these great employees do not need "customer service" training. They already have the personal touch.           At Lone Mountain Ranch the staff has become "the hallmark in the industry," according to Wadsworth because they           are "encouraged to create life-long relationships with the guests." Most of the people that work at the best xc ski areas want to work there as a           lifestyle choice. This is apparent with their attitudes with the guests and           about working at one of the best xc ski areas.
The Richards family, who own and run the Maplelag Resort in Callaway, Minnesota, treat           their guests as part of their family. It may sound trite but their guests           sincerely feel welcome and they state it unequivocally in testimonials. The           staff often greets the guests by name. They Richards constantly ask their guests           if there is anything that can be done and they drop everything to help their           guests, be it in the lodge, on the trails, in the rental shop or at the           dinner table. Richards feels, "One of us (the Richards family) is always           around to help with our guests. It's fun to be talked to and pampered by the           actual owners of the resort." Many testimonials from different areas           claim the same thing with regard to their feelings about the service at the           best resorts - they feel welcome, comfortable and "at home." And Maplelag avoids posting rules or signs saying "Don't do this or that."
RESORT LODGES
XC ski lodges can be designed to provide space, convenience and efficient           utilization, but there are also other factors that make a difference to           skiers. Ann Hirvonen of Lapland Lake states, "Clean is huge to us. We are cozy and convenient, but facilities such as           restrooms can get pretty yucky, so we keep them in good condition throughout           the day." Lapland also takes into account brown baggers (bring their own           lunch rather than purchase food at the area) by offering them a picnic area. And they have a public shower and changing area for skiers, who want to clean           up before their drive home.
At Lone Mountain Ranch ,           part of their ambiance is the historic facilities. Of course they have also           added new updated facilities such as a dining room and some cabins, but many           guests go there to enjoy the rustic and original facilities. "It looks           like what people expect Montana to look like and we continue to renovate with           cozy features such as antique furniture and old fashioned quilts to retain           our historical aspects," said Wadsworth.
Royal Gorge's Wilderness           Lodge has had the same managers for years and according to Dulaney, "they are fabulous with their employees and it trickles down to the           guests."
The main lodge at Maplelag is the area's group meeting place, and it is a living folk art museum. Jim           Richards has collected unusual items from around the world. He stated, "We work very hard cultivating this look to be a feast for the           eyes." There are nooks and crannies where people can sit and relax, read           a book, play games with the family, etc. The lodge also houses the main           dining room, hot tub, sauna, massage rooms, rental shop, gift store and it is           where the Saturday night talent show and dance takes place.
FOOD AND BEVERAGE
Whether Nordic skiers bring a picnic lunch, stop at a trailside snack shack           or relax with a first class dining experience, the best areas usually are           known for their outstanding cuisine. Good food service is a result of the           area's commitment, quality chefs with pedigree culinary backgrounds, wine selection,           and so on. A comment from Royal Gorge's Dulaney about the chefs at the Wilderness Lodge sums up the quality, "What these women do with food is just amazing and they've produced a           cookbook, which is very popular with the guests and going into its third           printing."
The Maplelag kitchen is           run by Debbie, the chef who has been on the job on and off for 25 years.           There is a window opening to the kitchen where guests can speak with Debbie           and see the staff cooking the meals. They make everything from scratch using           only natural and fresh ingredients. They call it homestyle, hearty, and           wholesome and it is a unique menu that is endorsed by the guests. Richards'           summarized, "Food is a real joy at Maplelag .
QUALITY FAMILY TIME
Some xc ski areas are highly touted for their commitment to families. They           cater to family needs by "dealing with the kids." Ann Hirvonen of Lapland Lake says, "We are a family and we           raised our daughter here and when you raise a family at a ski center, you           focus on families. So our trails have plenty of flat terrain for kids and we           offer pulks (sleds that skiers use to carry small children), children's sized           snowshoes, skis, boots, and ice skates." XC skiing offers families an           activity that they can all do together. And that can include a four-year old           on Snoopy skis skiing right alongside of grandpa skiing on his pine tarred           woody originals.
Child-oriented instructors are a key element for           families. For the kids to have a positive attitude about Nordic skiing they           must have positive first experiences. It is suggested that the most           successful lessons do not intermingle children with their parents in the same classes. Kids get comfortable with child-friendly instructors as individuals           and on subsequent visits the kids commonly request to take additional lessons           so they can spend more time with those friendly instructors.
Another important way to cater to families is to offer a           variety of other skiing and non-skiing activities. At Lapland Lake a game played in Finland called Napa           Kiikku is organized on weekends and holidays. The game involves a pole on ice           with a sled that goes around in a circle. Adult lessons are conducted to           correlate to the time that the kids play the game.
Kids love a campfire by the lake, sleigh rides, or just           playing on a big pile of snow. Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont conducts many kids "classes" from swimming to           puppet classes or making stuffed animals. The kids' classes provide parents           with some child-free time for going on harder ski trails or getting a massage           while the kids are being entertained.
Jay Richards (Jim and Mary Richards' son) of Maplelag commented, "Seeing our large           family with our own kids running around, being involved makes families feel           welcome here. We try to make parents feel at ease about having their kids run           around." Maplelag cabins and cabooses           are great accommodations that can fit large families and the Richards try to           help families focus on being together doing family activities. Serving meals "family style" is a key element to the atmosphere. But so are the           other family activities such as the dance and the talent show. Baby sitting           services are available on site, too. Jay feels that one of the biggest           reasons families visit is that there are many families already at Maplelag every time people visit and that makes           families feel welcome.
CONCLUSION
Of course, there are other criteria for selecting winter destinations - for           example, couples that are looking for a romantic weekend will have different           needs (and desires). There is something more memorable about traveling to a           destination compared to going to the local trail network for a couple of           hours to xc ski or snowshoe. Whatever your interests, there is a perfect xc           ski resort for you.
