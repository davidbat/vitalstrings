The cloud-covered Whiteface Mt.                  on an otherwise perfect day.
Â 
Most          people have at least heard of the infamous Whiteface Mountain, located          near Lake Placid, New York, and home to the 1980 Winter Olympics.
However, you will usually find            that most people haven't actually been there. Gore Mountain, the dubbed            sister of Whiteface, is also familiar to most skiers; yet the rest of            the state is less renowned for its downhill ski resorts.
New York's smaller ski areas may not have the            large clientele capacity that the sprawling, multi-peaked resorts, such            as Killington, Vermont, or Sunday River, Maine, have, but they are usually            cheaper and less crowded.
Smaller New York resorts, such as Wyndham and            Hunter, offer excellent skiing conditions at affordable rates, while            being conveniently located in the well-populated, southern upstate area.            Gore and Whiteface, while pricier, offer the spacious, high-octane trails            commonly found in the popular single-peaked resorts of Vermont's Jay            Peak and Stowe.
Here's a run-down of the more notable resorts            the New York ski/snowboard world offers.
Whiteface            Mountain
A            two-time host of the Winter Olympics with the largest vertical drop            in the East, Whiteface Mountain, along with the neighboring resort town            of Lake Placid, have become popular in tourist circles, attracting many            visitors to the Adirondack mountains from abroad.
Whiteface is located in the small, rural town            of Wilmington, about 20 minutes from Placid. This area is about 30 minutes            from the Adirondack Northway, also known as I-87, the major highway            through Northern New York, and two hours from any major cities. Due            to its relatively remote location, the regular patrons of Whiteface            are normally upstate New Yorkers, mixed with French Canadians from Quebec.            As a result, you'll find surprisingly short lift lines during much of            the season, an uncommon trait for such a large ski area.
Ski area must be stressed here, because the steep            grade found on this cloud-piercing peak caters less to the long, sweeping            carves of the snowboarder, and more to the quick-turning two-planker.            So, as the snowboarding trend becomes evermore popular, Whiteface finds            itself less crowded than in years' past.
Unfortunately for Whiteface's otherwise sterling            reputation, its slandering alias, "Iceface," has pulled it            out of the limelight that its Olympic history had cast in the winters            of 1912 and 1980. The Adirondack Mountains are notorious for their savage            ice storms. And, on a bad day, a sky-splitter like Whiteface will take            the brunt of any storm in the area full force. Subzero, face-tearing            winds have been known to close down the mountain during these particularly            violent mid-winter maelstroms.
However, Whiteface does have the luxury of snowmaking,            compensating, somewhat, for its variable conditions.
"It can get really icy," describes            Jon Tversland, a four-year ski/snowboard instructor of Warwick, New            York. "But, it has good steeps and an equally good terrain park."
Personal note: the conditions of Whiteface after            a heavy snowstorm are incomparable in the East; the clouds will break            and an unfettered sun will reveal a skier's reverie. Ride the summit            lift to the tree line and behold the all-natural, knee-deep powder -            untouched by the treads of any groomer. Then swallow your awe and plunge            down the white-faced giant to the warmth of the mid-lodge. The trail            Upper Skyward comes to mind, an intimidating slope immediately accessible            from the summit lift.
The pricing for Whiteface is average for a resort            of its size, running about $50 a day and $500 for a season pass. The            latter price can be halved, however, for impoverished college students            who fill a large portion of the snow riding demographic here.

The gondola chairlift            at Gore Mt.; the "twin" of Whiteface's.
Due to its shared membership in the Olympic Regional Development Authority            (ORDA) with Whiteface, Gore is sometimes dubbed the "sister of            Whiteface." Sisters they may be, but they fall short of twin-dom.
Gore Mountain is located about two hours north            of Albany in the small town of North Creek, positioning it closer to            urban areas than its "sibling," resulting in a more crowded            environment. It is also smaller in stature, yet large enough to substantiate            the need for a gondola lift; Whiteface also has one. Nevertheless, its            trails provide an ample mix of grade and scenery, giving it a high-ranking            in resort popularity. If you want a quality black diamond from Gore,            try Chatemaq or Hawkeye. Looking for a midrange rollick? Try the winding            intermediate trail Twister.
According to Ski Magazine, Gore is on the top            ten list of unknown ski areas in the world. With the addition of its            double-barrel glade and the "Tannery and Pub Restaurant" remodeling,            it can only get better. Its 72 trails that are supported by 10 lifts            (gondola included) offer no shortage of runs for its clientele.
Gore's prices, due to its shared membership, are identical to those of Whiteface. This provides the Adirondack ski/snowboard            world an economic consistency that customers can depend on, time and            time again. And does Gore offer the same deal for college students?            You bet it does.
Hunter and Wyndham
While close proximity is a trait that puts these            two peaks into a realm of comparison, distinct differences exist when            held under scrutiny.
Hunter Mountain, according to writer Mitch Kaplan            of www.gorp.com, has a tendency to draw a large crowd of young people            in their early twenties, serving as a single's bar of sorts. Whatever            the rumors, Hunter definitely carries a more congested atmosphere due            to its southern location; urbanites and suburbanites from New Jersey,            Long Island, and New York City commonly frequent this resort. Hunter            boasts 11 chair lifts, which cater to its 53 trails, which are divided            more or less equally across its three peaks. Its prices are affordable            as well, running you around the $40 range for standard adult prices,            with typical discounts for the young and elderly.
Wyndham, while equally popular, caters more to            family skiers/snowboarders looking for respite from the crowds. Located            only a few miles north of its jocund neighbor, Wyndham offers a docile            yang to Hunter's wild yin; it runs only seven chair lifts stemming from            a homely, yet, second-to-none base lodge. This merry little peak also            supports multiple terrain parks as well as snowmaking. Its prices are            slightly higher than those of its neighbor, a probable deterrent to            ward off the low budget debauchery that is funneled onto Hunter's slopes.
What's left?
While a myriad of smaller, less-known resorts            are smattered throughout New York - West Mountain, Titus Mountain and            Big Tupper, to name a few - the locations described above are the main            attractions. Although New York's snow culture may seem mediocre when            compared to the one of New England, a certain hometown pride must be            instilled to all who claim membership to it. So, next time you're thinking            about planning a ski trip, think about saving some money on gasoline            and lift tickets. Cold-shoulder Vermont for a weekend and ski New York.
