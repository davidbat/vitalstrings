So I'll be in North Carolina a few days next month.  Looking for a place to snowboard.  Keeping the scope to North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, what's the best place to go?  If the scope is just North Carolina, which would it be?
I've been to Snowshoe in WVA, Wintergreen in VA, and Whitetail (in PA, but close to DC if that makes sense) for snowboarding - all are good.  No info on NC.
Keep an eye on the immediate weather forecast and pick the closest hill would be my advice.  Unless there is a good storm somewhere else, the conditions (machine snow) will be identical.
FYI - nothing much is open yet, it's been warm.
