Wildflower Inn
The Wildflower Inn is a family resort found in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. The resort consists of 570 acres, with a family-run, traditional inn providing accommodation and log fires in the evenings.
Visiting families can take advantage of all of the snow-based activities on site---which include sledding and ice skating on a pond---as well as nearby skiing opportunities at Burke Mountain Ski Area, to be found around two miles from the resort. Burke features a ski school, catering towards both beginner skiers who need to learn the ropes, in addition to more able skiers. On the slopes, the beginner's area offers plenty of room for families to get started in a relaxed environment.
By timing their visit for Christmas, families can experience the Wildflower Inn's 'Feel of Fir' package, where each family will get to cut their own tree at the resort's farm, and take it home with them. The package runs from December 10th to the 19th each year. The Inn itself is decked out in festive decorations, too.
