Killington, VT
A dominant mountain in the northeast, with seven peaks, and plenty for the party crowd; but a good place for family skiing too, with programs from daycare (from 12 weeks old) to "Camp Freeride" for real keen teens.
Meanwhile, in Maine, is Sugarloaf : it's a trek (8-9 hours from NYC, four from Boston), but once there, you've got hotel, inn, condos, buses, restaurants, shops, and Maine's second-highest peak, with 2820' vert and an area above the treeline (-double-diamond, though!) Family skiing extras include a tube park, Outdoor Center, family games nights. Look for well-priced packages; kids are free during Children's Festival Week.*
In NH, Bretton Woods is the biggest ski area with 430 acres; it's partners with the historic Mt. Washington Hotel. Child care center takes babies from two months old.
