All-Inclusive Family Vacations in New Hampshire
New England is home to numerous ski resorts that offer a perfect venue for a family Christmas vacation. Snow is usually plentiful, but snow-making is available if Mother Nature fails to cooperate. The old-world ambiance at these towns and resorts enhances the Christmas spirit, making it easy to convince young children that Santa can indeed find them here. Most New England ski resorts have ski-in/ski-out lodging, but many of the Christmas activities happen in surrounding towns.
