Located just 90 minutes from downtown Boston
Ragged Mountain is the closest place in New England to lose yourself. With lift access to two peaks, 45 trails, 4 terrain parks, a wonder carpet for the kiddies and the only High speed 6-pack chairlift in New Hampshire, Ragged Mountain puts everything you expect from a winter resort at your fingertips. We also offer ski classes, rentals, onsite daycare and several dining options.
Ragged Mountain also offers multiple lodging options good for any size group, just steps from the lifts! Our Sunrise and Sunset Bunk Rooms are the newest addition - each bunk room accommodates up to 24 people. Bring a group of 10 or more and stay slopeside for just $20 a person per night! For smaller groups there's also the Spear Mtn. Clubhouse, an apartment-style accomodation that sleeps 9-12 people, and the Pinnacle Peak Hide Away which is perfect for couples or a small family - Reserve either of these options this winter for two non-holiday nights and get the third night and your ski days free!
