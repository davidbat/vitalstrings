Country crooner Rodney Atkins has filed for divorce following hefty domestic assault accusations, claiming that his wife Tammy has blown the situation out of proportion.
Tammy Atkins claimed the singer became violent during an argument at their home on the morning of Nov. 21. She called 911 to report the incident, according to TMZ.
The country star was then hauled off to jail, booked and released on $2,500 bail.
According to police, Tammy said Rodney, 42, “had been drinking alcohol all night and was intoxicated,” even attempting to smother her with a pillow in his rage.
Atkins’ lawyer, however, called the situation just an “unfortunate verbal dispute,” and said it did not escalate to the degree that Tammy Atkins claimed.
The lawyer noted in a statement to TMZ that the couple’s 10-year-old son was in the home, and that “when Mr. Atkins realized their child was in hearing range of the argument, his first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child.
“Mr. Atkins realized he would have no recourse but to file a complaint for divorce,” the statement continued. “He has exercised substantial parenting time with the parties’ son and he will continue to do so while the divorce is pending.”
Atkins and his wife first met when the singer was working odd jobs during college, including driving a delivery truck.
