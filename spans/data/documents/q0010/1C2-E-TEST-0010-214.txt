Hey, y'all, run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleanin' this gun
Well, now that I'm a father
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find
That teenage boy I used to be
That seems to have just one thing on his mind
She's growin' up so fast
It won't be long before
I'll have to put the fear of God into
Some kid at the door
[Chorus]
Now it's all for show
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt
It's just a daddy thing
And, hey, believe me, it works
[Chorus]
Son, now y'all buckle up and have her back
By te... let's say about 9:30
Drive safe
