Rodney Austin Atkins (born March 28, 1969, in Knoxville, Tennessee) is an American country music artist. Signed to Curb Records since 1997, Atkins charted his first single on the Billboard country charts that year. However, he did not enter the charts again until late 2002, with the Top 40 single "Sing Along". Atkins eventually landed his first Top Five hit on the country music charts in 2003, with the single "Honesty (Write Me a List)" from his 2003 album Honesty.
If You're Going Through Hell, his second album, was released in 2006. Its first two singles, "If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)" and "Watching You", each spent four weeks at the top of the country music charts. Both songs were also named as the Number One country song of the year by Billboard magazine ("If You're Going Through Hell" in 2006, and "Watching You" in 2007). The album, which has since been certified platinum in the United States, has since produced two more Number One singles in "These Are My People" and "Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy)", as well as "Invisibly Shaken" which peaked at #41. A twelfth single, "It's America", was released in late 2008 as the first release from his third album It's America and the song became his fifth Number One on the chart dated May 2, 2009.
