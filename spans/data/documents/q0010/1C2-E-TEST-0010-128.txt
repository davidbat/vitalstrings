Rodney Atkins knows the value of taking the long way home, of veering off the                  beaten path onto that road less traveled once in a while. You can hear it in his                  music, in the lyrics of his smash single, "Take a Back Road", a song that                  celebrates that feeling of getting away from the noise of everyday life, really                  living in the moment, and getting right with your soul. And you can see it in                  the way he lives his life: putting family first, listening to that inner voice                  and remaining true to himself, and striving to evolve and find unique ways of                  expressing himself through the music he puts out into the world. It’s a                  philosophy he tries to employ throughout his life, and it has led him to some                  amazing places.
