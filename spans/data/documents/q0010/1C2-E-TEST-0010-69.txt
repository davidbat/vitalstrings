Court documents show Tammy Atkins called 911 Nov. 21 claiming the two had been arguing in their home when Rodney Atkins turned violent. Insisting the country star "had been drinking alcohol all night and was intoxicated," Tammy told police Rodney tried to smother her with a pillow and, later, grabbed her by the face and threw her down the hallway.
Tammy also claimed the assault took place in front of their 10-year-old son, according to TMZ .
Atkins was booked and released from jail on a $2,500 bail. He claims Tammy made up the story and his attorney said it was just an "unfortunate verbal dispute."
"When Mr. Atkins realized their child was in hearing range of the argument, his first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child," the attorney told TMZ in a statement. "Mr. Atkins realized he would have no recourse but to file a complaint for divorce. He has exercised substantial parenting time with the parties' son and he will continue to do so while the divorce is pending.
"Mr. Atkins wants to thank his fans for standing by him as he is confident the truth will prevail."
