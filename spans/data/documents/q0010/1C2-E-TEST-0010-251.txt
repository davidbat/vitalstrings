Rhapsody
 
Rodney Atkins' third long-player, It's America, is chock-full of patriotic fist-pumpers and tunes that celebrate the lives of average folks. But rather than weigh the album down with a ton of serious songs, Atkins uses humor to lighten things up. Just listen to "15 Minutes," a song about attempting to break bad habits in a quick quarter hour. "Friends With Tractors," meanwhile, features a rich guy vs. regular guy scenario that makes for some of the album's most memorable one-liners. Other highlights include "Best Things," "Chasin' Girls" and the single, "It's America."
