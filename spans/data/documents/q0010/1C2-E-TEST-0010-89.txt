Reminds me of my little brother. He's proud of who he is and he's exactly like my father. I love them both. Bud would beat the hell outta anyone who messes with me or any of our family. He doesn't care who's watching or who their parents are. My baby brother is a 12 year old cowboy with a fightin side a mile wide and he's mine.

I'm a loser and my son is too. Yeah!! He's mine!! He drinks, he smokes, disrespects his elders, uses violence to solve problems, don't expect too much because he's mine!! Woohoo!!! Should have some more to follow in my footsteps, i'll encourage their delinquency till i die. Make the world a better place for future generations.
