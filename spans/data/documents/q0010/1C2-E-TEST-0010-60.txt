Walker Hayes’ “Feet” on Rodney Atkins’ New Album
Posted by TawnyTucker on  September 2nd, 2011
Rodney Atkins ‘ new album, Take A Back Road will hit stores on October 4th. There’s song that’s a little familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite figure it out. Well, it turns out, one of our favorite up-and-coming artists, Walker Hayes , has a cut on the album. “Feet” narrates a fight between a man and woman, that can all made better with the touch of their feet.
You can preview Rodney’s version here.
