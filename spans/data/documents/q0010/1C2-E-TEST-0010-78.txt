My how time flies, as[lastfm link_type="artist_info"] Rodney Atkins[/lastfm] took a break from his busy schedule yesterday to celebrate his ‘Little Man‘ Elijah’s 10th birthday. You may recall that Rodney featured a much younger Elijah is the video for his hit song “Watching You”…but Rodney has an even bigger reason to be proud of his little boy. I’ve known Rodney for many years, and he truly does have one of the biggest hearts in country music, and it’s obvious to me that ‘the apple does not fall far from the tree!‘ You’ll love this story, as Rodney recalls just one example of how his boy has such a huge and caring heart, and how proud he is that his son already understands that being kind to others is more important than fame!

Taste Of  Country caught up with Rodney yesterday on Elijah’s 10th birthday, and Rodney shared just one heartwarming example of his ‘Little Man’s’ big heart!
“He just knocks me out in so many ways. Elijah is an amazing kid. For example, we were at a show the day before Father’s Day. He came out onstage and brought me this Father’s Day card. When you opened it, it played ‘Been watching you daddy, ain’t that cool … I want to be just like you.’ He was so proud of the card … It was like gold. It was amazing.”

Rodney went on to say, that backstage after that show, he met a young boy who was part of the Make a Wish program:
“His wish was, and this still blows my mind, to meet me. He had come from the hospital and had a helmet on. I don’t know how long he had left. Elijah was there with me and said to him, ‘Do you want a Gatorade? Do you want a popsicle? We have a freezer here under the bus’.”
The young boy accepted the treats as he told Atkins that his father couldn’t attend the show that night because he was working. When Rodney asked the boy if he had made his dad a Father’s Day card, the boy shook his head:
“He said, ‘No. I’ve been sick. I’ve been in the hospital. I haven’t been able to,’” says Atkins, who then noticed Elijah get back on the tour bus and return a few seconds later.  He had the card he was so proud he had given me, and said, ‘Here. Give this to your dad.’ He does stuff like that all the time. He gets it that the world is not about [the status] you have at the time, but it’s about touching other folks.”
Sounds to me like Rodney and his wife Tammy Jo have done a great job teaching their son about being kind and caring to others…which I agree is one of life’s most important lessons! We parents all try to instill this in our kids from an early age, teaching them to ‘share their toys’ or comfort a pal who skins their knee, and that kind of thing. And when you witness your kid doing something so kind and compassionate all on their own with no ‘urging’ on your part, you can’t help but feel proud that you’ve done a good job![photogallerylink id=48982 align=right]

Here’s a chance for you to brag a little about your awesome kid, who did something so sweet and kind, it just melted your heart. What unselfish and kind thing did your child do that made you realize you had instilled these values and made your heart sing?
