Getting drunk, having a fight, and breaking up with your wife could be the lyrics to one of Rodney Atkin's songs, but for the country singer, they might be real life.
News broke earlier this week that Atkins was arrested November 21st after allegedly getting drunk, attacking his wife, Tammy Jo Atkins, and attempting to smother her with a pillow, all while their 10 year old son watched. Atkins denies the allegations stating through his lawyer that he and his wife merely had a disagreement, but whatever happened ended in a mugshot and filing for divorce.
The divorce documents were uncovered today, and in them both parties agreed that they had behaved badly in the marriage and shouldn't live under the same roof anymore. The judge did however, sign off on a mutual restraining order barring either party from harassing each other.
It remains to be seen if this is going to get any more dramatic than it already is. Probably with all of the money and custody issues that haven't been agreed upon. But most likely the plot will thicken as the criminal case is sorted out since Atkins is basically calling his wife a liar. Loyal fans are already taking to comment boards all over the internet to defend his honor.
What do you think? Is Rodney Atkins career over because of this or do you believe him when he says that this was just an argument that got out of hand and exaggerated a bit?
