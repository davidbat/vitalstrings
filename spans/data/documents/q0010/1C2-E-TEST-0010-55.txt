Sharing is Caring:
 
Rodney Atkins' latest album 'Take a Back Road' peaked the Billboard chart at #8 and the first single even topped it. "He's Mine" is his second single and should become a fast-rising star as well.
I gave the song a listen and have to admit that it is a nice song. An oldie but didnot make it to 'goodie'. Apparantly not enough attention to make it to the top. A pity...Click on the 'play'-button and enjoy!
I give it 2½ of 5 stars.
Listen and/or watch the music video using the RED 'play', 'watch'-button or play/watch-links.
