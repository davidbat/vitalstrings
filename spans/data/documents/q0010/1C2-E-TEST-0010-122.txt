Rodney Atkins Denies Assaulting Wife But Files For Divorce
It's been revealed that Rodney Atkins was arrested last month in Tennessee for domestic assault after allegedly attempting to smother his wife with a pillow. Police were called on November 21st after a call from wife Tammy in the morning claiming he'd turned violent after the pair argued throughout the night. The star was arrested and then released on a $2,500 bail. However in subsequent news, Atkins has denied this and now filed for divorce - if reports at entertainment news site Tmz are to be believed.
Whilst apparently admitting to arguing in front of he and his wife's 10 year-old son, Atkins has denied the violence and, in a statement issued on behalf of the country singer - whose 2006 album 'If You're Going Through Hell' went platinum in the Us - the 43 year-old's lawyer said "When Mr. Atkins realized their child was in hearing range of the argument his first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child. Mr. Atkins realized he would have no recourse but to file a complaint for divorce. He has exercised substantial parenting time with the parties son and he will continue to do so while the divorce is pending."
Conflicting reports, as you would expect in such a case, Rodney however would seem confident that his story will hold up though, the statement finishing "Mr. Atkins wants to thank his fans for standing by him as he is confident the truth will prevail."
