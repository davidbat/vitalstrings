I had to laugh when daddy whispered
Fifth time might be the charm
And there's a brother Lester
In the city, just flew in
All the way from out
We're still not sure about him
But different as we are it's good to be
In family
A few new babies, the same old crazies
I've known 'em my whole life
And they still amaze me
I didn't choose 'em
Cause you gotta love 'em
Man, they're family
When mama said the blessings
She was fightin back the tears
Cause the last time we were all together
Grandpa was here
She knew how proud he'd be
And how much he'd love to see
A few new babies, the same old crazies
I've known 'em my whole life
And they still amaze me
Don't get to choose 'em
But you hate to lose 'em
You gotta love 'em
Family reunion, 4th of July
It's been three years since I've seen it
Now I remember why
