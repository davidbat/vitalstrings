Rodney Atkins-Farmer’s Daughter Lyrics
Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin’ to work
till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said I’m your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin’,
the peaches need pickin’
And the cows need bringin round
I was haulin hay, I was feedin the hogs
and that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin’ out loud, thinkin bout quitin’
Lookin’ back now I’m sure glad I didn’t
Cuz just when I thought it couldn’t get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer’s daughter
She was just gettin’ home from Panama city
she was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin that I would sure love my job
as the days got shorter our talks got longer
the kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
so we’d hop in the truck and get all tagled up
every chance we got
we were down by the river all night long
when the sun came up I was sneakin’ her home
and draggin my butt to work
with the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I’d be on the tractor she’d be on my mind
with that sun beatin’ down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldnt get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer’s daughter
we got married last spring
Woah and there ain’t no better life for me
I’m still haulin’ hay and feedin’ the hogs
and that summer sun has me sweatin’ like a dog
so I cool off in the creek
and she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
I’m on the tractor and shes on my mind
and I can’t wait till its quitin’ time
and just when I think it can’t get no hotter
I come home to the farmer’s daughter
Yeah the farmer’s daughter
