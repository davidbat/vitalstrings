Rodney Atkins new tune called ‘He’s Mine’ is a great story!  When I heard it, I thought of my three boys (now all grown up!) and of Colleen’s husband Mike and their son Matthew. Well Mike and Matthew in about another 14 years!  Give it a listen and let us know what you think, and have you lived it with your kids?
