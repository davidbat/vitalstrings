He said,"Just think it over,and write me a list"
"So we can figure out what we both deserve"
She hardly could beieve it, their love had come to this
Dividing and deciding his and hers
But she grabbed a paper napkin and asked the waitress for a pen
And one by one she wrote down what she wanted most from him
Honesty,sincerity,tenderness and trust
A little less time for the rest of the world
And more for the two of us
Kisses each mornin' I love you's at night
Just like it used to be
The way life was when you were in love with me
She reached across the table and placed it in his hand
And said,"You know this isn't easy for me"
As he thought about the new car the house and the land
And wondered what that bottom line would be
And a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find
Honesty,sincerity,tenderness and trust
A little less time for the rest of the world
And more for the two of us
Kisses each mornin' I love you's at night
Just like it used to be
The way life was when you were in love with me
Well,he fought back the tears as he looked in her eyes
And said,"I don't know where to start"
And she said, "Everything on that list in your hand
Is written somewhere in your heart"
Honesty,sincerity just like it used to be
The way life was when you were in love with me
