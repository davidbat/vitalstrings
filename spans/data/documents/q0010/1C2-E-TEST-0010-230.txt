Country singer Rodney Atkins has filed for divorce from wife Tammy Jo Atkins after an alleged domestic dispute turned bad.
Tammy Jo claims her husband tried to smother her with a pillow during a fight on November 21 in Williamson County, Tennessee.
According to People , court documents also reveal that she is accusing her husband of grabbing her by the face and throwing her down a hallway in front of the couple’s 10-year-old son.
Rodney was arrested but later released after posting $2,500 bail.
The Washington Post reports that Rodney’s attorney Rose Palermo maintains that the allegations of violence after a night of heavy drinking are “completely untrue.”
Palermo also said after “an unfortunate verbal dispute” Rodney’s “first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child, and that is when Mrs. Atkins called the police and gave them her version of the argument, which is completely untrue.”
Palermo also explained in a statement, “Mr. Atkins plans to spend significant time with his child over the Christmas holidays and respectfully requests privacy at this time. Mr. Atkins wants to thank his fans for standing by him and he is confident the truth will prevail.”
The country singer’s No. 1 hits include “If You’re Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows),” ‘’Take a Back Road” and “Watching You.”
