Rodney Atkins Quotes

"Right now, I'm just trying to work really hard at building the familiarity with people out there for them to get to know me"
"It's just a blessing.  Artists search and search for songs that will connect for a new artist because the familiarity is so low.  People don't know what you look like.  It's just so unbelievable to find a song that people are relating to.  To have a song that people will actually pick up the phone and call the station to ask.  It's a blessing."
