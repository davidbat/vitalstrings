Atkins Files For Divorce After Arrest
Country star Rodney Atkins has filed for divorce from his wife after he was arrested following an argument at the couple's home.
The singer was detained by cops last month (Nov11) at his house in Tennessee after police officers were called to investigate claims a disagreement between the couple had turned violent.
Atkins was booked on suspicion of domestic assault and later released on $2,500 (Â£1,563) bail.
The star's lawyers have now released a statement to Tmz.com about the arrest, calling the alleged argument with his wife Tammy an "unfortunate verbal dispute" and confirming Atkins has since filed for divorce.
It reads, "Mr. Atkins realised he would have no recourse but to file a complaint for divorce. He has exercised substantial parenting time with the parties' son and he will continue to do so while the divorce is pending. Mr. Atkins wants to thank his fans for standing by him as he is confident the truth will prevail."
