If you're sick of contemporary country albums loaded with fattening fluff, get on the Rodney Atkins diet with If You're Going Through Hell. "These Are My People" is a meaty, honky-tonk ditty that drives small town themes into the ground (or into the sunset if you're from a small town). "About The South" will move anyone who has ever caught and consumed their own crawfish from a creek. Throughout his third album, Atkins implements the same kind of fast-talkin' rhyming that Billy Joel used in "We Didn't Start The Fire."
