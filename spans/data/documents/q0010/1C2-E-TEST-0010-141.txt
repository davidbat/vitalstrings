There is more drama going on in Rodney Atkins‘ life than he can actually take.
Divorce in progress: Rodney Atkins and his soon-to-be ex-wife Tammy Atkins.
In an attempt to get away from the ugly situation he is currently facing, the country singer’s filed for divorce from his wife Tammy Atkins. He did that as a response to her charges accusing him of a domestic assault that supposedly happened on Nov. 21.
It was last month when Rodney Atkins was arrested on a charge of domestic violence that included trying to smother Tammy with a pillow, an allegation Atkins denies. His wife claimed that Atkins assaulted her after a night of heavy drinking, when he also grabbed her by the face and threw her down the hallway.
Now, we have an update to this whole Rodney Atkins’ situation. We found out that TMZ has obtained the divorce documents between Rodney Atkins and Tammy Atkins, which at least prove the couple can agree on something.
Both Rodney and Tammy acknowledge they are ‘unable to live together successfully as husband and wife,’ while each says the other is ‘guilty of such inappropriate marital  conduct as renders further cohabitation unsafe and improper.’
OK, we don’t know if Rodney will agree on this, but Tammy is asking for sole custody of the  pair’s 10-year old son (who Tammy also says witnessed his dad’s attack),  along with alimony and child support payments.
But as we all know in court the judge has the final word. For the time being he has agreed on a restraining order barring Rodney and Tammy from ‘harassing,  threatening, assaulting or abusing the other party.’
And that’s seems like quite a  start, right?
