@ Honesty - Rodney Atkins
I can't believe ther are no reviews for this song.  Its amazing!  And now adays so true... so many people are splitting and so much relies on material things... if everyone were a little more worried about love than they were about houses and cars then the world would be a much better place.  The Beetles had it right "All You Need Is Love!"
