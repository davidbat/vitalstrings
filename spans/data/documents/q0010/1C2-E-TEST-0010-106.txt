TMZ quotes sources who say Rodney tried to smother his wife with a pillow. He has since filed for divorce.
Court documents say Tammy called 911 after she and Rodney got into an argument. She said he had been drinking all night and was intoxicated. He was booked into jail and released on $2500 bond.

Rodney, however, says his wife is lying about the altercation and the fact it all took place in front of their ten-year-old son. His lawyer says the truth will prevail and Rodney thanks his fans for standing by him.
