Here is a closer chord progression to my ear.   Half-step down tuning (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb)  INTRO: G D X2  VERSE 1: G C Well I heard he needed some help on the farm D C Somebody with a truck and two strong arms G D Not scared of dirt and willin' to work C D till the sun goes down G So I pulled up and said I'm your man D I could start right now and we shook hands G He said the fence needs fixin', D the peaches need pickin' C D And the cows need bringin round  CHORUS 1: G D I was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs G D and that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog Am So I cooled off in the creek G D then it was back to work in the dag gum heat G D I was cussin' out loud, thinkin' bout quitin' G D Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't Am Cadd9 Cuz just when i thought it couldn't get no hotter C D I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter   VERSE 2: G C She was just gettin' home from Panama city D C She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty G When her eyes met mine D C I was thinkin' that I would sure love my job G C As the days got shorter our talks got longer D C The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger G D So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up C Every chance we got  CHORUS 2: G We were down by the river all night long D When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home Am And draggin' my butt to work C D With the smell of her perfume on my shirt G I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind D With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine Am Cadd9 Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter C D I fell in love with the farmer's daughter  BRIDGE: Am D We got married last spring Am D Woah and there ain't no better life for me  CHORUS/OUTRO: G Im still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs D And that summer suns has me sweatin' like a dog Am So I cool off in the creek C D And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea G Im on the tractor and shes on my mind D And I cant wait til its quittin' time Am Cadd9 And just when I think it cant get no hotter C D I come home to the farmer's daughter G D D G Yeah the farmer's daughter   Suggestions welcome.  -Cody
