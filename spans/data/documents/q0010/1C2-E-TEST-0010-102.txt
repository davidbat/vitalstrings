The Limelight barely shined on him
But everyone still remembers when
He whooped up on that boy way bigger
For taking that cheap shot on our little kicker
And they threw him out
Oh man, you should of, you should of heard me shout
I yelled he's mine that one
Got a wild-haired side and then some
It's no surprise what he's done
He's every last bit of my old man's son
And I'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah man, he's mine and he'll always be
The best thing that ever happened to me
You can't turn it off like electricity
I love him unconditionally
I'll take the blame and claim him every time
Yeah, y'all, he's mine
I thank God, he's mine
Bless his heart
