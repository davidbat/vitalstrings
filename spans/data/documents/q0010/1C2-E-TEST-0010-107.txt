Â 
Country music singer Rodney Atkins is in serious trouble with the law.
On November 21, Atkins was arrested for domestic assault after his wife, Tammy, called 911 and told police her husband was drunk, acting violent and tried to smother her with a pillow. She said the incident took place in front of the couple's 10-year old son.
Atkins, who has since filed for divorce, was booked and later released on $2,500 bail. His attorney acknowledges a "verbal dispute" took place, but dismisses the other allegations as a lie, telling TMZ:
"When Mr. Atkins realized their child was in hearing range of the argument his first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child... Mr. Atkins wants to thank his fans for standing by him as he is confident the truth will prevail."
