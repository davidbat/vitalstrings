Hey Y'all -
We've been in Dallas and Tulsa, Okla., recently and the shows have been awesome. We rolled into Dallas on Wednesday morning and hit the ground running. Ran over and did some radio visits and met with some folks. The show that night at The Granada was awesome -- thanks everybody for coming out! Here are some pictures of the night. Had a good time hanging out with Meghan & Josh (from Steel Magnolia ) in Tulsa. Josh even got up and joined us for "Long Haired Country Boy." -- Rodney
