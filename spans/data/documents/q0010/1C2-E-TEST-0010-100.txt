I find it very hard to believe that I am the first one to review this CD, after waiting for someone else to review this CD. It just comes to show that people cannot appreciate good music anymore, because Take a Back Road, I feel, is Rodney's best material yet.
Rodney Atkins is an artist I love too much in the country music genre. He knows how to give out good music, good lyrics, and a good attitude whereas in other country music it falls flat. We all know Take a Back Road by now, and someway somehow it went to #1, and I feel that it deserves its spot because it is one of the best songs I have heard in the genre this year, however I feel that it should be longer at #1, rather than the abysmal Just a Kiss by Lady A.
But back to the album. We have the same good ole country boy tracks that got me into Rodney Atkins in the first place, and the same authentic style that he has milked in his past CDs. Standouts include the title track (of course), Growing Up Like That, Just Wanna Rock And Roll, and Cabin in the Woods.
So, Rodney, thank you. Thank you for doing it again. It is such a pleasure that you and other artists such as Brad Paisley, Brett Eldredge, Rascal Flatts, and Toby Keith have been working hard to make good music and try to stop the radio-friendly bombs that are Taylor Swift and Keith Urban, although I don't hate the latter as much as I do Swift. And please, do not dislike this review just because I said something negative about her. Take a Back Road is a masterpiece.
Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
