This was as far as i got!  im not sure if its correct or not but it sounds good when i play it to the song, id like for a professional to tab this out its my favorite song. G Well I heard he needed some help on the farm D Somebody with a truck and two strong arms G D Not scared of dirt and willin' to work C D till the sun goes down G So I pulled up and said I'm your man D I could start right now and we shook hands G He said the fence needs fixin', D the peaches need pickin' C / Cadd9 D And the cows need bringin round [ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/r/rodney-atkins/222719.html ] Chorus: G D I was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs C D and that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog Am So I cooled off in the creek G D then it was back to work in the dag gum heat G D I was cussin' out loud, thinkin' bout quitin' G D Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't C Cuz just when i thought it couldn't get no hotter D I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter G She was just gettin' home from Panama city D she was all tanned up and my kinda pretty G When her eyes met mine D G I was thinkin' that I would sure love my job G as the days got shorter our talks got longer D C the kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger so we'd hop in the truck and get all tagled up every chance we got we were down by the river all night long when the sun came up I was sneakin' her home and draggin' my butt to work with the smell of her perfume on my shirt I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind with that sun beatin' down on this back of mine Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter I fell in love with the farmer's daughter we got married last spring Woah and there ain't no better life for me
