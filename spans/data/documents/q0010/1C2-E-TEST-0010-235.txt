Carl Black Chevrolet gives away Rodney Atkins Silverado!
September 17th, 2008 in Events
Rodney Atkins was Live on the Lot at Carl Black Chevrolet on Monday, September 15 to sing a few hits, sign some autographs and give away his 2008 Chevy Silverado.
And the winner is….Tina from White House, TN.  Tina’s family was on site and surprised when Tina was the last woman standing, thereby winning Rodney’s truck.  Rodney handed the keys over along with well wishes and lots of pictures.
Rodney joined WSIX’s Big D and Bubba on Stage to greet each qualifier and give them a copy of his CD Going thru Hell.  Afterwards he stayed and signed every single autograph and posed for pictures.  Click here to download your picture from the event.
