Carrie Underwood, Rodney Atkins Lend A Hand
Aug. 20, 2009  Country artists generally get high marks for their efforts in reaching out to the community. Carrie Underwood, Rodney Atkins and Tim McGraw are the latest examples of the genres stars doing some sort of good work by linking with charities or simply making public appearances.    Carrie, Rodney and songwriter Craig Wiseman  author of Kenny Chesneys "Summertime"  are all contributing in their own ways to non-profit agencies that support people or animals in need.
