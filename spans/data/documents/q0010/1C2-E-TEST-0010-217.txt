I miss my baby so much,
After being gone,
Out on that lake uh fishin'
All weekend long,
So I bought flowers and a bottle of the good stuff,
But when I walked in I knew well I didn't bring enough
Cause' she ain't as happy as I am to be home,
If looks could kill then I'd be cold as a stone.
I'm already ready to kiss and makeup
Looks like tonight I'm outta luck oh lord
She'd rather fight then you know what.
Had reservations at the Japanese steak house,
Don't need to go where their throwing knives around,
Just take my ear full of all the wrong I've done,
Just get it over while she tears me a knew one,
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsty.com/rodney-atkins-shed-rather-fight-lyrics.html ]
She ain't as happy as I am to be home,
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone.
I'm already ready to kiss and makeup
Looks like tonight I'm outta luck,
Cause' She'd rather fight then you know
What I'd like to do,
If I could just somehow, get her in the mood
Oh but I can see right now
She ain't as happy as I am to be home,
If looks could kill then I'd be cold as a stone.
I'm already ready to kiss and makeup
Looks like tonight I'm outta luck, oh lord
Cause' She'd rather fight then you know what.
I might be sleeping in my truck,
Cause she'd rather fight then you know what.
You know what, I love you,
Don't you like what I got you,
I'm out here if you need me,
Oh my back is sunburned
I think it's sunburned baby,
Got some aloe?
