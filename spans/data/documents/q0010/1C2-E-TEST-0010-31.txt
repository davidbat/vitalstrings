yeah do you drive? do you drive down gravel, dirt or even mud roads? if you skid off the road, you are exceeding your own abilities to keep yourself in controll of the vehicle.. dirt roads are not dangerous, you are just simply to unexperienced. i am 17 and i know how to drive better than most city drivers, and i live in both the city, and the country. as for the maintenance, they basically correct themselfs and only get bad when a washoutï»¿ comes through or it rains.
