Rodney Atkins
Guest Artist
Rodney Atkins is every essence of country. He believes in how its music affects people. "There are values and beliefs inside of country music that speak to people, and it's that spirit that lives at the Grand Ole Opry. Every time I'm on that stage, I'm reminded of the message I'm supposed to carry out on the road and on the radio to represent this format.  It makes me proud and very humbled."
The East Tennessee native's second album, If You're Going Through Hell, was released in 2006.  The album produced four No. 1 singles-"Watching You," "These Are My People," "Cleaning This Gun (Come on in Boy)," and the title cut.  In 2009, Atkins released It's America, which achieved immediate success with the title cut. 2011 brought his latest album, Take A Back Road.
Atkins understands that country music, the way it ought to be played, isn't just about life-it is life. "It's about what people face every day. That's what they want to hear in country music. And that's what I draw on, what brought me here, every time I sing."
