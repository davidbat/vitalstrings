“Deer meat and turkey meat and anything wild is about as good as you can get,” Rhett Akins , an avid outdoorsman and hunter, tells Taste of Country when speaking of his wild turkey breast recipe. “The No. 1 main reason this recipe is cool is because you went out and got it yourself. You didn’t go to the grocery store and buy it. You spent hours and sometimes days or weeks trying to get the turkey. So it’s cool to know that you went out and did it on your own, like back in the old days.”
