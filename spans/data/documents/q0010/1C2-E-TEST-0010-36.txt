Watching Dallas and they had a band playing the Rodney Atkins song "Take a Back Road" on the show tonight during the Southfork BBQ (wish it had been Rodney singing though)!

Very Serious!!! Colorado is burning up but the biggest and worst wildfire right now is burning the west side of Colorado Springs. As of 6/26/12 there were 30,000 people evacuated from their homes. We need HELP!!! The firefighters and evacuees need water, Gatorade, non-perishable snacks and/or food. There is also a need for animal food, dogs, cats, horse…Any help will be greatly appreciated.
