Brad Paisley , Darius Rucker , Sheryl Crow , David Nail , Sara Evans , Dierks Bentley , Martina McBride , Rodney Atkins , Little Big Town , Jake Owen , Luke Bryan and Kellie Pickler , Alabama ’s Randy Owen is talking to you when he says “thank you.”
In the wake of a band of tornadoes that ripped through Alabama in the spring of 2011, leveling buildings and taking lives, the singing group organized a benefit concert called Bama Rising to aid citizens and repair their storm-ravaged state. The artists listed above are just some of the singers who lent their talents to the cause, and now Owen says the money raised during the show has been distributed to the people who needed it the most.
“For us, that was so special because it was such a positive influence for our state and it helped so many people,” Owen says. “It’s not just money that’s been taken and thrown out. There’s been a lot of thorough research done about where the money will do the most good. We are very proud.”
Owen says it’s common for people to ask him how it felt to be on stage with Alabama singing their hit songs again. Owen admits the music was rewarding but says, “I felt all the people that were still suffering and all the young children that had passed and all the buildings that were torn down on my shoulders. I know that we will go on with our lives, but still you can’t replace a life.”
Owen says his home state of Alabama is still a long way from being repaired to its pre-storm splendor and says his band intends to continue to help.
Also on the band’s agenda is a reunion of sorts. The group plans to get in the studio to record new music and even do a bit of touring in 2012. As to whether Nashville might be a stop on their itinerary, the singer says, “it’s business."
“Whoever has the money, that’s where we will go,” he says.
