NASHVILLE, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Country music star Rodney Atkins has filed for divorce from his wife Tammy Jo, court documents filed in Williamson County, Tenn., indicate.
The move comes after Rodney was arrested last month for allegedly attacking his spouse during a drunken argument in their home.
Rodney has denied any wrongdoing, but the divorce documents say both parties agree they are "unable to live together successfully as husband and wife," TMZ reported Thursday.

They also each say in the legal papers the other is "guilty of such inappropriate marital conduct as renders further cohabitation unsafe and improper," the entertainment news Web site said.
Tammy Jo is demanding sole custody of their 10-year-old son, while Rodney has requested joint custody of the child, TMZ reported.
