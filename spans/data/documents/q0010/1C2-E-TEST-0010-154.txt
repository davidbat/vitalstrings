All Music Guide Review
Take a Back Road, Rodney Atkins' fourth studio album from Curb Records, is led by the title track, one of the summer’s most memorable singles (complete with a George Strait name check), and Atkins’ fastest rising single to date. The disc will not disappoint his many fans and will undoubtedly yield a few more hit entries on the contemporary country singles charts., Rovi
