The Declaration of Independents,
Think I could tell you that first sentence,
But then im lost, I can't begin to count the theories,
I've had pounded in my head, that I forgot,
I don't remember all that Spanish or the Getty's Berg Address,
But there is one Speech from Highschool I'll never forget,
[Chorus]
Come on in boy sit on down and tell me bout yourself,
So you like my daughter do you now,
Yea we think she's somethin else,
Shes her daddies girl her momma's world,
She deserves respect that's what she'll get,
Aint it son, now ya'll run along and have some fun,
I'll see you when you get back,
Bet I'll be up all night,
Still cleanin this gun
Well now that Im a father,
I'm scared to death one day my daughter is gonna find,
That teenage boy I used to be,
That seems to have just one thing on his mind,
Shes growin up so fast it wont be long before,
I'll have to put the fear of god into some kid at the door,
Yea come on in boy sit on down and tell me bout yourself,
So you like my daughter do ya now,
Yea we think she's somethin else,
Shes her daddy's girl her momma's world,
She deserves respect that's what she'll get,
Now aint it son, now ya'll go out and have some fun,
I'll see ya when you get back,
Probably be up all night,
Still cleanin this gun
Now it's all for show,
Aint nobody gonna get hurt,
Its just a daddy thing.
And hey beleive me man it works
[Chorus]
Yea come on in boy sit on down and tell me bout yourself,
So you like my daughter do ya now,
Yea we think shes's somethin else,
She's her daddy's girl her mommas world,
She deserves respect that's what she'll get,
Aint it son, ya'll run along and have a little fun,
And I'll see ya when you get back,
Probably be up all night,
Still Cleanin This Gun..HAHA...Now son ya'll buckle up and have her back by 10...lets say about 9..30...Drive Safe
