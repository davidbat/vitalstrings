It's a case of country he said/she said.
Rodney Atkins, who was arrested Nov. 21 and charged with domestic assault, has filed for divorce.
His wife, Tammy Jo Atkins, told police that after a night of heavy drinking he assaulted her and tried to suffocate her with a pillow.
But his lawyer, Rose Palermo, tells AP that the allegations of violence are "completely untrue" and that the argument between the couple did not become physical.
The platinum-selling singer, known for hits including Take a Back Road and Farmer's Daughter, decided to file for divorce as a result of the false statement to police, says Palermo.
In divorce filings, both sides allege inappropriate marital conduct. Tammy Jo is seeking full custody of their son, Elijah, 10, along with an equal distribution of their assets, alimony and child support. Rodney is asking for joint custody.  A hearing in the divorce case is scheduled for Dec. 20.
Meanwhile, Rodney is scheduled to perform with Lauren Alaina on Fox's American Country New Year's Eve Live from Las Vegas.
