According to court documents obtained by TMZ , Rodney, 42, "had been drinking alcohol all night and was intoxicated" when he tried to smother his wife,  grab her neck and throw her down the hallway. The alleged incident is said to have taken place in front of the couple's 10-year-old son.
Released on $2,500 bail, Rodney argues that his wife of 13 years blew the incident out of proportion, and has answered her claim with a divorce filing.

"When Mr. Atkins realized their child was in hearing range of the argument his first priority became getting out of the earshot of the child," the singer's lawyer told TMZ in a statement. "Mr. Atkins realized he would have no recourse but to file a complaint for divorce. He has exercised substantial parenting time with the parties son and he will continue to do so while the divorce is pending."
