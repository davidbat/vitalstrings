The best of Rodney Atkins
The Man I Am Today lyrics:
When I was smaller wishing I was taller
I woke up one morning and my mama was gone
I tried to talk to my father he told me not to bother him
he said boy being a man means being strong
Now leave me alone
So you say you wanna see behind the curtain
you wanna know why I don't show it when I'm hurting
It never did me any good before so long ago I locked that door
But please don't think I'm pushing you away
