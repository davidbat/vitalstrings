Limelight barely shined on him
But everyone still remembers when
He whooped up on that boy way bigger
For taking that cheap shot our little kicker
And they threw him out
Oh man you sure you sure hear me shout
 
I yelled he's mine that one
Got a wild-hair side and handsome
It's no surprise what he's done
He's ever last last bit of my old man's son
And i'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah man he's mine and he'll always be
The best thing that ever happened to me
You can't turn it off like electricity
I will love him unconditionally
And i'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah y'all he's mine
I thank god he's mine
