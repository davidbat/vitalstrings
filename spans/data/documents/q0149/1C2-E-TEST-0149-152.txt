I just got done doing a whole lot of piers like you are describing, I think I had about 25.  Mine were 18" diameter and 2 foot deep as well.  I'm no expert, but here are few things I came across:
- I'm not sure how many piers you have but with 25 I knew I wasn't going to be hand mixing.  I also had a long haul since I couldn't let the concrete truck on my driveway.  In the end I ended up getting a pump truck to pump the concrete to my piers.  That cost me some extra $$$ but worth every penny in my situation.  If you only have a few piers then you can hand mix, but that is a pain.  You might want to look into a concrete mixer.
- I bought 18" Sonotube and cut it into 6" slices with the thought being that I sink 4 inches into the hole and let 2 inches stick up.  Trouble is when I augered my holes the tubes didn't fit in nice and tight and I had to drill 2x2 on each side to hold it in place.  This worked OK, but in hindsight I would have just run the tube all the way to the bottom of the hole to make it easier to level and you use less concrete too.
- I used a couple of the Quikrete tubes and they are not nearly has heavy duty as the Sonotube.  Mine saw a good rain before I could get concrete poured and the Sonotube held up great.  The Quikrete ones did OK, but they are a bit flimsier.
- I sunk J-Bolts in the wet concrete and that worked out great for me.  Then I came back with Post bases.
- I used 6x6 posts.  The bases are more expensive, but that did allow me a little play in my construction in case I didn't get all the piers and J-Bolts in a perfect line. They are a little trickier to cut though.  In the end I was glad I used the 6x6.
