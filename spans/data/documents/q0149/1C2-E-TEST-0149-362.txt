When I place a 4x4 post, should the concrete be level with the surface of the ground. Or will it hurt to have this treated 4.4 take some of the dirt for say 2 inches.
Slightly above with a slight taper to shed water, you really don't want mulch keeping the post wet if you can avoid it. 4 inches above grade here is code for a pier (deck support).
I am using those circular tubes. (10"
with 2 bags of the post hole stuff, that you just add water after you pour it in.
But my main question is where should the level of cement be. I got away with having it 2 or 3 inches lower, and covering it with dirt in the past.
Treated 4x4's. Brown..
I don't think I'd use a sonotube except to get the bottom of the post below frost level when using a short post that won't get you there.To fight frost heave.
Course, if you have soil that's difficult to dig a decent tube shaped hole you might use less cement to fill around the post.
Having used concrete to set wooden posts I don't think I'd do it again. I'd just use a 2x4 to tamp in clear or pea gravel under and around the post.
