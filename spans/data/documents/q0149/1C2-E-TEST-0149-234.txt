Comment: 1)      Excavation only – for a 14’x 26’ addition with basement.  The contractor  will first dig a hole and after the foundation is poured will backfill the hole.   The contractor will also dig holes for 6 sonotubes for the deck.  I will provide  the tubes.    2)      Concrete Foundation – 14’x26’ foundation walls.  Will put vapor barrier on  the outside wall before backfill. Will pour the concrete basement floor (may have to  put a few inches of crushed stones).  Will pour concrete in 6 sonotubes for the  deck, which would be about 7-8’ deep.  Sometimes the same concrete contractors do both - excavation and foundation.
