The BIGFOOT SYSTEM is a cone shaped footing form made of light weight recycled high density polyethylene plastic, which replaces the traditional wooden boxes.  BIGFOOT saves time, money and aggravation in a variety of ways while providing greater structural stability, strenght and safety for the poured construction tube footings.
BIGFOOT is simply attached to the construction tube by 3 to 4 screws, then placed into the ground on 4 to 6 inches of crushed rock and leveled. Once it has been inspected by the building inspector, if necessary, it is backfilled for safety and convenience, then poured as one unit using another BIGFOOT, upside down, on top of the construction tube as a funnel.  This method eliminates air pockets, possible frost heaves and effectively sheds water away from the footing. The volume of concrete used is marked on each BIGFOOT.
