SONOP1600
 
The wrapped tubes are black wrapped with flat black wrapping inside the tube and a glossy black wrap on the outside of the tube. They do not come with an end ring. Tubes are made out of heavy rolled paper. Although the tubes are used to make most of the commercial Dobsonian on the market today, they can be refinished and painted. One method of refinishing the tube is using standard plaster board finishing paste or filler used in the home construction trade. After the filler has dried, one need only sand the outside of the tube to leave a smooth surface upon which to apply paint. The wrapped tubes whose part number ends in "L" are tubes that can be cut to match the fabricators particular focal length even if it is a high f/# ratio.
Painted tubes have a white outer surface and a flat black inside surface. The finished tubes come with an end ring.
Note: Sonotubes are used in the construction (building) industry and can usually be obtained from cement companies in an unfinished condition.
