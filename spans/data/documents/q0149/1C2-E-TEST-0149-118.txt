Welcome to Complete Form Rentals! 
We rent Concrete Foundation Forms.  We deliver the forms to your worksite on a trailer that will stay for the duration of your rental.  You use the forms you need and return them to the trailer when you’re done; keeping your worksite in order. When you’re done with the forms we come and retrieve the trailer from your site.
Our storage yard is close to Slegg Lumber Langford, so we are able to supply any work site between Jordan River and Sidney.  We should be able to fill most orders within 24hrs.
Our hours of operation are Monday - Friday 7am - 5pm and Saturday 8am - noon.
Coming Soon!
We are working to also be able to supply the following items:
Decorative Concrete Stamps and Release,
Steel stakes,
Silicon sealers for slabs and driveways, and
Rebar Bending.
If you have any suggestion for what you would like us to supply, please let us know and we will see what we can do!
