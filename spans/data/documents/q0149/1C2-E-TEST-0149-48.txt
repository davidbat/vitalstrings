Mike, around these parts, you can get Sonotube at any Construction Supply Yard.......especially those that have or rent concrete forms. Some of the Ready Mix Concrete Yards have them also.  You may not find 24" diameter at the local Lumber Yard, but they also have tube sometimes.  Be prepared to pay for the tube that large.  I never could figure out why Sonotube is so expensive, but they have always been plenty proud of that stuff.   KC, as far as setting the Tube, I always leave the top just above grade........it makes it easier to level the tube that way.......then just pack soil or your backfill material around the tube and tamp it down.  The tube is thin enough that it won't affect the peir holding power when it deteriorates.  Sonotube is treated with something that makes it last a long time in the ground.
