Rolling structures on site holds its own considerations:
Site will have to have enough room to roll
(width or length of building x 2)
    Rolling                                              path in relationship to water and septic system
   Obstacles in or around the rolling path (trees, shrubs, plants)
   What will the building set on in new location
   All power to the building will have to                                              be disconnected prior to move
   Are you turning or rotating the building
     
Deciding to level a building                                              opens the door to the following considerations:
    to what point will you level too
level as best as practical with potential inside repair work to do
or level till damage starts to surface in living area                                              and leave it at that
are                                              there any bench marks we can use
fireplace                                              base
partial foundation or area that has not moved
    are there unseen factors to consider
work done to building while it was out of level
window/door installed to look level but is not truly                                              plumb
once the building                                              is level - the window/door may not work
if little work was done (shimming, trimming or planing)  items not currently working                                              may be working when we are finished
    after leveling the building what will it set on
will                                              we shim of what is existing
set                                              new pads/sonotubes or other "foundation" type
