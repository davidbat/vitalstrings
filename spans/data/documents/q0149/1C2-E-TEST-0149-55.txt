Sonotube® Meet                     your match, Ceme-Tube™.
by Shelley Hawes
While                   laying footings in wet land for his cabin in northern Minnesota,                   Jim Bradac was troubled by the complications of pouring concrete                   into traditional cardboard Sonotubes®. The material quickly                   became flimsy, and pouring had to be done immediately after                   placement to properly set. Bradac had to believe there was                   an alternative, something as simple as waterproof forms must                   certainly be available. It only made sense.
After careful patent research, Bradac                     discovered there was really no product available to pour                   concrete into that was manufactured out of plastic. “I                   can literally say this is the first to replace traditional                   cardboard forming tubes.” With                   a background in the stainless steel commercial restaurant equipment                   sales for over sixteen years, he set a side a lot of time and                   money to invest in research and development of a simple product                   that would solve his problem. If a guy trying to lay footings                   for his cabin was having these frustrations, certainly the                   construction industry at large would benefit as well.
Great Showing at World of Concrete
“This is a pretty simple                     invention.” After                     spending about $30,000 of his own money on a mold, Bradac                     made a prototype and took it out to World of Concrete. Not                     officially even in business yet, and with no inventory of                     product to fill orders, he wanted to see what kind of response                     the Ceme-Tube™ would generate. From show opening to close,                     the Ceme-Tube™ attracted a crowd at his booth at all times. “The                   whole idea of the show was to see how well they’d be                   received. Contractors were all over them,” Bradac says                   with a smile.
Bradac came up with the idea in 2004,                     and is now setting up distribution throughout the USA. Locally,                   there are several distributors in Wisconsin and Minn, with                   Farrell Equipment contractor supply in Eau Claire, La Crosse                   and Wausau, being one. Cemstone, Brock White and Advanced Shoring                   also carries the Ceme-Tube™ line and Bradac hopes to soon                   see them prominently displayed in showrooms throughout the                   country.
Impervious to Moisture, Ceme-Tube™ can be filled Anytime
What makes Ceme-Tube™ unique                   is not just its durability, but it can be installed, completely                   backfilled and filled with concrete at any later date. Impervious                   to moisture, it can be installed in wet ground conditions and                   maintain its form.
The standard Ceme-Tube™ is made from                     HDPE plastic and is available in 8”, 10”, 12”,                     18”,                     24” and 30” diameters and 4 foot in                   length. The integral collar end allows for stacking piers up                     to 20’ in one pour. (The 30” only                   stacks to 12’) Once desired length is installed, excess                   is easily cut with common power tools. The Ceme-Tube™ can                   be stripped using any type cutting or grinding wheel, and needs                   to only be cut 90% through, as scoring with a utility knife                   the tube will split open, trouble free.
The Ceme-Tube™ works well with manufactured                     footings like Bigfoot and is exceptional for underwater dock                   installation. Optional domed top caps are available to keep                   out rain and dirt and prevent accidents with children and animals.
Pour                   in Place Bollards
Ceme-Tube™ also                   makes the Pour in Place Bollard. It is 8” in                   diameter, and 4’ in length. Upon filling with re-bar                   and concrete, the installation is complete. A highly visible,                   reflective caution yellow color is molded throughout the plastic,                   not just surface applied, and is also available in custom colors.                   The outside is smooth and seamless and once finished, the Bollard Ceme-Tube™ provides a maintenance                   free, aesthetically pleasing product. Concrete or asphalt will                   not adhere to its sides which eliminates friction frost heaving,                   and the cost is a quarter the price of a steel pipe that still                   requires regular maintenance painting.
The Light Pole Ceme-Tube™
As if the tubes and Bollards                   aren’t exciting enough,                   The Light Pole Ceme-TubeTM steals the show! Designed to produce                   a base for parking lot light poles, these specially designed                   18”, 24”, and 30” diameter models                   are also manufactured in reflective caution yellow, which contains                   strong UV inhibitors to protect from fading. Visually appealing                   and minimizing installation labor, the top perimeter has an                   integral radius which transitions the sides of the Ceme-Tube™ to the top surface smoothly. A 17” diameter hole is provided                   on the top to facilitate pouring, finishing and light pole                   installation.
The smooth seamless walls of the                   finished light pole base are extremely heavy to resist dents                     and chips from vehicle contact. There are no visible air                     pockets in the concrete, they never require painting and                     are also available in custom colors.
