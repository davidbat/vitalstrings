Googling on the verbiage 'paper tubes', 'cardboard tubes' or 'sonotubes' located numerous manufacturers of large diameter paper tubes. It was interesting to note so many of the sites indicated sixteen inches as the maximum diameter paper tube they were capable of manufacturing.
Although located in the Northeast, the American Paper company is the second oldest family owned paper tube company in the United States. Their website indicates they manufacture spiral tubes up to 18 inches in diameter.
The Ohio Paper Tube Company produces all sizes of spiral wound tubes and cores, from 1/2 inch in diameter up to 46 inches in diameter.
The Sonotube company website indicates they are located in North Carolina.
