I’ve built two initial materials lists: one for the snow roller shed and for the farmers’ porch
The estimated cost for the farmers’ porch is $3,046.21 .  All materials were priced at Home Depot.  Labor costs or the “in-kind” labor hours have not been calculated, nor “donations” of any materials allowed for.
 
The farmers’ porch is also a gable roof, 12 feet deep and 26 feet long.  Representative drawings are shown at the end of this document.  The drawings were made by 3D Home Architect, so they are representative in nature and architectural quality. 
 
The construction is based on conventional construction methods. 
 
The foundation uses sonotubes filled with concrete. 
 
The is gravel with a wood perimeter to contain the gravel—the materials lists also show the costs with a concrete slab for both. 
 
A double 2x10 rafter girt/top plate is cut into 6x6 posts, 8 feet high with 2x10 rafters on 16 inch centers.  The roof is set on a 5 in 12 pitch. 
 
The roof is sheathed with ¾ inch plywood sheathing and covered with asphalt shingles. 
The gable walls are sheathed in vertical shiplap pine. 
 
The end “walls” of the farmer’s porch has two horizontal rails.
 
Overhead lights and GFCI-equipped outlets will be provided on separate circuits for each shed.
