The planking arrived today from Canada. It was beautifully      packaged in a pair of Sonotubes, and was bundled using strapping tape. The      stock was beautifully clear Eastern White Cedar, carefully machined with      deep bead and cove edges.
The order totaled 2180 linear feet, and cost me $641      (including $80 for UPS shipping, $25 for packaging, and $21 for a broker's      fee). This brings my costs so far to $980.
I unpackaged the planking and laid it out on the setup. The      lengths vary from 7' to 8'6", but the folks at Classic Boat Kits bundled it      in groups by length and marked the bundles, so it will be easy to select      lengths efficiently as I use it.
The first task was to make up a pair of sheer strakes, full      length (17'), to establish the initial planking at the sheer. Since the      planking is short, it was necessary to assemble the sheer strakes by laying      two rows of strip, with staggered butts. The strips were epoxy-glued and      held together by 9/16" staples and a few spring clamps.
I was delighted to find that the staples did an excellent      job of holding the strips together, yet are very easy to pull out, leaving      only a pair of tiny holes in the planking. Tomorrow, I can begin planking in      earnest.
Unfortunately, the electric staple gun died, just as I was      finishing... they're cheap, so I will pick up a new one tomorrow.
I'm about 75 hours into this project.
