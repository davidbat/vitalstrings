About Us
Tattersall's, Inc. was founded in 1884 as a local supplier of coal,  oil and building materials and equipment to Trenton, New Jersey  residents. Since the very beginning of our company, Tattersall's, Inc.  has been known as a leader in providing top-quality products and  service.
For 100 years, Tattersall's, Inc. continued to maintain a solid  reputation through company-wide dedication to building a relationship  with every customer. In 1984, the oil and coal supply division was sold,  and the building supply division was taken over by the current owners.
Today, Tattersall's operates on the same long-standing foundation of  outstanding quality and service. We are experts at what we do, and our  helpful staff and wide variety of products make Tattersall's the best  building materials, masonry supplies, equipment and industrial supplies  dealer in the area. Simply put, our selection of top-quality,  hard-to-find items and attention to service can't be found anywhere  else.
Additionally, Tattersall's is a proud member of the Do It Best Corp.,  a full-line, full-service buying cooperative in the hardware, lumber  and building materials industry. We are also a member of INCOM  Distributor SupplyTM, the industrial/commercial division of Do It Best Corp.
These affiliations give Tattersall's the buying power to give our  customers superior products at competitive prices. With access to more  than 65,000 items, Tattersall's can help you find exactly what you need  for every project and meet your project deadlines. We are big enough to  equip you with all the items you need, but small enough to give you  personalized service and support.
Tattersall's has served thousands of homeowners, professional  builders, masons and industrial customers throughout the Mid-Atlantic  region. We feel this strength comes from the beliefs that our main job  is to help our customers and that better products create better end  results for our customers.
The staff at Tattersall's realizes that  our success is based on the strong customer relationships we have  created and maintained. We always welcome the opportunity to assist you  in any way possible and remain confident we can provide the right  products no matter what the job.
