        This installation is a work in which the artist tuned cardboard                 tubes and assembled them in the shape of a giant tree. On this                 tree the artist placed twelve life-sized robotic replicas of                 himself, and then programmed them to beat out religious hymns                 at humorously irregular intervals. The source of inspiration                 has been a re-imagining and a reconfiguring of his own body.                 Hawkinson says about the work, "Each of these figures taps with                 a different part of its body on the branches of the tree. The                 rhythmic patterns are derived from popular melodies. The title                 refers to the historical Jewish holiday on which the 12 apostles                 of Jesus Christ received the Holy Spirit and were able to speak                 in different languages."
        A visitor of the exhibition explains                 that the first thing you notice is the sound made by the body                 parts striking their respective drums. Nose, toe, finger, penis,                 ear, tap out a delightful percussive music; The figures communicate,                 collaborate, speak in 'tongues.' A clever metaphor is established                 of the human community, our tree of life.
