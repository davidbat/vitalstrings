I have only used sonotubes on two residential jobs for decks many years ago, so my experience is limited.
However, I have set colse to 150 on commercial work. I all cases of commercial aplications we poured the footings first and the tubes later. All of the steel in the footing was tied and set on chiars, and the vertical steel for the piers tied and stubed up before the footing pour. After the footing was poured and finished level we tied the remianing steel for the piers, and set the tubes over it. The bottom of the tubes were held in position by nailing 2x material to the footing around the tube. It was then plumbed and braced  at the top with stakes and 2x lumber.
On large exposed sono tube columns that were stripped and exposed later, one of the companies I worked for had the specialty steel bracing collars and turnbuckle hardware to set and brace the tubes. Others either rented the bracing hardware, or we braced with lumber (a lot of it) for colums up to 14' high. Consolidating the concrete on tall columns with a vibrator was common, but care and experience are needed to keep from seperating the the denser aggragate into a layer at the bottom of the columns. For small piers we just touched the vibrator to the ouside of the tube, dipped in and out quickly, or just rodded the pier by hand. Through all those pours I don't ever remember having a honeycomb or any other problems.
You said you have the time, so why not do them in two pours? Footers first, then the tubes.
