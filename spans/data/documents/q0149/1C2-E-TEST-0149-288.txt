The studio sits on a rise above the house. Here is the foundation from          afar, with the 12x12 beams stacked on the graded site (May). The excavation          work and sonotube foundation were done in summer of 2003.
Here are the same beams stacked at the graded site, looking down at the          house. Note the sonotubes (round cement pillars) peeking out of the dirt.          The beams are laid on the tubes and bolted in place. The flat stones in          the foreground will be steps to the door on the porch, May, 2004.
The beams in place on the sonotubes, with two of the floor joists standing.          The floor joists are 2"x12"x20' and were green when we moved          them in place. Talk about heavy!(mid-June)
Mr. Tim nailing the plywood over the insulated floor of the studio. It          will have a 12 foot screened in porch, whose floor is not insulated, which          you can see framing for in the foreground, late June.
