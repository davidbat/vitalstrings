I really love this idea of the sonotubes. I have been using them forever, in
all kind of ways. I use them mostly to create a sagger of sorts in a pit
fire, or curve in a slab for an assemblage. But the idea of pedestals and
lights in the bottom are awesome.bring on the spray paint. It's too late to
use them this coming weekend, but they will have a future place, in my home
gallery & in the next show.
Thanks guys

I was a journeyman woodworker for several years and I use sono-tubes
for all kind of furniture construction including pedestals. I used to
cover the outside of the tube with "backing sheet" which is a very thin
form of plastic laminate. That gave me a very smooth and even surface
for a coat of paint. As far as keeping tall thin tubes upright I would
suggest putting a plywood bottom in the tube. (cut a circle of plywood
that fits inside the tube, slip it in with some glue and nail it in
place with finish nails) Then carry around some socks (or pant legs)
full of sand around with you. Put your pedestal where you want it, drop
the socks full of sand down in the tube and put the top on.
cheers
