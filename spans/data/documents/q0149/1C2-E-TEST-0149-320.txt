How do I keep my automatic pool cleaner from getting caught on the steps?
we have an in ground pool with a kreepy krauly automatic cleaner. It works great, but it is continually getting caught at the corner of the steps.  How can I keep this from happening? does it have something to do with the weights? The type of Kreepy that we have is the Pentair K70406 Kreepy Krauly Classic Inground Automatic Suction Pool cleaner.
Thanks
