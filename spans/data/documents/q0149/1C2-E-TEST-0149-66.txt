Now to Put It Together
What else can I say.  Within 1-2 weeks we will                                           be digging our 4 foot deep holes with, in my case, a 20" Sonotube at the surface.  We will use the technique described                                           on my MAS Observatory site (you can find this at: http://www.ourastrogallery.com/observatory/id11.html  ) to set the plates in concrete, making sure they are level and pointing to true north.  After that we'll build                                           the deck, erect the observatory and put in the first telescope at SRO.  You can check out our site or follow along on                                           this site to see what that entails.  There will be T1 internet, servers, cloud and seeing monitors with automated roof                                           control, Baytechs in each observatory and a lot of infrastructure to ensure it will all work efficiently.

The Key is getting Out Before the Cement is Poured
Unlike my last observatory, these sonotubes are only                                           about 4.5 feet deep, as there is essentially no frost line at 4600 feet in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  Contrast this                                           to the 3 foot frostline at 300 feet in Maine, the site of my last observatory.  Just for kicks, the highs at the site                                           of my old observatory was 35 deg F today, comared to 75 deg F at my home (elevation of 400 feet in the low lying foothills) and 65 deg F at the observatory site at 4600 feet (only 40  minutes from my house).  The lack of extreme weather                                           conditions, coupled with the laminar air flow should make a significant difference in image quality.  The seeing will                                           improve from 3 arc-secs (my site in Maine) to about 1.5 arc-secs at Sierra Remote Observatories, where the Lost Valley Observatory                                           will be located.

The Process !!!
The key is to be sure the mount                                           is pointed north and is level.  This is not always as easy as it may seem.  In our location we were able to confirm                                           the compas, taking the difference between true and magnetic north into account, was accurate if held a few feet from the sonotube. Essentially,                                           as the cement dries it will contort and move the J-hooks of the mount, buried in the cemnet, forcing us to make constant adjustments.  In the end we succeeded.
