Briefly huh? I'll try. A TL is a transmission line design which is the most common application of the quarter wavelength design. These designs attempt to utilize quarter wavelength acoustic standing waves to reinforce the output of the driver. If that's left you scratching your head check out this website. Based on my experience converting my vented Shiva application I've found that the muddiness and lack of good low frequency has been corrected. I was disappointed the first time I test drove the Shiva. Now I'm fairly impressed. The disadvantage is that it's kinda big. Unless you find a way to bend the tube it's going to be pretty long. Other examples are some folded horn designs which can get a little complex. The biggest advantage other than the sound was the utter simplicity of the design. It just don't get no easier than this. Especially when I was able to use someone elses numbers.
