The optional post hole auger for the Caterpillar 226 skid steer loader utilizes the industry standard quick-attach        mounting system. It features a high torque hydraulic motor capable of drilling 12", 18", or 24" diameter holes into the        ground with minimal effort. Extensions are available for the augers which will give a maximum drilling depth of 5'. Both the        auger and bucket can be used interchangeably on the job site so that you can place the removed dirt wherever you want it.
