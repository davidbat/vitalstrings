What level of finish are you looking for in the building?
If you are planning heat, finished interior walls, nice double hung windows (that you would like to use) and prehung doors, you will need to get your footing below frost line or on bedrock (which ever comes first). If that is your plan then you will need sonotubes for the foundation. The sonotubes will also need a footing at the base to distribute the load and keep it from moving out of position, if you are on bedrock you will not need this just a drilled pin into the stone.
If you are planning no heat (or heating just enough to keep the chill out in fall and spring), no interior finish on the walls, windows (that if they open great), and site build barn doors. I would say go with the blocks and call it good. The only thing I would recommend if you use cinder blocks is that you are putting alot of weight on a 8"x16" area, form up and pour a 2'x2'x6" pad under each area were the blocks are located. Doing that will keep your blocks from rolling and changing the point loads on the floor framing of your structure.
Other than that most towns are going to consider both methods pier foundations and the regulations are the same on both. Because you are not living in the structure it is up to you on how fancy you want to get. The sonotubes are going to give you a better foundation in the long run, but if they are not installed correctly you are wasting time and money. One other thing to consider is having an excavation contractor that will bring their mini-excavator to your site, install the pre-cast footing piers, that way you are not dealing with having to mix and pour concrete and is a lower cost option compared to tradition tubes. And the turn around time is faster, because the contractor digs a hole, sets the pier, backfills and moves to the next.
