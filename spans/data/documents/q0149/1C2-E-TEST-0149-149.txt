Frost Post’s
 
Frost posts are an alternative method to pouring sonotubes. Instead of digging a hole, setting up, and pouring sonotubes; precasted frost posts are instead just dropped directly into the hole and backfilled. This saves large amounts of time and money in avoiding small concrete load fees, and having to take the time to pour a much less attractive looking sonotube. They are also commonly used as barriers around buildings, kerosene tanks, and more.
