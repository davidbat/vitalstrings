Three years                   ago, while laying concrete footings for his family cabin, Jim                   Bradac ran into a problem.
The ground was so wet that the cardboard forming tubes                   got soggy and useless before he could pour concrete into them.
Wasn't there a plastic tube he                   could use instead, he asked his local hardware store? The answer                   was no.
So Bradac invented his own: the Ceme-Tube™,                   a lightweight but tough plastic tube with three designs for                   concrete footings, light-pole bases and protective bollards.
Now, the 44-year-old Hudson, Wis., businessman is                   pouring his life into his new venture. After spending three                   years getting Ceme-Tube™ ready, he closed his other business                   of 17 years, the Hudson sheet-metal shop that supported him,                   his wife and six kids.
Bradac is confident - and a little nervous.                   He knows it takes time for a new product to seep into customers'                   consciousness.
But he believes he's got a winner given the initial reaction of customers and others in the construction                   trades. "People keep telling me that I'm                   going to be blown away," he said recently, surrounded                   by stacks of his black and reflective yellow Ceme-Tube™ parts                   in a Hudson warehouse. He didn't begin selling tubes until                   late September because he wanted to have them in stock first,                   so he's sold only $8,000 in tubes so far; but he's projecting                   revenue in 2008, his first full year, of $500,000 to $1 million,                   and doubling the year after that.
The Ceme-Tube™ looks pretty simple. It's made of high-density                   plastic that is shoved into a hole in the ground. Construction                   workers can pour concrete into the tube to form a footing for                   anything from a backyard deck to a building.
The traditional                   forming tube is made of cardboard, which is cheap and easy                   to peel away afterwards. Most workers call them "Sonotubes," after                   the biggest and best-known brand. But the cardboard product                   wicks moisture if the ground is wet or if it's raining, Bradac                   said. In cold weather, ice crystals can adhere to the cardboard,                   causing "friction                   frost heaving" when the ground expands that can move the                   entire footing.
The Ceme-Tube™ is waterproof,                   of course. The plastic is pliable to minus 30 degrees, and                   because it isn't porous, ice doesn't adhere to it, Bradac said.
To                   make them easier to use, Bradac has the tubes molded in 4-foot                   lengths with built-in collars to make them stackable to up                   to 20 feet.
Bradac said his research showed no other plastic forming tubes.                   There are waxed cardboard tubes that can be used when wet,                   but after three or four days, those soak through.
He's patented his tubes and their features, like the built-in                   collar. He's also built a couple of other products upon the                   basic Ceme-Tube™.
One is a light-pole base. The part below ground is a basic                   blackCeme-Tube™, but the part that pokes up above ground as                   the pole's base is a reflective yellow.
Unlike the standard cardboard form, which is peeled away,                   the plastic yellow part is designed to remain and be an aesthetically                   pleasing design element.
The other is a Ceme-Tube™ bollard,                   which also has a safety yellow plastic top and cap that poke                   up out of the ground. Bollards normally are steel tubes filled                   with concrete, used in parking lots or outside buildings as                   protective barriers. Bradac fills his tubes with rebar and                   concrete, and because they're made of plastic, they are one-quarter                   the cost of steel tubes and don't need to be repainted, he                   says.
Although plastic tubes cost more than cardboard, the ability                   to use them in wet ground or in the rain saves time and money,                   said Bob McElroy, outside sales manager for Brock White Co.,                   a St. Paul-based construction materials distributor that is                   selling Ceme-Tube™ through                   its Upper Midwest and Canada stores.
"It basically eliminates the weather element and speeds                   up construction time," he said, adding there is not another                   plastic forming tube available for below-grade concrete work                   - meaning in the ground.
Farrell Equipment, Cemstone and Advanced Shoring also carry                   the products.
Bradac said he got a positive response when he took his product                   to the World of Concrete trade show in Las Vegas in January,                   setting up a booth and a demo - a conventional cardboard tube                   soaking in a clear bucket of water next to his Ceme-Tube™ in                   another water bucket. "Paper or plastic?" his banner                   read. "The choice is clear."
But his direct competition is enormous. Sonoco Products Co.,                   maker of Sonotubes, reported revenue of $3.66 billion last                   year.
Bradac has spent a lot of money getting into three architectural                   catalogs, and his company already has seen a lift. In August,                   architects ordered Ceme-Tube™ for                   five projects; in September, that number climbed to 31 and                   to another 32 projects in October, he said.
"We're finally getting our break, and the word is getting                   out," he said.
