Hello, all -
Well, we seem to be back in business after a long, frustrating, WET summer.   I will resist the temptation to bore you all with the details of how we've gotten to this point - saving that for an actual house thread, which actually looks like it may be coming soon! 
I'm just wondering if anyone has had any trouble with sonotubes - the actual name brand ones - as opposed to any other forms?  We poured sixteen piers (48" deep) yesterday; 14 were a brand called "ecoform" and the other two were sonotubes, just because the supply yard ran out of the ecoforms.  We noticed that the sonotubes were a lot lighter, and not waxed, but didn't think much about it.  Set them all up identically, braced them all identically, identical footers, etc.  We killed ourselves bracing them all the morning of the pour, to be sure they hadn't been out collecting moisture all night.  They were dry, dry, dry.  While we were pouring #8, the two sonotubes, full of concrete, dissolved.  Just melted away.  Sickening...and of course, expensive. 
We rushed to turn eight nice siding boards and a bunch of scrap into impromptu forms, and - after one of those burst apart, too - all is well.  The 14 ecoforms are just fine, and the other two will do the job.  But shoot - what a lot of panic, hard work, and expense!  I've never heard of this happening to anybody else.  The guy running the pumper truck assured us that we had done everything just right, and that this happens with sonotubes - the brand specifically - all the time.  He wasn't a bit surprised, and rattled off a litany of spectacular failures he's witnessed that made ours look like small potatoes. 
Do you think he's right?  I just thought that if this is even a remote likelihood, it might be helpful for anybody out there about to pour piers.  I wouldn't wish this stress, mess, or expense on anybody!
