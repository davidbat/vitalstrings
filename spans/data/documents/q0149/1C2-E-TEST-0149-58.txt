The pressure of wet concrete is significant. Considering the height and size of your sonotubes, we also recommend additional lateral bracing at the top of the tubes with at least (2) 2x4 members running tangentially at a 45-degree angle from the top of the tube to the ground (anchored to the ground with heavy-duty wooden stakes). The two 2x4's should be at 90-degrees relative to each other to provide lateral bracing along both axes.
As you're pouring, be sure to tap the sonotubes all around or use a vibrator to ensure proper consolidation of the wet concrete. Internal steel reinforcement often impedes the flow of concrete resulting in voids and air pockets.
