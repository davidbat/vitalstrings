Once you've had the opportunity to visit us and find that we
don’t carry a product that you want or need, just ask and
we'll consider stocking it for you. *
WE ALSO SERVICE AND CARRY PARTS FOR ALL THE
EQUIPMENT WE SELL!
* We promise that we will research your suggestion and, if a requested product meets our rigid standards and qualifications, we will strongly consider the feasibility of adding it to our current inventory. If it does not pass our qualifications, we will still try to order and keep it in stock or we will special order a supply just for you. As some specialized equipment is too large, too costly or experimental to keep on hand we may not be able to keep it in stock; but we will do our best to meet your needs in a timely fashion.
