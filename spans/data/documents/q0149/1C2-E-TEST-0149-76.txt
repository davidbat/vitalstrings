For buying so many? How many would he be buying at $160 / $152? I don't think the FiCar 15" IB was ever mentioned.

And what do you mean a line array approach? Just because the drivers wouldn't be down fired? That is irrelevent...nothing to do with line arrays.
Who said anything like that?
It would be like a line array project in that you wouldn't need the cleanest drivers because the individual demand on each driver would be minimal. I don't see many line arrays using $200+ ScanSpeak drivers.

I still don't know why people seem to only care about cheap displacement. Why choose a driver simply because it offers cheap displacement since ~16 subs are being used. If we were talking about one or two subs, I'd agree with you...but we're not.
I think you answered your own question at first and then got it backwards at the end. If only using one or two drivers, go for the cleaner one. If using multiples, go for the cheaper ones because the demands on each driver will be very little. If you were building an IB with 12 drivers, would you get 12 LMS 18s or something a little cheaper? Now what about if you could only afford one driver?

You said it...displacement isn't an issue with so many drivers. So why not choose the driver that has the best motor/distortion profile, and increased bandwidth. Kind of a no brainer...
Because the low distortion qualities really won't even come into play if it's only being asked to do very little. I'm really not following you on this one. Go cheaper and save some money.
