Re: Building a house on sonotubes
Thanks guys, the house is about a foot off the ground in the front and about 5 foot off the ground in the rear of the house, making it basically useless dead space. The lot needs work, I would bring fill in to level things out a bit and then get make a new driveway and pave. We looked at it again today and decided that even though the lot is in need of help (no grass to speak of and a driveway that will barley fit my truck) its still a good buy and with some landscaping will be beautiful. The cathedrial ceilings throughout, fireplace, and general look of the house kind of seals the deal, not to mention the house itself is perfect ready to move in.
From the looks of things this was someones summer cottage and they turned it into a year round home, it has new electrical service, and new siding. It is 1200 square feet, not huge but since we have no kids, its perfect.
We figured we could spend 5,000-10,000 on landscaping. How much work could one do for 10,000, a fair amount or is fill and grass seeding expensive? As this is my first home i am unsure, it doesnt need a ton of fill, maybe 2-3 dump truck loads to just get the front yard the way we would want it. Hard to say without seeing it I know, but mainly is it reasonable to assume we could get a good amount of work done for 5-10K? Would like a short (15x20 paved driveway as well and I think we figured that into our 10K budget.
