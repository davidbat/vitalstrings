Modular housing cost (long answer):
The cost is affected by a number of calculations. The size (singlewide/doublewide/custom), if it’s to be put on a basement, foundation wall or sonotubes, what options you want in it, freight, setup, etc. Pricing per square foot is subject to change without notice. Modular homes are considerably less expensive than site build or other prefab homes. This is primarily because they are built under controlled conditions indoors, which allows for very little waste of materials and time waiting for the weather or tradesman. Materials are purchased in large quantities and the savings is passed on to you, the end consumer. You end up with a quality built home for a lot less money.

What is the difference between a modular home and a site built home?
Modular homes are built just like a site built home. The only difference is, it’s built indoors in a factory and comes delivered & ready to assemble in 2 parts. It has the same 2x6 walls, 2x10 or 2x8 floor joists, roof pitch, interior 3/8” drywall, furnace, ductwork, plumbing etc. as a site built home.
