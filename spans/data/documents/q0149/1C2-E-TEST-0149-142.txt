Re: Sonotube questions Please respond if you know
Sonotube is made of heavy cardboard. You can set the sonotube on the bottom of the hole or put a wedge between the sonotube and the wall of the hole to hold it in place, cut it off at the height you want for the finished elevation of the piers. Then drop your rebar into the hole and use a pice of scrap rebar across the top of the sonotube to hold the rebar in place.
Caution: Make sure the sonotube is held in place very well. Keep in mind that a concrete truck will "shoot" the concrete into it at an angle and if the tubes are not steady they will be knocked sideways very easily.
Then pour the concrete to the top of the sonotube. After it sets up you can remove the cross piece of rebar you used to hold the rebar in place and you are done.
My objection to pouring footings and setting the rebar on top and then pouring the piers is you will have a "cold joint" in the pier where moisture is subject to entering. If it gets to the rebar the rebar will rust and heave upward. The cold joint will be a weak spot in the pour and it will make it easier for the rested rebar to heave.
I have seen rusted 1/2" thick steel plate heave 1/4" or more.
In industrial construction cold joints are not allowed because they are weak and allow entry of water into the joint.
You might want to consider hiring a concrete contractor to install the piers. He will make quick work of it and I doubt it will cost you that much more than doing it yourself. If you get a concrete truck on site and run into leaning sonotubes or other problems the concrete company will start charging you time after the truck is there for more than 30 or 45 minutes. In addittion, concrete that sits in the truck too long starts setting up, the driver may have to add water to keep it from setting up in the truck, and your finished concrete will be weaker than it should be.
