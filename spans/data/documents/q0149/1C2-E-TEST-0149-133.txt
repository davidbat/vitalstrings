I'm planning on putting in a concrete ramp/walkway up to the front entrance of my home. The height needed to go from ground to door is about 8-10"; thereby requiring a 8-10 ft ramp. I've received estimates where some indicate the need for sonotubes, others without. As my property is mostly limestone and they would not be able to dig down very deep are sonotubes necessary?
