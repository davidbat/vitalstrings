Phase I
Site Preparation
Shrubs, plants and other vegetation are removed from work areas. Tarps and plywood are placed around your home to protect the surrounding lawn.
Phase II
Shoring
Temporary shoring is placed under your homes existing beams. A 24" hole is dug below grade where new pier locations have been determined. This footing, or pad, is 24" wide by 24" deep. Rebar is tied together inside this footing and concrete is poured to a height of 12", leaving only the exposed rebar in the center for sonotube installation after it's had sufficient time to cure, usually 24 hours.
Leveling
Concrete blocks are used atop these footings to accommodate the hydraulic jacks used in the leveling process. The crew moves systematically, following the direction of the Field Superintendent, to create a gentle and uniform lift. The Field Superintendent monitors the reaction of the structure and the interior elevation readings throughout the leveling process.
Phase III
Pouring
Sonotubes are cut to span from the top of the previously poured footing to the new height of the beam. Rebar is tied together inside the 10" sonotube to provide ample strength and rigidity to the form. The sontubes are placed over the exposed rebar on the footings and concrete is poured into each form by hand.
Pier Completion
After the sonotubes have had sufficient time to set, the forms used in pouring are stripped away and any nominal space between the top of the sonotube and the beam is filled with steel shims. The remaining 12" void below grade is filled with dirt, leaving only the sonotube column exposed above grade.
