My server doesn't have the original post...
I live right down the street from you (Essex Junction).  Depending
on your soil type frost can go down a *lot* further than common
knowledge.  Several years ago, during a particularly cold stretch,
water mains all around Chittenden County froze and broke 7-8' under
roads.
I put my sonotubes down 48". Over the past ten or so years, they've
pushed out at least 2' (one completely).  Every year I have to
relevel the deck, often requiring a concrete saw to cut the pillar.
I was told 48" but it clearly wasn't enough for my soil (clay on
ledge).   With all the rain, it'll likely be mid July before I can
do it this year. :-(

42" isn't even close. Also, backfill the sonotubes with gravel,
*NOT* dirt.
