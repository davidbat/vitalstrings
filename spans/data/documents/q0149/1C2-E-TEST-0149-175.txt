-steps not necessary, depending on surrounding grading
Disadvantages
-concrete slab absorbs heat from the ground
-high labor cost to create formwork
Post on Pier
Advantages
-Passive cooling, cool air pulls up from under the floor deck, decreasing need for A/C use & $$$$$.
-Reduce chances from crawling bugs from entering house, especially  ground termites
-no concern from flooding
-cheaper if land is sloped, less cost on earthwork.
Disadvantages
-need for steps, inconvienent for seniors and handicapped
-creaking sounds in flooring, unless you pay for larger floor beams
Most people prefer slab on grade because they don't have to go up and down steps everytime they go in or out of houses. But in my experience in house designs designing for passive cooling (designing for cool indoor temperature without using A/C) post on pier is better.
Suggest instead of using traditional post & pier, look into sonotubes, which are like gigantic cardboard toilet paper rolls that are used for formwork. Sonotubes are much faster and cheaper to build up the posts and you set your anchorbolts and beams on top of it. Don't need to go higher than 30" - 36" above grade based on County code, which I think is 30" minimum.
