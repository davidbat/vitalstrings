About the design and designerby Ralph Calabria
Ron Stimpson is a 16-year veteran              of the US Army, involved in Military Intelligence.His audio interests stem from the many years of reading audio              publications (including Secrets, of course).Like a lot of us, his main impetus to start building subwoofers was the   "I-want-it-all-for-almost-nothing" syndrome. As these pages have preached in the past, if you want big bass and don't want to pay big bucks, make it yourself.When Ron is not building subs, he can be found lifting weights and              bicycling.Ron shares with us one              of the many subwoofers he's built using Sonotubes (a la Hsu Research              Technology).The design is based on              a 12" Hsu car audio driver in a vented alignment.As you will see, there's not much wood to cut, which is one of the many              advantages of this project.Need an              end table that does more than hold a few books?Read on!    
Introduction
Forget "Got              Milk?" Rather, think "Do You Want Bass?"So I ask, "why not DIY??"If              you want to get the most "bang for your buck", go for a do-it-yourself              subwoofer.Why?Perhaps you too have a fairly meager home theater budget, but still want              lots of bass. With a little homework, some "Hsu Research" drivers, and              items from part supplier "Madisound", (filled out with supplies from              Home Depot), I was able to make two very attractive looking subs for very little              money (comparatively speaking).So              can you, and with common tools.
Now, even with a good home-built              sub, you need power; but used amps like my Soundcraftsmen (model PM 860,              300watts/channel into 4 ohms) are available for $150 or less.When I tallied things up, I was still under budget (and based on advice              from Tom Vodhanel, AKA "The Sub Human"), I ended up getting a new ART              351 equalizer to give me more flexibility in tuning the sub in my room.
The Bottom Line: For less than $600, I've got two subs that extend to below 20 Hz and pump out SPLs in the low              120 dB (nearfield).I think they              look better and sound louder than store-bought subs, even those that cost twice              as much.Not including the power amp, you can build a first rate sub for about              $200 US.
I'm no genius.If you can make a spice rack for your "significant other", you              can make a cloned Hsu powered, cylindrical-based sub.  Of course, you can use other drivers too, but it would be hard              to beat Hsu woofers for the price/performance ratio.  If you have a weekend, and like to work with your hands,              it's the best way to rock on a budget.
Here's the "Reader's              Digest" version of making the 'The RJS Big 12"er Subwoofer', an              end-table configured cylindrical subwoofer.It's very similar to the Hsu 12Va, which can be found at http://www.hsuresearch.com .The word is that Dr. Hsu is no longer making this model.For me, this was all the more reason to build my own sub!Having completed this sub, I felt confident to design something a bit more              original.Since building this sub,              I've built two others.
The              Enclosure
For this design, I used a 23"              (height) piece of 24" (diameter) "Sonotube", which is a super-dense              concrete form material (imagine cardboard tubes on steroids), available nearly              everywhere that construction materials are sold.Cutting the tube square              on the ends is tricky, but I found that a good sharp saber saw blade worked fine.
Hsu's 12Va is a bit shorter (20" tube), but I found the larger size                to be perfect for table height (the 3" legs I put on my sub added to the final                tube height).Most such tube                material (there are other brands besides Sonotube) has a heavy waxy-feeling                polymer coating on the interior.  I was able to peel this off in full strips, which makes gluing the end caps more certain.After this, I also sprayed the interior with autobody undercoating                (except the ends of the tube) to help reduce resonance.I also affixed a 1" layer of polyester batting material (available                  from Madisound) for the same reason.Stick-on                  Velcro worked here.Pieces of                  tape on the inside of the tube, before you spray with undercoating, make nice                  stick-on points for the Velcro.A                  rasp/rough file works great to smooth the ends of the tube and round them a bit,                  which makes inserting the end caps MUCH easier.
The              End Caps
This is the only difficult part of the construction process.Make              these out of 3/4 inch "MDF".This              stuff is much less resonant than particle board, but produces a lot of              dust when being cut.After drawing              the circles that are needed to just fit into the tube (use a stick with a nail and pencil              for a rough but effective compass), I rough-cut the MDF pieces with a saber saw,              then cut close to the pencil line using a band saw.  Final precise cutting/smoothing was done with a router and              circle jig.
I used a single internal end                     cap for the top and a double laminated inner end cap for the bottom.  The final top was 2" larger in diameter than the tube.This gave a nice top that was, in turn, bonded to the top of the sub (in                     effect making a 2.25" laminated top).All this might seem over-built.It                     is NOT.The Hsu sub is famous for                     moving around.  Mine does not, but any less mass and it might be a problem.
Laminate the end caps with                     standard wood glue and clamps.
Make sure you cut holes for the                     driver, ports and binding post/speaker terminals BEFORE laminating.  Cutting 3/4" MDF is bad enough!
If you use the flares available                     from Madisound (see below or go to http://www.madisound.com ), the cuts will be larger than the inside diameter of the ports, but the flares                     provide a nice means to fasten the port assembly to the end cap.
Endcaps can be affixed to the                     enclosure with standard wood glue and wood screws (I used flat-head screws,                     which went in and made their own coutersink).Be sure to put a bead of silicone caulk around the inside seam to seal                     air leaks.
Laying out the ports, binding                     posts and 12"woofer on the sub bottom (before cutting of course) really is                     best done, by eye, with the items in place.Maximize space around each of these items and you are all set to cut.
The              Ports
Depending on the enclosure volume              and the desired tuning frequency, you need to finalize port length.  4" thin-wall PVC "sewer pipe" is ideal, as are              the 90" elbows you need to assemble the "J" shaped ports.This configuration is used by Hsu, and in my design to get (in my case)              35" long dual ports to fit into a 23" high tube. Given my enclosure              volume, these ports resulted in a 19 Hz tuning frequency.Subsequent tests have validated this.The port flares from Madisound are slick, but I suspect hardly critical.  Standard PVC pipe glue works fine to assemble the ports, but              once glued, they cannot be unstuck (you have about 3 seconds to adjust them once              you place glued ends together).Again, you want to maximize the space around everything in the sub.My ports are no closer than a port width from each other.They rise about 16", go parallel to the top, then bend back down to   "hover" directly over the driver, which is mounted externally,              pointing downward.I sprayed nearly              a whole 20 oz. can of rubberized undercoating on all port tubes and the end caps              to kill vibration, and added more polyester batting to the ends too. This paid              off, as I have not a single buzz or rattle.
The              Legs
I managed to find some furniture              legs with stamped steel base plates.The              total "reach" of the legs was cut to 3".  Don't go with much less, since there is A LOT of air being              moved by the driver and ports under load.I              used "T Nuts" from the inside of the sub to reinforce the bolts, which              affixed the legs from the bottom.I              would hesitate to rely solely on simple wood screws to bite sufficiently into              the MDF.It's really pretty fragile              stuff.(I did use wood screws and              silicone to affix the driver to the underside of the sub, however.) I used only              three legs for this design, as did Hsu. This gives good balance on any surface.              Heavy duty rubber "stick-on" bumpers helped stick the legs to my wood              floor.
Cosmetics
I went with this design since I              knew it would be out in the open part of my room.Madisound              sells heavy black speaker cloth that is perfect for making a double layer   "sock" to slip over the tube.Make              the sock about 1" too small in circumference and one inch too long in              height. This will make the stretch of the sock perfect.I painted the tube in semi-gloss black first to help make sure it would              be truly black.It is a perfect Hsu   "clone" externally.I              upgraded Hsu with the top.His              is (externally) only one layer and flush with the tube.Mine was 1.5" thick (dual layers of MDF) and 2" diameter larger              than the tube.  I put a 1/2" radius on the corners using a router.After a coat of gray primer, I finished the top with granite finish   "speckle paint".  This not only looks nice, but makes detailed sanding and              finishing unnecessary.(The top was              bonded to the single layer inner end cap with about 3/4 tube "Liquid              Nails".)
So              how'd it come out?
So far, this project exceeded              my hopes, and it seems to work very, very well.That old Soundcraftsmen amp, driven by the LFE channel of my Denon              receiver, really does the trick.I              would not go with less than 150 watts into the 4 Ohm load that the Hsu driver              gives. With 300 watts you can exceed the maximum excursion the driver.Summing up performance, you can expect that such a sub, corner              loaded, will attain about 117 - 118 dB at 20 Hz using a 1 m microphone distance.              With typical room gain then, you'll see (or rather hear and feel!) greater than              110 dB from 20 Hz and up in most listening positions in the typical home theater              room. This is competitive with many VERY expensive commercial subwoofers. Best              of all, this sub seems subtle when needed. It does not intrude unless the LFE              calls for it.
