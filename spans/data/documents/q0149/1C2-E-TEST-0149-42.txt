They did seem pretty sturdy, but will they be sturdy enough?  I'm thinking of using a 10" MTX or Infinity car sub that I have laying around to build a sonotube for my computer.  They had the ends for it, I think used in making small tables, 15" for $6.  So all in all I should be able to walk out of Lowes with under $30 spent and all the hardware to build this sub.
Do you guys think this tube will be sturdy enough?  Is this the same strength that the larger ones are?  Also, what's the best way to bond the cardboard tube to the wooden table top?
Thanks!
the tube will be sturdy enough, don't worry about that
if you search the archives, .. you will find a thread i started on building a TL using sonotube and an MTX 4000 12" woofer. that driver was no good in this application, though it was decent in the car. ... woofer flapping all over the place.  not sure what enclosure you want to build, .. results may vary with another enclosure type
use liquid nails, ..look for my thread for pics / details etc
