About ACE
It was in Chicago that the ACE Hardware Corporation was founded in 1924. The founder of ACE Hardware, Richard Hesse, was familiar with the disadvantages associated with traditional procurement of goods at retail. At that time, a major concern was to make a profit while offering competitive prices. Purchases from a salesman or a commercial intermediary were not advantageous because the product price rose while cutting the profit margin of the retailer.
