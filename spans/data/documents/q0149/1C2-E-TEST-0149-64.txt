I have two Soundsplinter RL-p15 LLT sonotubes that works really well in the rear center of my room. The problem is my projector is hung there, and the tubes are too tall to fit under it. So I'm going to lie them on the side, and stack them. They need to go on top of each other, like this: 8. I don't have space to put them both on the floor. How can I do this? Any tips to make them stay like that?
