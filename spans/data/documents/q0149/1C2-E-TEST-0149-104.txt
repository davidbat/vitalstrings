The USDA Zone map might be a good guideline. I am in Zone 6 next door to
you.  Bottom of footing 18" below finished grade here.
Your local building inspection office can tell you for sure what it is in
your area.
BTW, around here at grade decks just float.  Not sure what the rules are for
those over 8' off the ground.

The building inspector will know. Here it is 48" May bell be that in your
area a bit north of me.

You need a local source, building inspectors,
contractors, etc.   Depth of frost can vary
tremendously over a short distance.  And those
that use the published depths may end up with
major repairs during an extreme year.  For your
purpose it is probably not that critical.

I live in Toronto.  We're around the same latitude, and 42" is th
standard here.  Building codes must err well on the safe side, so 42
is probably more than safe.  Unless you plan to have your loca
government issue a building permit, then I can assure you that 42" i
perfectly safe
