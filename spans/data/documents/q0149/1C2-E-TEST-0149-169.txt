The design of an addition is a matter of combining architectural features with personal taste. An addition should blend with the structure and duplicate the existing details as much as possible. There are many roof, wall, window and door options that are discussed later. In short, we can use many combinations to create an addition. The design of an addition and how it will be used will determine what type of components will be used. There are three basic categories of use:
Category # 1: Sunrooms
These additions are designed to be used year round and as such combine the finest in energy efficient components. Typically this would include windows, doors, overhead glass sections that are glazed with high performance insulating glass for maximum comfort and thermal efficiency. The roof can be any combination of wood beams and shingles, skylights, or glass sections. Insulating aluminum roof systems are also available.
 
This category is constructed to be used throughout the year but only periodically in the winter. All glazing (glass) is insulating type but of standard performance. Roof options are same as # 1.
 
Category # 3: Porch and Patio
This category is designed for seasonal use and includes single glazed windows and   doors. This type of addition can still be used periodically in the winter, but it   is generally not practical to heat it for year round use. Roof options are same as above with the addition of a non insulating aluminum roof and wall system, commonly   referred to as a "patio enclosure". 
 
***** WALL ARRANGEMENTS and COMPONENTS***** 
(A) CONSTRUCTION;
(1) The wall framing is normally wood, 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 construction with 1/2" plywood sheathing.
(2) Interior finish options are many, the most popular being tongue and groove pine or drywall.
(3) Wood casing for the windows and doors and wood baseboard moulding is installed.
(4) The wood and/or drywall can be stained or painted, or prepared for finish by others.
(5) Insulation, electrical, phone & cable, and plumbing are installed as desired.
(6) On non-heated rooms, aluminum framing can be used.
(B) WINDOWS;
    (A) Sliding windows;
(1) Available with screens and grids.
(2) Sliding windows offer the easiest operation and there are no projecting sash that may be 
hazardous if a deck or sidewalk is nearby.
(3) Available in many sizes including widths to 6' and heights to 5'.
(4) Constructed of vinyl, wood with aluminum or vinyl cladding on the exterior, or aluminum.
(5) Available with "Heat Mirror" high performance insulating glass, "low e" high performance         glass, standard insulating glass, or single glass.
(6) Argon gas between the glass panels available on insulating glass for higher performance.
(7) Tinted glass in gray, bronze, blue, and other colors.
(8) Both sashes will slide on vinyl or aluminum sliders.
(9) Sliding sashes on all sliders will lift out for easy cleaning.
    (B) Casement windows;
(1) Available with the same options as the sliders.
(2) Casement windows are hinged on the side and offer near 100 percent ventilation when all sashes are           open.
(3) Projecting sashes when windows are opened must be considered in the sunroom design.
(4) Windows are operated by a crank, many casements equals lots of cranking.
    (C) Awning windows;
(1) Essentially the same as casement except are hinged at the top.
(2) Not available in large sizes as are casements or sliders.
(3) Can sometimes be left open in a rainstorm with minimal water intrusion.
    (D) Picture or fixed windows;
(1) Same options as all above except are non-venting.
(2) Available in larger sizes than any above.
(C) DOORS:
(1) Available with screens and grids.
(3) Available in many sizes including widths of 5', 6', 8', 9' and 12'.
(4) Constructed of vinyl, wood with aluminum or vinyl cladding on the exterior, or aluminum.
(5) Available with "Heat Mirror" high performance insulating glass, "low e" high performance         glass, standard insulating glass, or single glass.
(6) Argon gas between the glass panels available on insulating glass for higher performance.
(7) Tinted glass in gray, bronze, blue, and other colors. 
    (B) Hinged doors;
(1) Available with the same options as the sliders except not available in vinyl.
(2) Single doors available in widths of 24", 32" and 36", special sizes available.
(3) Double doors available in widths of 4', 5'6", and 6'.
(4) Double doors can be set up as "French" doors with both doors opening.
(5) Double doors can be set up as single acting with the operating door hinged in the center.
(6) This center hinged door allows furniture to be placed closer to the door.
(7) Center hinged doors usually include a sliding screen. 
Window and door options are available from the following           companies:  Andersen, Marvin, Pella, Hurd, Harvey, and Dove.
***** ROOF SYSTEMS *****
(1) We offer several different roof systems and many different roof designs.
(2) The design of the roof is the first item to be considered.
(A) THE GABLE ROOF;
(1) The most popular design is the "Gable" or "A" shape.
(2) This design normally blends with many homes and allows the use of a cathedral ceiling.
(3) The gable style roof can be extended from a one or two story home.
(4) Adding to the side of a one story requires the new roof to be extended back onto and tied        into the existing roof framing and shingles.  This is commonly called a reverse gable roof.
(5) If the design includes a cathedral ceiling, the gable end wall above windows or doors            can have circle top windows, trapezoid glass panels, or be framed solid. Designing the room       with either circle tops or trapezoids considerably lightens the room and reduces the need        for skylights.
(B) THE STUDIO STYLE ROOF;
(1) The studio, or "shed" roof, is commonly used when the sunroom is to be attached to the side       of a two story house.
(2) This design allows for either a vaulted ceiling or a level ceiling.
(3) Studio style roofs are not usually used when the roof is to be connected to the side of a       single story. The existing roof can be "built up" so the new roof will begin high enough to      slope enough to have shingles. A better approach for this application is to build the            roof "flat" and install a rubber roof instead of shingles.
(C)  MISC. STYLE ROOFS;
(1) We have also built roofs with un-even pitches on each side, called "Carriage Style".
(2) Another design is the "Gambrel" or barn style roof. 
(3) Our experience will allow us to design and build roofs for unusual circumstances, but       incorporate practices that will still enhance the appearance of your           home. 
 
(1) The floor can be a wood system or concrete.
(2) Both systems require a foundation for support that is also protected from frost movement.
(A) CONCRETE FLOORS;
(1) Concrete floors are usually best if the level of the floor is close to the level of              surrounding ground. 
(2) A foundation "footing wall" consisting of a 40" deep trench filled with concrete will        surround the floor on three sides. 
(3) Foam insulation can be installed on the perimeter of the foundation and under the floor          if the sunroom is to be           heated, as well as a vapor barrier.
(4) Carpet, ceramic tile, or hardwood flooring can be installed for the finish flooring.
(B) WOOD FLOORS;
(1) Existing wood decks can sometimes be used for the floor if they are properly constructed.
(2) A wood floor system must have a suitable foundation.
(3) This would consist of either a number of concrete piers or continuous foundation wall.
(4) The pier system is 40" deep holes approx. 20" diameter that are filled with concrete to a height of 2" above the ground. Round "sonotubes" are used as forms for the concrete.
(5) A steel post connector is attached to the concrete pier and a treated wood post is installed to support the deck/floor. 
(6) The continuous foundation wall system consists of a 40" deep trench around three sides of the floor system.
(7) The trench has a concrete "footer" poured in it, then concrete blocks are laided up to the bottom of the floor joists, similar to a standard house foundation system.
(8) The wood floor system is built with floor joists and 3/4" tongue and groove plywood.
(9) Insulation is installed between the floor joists if the sunroom is to be heated. 
(10) In the case where a pier system is used and insulated, wind barrier along with either plywood, O.S.B. sheathing, or vinyl ceiling panels are installed on the underside.
(11) With a pier system, the area between the floor and the ground can be closed in with a variety of exterior paneling or lattice.
(12) Carpet, ceramic tile, or hardwood flooring can be installed for the finish flooring.
