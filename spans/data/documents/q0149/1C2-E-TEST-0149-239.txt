What I want them for is for table bases/columns that will be painted with faux finish acrylic, or laminated with veneer, or formica, or flexible mirrors.
I have in the past covered the column with flexible mirror sheets and black lacquered the tops and the round bases. Very elegant looking, quick and easy to make and high profit. They usually go in a home bar.
I know the above mentioned stuff will glue to the MDF but doubtful of the cardboard. The sonotubes used for concrete pouring are made of a spiral wrap and this telegraphs through the veneer and I never tried painting them. Some of this stuff I make sells for a good buck so I dont want to gamble.
