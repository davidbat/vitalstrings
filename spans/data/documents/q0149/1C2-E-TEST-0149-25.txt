For the benefit of others, try shopping at a real lumberyard not the big chains. It's their business to know what they are talking about. If they don't stock it they can get it. Most will be good enough to tell you where you can go and get it yourself. The big chains have a lot to learn about customer service.
I asked at HD and Lowe's and they had no clue where to get bigger/better ones.  That is why I asked here.  Then figured I would start calling larger construction supply companies and ask.  I figured that I was too small to deal with but they might at least know where to go.  They were HAPPY to provide whatever I needed .. and at great prices.
So yes.. don't just stick with the retail chain stores.  If I could get cheap lumber from the construction supply places I would do that as well.
