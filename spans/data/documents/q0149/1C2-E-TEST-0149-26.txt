Concrete Footing – 12 Inch Sonotube
June 30, 2007 By admin Leave a Comment
As promised (oooh exciting), I am posting a photo of one of the concrete filled 12 inch sonotubes . Yesterday, the guys came over with that cool concrete trailer and filled the tubes up. We have 6 tubes with a 12 inch diameter. They are 42 inches deep.
The lumber delivery is scheduled for two Mondays from now. Why two Mondays? Well…you’ll see.
