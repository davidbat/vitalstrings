The following set of pictures is from a recent deck stabilization job we successfully finished.Â  Please note we drive down the piling to complete resistance.
Driving down a pin piling to stabilize the deck

Once pin pilings are driven all the way, we drill holes through the pin pile to install rebar
We hydraulic jack the deck (upper left) to slightly raise it
Using sonotubes, we form and pour around the piling which supports the deck from moving

Our Commitment
At Austech Pools we believe in giving the best service possible. That's why when you call our office during normal operating hours, you'll never get an answering service or answering machine. All of our incoming calls are handled in our office by a live, friendly, knowledgeable person who's willing to go the extra mile to answer all of your questions.
The Difference is Clearly Visible
We're also taking our leak detection services into the 21st Century. Austech has obtained a new, state of the art video scope giving us the ability to see what's happening in the pipes underground. When we come to you to pinpoint the leaks in your pool, spa or fountain we may be able to use this new technology to record our findings. The new video scope also gives us the ability to upload and email our findings to you. Although the video scope cannot be utilized in every situation, you can be rest assured that we've got what it takes to show you what isn't visible to the human eye.
