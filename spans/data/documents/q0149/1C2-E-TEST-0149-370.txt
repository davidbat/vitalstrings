Sonotubes are big tubes of waxed paper. They come in various sizes; I've
seen them to 24", and suspect there are larger. They are used for forms for
pouring concrete, usually on large construction jobs. They aren't very
pretty, but amateur astronomers often use them for telescope tubes. I'd
contact a company that does a lot of concrete construction to try and find a
local source.
Can't help you on the air freight question.
