Pier and Beam Sonotube Foundation in Central Austin
December 8, 2010
Curtis Concrete Pumping line pumped and placed approximately 15 yards of concrete in 18 holes with 24" sonotube piers for a pier and beam foundation in East-Central Austin.
This residential client in East-Central Austin followed engineering specifications by excavating 18 deep piers in preparation for a home addition's foundation. The area's clay-rich soil is known for its expansive properties so Curtis Concrete Pumping worked alongside the contractor to ensure the proper concrete mix was used.
Curtis Concrete Pumping carefully placed approximately 15 yards of low slump concrete to reach maximum concrete psi during curing. The inability for concrete trucks to reach the Sonotubes made line pumping a safe, clean and quick solution for this residential, pier and beam foundation project.
With little clean-up, this pier and beam slab was poured and placed within 2 hours. To contact Curtis Concrete Pumping about line pumping your next residential or commercial slab or foundation, Click Here .
