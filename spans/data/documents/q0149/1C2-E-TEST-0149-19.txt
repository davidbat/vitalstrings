Re: pier foundations / sonotubes

I have used sonar tube foundations on a small house and cabin with no trouble at all, and the building inspectors were happy. An important point is the bearing area at the bottom of the tube must have enough total area to support the weight of the building for you soil type, this usually means a lot of tubes or more commonly some type of pad at the bottom of the tube, my last cabin was 16x32ft build on hard clay it had 8 tubes with bases of 6.25 sq ft each. The addition was 14x24ft and used 6 tubes/footings of the same size, we built in an area of heavy frost with 48” deep footings and backfilled with the original clay all is fine after 15 years.  My next project is a 24x24 single story using 8 tubes with 24"Bigfoot bases this are a lot easier to work with than pouring the footing then the tube, the bearing area is only 3 sq ft per base but as we are building on hard packed gravel it should be fine providing we have no surprises digging the holes, the area is known for growing rocks.
   The base and tubes should contain at least 2 L shaped lengths of rebar and a rule of thumb we use is that the cement tube shouldn't extend out of the ground more than 2 times the diameter of the tube without extra re enforcing or bracing.
 The only problems I have seen on these types of foundations have been in clay in northern B.C. where the tubing had no base on it or no rebar, the frost grabbed the tube and lifted it partly out of the ground complete with the carport, it is hard to imagine but under certain conditions of heavy frost the cement column can come under enough tension to snap the concrete and lift the top of it and the building hence the need for the rebar and base. Some people also leave the sonar tube on after the cement is cured with the idea that the frost will grip the tube and not the cement.
