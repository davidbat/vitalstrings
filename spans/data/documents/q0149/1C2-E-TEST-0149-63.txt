A good way to strengthen the thinner tubes you find at Home Depot and the like is glue two of them together -- just cut a thin strip out of a slightly larger tube and glue it to the inside of the second tube.
I wasn't impressed with the Home Depot tubes and located a local commercial building supply company that had much better heavy-duty cardboard tubes. One thing about commercial suppliers, though is they don't necessarily provide tubes in convenient carrying sizes. I drive a pickup truck, so it wasn't much trouble to take a 12 foot tube (or whatever size they were selling).
