So I'm building this big ol' pole building, and attempting to drill suitable holes for the 6x6x16 PT poles I'm using.
The old Danuser auger on my Ford tractor just doesn't go quite deep enough. I want the poles to be 4' in the ground. And when you pull the auger out, a bunch of spoil falls back into the hole that you have to remove by hand. The soil is damp and sticks to the post hole digger, making the process tedious. I have 2 poles in the ground and 8 to go.
So I get to thinking- I have a full size backhoe that is just sitting there and itching to dig some holes...why not dig a pit the the right depth with the backhoe, and place a 12" x 4' or 14" x 4' sonotube at exactly the right position, and backfill around it? Then I'll drive some lags into the pole, paint the section to be buried with tar, and place into the sonotube.
I'll fill the sonotube with concrete and crown the top for runoff. I'll grade to the top of the sonotubes, then put down gravel.
The only question I have about this is whether sonotubes are rated for spending their life underground. They are basically carboard, treated with wax or plastic or something. Will they eventually deteriorate, leaving a gap around the concrete post? Seems unlikely to me...
I guess the downside is the cost of the sonotubes. Concrete is cheap. Time is not, and this approach should be faster than augering and digging holes.
