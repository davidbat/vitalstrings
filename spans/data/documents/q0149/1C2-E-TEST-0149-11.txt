These                are the homemade drums that are causing such a stir in the drumming                for wellness scene this year.
Tube drums, made from heavy cardboard cylinders are                currently THE RAGE, thanks to facilitator and founder                of the Eldermusic group at Yahoo, Annie O'Shea.
The idea of using heavy cardboard concrete forms,                used for pouring concrete, for drums is not entirely new. Banek                and Scoville described such tube drums in their book Sound Designs                years ago, but they used goatskin and were a little different, hanging                in different lengths, different pitches from a rope or cable.
Annie has added several crucial modifications that                are great, such as a viable synthetic head material (pack cloth)                and the use of an embroidery hoop as a reinforcing ring. (!)She                also added the cutouts at the bottom that let the sound out, like                the REMO brand TUBANOS®.
The Eldermusic group has been alive with ideas for                these instruments, with participants coming up with new ideas and                adaptations, including Beverly Nadelman (she has posted a jillion                good ideas), Randy                Brody , and others. To really get the entire lowdown, and see                all the images, you should join                the eldermusic group at Yahoo and read the archives..
The eldermusic list was established to facilitate communication                between people currently working with elders in any setting and                using music. There is sharing about instrument making, sources of                instruments/supplies , facilitation ideas, and encouragement and                support of each other.
Annie has given us permission to post her very basic                instructions and a photo or two here, and Massage Therapist Lorraine                Achey has offered her more detailed instructions, complete with                list of tools, materials, and procedures from beginning to end..                If you want the detailed version it is pasted in below Annie's..Thanks                to both ladies for their generosity in making this stuff available                to Rhythmweb readers..
Annie: "Here are the absolute BASICS…"
Cut an 8, 10 or 12 inch diameter tube in whatever length
you want. (They usually come in 4 ft lengths). Cut scallops or                  rectangles in the bottom to let the sound out. (Lorraine Achey                  has wisely suggested that you postpone this step until after the                  head is stretched, to avoid damage to the bottom during the stretching                  process.)
Cut                  2 wooden embroidery hoops to size and glue onto the inside of                  the head, one inside the other placing the areas of the cuts across                  from each other. I also glue a short piece of hoop over the area                  of the inside hoop where it was cut to fit together. One may be                  enough depending on how tight you want to pull the heading fabric.                  I use Titebond II Wood Glue. Be sure to clamp for a couple of                  hours. I also add Gorilla Glue in any places where there is a                  gap between the glue and the tube wall.
ALTERNATIVE: You can also buy plastic embroidery                  hoops and use these instead of the wooden ones. I only use one                  of these instead of two They cut very easily with a hacksaw and                  DON'T NEED ANY GLUE!! You have to be a little more careful when                  you pull the heading material taut.....if you don't pull evenly                  they can end up egg shaped. (they still work, though!)
Using a white craft glue like ModPodge or Elmer’s or Aleene's                  original tacky glue, apply a cotton or cotton blend fabric.....or                  any other fabric that will glue...to the drum...or you could paint                  them also. My drums are all somewhere between 18- 27 inches high                  so I buy 3/4 yard of a fabric that is 44-45 inches wide. Leave                  at least an inch down on the top without fabric....the heading                  material glues better to the cardboard tube surface than fabric.                  Leave at least an inch down on the top without fabric....the heading                  material glues better to the cardboard tube surface than fabric.                  Trim the top edges and turn under the bottom edges , gluing securly                  to the underside..
Cut out an appropriate size circle or square of "pack                  cloth" material. This is a coated nylon available at many                  fabric stores and on the web.
Soak the pack cloth in water for at least one hour. This is                  important. It takes awhile for the water to soak in.
With another person helping, staple the pack cloth onto the                  top, pulling as tightly as possible. Staple all the way around,(I                  use 1/4 inch staples,some use 3/8 inch) alternating sides to get                  a good tight pull. Trim away the excess pack cloth. Wrap black                  electricians tape around the staple area to flatten and cover. Note: There is an alternative to stapling.                  See the update below.
Apply either ribbon or a strip of the same material (or whatever                  you like!) around the drum to cover up the staples and electrician’s                  tape.
I buy plastic tubing at the local True Value hardware store,                  cut it in the same length as the "feet", split it open                  lengthwise and slip onto the leg to protect the fabric from fraying                  out and tearing. I have also used sticky backed felt to finish                  off the legs. I had one person discover she could get a cool sound                  by banging the entire drum against the floor.....and so I came                  up with some protection for that particular creative act!
For mallets we use 12 inches of 1/2 inch dowel with a 1 inch wooden                dowel ball that has a 1/2 inch hole already drilled into it. We                just glue these on and sometimes cover in matching material. I have                covered most of my mallets with colorful fleece to dampen the sound                depending on where I will be and what group I will be working with.
These drums elicit wild ideas and creativity and are very fun to                make especially with a group. Enjoy and please let me know how it's                going and what new ideas you came up with!

Annie's update, January                '05: Annie has been working with goatskin,                too. Click on the thumbnail of the goatskin Tube drums below to                see a gorgeous close up. good work..
An                alternative to stapling is as follows: Apply Elmer’s Glue on the top edge and about 1-2 inches around the outside of                the rim. Let it get a bit tacky (about 10-15 minutes). Lay the pack                cloth over the top. Put a hose clamp around the top edge (you have                to “daisy” several hose clamps together). Begin to tighten                the hose clamp while pulling down on the cloth. Keep moving around                the rim while you do this until the hose clamp is tight and the                cloth is pulled down as tight as you can get it. It helps to have                two people do this. Allow it to dry overnight …..The next                day remove the hose clamp. Trim the cloth and proceed to next step.
These same directions apply to a goatskin head (of course you need                to soak it first in water like the pack cloth but longer…until                it becomes pliable). Caution: do not apply the goatskin in REALLY                hot dry weather….because when it gets cooler or damper, they                can go too slack. Best temp is between 68-75 degrees. If you use                outdoors in humid weather, or light rain they will go slack and                be unplayable. They will recover when the heads dry.
[note from stu: this is actually more a matter                of humidity than heat. Heat dries out the skin in some situations,                hence it is associated with tuning up.
Remember, if you have an event and need to                tune up: you can bring a little space heater to help you if there                is electricity. Put the drums in front of the heater and turn it                on, checking every few minutes until the pitch is right.

While I did not come up with the original process                for making these wonderful little drums, I did write down these                guidelines for my friend Heather. I hope that you find them of use                and build many beautiful and wondrous drums. Please visit my website http://acheybodybiz.com for pictures (coming soon!).
Above all, enjoy!
