Concrete slab/pad cost for cottage in Nova Scotia?
looking at building a cottage in the spring. Trying to weigh the costs of building on sonotubes versus concrete slab/pad. I believe the slab will need a 4 ft frost wall and probably 4 inches thick. The size is 24X26. Does anyone know any idea whatsoever of what this might cost?? I could call and get an estimate but for now I dont want to go that far. Thanks.
