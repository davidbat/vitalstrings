Re: Bathroom addition on sonotubes?
Using piers can be successfully used provided it's done properly.
Making sure to be well below the frost line ...... footings that are larger than the pier would be poured at the same time as the pier. This makes them a monolithic component instead of having a "cold " poured connection between the footing and pier. That's why the BigFoot system works well.
Having the footing that's larger than the pier becomes locked in under ground. If the frost tries to heave the pier upward the ground is providing resistance to the footing locked in place.
Aside from that ... I personally wouldn't put a bathroom over unconditioned space below. My thinking is when it comes to water .... either supplies or drains .... should be in the warm side.
Just 2 cents worth.
