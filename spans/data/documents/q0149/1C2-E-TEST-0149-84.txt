POST SETTING PROCEDURE:
The hole is augered to the appropriate diameter.
The post is placed to the bottom of the hole and then is plumbed and squared.
The hole is then filled with cement within a few inches from the top.
Some of the dirt is used to fill the top of the hole over the cement. The remainder of the dirt can be carefully removed by the customer after the post has set for a minimum of 24 hours.
Allow a minimum of two days or more (depending on weather conditions) for post to set before any construction begins.
Post heights will vary from one to another and will need to be trimmed to exact height after the fence is constructed.
CALL BEFORE YOU DIG!
Call for your area's cable & hydro locates.
Utility locates are a free service and must
be done by the customer prior to digging!
