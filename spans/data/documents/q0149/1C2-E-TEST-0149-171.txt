As mentioned,the bearing capacities would be only as good as the concrete design and soil bearing capacities.
You may have a concrete design mix of 2500 psi, 3000 psi, or 4000psi.
You may have soil bearing capacities of similar capacities based on the material;

(Pounds Per Square Foot)
Rock w/ Gravel 6,000 psf +
Gravel 5000 psf
