Deck footing sonotubes
I am designing a 34' x 12' deck (about 400 sq/ft subtracting chimney space). One half is attached to the house by a ledger, the other half is cantilevered on a beam 10' out. It's supported by 6x6 posts 6'6" apart with a 9" cantilever on the ends. That makes 5 sections. I have been reading up on footing sizes and calculated as follows:
400/2 = 200 sq/ft
200 x 40 psf load = 8000 lbs
8000 lbs / 5 sections = 1600 lbs per section.
Various internet charts recommend 16" round footings for this load. The depth is going to be 36". I don't know what kind of soil I have, I'd guess somewhere between loam and clay.
Deck height is less than 3'.
Question:
Using 16" Sonotubes is going to be a whole cubic yard of concrete for 6 footings. Does sound right?
40 psf seems very high. If I understand this right, that's the  equivalent of over fourty 300lb persons standing on my 400 sq/ft deck!?  The deck itself can't weight more than 3-4000 lbs.
Please forgive my MS paint sketch :
