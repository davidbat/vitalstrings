Found Lowe's in Ft.Worth selling "sonotubes" (price is good)
The Lowes at I-20 & Bryant Irving in Ft. Worth sells "sonotube" lookalikes made by that concrete company you see everywhere, like quickcrete or something.  Anyways that had two sizes that were 8"x48" and 12"x48" each was about 1/4" thick walls. Not sure what a real sonotube measures in the walls as I've never seen one.  The great thing was the price, and even though I've never priced real sonotubes these puppies were about $5 for the 8" and $8 for 12".  Seemed pretty good to me. the 12" would make a great HSU lookalike sub and the 8" would make good tower or bookshelf in a D shape.  They are in the Masonry/Brick area by the lumber.
Good Hunting! And sorry if this is old news, I've just never heard someone mention a home depot or lowes for sonotubes.
