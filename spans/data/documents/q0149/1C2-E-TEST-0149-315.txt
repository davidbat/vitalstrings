Hi, I have an 11' x 13' room that I have converted to just a 2 channel listening room with some pretty nice equipment, i.e. Marantz, Musical Fidelity, Tannoy Saturn S10 towers. I have treated the side walls with 2' x 4' 1" thick 703 Owens in wood frames covered with burlap. The wall/ceiling are treated all the way around with 2" thick 703 Owens with 14" wide panels and are angled between the wall/ceiling area. The front wall has a 2' x 4', 2" thick panel on each side.
Now I am ready to start treating the corners. I read on a DIY site to use Sonno Tube (concrete forms) and fill them with sand for bass tubes. Then, I read a reply from Ethan Winer that this would have no positive effect at all.
I bought 2 of the Sonno Tubes anyway....12" in diameter. I heavily duct taped each end and inside of them I put a 2" thickness of 703 Owens in a + (plus sign) configuration and capped each end with a round cut of 2" 703 Owens, then duct taped it air tight.
I have only made one of these so far and don't really know how to tell if it is effective or not. I do not have an SPL meter, nor the software to measure the room. Furthermore, when I look at the examples of the EQ readouts on some sites, it's like a monkey doing a math problem. I don't understand it, therefore have not downloaded the software and bought a meter.
Has anyone tried this method with the Sonno Tubes and have you found them worthy? In theory, they are similar to the bass trap drawings Ethan Winer shows on his website, but may not be doing a thing for me. If not, I haven't wasted much $$.
Thanks in advance for any input.
