To answer this question adequately/academically, it is necessary to
know the bearing capacity of the soil and the weight of the building.
However, as a ballpark, for a shed that size with wood framing and
siding, I'd probably pour 24" diameter piers. You'll get a total of
about 12 square feet of bearing, and assuming your building weighs
about 4 tons (it probably weighs less), that's 1 ton per pier, which
only requires about 700 PSF of bearing capacity from the soil (it
probably has a lot more). A single 24" x 12' tube will cost you less
than $100 and can be cut into 4 3' pieces, enough for the job. The
holes do not have to be wider at the bottom, although I guess they
could. Dig the holes down to undisturbed soil and remove any crumble
that falls in. Install the piers and stake them up plumb. Get some
rebar in there. Fill them with concrete without knocking them over.
Use a wood float to level the concrete at the top of the tube. Mix it
yourself since you need maybe 1.5 yards. Install your beam buckets or
post bases in the wet mud and you're done, aside from stripping the
tubes, which is a pain in the a.s.
That said, my advice is worth what it cost you. You could also get an
engineer to spec it for you, but you are probably not required to do
that by the building department (non-habitable building less than 400
SF) and and most guys and gals wouldn't.
