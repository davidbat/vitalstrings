Cutting Rebar and sonotubes
 Karen got 14- 20ft sections of #6 rebar delivered to the house. We rented a gas powered concrete saw to cut all 120 sections of rebar. We determined the length of the rebar from the elevation data we got at each of the holes. And yes, we were getting some strange looks from our neighbors.
 We used our trailer to organize the rebar in sections. Each pier will used 4 pieces of rebar. Each rebar section was labeled according that particular pier label (A1, E3, etc.  See previous posts). 
Here, Karen is preparing to cut each of the 12" diameter sonotubes to the appropriate length.  To mark the sonotube at the appropriate place to cut, she used a long piece of paper with one of the long sides having a factory edge (like wrapping paper),  She would just warp the paper around the tube and line up the ends of the paper along the factory edge. Then, she would mark the edge w/ a sharpie. 
 She used a circular saw to cut along the line she made around the tube. After the section was cut, we determined which end was most flush, and marked that end to be used as the top of the pier.
 We used #3 rebar loops to hold the rebar in place and used rebar tie wire to wrap each piece securely to the loop.  This made a fairly solid assembly. 
In one day, we were able to get all the sonotubes cut, and about half of the rebar assemblies made. Notice that the piers and the rebar assemblies are at different lengths. That is to accommodate for the different heights of the piers based on the differing ground elevations at each of the pier locations.
