About
About the Accu-Chute
The Accu-Chute is a patented wheelbarrow attachment designed to make everyday construction and home yard work easier. The unique design of Accu-Chute allows one person to to the work of two effectively and efficiently. The uses are endless; pouring concrete, mulch, loam, stone, gravel, water, grain, feed, anything that needs an accurate pour from a wheel barrow.
When pouring concrete into Sonotubes -  a normally messy and unwieldy job with an ordinary wheel barrow and shovel – the Accu-Chute makes it a seamless one man job with no spillage and cuts the average work time in half! The pouring of concrete in an everyday task in most construction and building jobs, with the Accu-Chute the mess and cumbersome activity is now an easy one person job.
With its proprietary features – the Accu-Chute made of high density polyethylene attaches to the top and front of the 
wheelbarrow with four heavy duty steel latch type clips. Attaching the Accu-Chute is simple – anyone can do it. It attaches in seconds, no tools are required and the total weight is less than three pounds.
