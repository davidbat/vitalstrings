Construction of the Portico
First, we needed to drop sonotubes (cardboard tubes into which one pours concrete) to act as piers to support the portico deck and without running water this made making cement quite a chore. Once the tubes were in and poured things went quickly. We needed to get the portico in place before we could finish the siding and skirt boards along the bottom of the house.
The portico serves to shelter the entrance, break the facade of the house, and transition the occupant or visitor up to ground level in the house. Above is the deck in place in front of the house. One can see the sonotubes (yellow posts) under the portico with the cement column protruding from the top and supporting the deck. The deck is 5/4" mahogany which is both very presentable and a good treated surface for a deck.
Yup, it was a touch cold that day. Art blows on his hands and he moves into position to frame the portico. The pillars are actual pillars, not poly-molded decorations. It is a Douglas Fir 6x6 column with simple capital and base. They will be sanded, caulked, primed and painted to that they have a pleasant and smooth appearance.
Art applying some final details. We actually have removed the clapboards from the gable section in the portico, as when we looked at them, they seemed too much for our taste. They will be plain vertical boards.
Update, Dec 17, 08: Here are the more recent images, taken this morning. Still not finished, but now the house has a "face", wouldn't you agree?!
