Building foundation options Nova Scotia Canada?
Im just in the planning stages of a year round cottage/small starter home in Nova Scotia.
I want to start figuring out my material list but dont know what to start the building on. I built the home we live in now but its on sonotubes and in the ground approx 4 ft to allow frost problems.
The thing is I am looking at land that i'm concerned will be too rocky to do the sonotubes this time. Is a concrete slab a good alternative? If so how thick? I do not want a basement and i'm really trying to keep costs down. Any other advice?
