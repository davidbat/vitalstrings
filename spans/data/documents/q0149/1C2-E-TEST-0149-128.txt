Materials Used to Build Your Own Cat Tree
There are a wide variety of materials to choose from when planning a do it yourself cat tree . Some items are more common than others, and there is really no right or wrong way to build this piece of cat furniture.
Concrete Forms
These round forms are often called Sonotubes or Quik-tubes, and are used to make concrete piers and cylinders. They are used for curved perches. They are made from an extremely heavy cardboard and treated to be water resistant. You should be able to find them at your local home improvement store.
Lumber
You will need various types and sizes of lumber for your project. If you use ready made plans, they will include a materials list with specific sizes of lumber. It is best not to use treated lumber since it contains chemicals that may be harmful to your cat. Since the lumber will usually be covered up, you really don't need to buy the top quality. You may even be able to get some of what you need for free if you ask around at building sites.
