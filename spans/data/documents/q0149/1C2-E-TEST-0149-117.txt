After giving the sonotube a nice epoxy soak (paint it with epoxy diluted with acetone), why not take a hole saw to it and cut a few hundred 2" or 3" holes in it?  I'd bet you could knock 25% off the weight without reducing strength significantly, maybe more.  The only trick is in getting a layout that makes the pattern look intentional rather than random....  Of course, you'd want to make a cloth shroud to deal with the light leaks, but black ripstop nylon is a whole lot lighter (in weight) than the same square footage of Sonotube.
