I have found a contractor who treats sonotube ductwork with a multi-layer latex based coating that completely lines the ducts.  I have not had it done at my house yet but my girlfriend recently bought at townhome in NE Abq that had some significant areas of damage and she had hers lined and split the cost with the seller.  The company is called Air Duct Medic.  She had most of hers lined and the total cost was about $4000.
I would not necessarily run away from a house with sonotubes but If I was buying a house I would probably insist that the seller have the ducts lined.  The issue is that they WILL NOT LAST- I don't care what the HVAC guy told you.  They are just thin cardboard tubes lined with foil.  You can't clean them effectively because the foil will get stripped off by the normal duct cleaning brushes etc.
I am currently saving up to get mine done- it will be expensive but at least I know I will not have to cut up my slab to replace the ducts.  The lining should be a very long lasting solution.
Here is their website and some pictures of before and after sonotubes.
