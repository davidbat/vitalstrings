Mix It Quik™ -- Instructions For Use 
We at Mix It Quik™ encourage the use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
STEP 1: Lay the cloth mixing trough flat out on the ground. Fill the MixItQuik™ bucket with water.
STEP 2: Pour dry mix (concrete, cement, mortar, soil mixes) in the center of the cloth mixing trough.
STEP 3: Create the shape of a donut to hold water. Left side photo, with aggregate; right side photo, without aggregate.
STEP 4: Pour water into the center of the donut shape. Use the 5 gallon bucket as a water source when hose is not available.
STEP 5: By letting the ground take the weight of the material, mixing begins by slightly raising one corner at a time, in a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation, for about a minute or until dry mix is blended to your liking.
STEP 6: Pour wet mix directly from the Mix It Quik™ into project area (box forms, sonotubes, walkways, planting areas, etc). Spread wet cement into place.
STEP 7: When finished with project, simply rinse off Mix It Quik’s industrial strength cloth mixing trough, fold it, and store it in your bucket until your next project.
