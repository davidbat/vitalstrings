6" above grade is about where the concrete should stop.  You want the wood posts elevated to keep them dry, and secured to a base that is anchored to the concrete.  I'm not a huge fan of embedding the post in concrete.  It takes care of lateral movement, but accelerates decay.  It also means you can't reuse the sonotube in 20 years if you want to build a new deck on the old foundation.
19" is nothing for 4x4 posts.  If your deck is on the second floor, 4x4s become toothpicks.  So many builders use 4x4s when they should have used 6x6s.  You see this on new homes all the time.  That, and they anchor to brick.  Brick is a veneer - not structure.  It's not to be used to support a deck, or even a handrail.  Sure, in most cases it can, but it shouldn't.  If you can't bear on the foundation wall or directly against the stud wall, it's better to have a freestanding deck.
Sorry if I wasn't clear.  I dug 8-9 inch holes about 4 ft deep.  And used 8 in sonotubes and my dad filled the tubes and around it with cement.  Then he attached this bracket thing and let it dry.  Then he used I believe 2 - 2x10's connecting 2 brackets things at a time. so I had 3 long support beams right above the cement.  These were about 6 inches above grade.
Then he built another layer using 2x6's that framed the actual deck.  I think each board was about 12 inchese apart goin perpendicular from the base 2x10's.
Then the final layer was the top layer which was also laid perpendicular from the second layer.
