Part 2 of our foundation is the Sonotube piers that sit atop the foundation footings (the Sonotubes are the cardboard tubing used as formwork to pour the concrete). These cylindrical columns are what the structure will physically sit atop, and thus they must be perfectly level across the entire grid. In order to properly connect the column to the rectangular foundation footer beneath it, we used a Hilti drill and anchoring system to drop rebar into the footer, which connect to a rebar cage within the columns (similar in shape to a tomato plant cage).
Because the concrete truck also has only 16 feet worth of chute, we built a chute extension so that we could reach the farthest row of piers. When the concrete truck arrived, it was fast and furious to get the concrete into the tubes and leveled off perfectly. We still have one more round of pouring to do for the remaining Sonotubes, but once poured and after 72 hours of set time, we will be ready to start raising and setting trusses atop them using the galvanized braces and hefty bolts we have specified. It should start looking like a structure very soon!
