We are proud to announce that we are a distributor of Finnleo Saunas manufactured by Saunatec (Cokato, Minnesota). We have three different

all look stunning and we are amazed at the build quality. For more information please visit our Saunas by Saunatec page.
 
 
 
We are proud to be carrying a Canadian produced real natural thin stone by Masonal. Approximately (1" - 1.5") thick, we stock a couple hundred
square feet in our warehouse. This stone is available in flat pieces (10 square feet) packaged per box and in corner pieces (8 lineal feet)
packaged per box. A skid of thin stone will cover approximately 200 square feet. 
 
Masonal thin stone weighs less than 15lbs per stone, therefore it can be installed faster than full thickness veneer stone and no brick ledge or
tie system is required. When comparing cultured or artificial stone products, we believe Masonal is by far the better option. Their stone
is available in a large variety of shapes and colours. Please also note that many of our thin stone is also available in full bed stone. 
 
We are also able to do material estimates for small and large quantity jobs at no additional cost. Please stop by to see our stone samples
displayed on our showroom walls.
