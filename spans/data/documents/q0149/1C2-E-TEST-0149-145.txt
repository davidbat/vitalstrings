Thats all there is to it.
There will be no posts, as the way I see it, posts just provide two additional joints that will weaken the lateral support of the structure. I'm going to bring the piers up high enough so that the beams can be attached to brackets on top of the piers. That is why I was looking to use plastic tubes that would encase the concrete all the way to the top.
Will definitely use rebar as another poster suggested. The piers will also rest on footings at the bottom of the hole which will also have rebar.
Still, I might just go with the sonotubes - it would probably be strong enough, and the plastic pipes are just too expensive.
