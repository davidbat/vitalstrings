Good place to buy sonotubes?
>I bought my 10" ID tube at a place called Border Products -- theirs are not
Thanks for the pointer Howard.  When I get around to redoing the OTA on my 12.5
inch with the Novak cell I will be making a trip to Border Products I
suspect...
Of course you're in Tucson and I'm in San Diego but a bit of web work turned up
their website at www.bordercorp.com .
It turns out they have a location that is only a few miles from my
house/work...  Besides Arizona, they seem to have a place in Las Vegas for
anyone interested.
