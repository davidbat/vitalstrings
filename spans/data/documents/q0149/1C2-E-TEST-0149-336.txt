The construction         of an earth-sheltered abode
suitable for this brave new world.
 
The design and construction of a new home is       a traumatic experience for most folks and the process quite daunting to       say the least, these pages will present an ongoing photographic essay of       that process.
The project illustrated on these pages start from the wooded land and will continue to the finished house.
New photos will be added as construction progresses.
