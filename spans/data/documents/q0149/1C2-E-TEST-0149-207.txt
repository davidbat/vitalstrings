Excavation Services & Heavy Equipment Rates
Excavation - We dig almost  every time we landscape or   build, but some projects are all about diggin' in the dirt and making it look good afterward.  We specialize in driveways / road building, utility line installs and drainage systems.  As in the other services we offer, we are a licensed, bonded and insured excavation company.  Our rates are generally more affordable than companies devoted exclusively to large-scale excavation projects.  Small projects for the home owner or small business receive the same attention and care as our large contracts.   Our excavation projects have included:
Concrete Foundations, Sonotubes, Footers, Wind Tower Foundations
Driveways, parking pads & private roads
Water line installation and insulation
Telephone, data and underground wiring / conduit installation (all electrical connections should be made by a licensed electrician)
Drainage ditches, berms and culverts
Terraces, retaining walls, tree planting
Land Clearing, brush removal, firebreak planning
