That's on the inside.  If you get them soggy on the outside they just fall apart.  So be careful to store them out of the rain.
I agree that running the sonotubes 18" into the ground would be unnecessary.  On the commercial concrete jobs I've done we build a square form out of 2x4s to set in a shallow hole above the round hole dug for the post, and screw the sonotube to the square form.  Then you run 2x braces to four sides of the upper part of the sonotube.  But for only 8" above grade you wouldn't need that.  The sonotube you put below ground is material paid for that you didn't need and also is cardboard degrading in your compacted fill- probably not an issue but always a good thing to avoid.
