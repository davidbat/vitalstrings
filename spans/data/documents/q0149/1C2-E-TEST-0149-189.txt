Anybody know where to get sonotube near Detroit/Ann Arbor?
I never thought I'd ask this forum, but since no one on HTF can help me, this is my last resort before I start calling construction companies.
But yeah, I'm looking for a piece of sonotube, 20" or bigger in diameter, and at least 36" in height.  It's a thick, stiff tube of cardboard used by construction/concrete companies.  I need it to build my sub.
Thanks all, if you can actually help me out, I wouldn't mind giving you $5 or so in compensation.  (it's not a lot, but it's the notion)
