class D is theï»¿ ONLY way to go with bike systems. i miss the original sonic impact i blew, but i have a 25wpc sure waiting for a build.
nice distinctive setup and REALLY clean sounding.
i really gotta get my ~500w trailer system put together this summer now that i don't live on a 2nd floor.
what did you use for cabinets? carboard cement molds?
