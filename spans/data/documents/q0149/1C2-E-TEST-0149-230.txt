AFTER 
9 sonotubes and 500sqft of cedar.... 
 
 After, the deck was   layered and complex with room for grills and tables, generous benches,   chairs and quiet corners for conversation. There were 35 people at the   first party and plenty of room for more.
 
Sugar River House Renovation [2001]
A classic New Englander on an open site, this house underwent a complete renovation. The entire interior was gutted, partition walls removed, a cold sunroom was transformed into conditioned living space and the exterior back porch became a mudroom. Insulation was added throughout and windows were upgraded. Once a collection of very small rooms the first floor level became open concept living featuring a generous kitchen area and bright sunny living room.
