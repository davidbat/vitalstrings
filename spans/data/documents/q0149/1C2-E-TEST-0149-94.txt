Cottage Lift and Roll - Tedford House Movers
Cottage Lift & Roll Project
The owner of this cottage/house wanted to put  a new foundation under the building.  It was previously sitting on sonotubes, and the new foundation was to be constructed behind the current building location.  We were hired in to lift the cottage off of the old sonotubes, role the building back the width of itself to the new foundation location, and then lift and support the building 12 feet in the air so that the new foundation could be built.  Once completed, we set the building down onto it’s new resting place.
Here is the house just after we have lifted it clear of the old sonotubes. 
The building has been lifted to the correct height so that we can put in roller beams that will allow us to roll the building backwards.
As you can see, the footings have already been poured to support the new foundation.  We will roll the house back over top of these footings.
The building is slowly being rolled backwards towards the site of the new foundation
We’ve lifted the house approximately 12 feet into the air, and the new foundation has been constructed to support the building.  What a great way to turn your cottage into a permanent retirement home and increase your property value at the same time!
The house is sitting firmly on the new foundation, and the clean-up can now begin.
