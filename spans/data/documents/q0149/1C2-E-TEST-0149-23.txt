Hi.
I'm building a low free-standing deck
I am going to pour 6 pier footers for a deck I'm building. I'm required to go 36" below grade. I will be using those sonotube forms, 12" diameter ones. I was going to cut each tube to 36 inches (they come in 48 inch lengths at my local Lowes).
Someone told me that I could dig the holes to the required depth of 36 inches  but just cut each tube to 24 inches. I'd save money this way by only needing 3 of these tubes instead of six and there'd be no waste cutoffs. They are about $12.50 dollars each for each 12 inch diameter by 48 inch long sonotube. So I'd be saving myself around 39.75 dollars or so with tax.
Can I do this?
The tops of each of these footers will just be slightly above grade.
Also, how long do I wait for these piers to harden before I can drill into the tops of them to attach my adjustable metal pier-to- post base connectors-like those made by Simpson  ABA66 or USP.
I'm following the same method used by Rick Arnold's column in Finehomebuilding mag issue "Decks and Outdoor Projects" Summer 2010 to make these piers.
Also, I'm using 6 x 6 posts with a doubled 2 x 12 beam resting on top. What is the best way to make that connection between these sizes of lumber? A 6 x 6 post is actually 5 1/2" square and a doubled 2 x 12 finishes at 3 inches. Do I use a Simpson post to beam cap that can handle a 5 1/2" square post but then do I put a spacer between the doubled up beam to get to the 5 1/2" dimension? Or do I notch the post and rest the 3" thick beam in that? I believe the IRC code (which my township follows) does not allow the beams to be fastened to the sides of the posts with just carriage bolts drilled throught the post and beam.
Also, should I just remove the post shown in my attached file and lay the beams onto the tops of the concrete pier since the 6 x 6 post is so short?
Thanks to all in advance.
