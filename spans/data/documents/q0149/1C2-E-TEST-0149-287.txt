A friend of mine built her house largely on concrete filled sonotubes.  The house had a small concrete block rectangle in one corner through which the water line and waste line ran.  The rectangle was about four feet square, which proved to be about one half the size that it needed to be as during one very cold winter, the water line froze while she was in Florida, and I had to go down into the "hole" to thaw it out with a torch.
Her floors were framed with 2X12's so the actual insulation in the floors was 11 1/2 inches thick. The house was built with orientation for terrific solar gain on a hillside, and the entire house envelope worked very well.
Next year my wife and I will be building a new home and I have given a lot of consideration to building the same kind of structure, but since we will have a lot of granite exposure on the actual building site, I expect that we will pour an insulated slab on grade and build on that.
The only real difficulty with building on piers is that the floor insulation is extremely important, as well as the method of sealing the floor and insulation from critters who might try to find a nice comfy nest.  Once the cost of the digging and placing the piers, posts, or sonotubes, adding the insulation and material used to sheath the underside of the structure is totalled, it will probably be easier, faster and perhaps no more expensive than to just pour an insulated slab on grade.
