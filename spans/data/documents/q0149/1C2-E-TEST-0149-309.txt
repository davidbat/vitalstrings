Yes saddles are required, they keep the posts in position and are required by most codes. A piece of string and tape measure is all you need to install them in a straight line.
If your contractor builds decks with no saddles, and can't even install them straight, FIRE HIM NOW, you'll be better off.

James is right Trent! Saddles are necessary to keep that deck in place. Sounds like they have already poured the concrete and are trying to cut corners. If he quoted you on the saddles to be installed he needs to install them.
Also sounds like you don't have a permit on that job which is bad news as well. James is right saying fire him off the job. Your wasting time and money with that contractor.

"If your contractor builds decks with no saddles, and can't even install them straight, FIRE HIM NOW, you'll be better off. " Lol, I couldn't agree more. That is the most basic part of the deck building process. Any good builder knows that layout is key to a successfull, and visually appealing job.
If the footings are already poured, you can still buy bolt down saddles which have a hole in the center so a 1/2" concrete lag can be drilled in place.
Again, I agree with James, I would not go forward with using this builder.
