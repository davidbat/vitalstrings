Fence Posts - Sonotubes?
Hi All,
I am preparing to install a wood fence in Ontario, Canada. I'm using 6x6 PT posts. My main goal is doing this right - we're dropping a good chunk of change on this project and I want something that will last a good long time.
Current plan is:
2. Add 4-5 inches of gravel, and tamp down.
3. Add sonotube and place post in hole. Leave 2 inches of sonotube above ground.
4. Fill sonotube with concrete, and bevel the top so water drains away from the post.
Is this the right way to go about it? I've heard conflicting bits on whether to use sonotubes or not. I think, given how cold it gets during the winter that the nice smooth surface the sonotube gives will provide less area for frost to "bite" into and heave.
Also - do I leave the sonotube in place once the concrete is in, or pull it out after some amount of time?
Thanks in advance!
