Sonotube without "base/footings" if not deep enough will be moved out of the soil from freeze and thaw. (i.e. most people do the sonotubes for fences and dig only 24", 2 years after the fence is out of alignment).

Ah! (Chance were highly unlikely you were anywhere near as far North as I - let alone farther. High five!)
