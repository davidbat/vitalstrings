In less than four months, the project team for the $21 million                     Bethpage Power Plant in Hicksville, N.Y. for Calpine Corp.,                     constructed a 48-megawatt power plant in an effort to prevent                     power outages on Long Island during summer months.
The task before the project team included procurement, installation,                     construction, testing, commissioning and turning over the                     facility to the owner within 100 days. The guiding principle                     established at the onset of the project and maintained throughout                     its duration was "teamwork."
Within the 100-day schedule, the project team constructed                     a gas-fired, simple-cycle peaking plant complete with a General                     Electric LM 6000 turbine generator set, sophisticated pollution                     control equipment, a 100-ft.-tall stack and a combustion air                     chiller system wit associated piping, pumps and glycol-cooling                     equipment.
Included in the project is the installation of 8,500 lin.                     ft. of surface and underground process piping, 40,000 ft.                     of conduit, 2,100 ft. of cable tray with 200,000 ft. power                     and control cable and placement of 900 cu. yds. of structural                     concrete for six major and several secondary equipment foundations.
In addition to the fast-track schedule, the project team also                     had to deal with an extremely small site with limited access,                     coordination of the delivery of equipment purchased by the                     owner and installed by the general contractor and the sensitive                     conditions caused by working in and near an existing live                     power plant.
The tight schedule led the project team to develop creative                     time-saving construction methods. One example of this was                     proactive planning by the general contractor, which shaved                     extensive time off the schedule. In addition, to save time                     and money, a 200-ft.-long pipe rack was built to house the                     utilities instead of placing the utilities underground. Had                     this not been done, costly and time-consuming excavation would                     have had to be done to place the utilities underground.
In addition, sonotubes were used. Sonotubes for this project                     consisted of 12-in.-dia., 1-ft.-long heavy cardboard tubes                     inserted into holes in the ground, then filled with concrete.
The decision to use sonotubes in lieu of anchor bolts for                     the pipe rack structure's footings also saved time and money                     since the anchor bolts would have had to be drilled into a                     concrete slab, which the team would not have been able to                     pour until later in the job.
To fast-track the electrical components, such as the installation                     of the cable tray, the pulling of the cable and making terminals                     for all electrical connections, an electrical subcontractor,                     Welsbach Electric Corp., had its crews put in the extra hours                     necessary.
Because of tight site constraints, there was no room for staging                     and equipment storage. The solution was leasing property adjacent                     to the site for this purpose.
This project is a classic example of true teamwork. Because                     of the tight schedule, the assignment would not have been                     complete on time unless all team members approached the job                     with the same goal.
The jury cited "excellent execution of the project by                     the contractor" and noted that the project started and                     completed in four months as reasons for recognizing this project.
