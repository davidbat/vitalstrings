Confluences, inclinations, circumstances, chance ... that's how decisions are made in the human realm. At least, my human realm.
In the winter of 2011 I decided to build an observatory at my home in west Sonoma County. Why? Wasn't my telescope dolly enough to make observing with my Meade 12" convenient and rewarding? Yes, it was.
But the driveway is a rather large expanse of asphalt in two directions, and in the summer this would heat to cooking temperatures. Worse, the entire south and west compass directions lay under the span of my residence, which exhaled heat in the early evening from shingles and attic. And the rooflines block the entire southern sky below declination –20˚ or so. (The horizon is at around –50˚.) I could do better!
In addition, I ordered a 10", f/20 Dall-Kirkham from Robert Royce , due for delivery in early summer. This would put two telescopes in the garage, which was already cluttered. And require building a second dolly ... An impediment curve was rising before me.
Then there was my dear wife, who had decided to get a hot tub installed in our back yard to soothe her sometimes mordant arthritis. It seemed like a great opportunity to fold two projects into one, and construct the observatory at the same time.
There was a bit of peer pressure, too. A generous and very knowledgeable acquaintance, Phil Sullivan, mentioned that I should have an observatory. Later, when he came over to my house to stargaze and share eyepieces one night, he groused about a neighbor's porch light shining through the trees above our site. "You should have an observatory."
And finally ... I did some browsing of amateur observatories online, at the "Amateur Astronomer's Dead Link Site", nine planets , where over half the links return a 404 ... and I was surprised at how crude and makeshift many of them were. Really? Rot lumber on cinderblocks? An outhouse shed on a lading cart ? A doghouse observatory ? And I don't have an observatory?
So I spent a couple of months researching different observatory designs, visiting local observatories and talking with their owners about their experiences with the buildings, and gradually developing my own concept for a building in our back meadow.

My contractor Bob Corcoran came over today to begin work on the site. Our agreement is that I will contribute labor, he will provide expertise, and we'll get the job done.
We first carefully checked the location I had chosen against a map of the leach field below the garden, and discovered that the leach lines extend under the previously selected site between two lovely, medium sized coastal black oak trees. So we relocated to west of the western tree (in the background of the photo, left) instead.
We fastened two 8 foot poles to the corner stakes, to show the finished height of the roof, and got approval from my wife to proceed.
A few days earlier, a tree care contractor was out to trim back the oak tree and other trees around the property. I'll have to continue trimming the oak to keep it at an acceptable height. Although its canopy blocks part of the eastern horizon up to about 30°, that is a good thing  it partly shields the site from the light dome cast by Petaluma, a rural city to the southeast. In tribute to its influence, I'm calling the building Black Oak Observatory. (Thanks to Phil Sullivan for the correct identification.)
We staked out the approximate location of the caisson and pier holes, and talked about the project logistics going forward.
Later, I took a photograph of the site from our south facing deck and used Photoshop to rough out a concept panorama of the finished building ... the stake locations gave the scale and perspective.
I've designed the structure to conform to the slope and be compact, functional, comfortable, thermally stable and robustly weatherproof against our fierce winter winds. Only 10' by 12', it requires no building permit ... but will be able to house two separately mounted Schmidt Cassegrain, Dall Kirkham or Ritchey Chrétien telescopes up to 16" aperture, or classic Newtonians up to 12" at f/8, in any combination.
There will be a bench swing from the roof track supports, trellised vines and bushy flowers, a small patio of packed sand, and maybe a staging area downhill for a big Dobsonian. We'll see.
