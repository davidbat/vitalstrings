Not my choice. Too many gaps for an acceptable response from the Neo 3 and the impact is discussed in the NFLAWP. Also can the Neo 3 be crossed in the sub 2000 Hz area? You would need that as the SS would roll off well before 2000 Hz. Better would be the 6-7" long Fountek or Aurum Cantus ribbons used 8 or 9 per side. Far superior to the Neo 3 or Neo 8.

I like the Seas Excels (low distortion per Linkwitz's tests) vs. the SS but that is a preference thing.

You should spec the DEQX PDC 2.6 Preamp version at $3750 handles the 3-way crossover, EQ (4000 points plus paramerics), preamp, remote volume control, and room corrections functionality. Add a 6 channel multichannel power amp for grins.

You likely can do better than a Sonotube type cabinets. Have you seen any of Rick Craig's Selah Audio curved back LA cabinets?

As iterated they would be great whatever the name.
