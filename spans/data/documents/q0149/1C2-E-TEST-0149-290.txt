Quickrete Products offer different types of concrete repair and resurfacing for the Do-it-yourselfer.  From fast setting concrete, such as Hydraulic Water Stop to concrete redi-mix bags, Quikrete has the products necessary to meet your needs.  Sonotubes are available to help you install basketball backboards properly.
National Block also handles masonry repair products from Quikrete such as redi-mix mortar to help you replace that loose brick on your house or tuck point mortar on a chimney.
We also handle masonry cement in Type N, S and M for the more sophisticated user.  St. Mary's, Lafarge and Holcim Cements are kept in inventory at all times.  Type N is typically used when laying brick on homes as a veneer.  Type S is usually used when concrete block is being laid.  Type M is used very often when masonry units are laid below grade.
