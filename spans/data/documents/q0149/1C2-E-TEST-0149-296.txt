 
Features:
The Electric Concrete Vibrator is a Mikasa unit. The flexible shaft length is 10.5' and the head diameter is 1.5".        The electric motor plugs into a standard 20 amp 120 volt outlet. Flexible shaft vibrators are designed to be used in enclosed        cavities where cement is being poured such as walls or sonotubes. The vibration of the head will cause the mix to settle in        and air pockets will rise to the top and escape rather than getting trapped in the mix and leaving a weak void spot in your        concrete foundation. Occasionally they have been used for flatwork but the slab needs to be of reasonable thickness to        accommodate the head. Also, any contact of the head to flatwork forms may cause them to settle. Dipping the head into the mix        only takes a few seconds. If the concrete is over vibrated, the aggregate will settle to the bottom and the cream will rise to        the top, further reducing its strength. Flexible shaft vibrators can be transported in almost any vehicle.
