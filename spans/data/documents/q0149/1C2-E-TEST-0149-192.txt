I'm thinking of changing my strategy a little bit.  I'm having a bear of a time getting the 24+ inch diameter hole to fit in those redi-bases (which are not required by code, but not a bad idea).  Rocks are just ridiculous- I've gotten down to the 42+" mark, but not wide enough to fit a redi-base in each hole.  I really don't want to invest hundreds into excavating for this small project.
So instead of a 8" sonotube (4 ft.) connected to a redi-base, I'm thinking of scrapping the redi-base and going with a 10" or 12" sonotube with no base.
Problem is, I'm trying to research strength of 8" w/redi-base vs 10" or 12" and can't find any solid comparative info.  Can anyone here comment or know how they compare?
This is a little pressure treated deck with no roof, etc.  it'll end up being 10'x20' with one 10' side attached to the house, two 8" tubes with redibases at 8' from house, and 2 more that I'm installing now about 18' from house (that I'm having problems getting the diameter for the holes).
EDIT: I've already got the concrete and am into this project, but I ran across these... and they look pretty impressive: Â» redifooting.com/ Had I known about them before starting, i might have gone this route... but I'm too far in at this point and don't have the time to chase them down.
