Sonotube footer for on-grade slab??
We're constructing a 9x9' concrete slab for a hot tub and are thinking about using 4 Sonotubes for footers rather than just pouring a floating 6" slab (4000psi fibercrete) over 4" of gravel.
Were going to put 4 sonotubes in 24" deep and have them up to the top of the gravel level when we pour the concrete and all done in one pour.  (Backfill around the sonotube hole would be gravel prior to pouring and the tubes would stay in place).  So we'd end up with 30" thick concrete piers that, are incorporated in the slab and would hopefully prevent the slab from any movement.
Is this overkill or are we creating problems with the tubes??  Right now the tubes will probably not be in the corners of the slab, but midway in each side so as not to interfere with stakes for our forms.  (We are located in VA).
Thanks for your suggestions!!
