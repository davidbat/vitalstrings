Hi,
I’m a Florida State Licensed Building Contractor and this is how I would estimate how much I would pay a subcontractor. The price would be dependent on the job, the terrain, digging conditions etc. This would be based on the Walkers building estimators guide to construction. Light Comercial pricing residential would be a little less.
Labor: 12 tubes, 24 hours, 2 men at $40.00/ hour = $1,920.00
Labor would include, supervision, layout, excavation, cutting and installing rebar, placement of tube and rebar, clean up.
Materials:
Concrete: 12 X .83 X 3 = 29.88/ 27 = 1.2 yards of concrete
3 yard minimum price on concrete, Concrete about $300
Rebar: 8 rods, 8 X $4 = $32.00
Sonotubes: 12 X $9 = $108.00
Misc: $100.00
Total Labor and Materials: $2,460.00
Overhead and Profit: $246.00
Total: $2,760.00
That figure could go either way depending on conditions, acess, equipment rental, if the contractor really needs work etc.
My additional advice, pay no more than 20% in advance, 40% at a half way point, the remaining 50% upon completion.
