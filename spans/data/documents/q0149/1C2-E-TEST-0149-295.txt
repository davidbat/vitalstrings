A water level is the easiest tool to use for this. You can buy water levels or even make your own with a length of clear plastic tubing and water. Pour water into the tubing and you've got a level. Hold one end of the tube so that the water level matches the level of the concrete in one Sonotube, and the water level at the other end of the tubing will be at exactly the same height.
