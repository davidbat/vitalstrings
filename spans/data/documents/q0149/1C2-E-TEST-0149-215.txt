Connect the top plate with the bottom of your floor joists and dig down 6" to a foot around the base for the bottom plate, then back fill against it a little ways up. I highly suggest you vapor barrier the ground surface under the house to cut down on the moisture that collects in the crawl space.
Another thing to be concerned with with sonotube supports is the eventual possibility of leaning in the future. Did you use some sort of base on the tubes or are they just stuck in and poured? If there is a footer under them like a Bigfoot you are usually O.K. How deep are the tubes vs. how much sticks up?
By attaching the skirting wall to the sonotubes with drill-in concrete anchors you can accomplish both a sheer wall to fight possible lean in the future and seal in the foundation.
Hope this helps.
What you've put here was kind of my plan.
Then I talked to a guy that told me that "framing up" was a waste of material (& $$$$) and to make panels of 2x2's and AW plywood with blueboard. So, that led to my question here.
Here's the deal with my tubes. They are on roughly 17' OC along the 20' width. So, there are inside the perimeter of the cabin by 1'6".
Yes, the tubes have footers under them and they are 10 - 12' deep (which is about where the "real" gravel layer begins on my lot).
My plan was to wait for summer.
Seems some days like it'll be here sooner than what the calendar tells me.
