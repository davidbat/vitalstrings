Techno Metal Post helical             piles can be used in a variety of             applications from construction of new             home additions, retaining walls,             sunrooms, and decks to repair of house             foundations, floor remodeling, and             temporary structure support.
Decks
Eliminate frost heaving and               weight bearing concerns.  Design your deck for a future               hot tub or sunroom without               concern.  Our posts can               hold the weight.  Installation is fast and damage               free.
 
Concrete Patio/Slabs
Instead of excavating for Sonotubes® use Techno Metal Posts in               your concrete projects.  In               many cases we can eliminate the               need for frost walls which               require extensive excavation and               concrete work.
 
Sunrooms
Techno Metal Posts are ideal for               sunrooms.  The expensive               glass panels are susceptible to               any movement of the structure.  We guarantee no movement due to               frost and we ensure the post is               drilled down to native soil.
 
Home Additions
Home additions are another               application ideally suited for               Techno Metal Posts.  We               have the post size that can               carry the weight of a 1, 2, or 3               storey home addition without               need for a concrete foundation.
 
Retaining Walls
Techno Metal Posts can be               installed horizontally as well               as vertically.  Use them to               support and tieback your               retaining wall.
 
Nature Trail
Techno Metal Posts are               environmentally friendly.  Use them conservation protected               lands and in other sensitive               areas.  
 
 
Landscape Features
Landscapers can use our system               to support various landscape               features (stone columns,               concrete slabs, etc...) instead               of using concrete foundations.
Foundation Underpinning
Using Techno Metal Post Helical               Piles to stabilize your               foundation from movement can               save you thousands of dollars in               repair costs.
Soil Decontamination
Pier underpinning to allow               decontaminated soil to be               removed.  We can               temporarily support your               structure to allow for repairs.
