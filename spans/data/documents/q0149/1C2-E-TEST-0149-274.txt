The mission of Rock Solid is to provide the best steel foundations at an affordable
price providing industry-setting customer service.  
Rock Solid Pile Company was born out of a recognized need in Alaska for superior
foundations to the ever-failing traditional concrete sonotubes.
Rock Solid Pile Company is owned by Alaska Treeline, a Top 15 Deck Builder in the
nation recognized by the Trex Company, and has been in operation since 1999.  Rock
Solid is a Certified Green Professional, and is committed to sustainability and best
building practices.
Here's the low down on everything you might want to know about Rock Solid's pile drivers...
Q: What type of machine drives the piles?
A: Rock Solid uses customized excavators fitted with a
hydraulic hammer to drive piles.
Q: How much overhead clearance is required?
A: At least 12 ft is required for the excavator arm.
Q: How wide does a gate need to be for access?
A: Even gates as narrow as 4 ft are wide enough.
Q: What is the load capacity of a pile?
A: Depending on the pile size, Rock Solid's piles have a rated
capacity of 4,000 - 25,000 pounds.
Q: How does the pile driver not damage grass?
A: Not only do Rock Solid excavators have rubber tracks, but
we can lay plywood directly onto sensitive landscaping.
Q: What size pile does an average deck require?
A: 2 inch piles are generally satisfactory for a residential
deck.
Q: And, what about a dock? What size pile should I use?
A: A 3 inch pile is the most frequently used dock pile.
Q: When is the best time of year to drive piles?
A: Rock Solid's piles can be driven year-round, even in
Alaska's extreme winter months! In fact, we often recommend
installing dock piles in the winter right through the ice - this
allows the piles to go out from the shore farther and protects
the water from debris.
Q: How deep doe the piles go?
A: Rock Solid's piles are driven until resistance or complete
refusal, generally 10 ft - 30 ft deep, well below the frost line.
Q: Are piles guaranteed to never frost heave?
A: Although no foundation is guaranteed not to frost heave,
steel piles are your best defense in most soil types.
