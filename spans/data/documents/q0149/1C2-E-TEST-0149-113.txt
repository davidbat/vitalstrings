I hope you have hired an engineer for this project. If not get one.

Why not use the tubes and then at gade or slightly below form the
triangle you spoke of this way you get the best of both. Im not sure of
the whole soil griping the piers thing Ive never heard of such concern.
If this is your personal concern do the the triangled concrete or just
put a layer of crushed rock around the posts.

The concrete is not going to be the exspansion problem the ground is.

Why would you want water to permiate the ground under the house if it
is not alreay doing so? The runnoff going straight under the house is
an ideal situation. If the footings for the piers are at proper depth
for the soil conditions the water is going to flow right past them.
A final note: If you have a engineer on the project this is not out of
his scope of work ti adress these issues. In fact the should be address
on the detail page of the plans.
