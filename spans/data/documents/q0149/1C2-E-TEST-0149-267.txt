The moment of truth...
For some reason, the actual moment of pouring the cement                                           was one of the more nerve racking from my perspective.  The forms were filled with rebar.  As per the concrete company's                                           recommendation, all was at least three inches of the edge of the sonotube. The concrete was mixed with fiberglass and                                           mixed for setting at cold temperatures.  The actual pouring happens rather quickly and care needs to be taken that the                                           sonotube is not disturbed and that the concrete is well dispersed.  We were able to pour it all at once, as,                                           despite my concern, the concrete in the sonotube was not heavy enough to push out the cement in the base of the foundation.

An Unusual Project...
There's Paul (right) and Dave Murphy, of Murphy's Construction                                           (in Lewiston, Maine).  Paul specializes in renovations and unusual projects.  He has assured me that this more than                                           qualifies as an unusual project (I can't image why...).  He's been in touch with Brad and Wayne from                                           SkyShed ( www.skyshed.com ), and we've decided to put our custom SkyShed on a deck (though they generally build a very solid structure at ground level,                                           floor and all).  Hopefully next week there will be photos of the electrical and computer lines, and a deck.  Once this is done Brad will be coming down from Canada (yes, in the dead of winter) to build the SkyShed. Next the Pier                                           Tech adjustible mounts ( www.pier-tech.com )  will be placed. Once placed the Meade GPS LX-200 (with piggy back Tel-Vue NP 101) will be added.  Then we                                           wait for the Ritchey-Chreiten 16" Truss Telescope being built by RC Optical Systems ( www.rcopticalsystems.com ), and its Paramount ME mount ( www.bisque.com ), both of which are expected in April.  To this scope a piggyback Takahashi 106 will be mounted.  There should                                           be plenty to do while we wait.  Lastly John Smith ( www.hiddenloft.com ) will be coming out to fine tune  the setup and correct all our mistakes !!

Never Trust a Compass !!
John Smith warned me about using a compass (he's known                                           of a few disasters trying to set north with a compass).  The transit method is combersome and it is very tempting to                                           use a compass (manual or electronic).  This diagram shows how inaccurate this can be.  This compass it the standard                                           Meade LX200 compass which has been adjusted for magnetic north (and confirmed with a LX-200 which is exactly polar alligned).  As can be seen the N/S line given by this compass is about 8 degrees off when compared to the transit N/S line.  By moving                                           the rebar below it this can vary from 5 to 15 degrees (even with the leveling bubble in the compass exactly centered).  Never trust a compass !!
