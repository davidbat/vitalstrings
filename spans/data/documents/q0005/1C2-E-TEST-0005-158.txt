MERRY GO ROUND            by Keith Sweat
I think it was Sue82 that liked Keith Sweat. Wow! This song really gets to me! It takes me back when everything was before me ya know? Like when all the world is kinda out there and it's whatever you want to make it, but you are still (lots of choices) scared of the unknown? Young Adult Kid stage? It's like a Merry-go- round! The first time your in a big city(if your new to it) Anyone understand where I'm at? Keith Sweat is just one of a kind!! :)
