3 TIPS ON PICKING THE CHEAPEST KEITH SWEAT TICKETS AND BEST SEATS
TICKET TIP #1
When buying floor seats remember that people are going to stand up. If you are 6'10 or taller you should have no problem, but if your are vertically challenged try getting seats that are in the first few rows or near an inside aisle.
TICKET TIP #2
Before you purchase a pair of ticket there are a few things that you should do. First check the section next to the one that you are interested in, then you should check the opposite side ( mirror image section). A lot of times there will be a price difference in similar sections that you can take advantage of to get the Cheapest Tickets.
TICKET TIP #3
Prices go up and down on a daily... almost hourly basis. What we recommend is for you to find the date your want, once on that page use the "add to favorites" button on the top right to save that page, Once you have bookmarked that page you can easily go back to that exact page. The prices are organized by cheapest first so it should be easy to see if prices have gotten any cheaper.

After the checkout is done you will have a chance to get ticket insurance (thru a 3rd Party). On some occasions the tickets you order are not available to ship at the time of purchase. A few examples of why this would happen would be if you were to purchase KEITH SWEAT tickets 8 months ahead of time, at this time the tickets are not printed yet so we wait for them to arrive and we send them the day that we receive them. Another example would be if you were to purchase front row tickets to KEITH SWEAT, Most front row tickets are provided buy the fan club and they wait until at least one month before to send them.
