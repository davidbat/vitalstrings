Her name is Lisa Wu-Hartwell. She is the ex-wife of singer Keith Sweat and the current wife ofÂ NFL player Ed Hartwell.Lisa currently stars in the reality television show “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” on Bravo,but don’t you call her a “desperate housewife.” The budding actress owns her own real estate firm, Hartwell & Associates, a jewelry line called Wu Girls, a childrenâ€™s clothing line, Hart 2 Hart Baby;she is also a model and a mother to 13-year-old Jordan, 10-year-old Justin and 1-year-old EJ.It is Jordan and Justin,however, who won’t be starring in theÂ Bravo series because their dad,Keith Sweat,won’t allow it.

The drama on Bravo’s new The Real Housewives of Atlanta series began long before the cameras ever started rolling.Lisa Wu Hartwell, one of the five women showcased in Bravo’s latest Real Housewives incarnation, tells me she was hoping to have all three of her children on the show, but her ex-husband, late-’80s R&B hitmaker Keith Sweat, has gotten in the way.Hartwell and Sweat have two sons together, 13-year-old Jordan and 11-year-old Justin. “He didn’t sign a waiver,” Hartwell complains. “He’s like, ‘Lisa, it’s nothing personal. I just really don’t know how they’re going to edit and if they’re going to make you look crazy. I just don’t want the kids to be, you know, overexposed or anything.’ “
Hartwell doesn’t buy it. “They asked their dad if could they be involved, and he [said] no,” she says. “It could have been a Disney show and I don’t think he would have signed it.”
An email sent to Sweat through his official website has not been returned.For now, Hartwell appears on the show as if she only has one child, one-year-old E.J., her son with her current husband, NFL player Ed Hartwell.
