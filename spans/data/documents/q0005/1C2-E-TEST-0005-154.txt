Movie synopsis
Soul singer Keith Sweat was one of the pivotal figures of the 1990s New Jack Swing movement, which blended R&B vocal stylings with rhythmic hip-hop beats for a fresh new genre that continues to influence the modern pop landscape. SWEAT HOTEL finds the crooner reuniting with his New Jack Swing cohorts Teddy Riley, Charlie Wilson, Jackie McGhee, and Silk for a series of live performances recorded in Atlanta and Dallas in 2006. The concerts also feature special guest stars Lil' G, Kut Klose, Johnny Kemp, Monika, Akon, Da Brat, and Athena Cage, as well as stellar renditions of classic Sweat songs like "I Want Her," "I'll Give All My Love to You," and "Twisted."
