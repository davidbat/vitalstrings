***, KEITH SWEAT "Keith Sweat," Elektra
July 28, 1996 | Connie Johnson
A stalwart member of the New Jack Swing generation, Sweat has delivered a steady stream of hits ever since "I Want Her," a 1987 hip-hop nugget so inviting and rich with promise that it established him as a kingpin of that genre. What sounded new in 1987 may not be groundbreaking today, but Harlem-born Sweat can still crank out a Jeep jam or temperature-teasing boudoir ballad with the best of them.

Stardom comes easily for some singers, if not always for the same reasons. So while Ashanti is no threat creatively to such distinctive soul artists as Alicia Keys and India.Arie, she still carries herself on stage like she belongs there. And she does. Ashanti's first solo set in Los Angeles was the high point in Friday's Hot 92 Winter Wonderjam at the Shrine Auditorium, which also included sets by Keith Sweat, Midnight Star and Rose Royce.

KEITH SWEAT "Keep It Comin' "  Elektra * * * In 1988, singer Keith Sweat fired up the music scene with his new jack swing, a three-way truce between R&B's snapping funk, disco's hammering overdrive and hip-hop's cut, scratch and mix. Giddy like Motown love, street-wise like B-boy rap, "Make It Last Forever" occupied the No. 1 spot on both the black single and album charts--the first time that had happened in more than 10 years.

Keith Sweat's first two albums have sold a total of 5 million copies and he's co-headlining a national tour with Bell Biv DeVoe that includes a three night stand, beginning Friday, at the Forum in Inglewood.

He feels he's still largely unknown outside the black community.

Keith Sweat: From Stock Market to Pop Market
March 20, 1988 | CONNIE JOHNSON
Keith Sweat has a major crossover hit on his hands with "I Want Her," a funky, drum-dominated dance jam. He's so tickled about it that at a recent interview he refused to answer any questions until he'd had a chance to sit down in an office at Elektra Records with the latest issue of Billboard. "Aah, great," he fairly chortled, savoring his No. 1 position on the trade magazine's black singles chart. "I can see dollar signs. . . ."

Just call this mood music for the love gangstas and roughnecks, two core groups that Sweat affectionately gives a shout-out to on his latest album. Having cranked out several sex-obsessed singles since the mid-'80s, the New Yorker still keeps his narrow focus on the body's reproductive regions. That isn't necessarily bad news to those who've followed his career since "I Want Her," his sweat-drenched ode to lust at first sight.

Today, Silk is secular with a vengeance, ready to do battle with Boyz II Men by blending its voices to pop-funk perfection on the Sweat-produced "Happy Days" and luscious title track. Silk and Sweat, ahhh . . . now there's a hot concept.

Nobody begs like Keith Sweat. Luther Vandross comes close, but even he is a mere pretender to the throne. No, when it comes to romantic, soul-drenched pleading, Sweat has it down to a science, and he proved it Saturday night at Jamizon, the R&B-urban answer to Lollapalooza '97.
