I listened to Keith Sweats new CD and was very disappointed to say the least. I use to really love Keith back in the day.  But let’s face it, back in the day Keith was in his 20′s, so his music back then was appropriate for his age.  He’s almost 50 years old now still singing those same old teenage songs.  I mean come on, “Hood Sex”!!  That sounds like something his son should be singing, not someone his age.  He’s been through a marriage and has two kids, can’t he think of something more mature to sing about?  His voice still sounds nice and he looks good.  Looks a lot more mature than his music sounds.  It’ time to grow up Keith and sing some grown man songs!!
