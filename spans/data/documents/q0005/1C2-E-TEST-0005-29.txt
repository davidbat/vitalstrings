lisa your ex wife is funny she has you looking a mess while you continue not to comment on the abuse and why she`s on a show pretending to have only one son. even if you did not sign the release she could stil; had mentioned she has two son`s who live with there father, and left it at that. She didn`t forget to mention the abuse. She losing such a fraud.
