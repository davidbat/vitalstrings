GOT YOU HOCKED
ALL OF KEITH SWEAT'S MUSIC IS GOOD, BUT THIS ALBUM STICKS OUT ABOVE THE REST.  POP THIS CD IN, LIGHT THE CANDLES & GET UNDRESSED.(YOU KNOW THE REST)

Best of the best
This album is a romantic masterpiece. Keith couldn't anything better to this album, but add more romantic jamz.  This album is extremely popular in my cd collection; as is all of Keith Sweat albums.
