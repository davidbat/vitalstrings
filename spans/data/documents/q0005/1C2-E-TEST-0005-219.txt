Lyrics to Twisted by Keith Sweat featuring Kut Klose
Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Yeah, Kut Klose, help me out
[1]-You know you are my lover
You got me twisted over you
I know i got what you need
So what you wanna do
Baby, baby I know
Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me what can I do
[2]-But I gotta be strong
Did me wrong
When I thought we were really down
So you say you want me
Make up your mind
Cuz I'm not gonna be here for long
[Repeat 1]
Baby I know you'll find
That what you needed was here
Think about it my dear
[Repeat 2]
