Just Me Review
The Quiet Storm genre of R&B has been roundly, although often fondly, mocked, to the point of it seeming as outdated as hair metal or inspiring musical montage sequences, but Keith Sweat hasn't given up on it. Just Me has some in common with the glittery pick-up lines of Bobby Valentino and J. Holiday , but it's much more similar to the Isley Brothers / R. Kelly collaboration Body Kiss . The production isn't exactly minimalist, with electronic swoops and soft beeps punctuated by gentle bass thumps and runs down the scale, but it doesn't ever move into the crazy lushness of modern baby-making music, nor is it so classy as to promote dozing off, a la Joe . In other words, it's full of falsetto and lines about "sexin' you" delivered with a wink that could indicate a lack of seriousness but is more likely a come-on.
Sweat’s dulcet tones haven't suffered a bit, and, in fact, he comes off beautifully in contrast with Keyshia Cole , who sounds like she could use a hit of Chloraseptic on the duet "Love You Better." The opener, "Somebody," is a proud statement of return, but its follower, "The Floor," has better energy and makes great use of a little chopped and screwed vocal sample in service of the same end ("when you think of Sweat, you think of sex"). "Sexiest Girl" is packed with warm keys that bring the best elements of 1980s romance to mind; "Butterscotch," which features Athena Cage , is a fairly successful duet, and although its lyrics sometimes give a little much information, they never cross into R. Kelly territory; and "Just Wanna Sex You" is endearingly committed to its concept, listing all the ways and times in which Sweat wants to do exactly that. Just Me shouldn’t be mistaken for anything new, but it's got a glossy, vintage appeal.
