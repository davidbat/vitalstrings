The Sweat Hotel radio personality and R&B veteran Keith Sweat has partnered with erotic novelist Zane for a love and relationship book. Sweat will provided advice in a love handbook entitled 'Make It Last Forever: The Do’s and the Don'ts.'
Sweat spoke with Sister2Sister about some of the advice in the book in regards to woman being vocal in the bedroom. "Now, most women feel that telling a man how she wants to be made love to--she feels that might hurt a man’s ego. But a real man is acceptable to a woman telling him what she loves and what she doesn’t like in the bedroom," said Keith Sweat.
The  Make It Last Forever: The Do’s and the Don’ts  is expected to hit book shelves in early 2012.
In addition to the book, Sweat is releasing his eleventh solo album 'Til the Morning or High As the Sun' in November. The set, led by the first single Make You Say Ooh , was previously titled 'Open Invitation' but was recently changed.
