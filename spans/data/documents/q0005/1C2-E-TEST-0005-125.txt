Keith Sweat
R&B and Soul music dates back to the 1940s and 1950s and both have their origins in gospel and blues. Generally, New York City , Chicago , and other urban areas are known to be the birthplaces of soul. R&B, on the other hand, was originally created for the lack of a better description for the genre. Soul music is known for its intense vocals as well as its spiritual and religious roots, while contemporary R&B typically has a more poppy sound with smooth vocals.
Legendary soul artists include Ray Charles, James Brown, and later Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight . Today's R&B scene is shaped by musicians such as Jill Scott , Chris Brown , and Mary J. Blige . Hear the best of soul and R&B by getting Keith Sweat tickets from TicketNetwork today!
