*For all of those who miss that raspy voice and sexy, freaky lyrics, your man Keith Sweat heard ya.
According to Singersroom , the singer is getting ready to release his 11th studio album, “Open Invitation.” Sounds like a Tyrese album… hmm.
Anyway, the new project will be released on Nov. 1 this year via eOne Music, with “ Make You Say Ooh ” as the lead single.
Keith isn’t switching up his style too much. It’s all about love making and keeping the freak alive, with a few slow jams thrown in there for good measure of course.
His debut album, “Make It Last Forever” was one of his best selling albums reaching more than three million fans, and he keeps making hits.
“Open Invitation” might take you back to the old school days when Keith Sweat was in heavy rotation.
