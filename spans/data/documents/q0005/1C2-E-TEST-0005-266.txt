Keep it comin', girl I want you to
Turn me on with all the kissing and hugging
Do me baby, drive me crazy
I can never get enough of your lovin'
Feels so good when I'm with you
You know I gotta have your love
Every day and every night
You're the one I'm thinking of
(You've got all I love)
Everything that I like, oh yes you do
(Let's make love tonight)
All you gotta do is bring your body right here, babe
CHORUS
