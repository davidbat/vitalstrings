Without question one of the biggest superstars in the history of modern R&B and the new jack swing era, Keith Sweat dominated the airwaves from the late '80s through the mid-'90s. He racked up chart-topping hits starting with his classic debut album, Make It Last Forever. Til the Morning is his 11th studio album since 1987, and it’s a strong effort likely to satisfy his global legion of fans. A dozen love songs that bubble over with smooth production and melodramatic vocals, these are all effective bedroom anthems sure to set the mood. Fellow old-school favorites Johnny Gill and Gerald Levert drop by for "Knew It All Along," SWV's Coko adds her magic to "My Valentine," and the Auto-Tune comes out for the T-Pain collabo "To the Middle." Other standouts include "Open Invitation" and "High as the Sun."

This is true baby makin music... Thanks Keith for another hot album and taking your true fans back to those classic groves that kept us busy in the bedroom back in the day.  R&B is not going anywhere!  You, Kells, and Joe are keeping the romantics loving this genre of music.  Please tell me you'll hook up with Kelly on at least one single!
