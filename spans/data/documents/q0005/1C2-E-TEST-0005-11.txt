This is awesome. The best CD of all time. Heres the overview of each of the songs
1. Twisted- One of the best songs I've ever listened to 2. Funky Dope Lovin-Quality song with a good beat from R&B greats, including Gerald Levert, one of the best artists of this age 3. Yumi-As good as Twisted, maybe even better 4. Whatever You Want-Another quality song 5. Just A Touch-Another great song with good Keith Sweat beats 6. Freak With Me-Another quality song 7. Natures Rising-One of Sweats best interludes 8. Come With Me-Ronald Isley makes this song also one of my favorites 9. In The Mood-Another quality song 10. Show Me The Way-Another great interlude 11. Nobody-the best R&B song in 1996 and 1997 (probably heard it one the radio at least once. Has been on the radio a lot) 12. Chocolate Girl-great way to end the CD
So all the songs on this CD are quality. If you don't already have this CD I suggest that you better go out and buy it. Its worth it.
