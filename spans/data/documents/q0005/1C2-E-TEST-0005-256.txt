You've got to make your mind up
Yeah
You know you are my lover
You've got me twisted over you
I know I got what you need (right here, baby)
So what you wanna do?
Maybe, baby, I know
Maybe I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me, what can I do?
But I gotta be strong (but I gotta be strong)
You did me wrong
When I thought we were really down
So you say you want me,
Make up your mind
'Cause i'm not gunna be here for long
You know you are my lover
You've got me twisted over you
I know I got what you need (right here, baby)
So what you wanna do?
Maybe, baby, in time
Maybe, I'll know you'll find
That what you needed was here
Think about it, my dear
But I gotta be strong (but I gotta be strong)
You did me wrong
When I thought we were really down (I thought we were down)
So you say you want me,
Make up your mind
'Cause i'm not gunna be here for long
You know you are my lover
You've got me twisted over you
I know I got what you need (right here, baby)
So what you wanna do?
