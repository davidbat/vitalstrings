LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Keith Sweat is not dead. Keith Sweat false death reports are swirling on twitter Saturday. As of 3:30 PM PST, there are roughly ten tweets per minute claiming the popular singer has died. Sweat is the latest celebrity to be the victim of fake death reports, a trend that dominated online social networking in 2009 but settled down in 2010.
Today, it’s back again.
Twelve months ago, fake celebrity death reports became a regular, weekly occurrence. Virtually every Sunday evening at around 3 pm PST, fake celebrity death reports, masquerading as news reports, would spread via social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, almost via automation. In many cases, the reports were fueled per persons adding comments to message board or other community forums.
By fall 2009, the victims were predominately teen pop stars and male rappers. Miley Cyrus, Nick Jonas and Lil Wayne were the most frequent subject. By late 2009, Tom Cruise became one of the first film actors to be the subject of such reports. To date, the reports never truly spread into other entertainment fields like television and radio.
The most peculiar death report was the August 2010 tweet by LeBron James. He twittered at the time “R.I.P Gus Johnson”. James’ reference was to the basketball player, not the broadcaster. People read James’ tweet and though he was breaking news that Gus Johnson of CBS Sports had passed. The fake celebrity death reports most frequently include  fake plane, train, or auto crash story attached.
Keith Sweat is alive. In 2010, he released his latest album Ridin’ Solo.
