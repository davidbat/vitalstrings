Keith Sweat Is The Topic of the Latest Death Rumor.
R&B/Soul singer Keith Sweat may be a lot of things, but dead is not one of them. While many death rumors come and go in the celebrity world, it can also give a celebrity a much needed publicity boost.
Sweat has been an American artist since 1987 when his debut album, Make It Last Forever, was released. Since then he’s had ten hit albums including his latest, Ridin’ Solo, released this June of 2010.
Since 2007, Sweat has been the host of a nationally syndicated radio program based upon the Quiet storm format. The Keith Sweat Hotel (known as The Quiet Storm with Keith Sweat on WBLS in New York City) is syndicated through Premiere Radio Networks.
Perhaps we will finally see a Keith Sweat album go to #1? Keep your eye out for Ridin’ Solo to climb the charts as this rumor flies around the internet. What do you think?
