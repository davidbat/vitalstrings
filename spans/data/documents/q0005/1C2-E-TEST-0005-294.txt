Producer, writer and R&B icon Keith Sweat has always stayed on top of the charts with his sensual sound of soul music. 
Born and raised in Harlem, New York, music was imbedded in Sweat at a very young age. Before being discovered, Sweat perfected his gift by performing in New York’s nightclubs. In 1987, Sweat’s hard work finally paid off when he released his debut album Make It Last Forever. The album went on to sell four million copies and housed two hit singles “I Want Her” and the title track.
Sweat is also known for his hit albums which include, I’ll Give All My Love To You, Keep It Comin’, Get Up On It, Keith Sweat and most recently Ridin’ Solo. In addition to being a solo artist, Sweat is also credited with forming R&B super group LSG, which included Sweat, Gerald Levert and Johnny Gill. He is responsible for producing hits such as Dru Hill’s “Share My World,” The Isley Brothers’ “Slow Is The Way,” The O’Jays’ “Baby You Know,” featuring Sweat and many more. Currently, Sweat is touring music from his latest album and hosting The Sweat Hotel radio show, which broadcasts across the country.
