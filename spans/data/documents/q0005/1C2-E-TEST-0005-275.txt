Lisa Wu Hartwell is fighting for her sons. The recently-foreclosed star of Bravo’s Real Housewives of Atlanta has uncovered never-before-heard details of her acriminous divorce from ’80s R&B king Keith Sweat and her plans to return to court to obtain custody of the former couple’s two children, Jordan, 14, and Justin, 11 — who the real estate agent and fashion designer hopes to feature on her hit reality series.
Lisa married the “How Deep Is Your Love” crooner in 1991. During their 2003 split, both partners accused each other of infidelity, physical abuse, and theft. A judge utimately awarded Keith custody of Justin and Jordon. The singer has refused to sign a waiver allowing the boys to appear on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, says Lisa, 38, who appears on the RHOA with her second husband, former NFL star Ed Hartwell, and their 2-year-old son, EJ.
“I’ve already been seeing them four or five times a week, but now the time has come when I want to have them with me full-time,” Lisa explains. “I immediately filed for an appeal after the verdict, but I was never given a court date in five years. I’ve been afraid of the judicial system, but I’m finally taking the bull by the horns and trying to get my boys back again!”
Lisa and Keith are set to appear during a custody hearing in Fulton County (Georgia) Superior Court in October.
“If Keith has a hang-up about our sons being on TV, I would be fine with that. But Real Housewives is supposed to be a reality series, and the reality is that all the fans watching believe I only have one child,” she says. “Jordan and Justin understand what the show involves, and they’d love to do it. I adore all three of my sons — and I believe they all have a rightful place on the show.”
