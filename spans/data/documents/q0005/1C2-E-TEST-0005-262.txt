and let me do it to you
Don't be afraid
I promise to give it to you
Just the way you like
And who can love you like me ~~ Nobody
Who can sex you like me ~~ Nobody
Who can lay your body down ~~ Nobody
Nobody, baby ~~ Nobody
And who can treat you like me ~~ Nobody
Who can give you what you need ~~ Nobody
And who can do you all night long ~~ Nobody
Nobody, baby ~~ Nobody
And the band keeps playing on
[Both] 2x
On, on, on, and on, on...
Nobody, baby
On, on, on, and on, on...
Nobody baby
On, no, on, and on, on...
Nobody baby
I want you, right now for my lover, oh yes I do
Place no one above you, oh yes I do
If you need love, I'll be right, baby
I'll be right there, baby, oh yes I will
Oh yes I will baby
Oh yes I will baby
And who will love you like me ~~ Nobody
Who can sex your body like me baby ~~ Nobody
Who can do it like me, baby ~~ Nobody
No, no, no ~~ Nobody
Who can lay you down just like me ~~ Nobody
Who can kiss you all over your body, baby ~~ Nobody
I'm gonna caress your body
(ad lib till fade)
