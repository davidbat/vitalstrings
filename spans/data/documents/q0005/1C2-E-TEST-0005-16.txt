The Keith Sweat Hotel
Weekdays, 12m-5am
The Keith Sweat Hotel is a music-intensive program – R&B and slow jamz from the 70s, 80s, 90s, to today. Also featured on the show, special guests, live in-studio musical performances, and listener confessions, apologies and dedications.
Keith Sweat is a Harlem-born R&B singer/songwriter who released his debut album, Make It Last Forever, at the end of 1987. The album sold over three million copies, spawning the hits "I Want Her" (number one R&B, number five pop), "Something Just Ain't Right" (number three R&B), "Make It Last Forever" (number two R&B), and "Don't Stop Your Love" (number nine R&B). It was followed in June 1990 by I'll Give All My Love to You, another million-seller, that featured the hits "Make You Sweat" (number one R&B, number 14 pop), "Merry Go Round" (number two R&B), "I'll Give All My Love to You" (number one R&B, number seven pop), and "Your Love, Pt. 2" (number four R&B). Sweat's third album was Keep It Comin', an R&B chart-topper at the end of 1991, whose title track was another number one R&B hit. In 1994 he returned with Get Up on It; a self-titled release followed in 1996, and two years later he issued Still in the Game. Didn't See Me Coming (2000), Rebirth (2002), and the live Sweat Hotel (2007) followed. Two albums recorded with Gerald LeVert and Johnny Gill, billed as LSG (and released in 1997 and 2003), were also considerably successful. ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide
