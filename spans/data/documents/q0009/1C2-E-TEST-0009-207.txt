Bill and Taffy then told him about a song they'd been working on for about a month. The inspiration had come while they'd been driving to a family reunion of Taffy's relatives in Maryland. To pass the time en route, Bill had made up a ballad about the little winding roads they were taking. Later, he changed the story to fit that of an artist friend, who used to write to Bill about the splendors of the West Virginia countryside. The second verse of the tune was a bit risque -- making reference to naked ladies and such -- so Bill and Taffy figured their song would never ever get played on the radio.
They sang it for John, and, as he recalled, "I flipped." The three of them stayed up until 6 a.m., changing words and moving lines around. When they finished, John announced that the song had to go on his next album -- and it did.
"Take Me Home, Country Roads" appeared on the LP
Poems, Prayers and Promises,
and was released as a 45 in the spring of 1971. It broke nationally in mid-April, but moved up the charts, very slowly. After several weeks, RCA called John and told him that they were giving up on the single. "No!" he screamed. "Keep working on it!" They did, and on August 18 it was certified a million-seller.
"Take Me Home, Country Roads" spend nearly six months on the hit parade, establishing John Denver as a force to be reckoned with in the pop, country, and easy listening fields. Fat City later evolved into the Starland Vocal Band, winner of two 1976 Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist of the Year.
And Bill and Taffy? "Someday," they said, "we'll have to visit West Virginia."
