             When the sun shines from                                     cloudless blue skies,
             With reflections that gleam
              In the cool mountain                                     streams,
             We'll remember the light                                     in your eyes. 
 
             When the shadows of evening                                     are long,
              And the sun, setting high,
              Paints a fire in the                                     sky.
             We'll remember the sound of your                                     song.
 
              Even though you are gone
              To where spirits fly free,
             We still have the gifts that you gave.
             We will carry your hope,
             We will carry your love
              Here on earth for the rest of                                     our days.
 
             When the gold leaves are falling                                     again.
             When the soft autumn breeze
              Rustles high through the                                     trees
             We will here the wind whisper                                     your name.
 
The Dove of Peace flies from site to site, through as many countries as possible. It does not belong                                     to ANY belief system. Please help make it a line across the globe by taking it with you to your site, by giving it to someone                                     for their site, by passing it on to another continent, or to the conflict areas in the world....
When I found this dove on another site, it reminded me of a beautiful thing that happened at the dedication of the garden                                     at Snowmass chapel during my visit, so I have added a page to tell you about it. Click on the dove to get there.
This site is dedicated to the memory of John Denver. He was the greatest inspiration in my life. Those of us who discovered                                     the beauty of his music will never forget him.
I hope you enjoy the poetry that I have written for him.
 
Remember "You don't have to do it all....you do what you can do."

My name is Sylvia Ashton. I live in Herefordshire UK with my husband and 3 grown up children. I have                                     been a follower of John Denver since 1972 when I first saw him on the BBC 2 Shows. When he died, like thousands of others,                                     I was devastated. Then I started to write poems to express my feelings. I would like to share them with you..
 
Quotes from John's songs are in italics.
