Lost in a boat on the ocean
Lost in a ship out of sea
Lost in the dark of misfortune
Where is the light I can see?
Where is the highway to heaven?
Where is the love we all need?
Where is the peace that we long for?
Where is the man who is free?
Here in the heart there is freedom
Here in the heart there is peace
Here in the heart is the answer
To questions much deeper than these
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly
It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame
Some will take fame over fortune
Some take love over gold
Some will pray only for power
Some never want to grow old
Some see the day that is coming
Some only see what has passed

Someone will always be last
But here in the heart there is freedom
And here in the heart there is peace
Here in the heart is the answer
To questions much deeper than these
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly
It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you can hold on tightly, let go lightly
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame, yeah
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly
It's only surrender, it's all in the game
And you can hold on tightly, let go lightly
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame
You better hold on tightly, let go lightly
It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame, yeah
Hold on tightly, let go lightly
It's only surrender, it's all in the game
Hold on tightly, let go lightly
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame
