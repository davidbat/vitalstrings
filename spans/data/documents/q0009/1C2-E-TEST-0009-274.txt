Â 
Hello there  Many thanks for your interesting question.  When John was 22 he met Annie (Ann Marie) Martell while hanging out with some students after a gig in Minnesota.  Two years later, in June 1967, they married.  That relationship is celebrated in 'Annie's Song' and other songs written as a tribute to the woman he loved.  Sadly, things changed.  One challenge was fertility issues.  John proved to have a low sperm count and eventually the couple adopted two children: Zachary, born 1974, and Anna Kate, born 1978. Later things got really bad. Some people have suggested that he was often unkind; one commentator describes him as "unremittingly cruel".    Denver himself admitted that he once became violent and abusive, perhaps as a result of drinking. He got to the stage of nearly strangling Annie but managed to recover self-control. They divorced in 1983 but remained friends and, despite the difficult times, Annie has always been very loyal in her public remarks, calling him "fearless", for example: http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,1944,00.html and, of course, she found his death very distressing.  You may want to know that she is now a psychologist in Aspen.  There is one tiny picture of Annie with John on an album cover at: http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=www.superseventies.com/abm74_8.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.superseventies.com/albumsbymonth74.html&h=87&w=87&prev=/images%3Fq%3Djohn%2Bdenver%2B%2522back%2Bhome%2Bagain%2522%2B%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DG A review of his autobiography (on Amazon.com) describes him as an "awkward, insecure loner fighting the demons of his relationships with his father, his wife, and his agent, to name three" and he obviously didn't find love and marriage ran smoothly, despite his high ideals.  After the divorce from Annie there is no suggestion of any important relationship before he met Cassie or Cassandra Delaney, a singer and actress.  This was during an Australian tour in 1986.  Two years later they married and a year later Cassandra gave birth to their daughter, Jesse Belle, a wonderful surprise in view of John's fertility problems.  But by 1996 there was another divorce, said to be quite bitter.  There are many pictures of John and Cassandra together at: http://www.cassandramusic.com/john_gallery/index.htm Cassandra was less popular with the fans than Annie especially after his death when she took legal action to try and reduce the amount of money the two children from his first marriage would inherit. http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22annie+martell%22+denver&start=10&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=19980112172701.MAA25853%40ladder01.news.aol.com&rnum=16 But his manager insists that he was truly in love with her.  A fan at alt.net.john-denver posted this quote from People magazine, October 27, 1997: "It took him a while to get over the divorce from Cassie," says Kris O'Connor, Denver's road manager for 27 years. "He was very much in love with Cassandra. But they were getting along again, and they shared joint custody of Jessie Belle." Here you'll find info tying together the course of his marriages and the music that runs alongside: "In 1967 John married Anne ..... wrote 'Annie's Song' and many other beautiful love songs for her.  ....True love did not go so smoothly, however, and John and Annie were divorced in 1982.  Several years later John married Cassandra Delaney of Australia.  You can follow this metamorphosis on John's albums, since John's earlier albums are like a tribute to Annie. The two of them are shown together on the cover of 'Back Home Again.' When little Zachary came into their lives, that was also chronicled in song on such albums as 'Rocky Mountain Christmas' and 'Spirit.' John's marriage to Cassandra Delaney is also shown on the albums  since she sang on several of his albums and appeared in a video with him as well.  Listen to the album HIGHER GROUND (1988) to hear Cassandra on the songs 'Home Grown Tomatoes', 'Whispering Jesse', 'Bread and Roses' and 'Alaska and Me.' On the album THE FLOWER THAT SHATTERED THE STONE (1990) she sings on the song 'High, Wide and Handsome'.  That same year on the album CHRISTMAS LIKE A LULLABY, John mentions celebrating Christmas in Australia.  During their marriage John and Cassandra had a baby together and they named her Jesse Belle.  The album, THE FLOWER THAT SHATTERED THE STONE is dedicated to Jesse Belle. " http://www.madnessmansion.com/~jimkc/txt/jd-faq.txt The next quote not only sums up what a lot of fans feel about John's life and relationships but also comes from a website which may give you more information: "The big surprise is that John's life has been far from idyllic, far removed from the image his followers have of what his lifestyle must have been like over the past years. He's human; he's faced the same types of problems and challenges that we all have." http://www.sky.net/~emily/txt/takemeho.faq So, I hope that helps answer your question.  As you'll probably have seen, many John Denver sites concentrate more on his music than his personal life.  If you want to read more, perhaps you'd like to check out his autobiography from your library: "Take me Home" by John Denver, Harmony Press (1994)  If you need any clarification, please let me know.  It's been a pleasure to research this for you.
