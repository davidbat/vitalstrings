John Denver
RCA 0213
Poems, Prayers & Promises.
For many, that song served as an introduction to one of the most pastoral of all American singer-songwriters. John Denver's music was described as a cross between contemporary folk, country, and pop: a joyous celebration of nature and the simple pleasures of rural living. In 1972, "Rocky Mountain High" continued that philosophy, inspiring Baskin-Robbins to invent a "natural" ice cream flavor of the same name. John also brought his folksy demeanor to television, serving as the first host of "The Midnight Special" when it premiered on NBC in August.

Clearly, by 1973, Denver was a man to be reckoned with when it came to colorful characters on the U.S. pop scene. It was natural that he would be asked to expand into motion pictures, even if it was only to help score a made-for-TV movie.
The feature was called
and was a character study based on a real-life journal excerpted in the
Los Angeles Times.
It told the story of a terminal cancer case: a nonestablishment couple and the doctor who tried to save the young woman. Joseph Sargeant directed, Cliff DeYoung starred, and Cristina Raines played his wife. Also in the cast were Brenda Vaccaro, Meg Foster, Billy Mumy, and Corey Fischer. CBS drew high ratings when they aired the film on November 9, 1973.
MCA issued a
Sunshine
soundtrack LP, with performances by a number of cast members (in the picture, DeYoung, Mumy, and Fischer portrayed a singing trio). One of the tunes tackled was a Denver composition, "My Sweet Lady." Released as a 45 in the spring of 1974, it became a left-field Top 20 hit.
