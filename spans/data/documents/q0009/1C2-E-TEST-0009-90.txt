It's by far the hardest
thing I've ever done
To be so in love
with you and so alone
(chorus)
Follow me where I go
what I do and who I know
Make it part of you
to be a part of me
Follow me up and down
all the way and all around
Take my hand and say
you'll follow me
It's long been on my mind
You know it's been
I've tried to find the way
that I can make you understand
The way I feel about you
and just how much I need you
To be there where I can talk to you
when there's no one else around
(chorus)
You see I'd like to
share my life with you
and show you things I've seen
Places that I'm going to
places where I've been
To have you there beside
me and never be alone
And all the time
we will be at home
(chorus)
