Volunteer Work Weekend, May 2012!
SAVE THE DATE!! Come dig in the dirt and help us revitalize the land  at Windstar's annual Volunteer Weekend, May 25th-28th!  A nominal  registration fee will cover meals for three days, and includes a  commemorative t-shirt, hat and/or water bottle! We will help the  Conservancy land manager get the property in tip-top condition for all  of our planned summer and fall outreach  activities.  Please register by May 4th, so we can get a head count  for meals, and make sure everyone has a place to camp. We may have a  local hotel group rate, too. Besides two full days of getting our  hands dirty, we will have a night in Aspen and maybe one in  Carbondale, a night around the campfire, and new this year, music  throughout the day to keep us both motivated and entertained! This is  an important weekend to realize Windstar's 2012 vision to encourage  vistis and use of the land, and everyone of all ages and abilities is  invited!
Please email any questions to windstarco@wstar.org
We hope to see you out there!
On behalf of the Windstar Foundation, we wish to thank everyone who came out to Windstar for a very special Celebration and memorial dedication to Erma Deutschendorf on Sunday, October 10, 2010.
