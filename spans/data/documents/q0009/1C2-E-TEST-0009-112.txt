I went to the Japanese hot spot Benihana for dinner this weekend. And somewhere between the onion volcano and the hibachi chicken, my friends insisted I try sake, since I'd never done so before. They swore that it was rice wine and that it was really good. And I swear that it was moonshine and it was really terrible. And it was hot. It tasted just like nail polish remover which is how moonshine tastes to me. But while I can't stand the taste of ‘shine, for some reason, I absolutely love songs that make mention of the illegal corn whiskey.
