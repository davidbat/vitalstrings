An Evening with John Denver [Bonus Tracks]
Biography of John Denver
A fan of folk music by the Chad Mitchell Trio, Joan Baez, and others in the '60s, Denver sang their songs in coffeehouses. He later joined The Mitchell Trio before going solo in 1969. From 1974-1975 Denver scored four #1 hits, including "Thank God I'm a Country Boy," "Sunshine on My Shoulders," and "Annie's Song." His commercial fortunes declined in the early '80s. ~ Bil Carpenter
