John Denver Sanctuary
The John Denver Sanctuary is near the Rio Grande Park in Aspen. This memorial features many of Denver's songs carved into large granite stones.           Denver died in his small airplane October 12, 1997. Fans gather every year in October, on the anniversary of his death, to celebrate his life and music.     (The gentleman in the panorama was on a 2 week motorcycle tour from Albuquerque, New Mexico. He had stopped in Aspen to visit the shrine.)
