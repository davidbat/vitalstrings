Pulled out of Denton, Texas two days and nights ago,
I been living on pills and burgies, the whites of my eyes don’t show.
The south bound headlights are making me blind, I’m too damn tired to blink.
My toes are numb and my brain’s gone dumb, I can just barely think.
Lo de looou, sweet Melinda, my wife.
The lonesome moan of this eighteen-wheeler cuts through me like a knife.
Except for you, sweet Melinda, my wife, I been riding on empty most all of my life.
Two more hours till daylight, starting to rain again.
A sign up ahead says welcome to Paradise, Population Ten.
Me and this truck and that old white line stumbling on and on,
Like three old drinking buddies coming home at dawn.
Singing ooooo, sweet Melinda, my wife.
The lonesome moan of this eighteen-wheeler cuts through me like a knife.
Except for you, sweet Melinda, my wife, I been riding on empty most all of my life.
Except for you, sweet Melinda, my wife.
The lonesome moan of this eighteen-wheeler cuts through me like a knife.
Except for you, sweet Melinda, my wife, I been riding on empty most all of my life.
I been riding on empty most all of my life
What’s On Your Mind
What’s On Your Mind
You know sometimes I can’t sleep at night. I can’t quiet my heart or my mind.
I toss and I turn, I ache and I burn, I get caught in the passing of time.
It’s like too many miles, too many heartaches, too much that needs to be done.
Yes, and too many sidewalks, too many people, too many hours alone.
What’s on your mind and what’s on my mind is really quite the same.
I’ve been working so hard and I’m ready to play, I know just the right game.
What’s on your mind is what’s on my mind. That’s the way it’s gonna be.
I’m gonna find me a place I can hide, I want you right next to me.
Oh, I’ve never seen a more beautiful day, it’s my favorite time of the year.
The colors are changing, she’s rearranging and I’m so glad to be here.
I’ve been up and around, I’ve been lost, I’ve been found, I’ve seen love face to face in my dreams.
And the things that I know and the things that I show are not always just what they seem.
What’s on your mind is what’s on my mind, it’s just that way.
It’s like catching a ride on a beautiful river, let it carry us all away.
What’s on your mind is what’s on my mind is really nothing new.
I want to get you alone, I want to make you my own, baby, I want to make love with you.
What’s on your mind is what’s on my mind, is really quite the same.
I’ve been working so hard and I’m ready to play baby, I know just the right game.
What’s on your mind is what’s on my mind is really nothing new.
I want to get you alone, I want to make you my own, baby, I want to make love with you.

Joseph & Joe
Joseph & Joe
Joseph and Joe, the priest and the cowboy, the places they’ve been to, the spaces they’re in.
For a time between storms at the side of a mountain,
with another man’s family, family and friends.
Joseph can give you the keys to the kingdom, he’ll put you in touch with the spirit of man.
Joe loves the desert but lives in the mountains, his closest companion, a left-handed man.
Where do you go if you’ve got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you’ve never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?
Joseph, I lost you in some other city, our paths are not crossing, were way out of time.
Joe how the seasons have drifted between us, or is it your vision much greater than mine?
Take heed of the darkness which gathers around us, a fire that consumes us, forever to burn.
Then look to the sun for our father is with us, our mother will teach us what we need to learn.
Where do you go if you’ve got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you’ve never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?
Tell me where do you go if you’ve got no way to get there? Where do you go?
How do you know if you’ve never ever been there? How do you know?
Tell me how do you know?

Life Is So Good
Life Is So Good
Life is so good, life is so good these days life is so good these days, life is so good.
Life is so good, life is so good these days life is so good these days, life is so good.
Life is so good, life is so good these days life is so good these days, life is so good.
My life is so good, my life is so good these days, life is so good these days, life is so good.

Berkeley Woman
Berkeley Woman
I saw a Berkeley woman sitting in a rocking chair. A dulcimer in her lap, feather in her hair.
Her breasts swayed freely with the rhythm of the rocking chair,
she was a sitting and a singing and a swaying, Her cheeks were red I declare.
‘Twas hard to believe what my eyes showed me then,
the color in her cheeks was just her natural skin.
She wore no makeup to make her look that way.
She was a natural mama with the red cheeks, what more can I say?
Well, I finally realized there was hunger in my stare.
In my mind I was swaying with the woman in the rocking chair.
But the lady I was living with was standing right by my side,
she saw my stare and she saw the hunger and Lord, it made her cry.
So with anger on her face, yes and hurt in her eyes,
she scratched me and she clawed me, she screamed and she cried,
“oh, you don’t give me near all the loving that you should,
yet you’re ready to go and lay with her, well you’re just no damn good.”
Well, I guess she’s probably right, oh, I guess I’m probably wrong.
I guess she’s not too far away, she hasn’t been gone very long.
And I guess we could get together and try it one more time,
but I know that wanderlust would come again, she’d only wind up a-crying.
Well, now you’ve heard my story as plain as the light of day.
It’s hard to feel guilty for loving the ladies, that’s all I gotta say.
Except a woman is the sweetest fruit that God ever put on the vine,
I’d no more love just one kind of woman than drink only one kind of wine.
Well, a woman is the sweetest fruit that God ever put on the vine,
I’d no more love just one kind of woman than drink only one kind of wine.
I’d no more love just one kind of woman than drink only one kind of wine.
