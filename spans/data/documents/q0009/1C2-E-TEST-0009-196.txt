Answer:
John and Annie Martell married when they were in their early 20s in the mid 60s after a brief courtship, Annie admitted herself that they did not really know each other. John was a member of the Mitchell trio at the time and toured constantly.
After they married, money was very tight for a time which put a strain on the relationship. Then he found success but still Annie did not travel with him.
They had 2 adopted children. John was tested and found to be 'sterile'.
John admitted himself in his autobiography and on the associated CDs which he made to accompany the book, that he was unfaithful to Annie and this escalated after he hit the big time. He spent little time in Colorado where they had a home and they had numerous separations during the 70s....one of which inspired "Annie's Song".
Annie and John divorced in the early 80s.
In 1986 John met Cassandra Delaney who had appeared in various states of undress in the 1986 film 'fair game'...there was a 20 year age gap. John admitted in his autobiography of being warned about Cassie by her boyfriend whom she waved goodbye at the airport as she flew off to Aspen with John after knowing each other only a few days. During courtship John said that there were rumours that Cassandra had been unfaithful.
Cassandra gave birth to a baby girl, Jesse Belle, in May 1989 - 9 months after marrying John. After the baby, John wanted to tour again but Cassandra wanted to stay with the child. Things turned sour and Cassandra complained of his moods and his drinking. John said that Cassandra was making a fool of him.
They split in 1991 and divorced in 1993 - the divorce cost John dearly.
John died in an aeroplane accident in 1997.
