Country Roads Lyrics
Almost heaven West Virgina blue rich mountain,tended to old river. Live is older than, older than the creek, younger than the mountians, brolling like the breeze. Country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia moutian mama, take me home Country roads.  All my memoires, I get around her, by this lady, stranged to blue water. Darking dusk see, paint in all this sky, mister taste the Moonshine,teardrods in my eyes,  Country roads take me home to the place, I belong West Virginia moutian mama, take me home Country roads.  I hear her voice in the morning are she calle´s me,radio the minds me on my hold far away.Driving down the road, I feel the feeling that I sured me,oh yesterday, yesterday  Country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia moutian mama, take me home Country roads. Country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia moutian mama, take me home Country roads.Take me home now Country roads.Take me home now Country roads.
