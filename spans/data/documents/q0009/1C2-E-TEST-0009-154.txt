Windstar Land Conservancy
John Denver saw the Windstar Land as a symbol of the importance of the wild places throughout the Earth. He hoped that other landowners would be inspired by the actions taken by the Boards of the Rocky Mountain Institute, Windstar Foundation and the National Wildlife Federation that enabled the creation of the Windstar Land Conservancy - and that many others would provide conservation protection for the open space lands in their care.
The Windstar Foundation is a not-for-profit environmental education organization founded in 1976 by John Denver and Tom Crum. The mission of the Windstar Foundation is "To inspire individuals to make responsible choices and take direct personal actions to achieve a peaceful and environmentally sustainable future."
John was deeply grateful for people's generosity and commitment. He would be delighted to know that the good works and contributions of the many friends of the Windstar lands continue.
The Windstar Foundation is pleased to reprint this viewpoint written in 1995 by John Denver. John and the Foundation followed this issue closely for years leading up to the signing of the Alaska Land Conservation Act in 1980, an act John was instrumental in supporting. Before his accident, John never failed to speak out when it's status was threatened. We feel that John's eloquent and passionate letter is an appropriate and timely means of continuing to educate those who are still uncertain as to the importance of preserving what few pristine wilderness areas remain.
