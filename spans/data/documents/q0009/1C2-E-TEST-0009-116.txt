Featuring Tom Becker
Former Member of the Legendary Folk Group                 The New Christy Minstrels
"Tom Becker's John Denver Tribute does more than simply remind you of John Denver and the music that made him famous.  Tom and his fabulous cast of musicians go a step further and recreate the essence of folk music, both onstage with delightful vocals and masterful playing, and offstage with their ability to please the audience to the core."  Amanda Segur, Theater Manager,  Cultural Center Theater,                    Port Charlotte, FL 
Tom and his band bring back the foot-stomping fun of “Thank God, I’m a Country Boy”, the tenderness of "Annie’s Song”, and the sweeping grandeur of “Eagle and the Hawk" in an uplifting and powerful tribute.
 
The show offers the perfect blend of well-known and lesser-known Denver songs, and features music and stories from Tom’s days as a member of The New Christy Minstrels.
Also included in the show--a few Denver-inspired original songs including, “Sailor”, selected by the US Navy as the Official Commemorative Song for the US Navy Memorial in Washington, DC.
