 
About John Denver:
John’s music clearly reflects the conscience of a concerned citizen, a man        working for the improvement of the quality of life for all people – environmentally,        socially and politically. He was asked to serve as a member of the        Presidential Commission on World and Domestic Hunger and was one of the        five founders of The Hunger Project – an organization committed to the        sustainable end of chronic hunger. John was asked to be a member of the        fact-finding delegation, which toured African countries devastated by        drought and starvation as a representative of the Hunger project and        UNICEF. Because of his tireless effort and dedication, John was awarded        the Presidential “World Without Hunger” Award by President Jimmy Carter.        John also received recognition from many governments for his concert about        global hunger problems.
John’s birthday is December 31st 1943 and we  celebrate it.  John’s former band        members  perform at our New Year’s Eve Concerts and proceeds        are donated to a charity that shares John's vision.  Past ones have        included:  St. Vincent de Paul at the Casa in Scottsdale, AZ, as well        as the Deaf Camp and John's Windstar Foundation, both outside of Aspen,        CO.
Many years ago, John wrote the song “It’s About Time”. The last verse        states:
 
“There is a man who is my brother, I just        don’t know his name
But I know his home and family because I know we feel the same
And it hurts me when he’s hungry and when his children cry
I too am a Father and that little one is mine.”
