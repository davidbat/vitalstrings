About This Track
Written by John Denver in 1975, “Calypso” is a tribute to Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his famous marine conservation/research vessel “Calypso”.  There are a number of versions of Calypso on Denver’s albums.  The original version can be heard on Windsong (featuring many of Denver’s megahits - Fly Away (duet with Olivia-Newton John), Looking for Space (featured in the series finale of Magnum P.I. ), Like a Sad Song, Thank God I’m a Country Boy)  As John Denver got older and his voice in his words became deeper, he would later do an acoustic remix of Calypso which appeared on a number of future compilation albums in the US and abroad, but most noticeably Earth Songs; an acoustic album which coincided with the very first recognition of what we know today as Earth Day.  Calypso also appeared in video form on John’s Evening At and in a TV special which Jacque-Yves Cousteau and his son and his crew’s work were recognized.  John spent several days onboard with the crew which was the catalyst of the song.  He admitted later in a future program of his video hits admit difficulty in finishing the last verse of the song and his son giving him the inspriation to finish just days before it was to be recorded for the first time.
