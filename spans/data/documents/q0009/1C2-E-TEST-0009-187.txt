John         Denver - July 1997
It's another beautiful spring in the Colorado Rocky Mountainsblue       skies, bright sunshine, cool breezes, and tender green buds interspersed       with blooming dandelions greet me each morning. The mountains are graced       with glistening snowoff somewhere a hawk is heardand as its       graceful body soars aboveI think of Johnflying for me.
Sometimes it's amazing to think about the joy I've again foundthat       wonderful feeling that life is goodand that there is so much for me       yet to do. A sweet happiness is mine once again despite that terrible pain       of losing John from this Earth. Despite the tears, I know John wants me to       flyhe wants you to flyand the joy which makes that possible       comes only when we bring love to everything we do each day. Miraculously,       love given to others eases paintheirs and ours.
John spent his life flying - literally and metaphorically. Surely the       sensation of piloting those planes was wonderful; seeing all he could see.       But John also knew the pleasure of flying while his feet were firmly on       the groundhe knew the freedom and joy as his Spirit flew as he gave       and shared of himself with all of us. He knew and taught us that it's only       when we love that we fly. Despite the pain of living in this realm, we are       meant to lovewe are meant to fly.
Easter has recently passeda story of a man who lovedgave his       lifeand has risen. A story reminiscent of all great teachers of love       who have come and gone. Their short time upon this Earth leaving behind a       legacy of such magnitude that we will always recognize and celebrate that       they came to show us the way. I think of Jesus, Ghandi, BuddhaI       think of John. Both from ancient and modern times there are souls who       recognize the necessity of love and live their lives in an effort to teach       that truth to others.
Such souls experience many tribulations and much pain during their human       existence, yet somehow they cope with the pain of suffering and maintain       that love is the answer to it all.
John         Denver - September 1997
John suffered in his lifethat's obvious. We all suffer. But he       maintained his faith in purposehis trust in love. Thus, as we know,       he worked in so many ways to help, inspire, and ease other people's pain in spite of the pains he went through.
It takes strength to work for peace when you're enduring incredible       emotional pain. It takes courage to commit your life to relieving other's       suffering when you find yourself in despair. Very few have such strength       and couragebut John had it. He flewhe is flying now.
So it is with each of us. We are born, grow, experience sadness and joy,       feel pain and happiness, andif we choose, as John did, we can flyfor       ourselves and for others.
John's beautiful memorial song, "Flying For Me", expresses       deep appreciation for the Challenger crew. But it also communicates his       heart's desire to "give a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be       heard, and for all of the ones who live in fear" Here, again,       we find John's love for others. Poignantly he sings, "I wanted to       give myself and free myself, and join myself with it all". He has.
As he intended, it is a wonderful tribute to the space shuttle crew, but       it is also something morean exceptionally personal ballad of John's       essence: his dreams, his vision for a better world; his hope that his life       would be meaningful and significant to the welfare of othersone of       the highest callings we can aspire to.
I often find myself thinking of John's life and death. John gave us his       light, he gave us his spirit and all he could behe was flying for mehe       was flying for everyone. And to me, that song is really a tribute to each       soul who lives their life from lovefrom a wanting deep within to be       part of the movementpart of the growingpart of the difference.

Believing in love will not protect you from pain, sadness, or             sorrowin fact, I think you'll have more of it in your life.             But it is not a bad thingit is, as John sings, part of life.             To refuse to acknowledge it is to refuse part of life. Being in touch             with our innermost feelings is essential to being able to express             love in the fullest wayand to all.
I believe John's hope for each of us while our spirit is within             this human form is to flyto love all lifegive love in             every breathing moment we haveto exclude nobody from that love.             And, to remember that despite the pain we have while on Earth, that             life is worth living. For as John said so perfectly, "In the             midst of this incredibly insane world with all the terrors and problems,             life is worth living. I love life, and everything about it. The first             thing that is there for me in every relationship, in every aspect             of living, is this celebration".
So, spread your wingsendeavor to examine your life to develop             ways to express love to all. Make no exceptionsalways love.             No matter how much pain you feelno matter what you have doneor             has been done to youno matter what happensalways love.         Then you will, like John, fly.
