John Denver, the greatest country singer I've ever heard in my life.His each and every song is very mind blowing not only to me but also to all I think.Especially his
Annie's Song is the most appealing song.His passing away makes us really desolute in the country song world and the world of every country song fan's heart as well.I remember him for his great contribution and dedication to all of his melodious songs and his song loving people.I also salute him from the bottom of my heart.
Rest in Peace, John.Thanks.
