John Denver Death
John Denver, a classic American singer-songwriter                      whose words and later political deeds touched millions of                      fans and others alike, died tragically on Sunday 12th October                      1997 at the premature age of just 53.
Denver, a lifelong aviation fanatic, was taken from us whilst                      partaking in one of his great passions, namely piloting his                      own small aircraft.
The terrible irony of such a passing, a man dying whilst enjoying                      his passion, was further deepened when fans gathered and radio                      stations played his music to remember him, they recalled the                      lyrics and title of one of his best-known and loved songs, "Leaving on a jet plane", whereupon the singer is                      left mourning the absence of his loved one. And over 25 years                      on his family, friends and ever loyal fans where left with                      the same bereftness and longing as the narrator of the song                      themselves..
But Denver never allowed his love of flying get in the way                      of anything and he was certainly a fearless though never reckless                      aviator, witnessed by the fact that he'd already had two lucky                      escapes from the clutches of death whilst pursuing his love                      affair with aviation travel.
He'd already walked unscathed from a runway accident in 1989                      when the 1931 bi-plane he was taxiing down the runway in readiness                      for ascension suddenly flipped and ended up facing the wrong                      way down the runway. It was a relatively minor accident but                      one that could've resulted in the worst circumstances, but                      fortunately Denver walked away without a scratch.
And his love of flight extended beyond earthly binds, as                      he was a fully trained astronaught and was in training to                      be on-board the doomed Space Shuttle Challenger on its tragic                      1986 flight. But a simple twist of fate and Denver couldn't                      come aboard and so he was spared, though only temporarily                      as it tragically turned out.
Exact causes are very seldom easy to find in sudden deaths                      like aircraft fatalities such as Denver's and this case is                      no exception as no-one not even the coroner, crash investigators                      nor the traffic controllers he was in contact with until seconds                      before his death, can definitely ascertain what occurred in                      the tragic seconds at around 5.27 PM on the fateful day.
What is known is that Denver, a highly qualified and experienced                      pilot, was practicing manoeuvres in a home-built experimental                      two-seater plane that he'd bought just the previous day over                      the Californian pacific coast near to where he had a home                      in Montery Bay.
There are two theories has to how the tragic events unfolded,                      but what is certain is that Denver was unfamiliar with some                      of the controls of his new aircraft and despite his great                      experience as a pilot made a fatal error in his final seconds                      by either, depending on who you believe, misreading the fuel                      gauge and believed that the aircraft had enough fuel to continue                      its flight when in actual fact it had none, or a design quirk                      added by the plane's original owner when he built the plane                      built fooled John into misreading the control panel thus causing                      the fatal error.
Either way the plane hurtled into the Pacific and the world                      lost one of its most favourite singers.
