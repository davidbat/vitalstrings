Windstar
Dedication
We dedicate the John Denver Peace Cloth in loving memory of John Denver,      to John's family - without whom we could not have come this far, and to the       many people who sewed and dreamed and gave it life.

Welcome to the John Denver Peace Cloth Connection

“Friend, We Will Remember You”
Our friend and Peace Cloth board member Lana Zinkon  passed over on Thursday October 28th 2010, after a lengthy and courageous battle with pulmonary hypertension.  It's hard to imagine the Peace Cloth without Lana, she is ever a part of it.  She sewed many of the panels that made up the original footage so many years ago.  Being a part of Windstar and the Peace Cloth meant a lot to Lana, even after she became ill and could not be as active as she wanted.  We ask that you keep Lana's family in your thoughts and prayers.
About the John Denver Peace Cloth Connection
Welcome to the official web site for the Windstar John Denver Peace Cloth Connection.             The John Denver Peace Cloth is a creative work of art that is      the culmination of work from people around the world - pieces     of cloth sewn together in panels to convey the hopes and      prayers of individuals who believe that by coming together,     we can make a difference.
The Windstar Foundation and the John Denver Peace Cloth      have been a team since September of 2000, when the John Denver      Memorial Peace Cloth made it's debut at the United Nations in       a ceremony for Millennium Peace Day. Ron Deutschendorf,        John Denver's brother, joined us that day, supporting us in        our efforts, and he gave us his blessing on the John Denver        Peace Cloth project when he said "you need to keep this going"     and promised his support.
True to his word, over the coming months, Ron worked with us      to get the permissions we needed to use John's name, pictures       and words in the Peace Cloth. Ron, his family, Windstar and        others worked with the newly formed board of the Peace Cloth,        eventually bringing the Peace Cloth under the Windstar umbrella,     giving us a home and opportunity to be a true part of working     toward the vision that we all share.
We hope you enjoy visiting our site and will keep coming back to                      see new pages and content as they become available. It is a work in progress, so       if you don't see what you are looking for, please email us with any       questions you have. Thank you for your continued support of the Windstar John Denver Peace Cloth Connection.
The John Denver Peace Cloth Connection Board of Directors,
Cheryl Fritz, Eve Kleinfeld and Lana Zinkon
