I want to do anything I can
to improve the quality of life
on our planet." - John Denver
“You've probably heard people talk about conservation.  Well, conservation isn't just the business of a few people.  It's a matter that concerns all of us. It's a science whose principles are written in the oldest code in the world, the laws of nature. The natural resources of our vast continent are not inexhaustible. But if we will use our riches wisely, if we will protect our wildlife and preserve our lakes and streams, these things will last us for generations to come.   I have a great love of animals and laughter.”
- Walt Disney
