F#m Life is old there, older than the trees, E D A Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze. A E Country roads, take me home, F#m D To the place I belong: A E West Virginia, mountain momma, D A Take me home, country roads. A F#m All my mem'ries, gather 'round her, E D A Miner's lady, stranger to blue water. F#m Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, E D A Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye. A E Country roads, take me home, F#m D To the place I belong: A E West Virginia, mountain momma, D A Take me home, country roads. F#m E A I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me, D A E The radio reminds me of my home far away. F#m G And drivin' down the road, D A E I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, E7 yesterday. A E Country roads, take me home, F#m D To the place I belong: A E West Virginia, mountain momma, D A take me home, country roads. A E Country roads, take me home, F#m D To the place I belong: A E West Virginia, mountain momma, D A take me home, country roads. E A Take me home, country roads. E A Take me home, down country roads.  * Alternate:  Capo II A = G F#m = Em E = D D = C G = F E7 = D7 Set8  http://sites.google.com/site/guitarmusicchordsandlyrics/
