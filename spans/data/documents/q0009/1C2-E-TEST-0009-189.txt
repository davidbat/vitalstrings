Reaching for the Magical Higher Ground of John Denver's Music,
These pages feature MIDIs and Media of John's musical & lyrical legacy
You're listening to John's "The Wings that Fly Us Home,"
Beautifully sequenced by Lorrieann Russell
If you would like to actually hear John Denver singing
"Higher Ground,"
Click the link button above and you'll hear
the complete song in the mp3 format
as well as see photos of Greenland's
John Denver Peak!
If you have a cable modem or DSL, the download time
should be about 10-30 seconds. A slower connection
will take, of course, much longer to download.
I've previously recommended using Crescendo for playing
MIDI's and mp3's from web pages. Live-Update has gone
out of business and Crescendo is no longer available. If you
still have the program on your computer, it will continue to work.

Now, I'd suggest downloading Windows Media Player
if you don't already have it installed. Don't have the
most current version? Click the logo at the right and
get the correct version for your Operating System
