Welcome
JOHN DENVER... An icon of American music, and one of the world’s biggest selling recording artists, was a connoisseur of fine acoustic and electric guitars. As afforded by his international celebrity, he was able to acquire an impressive array of rare and unusual instruments over the course of his extraordinary career.
Much has been written about John Denver’s voice, his music, his personal life, as well as his environmentalism and humanitarian work. Though up until now, very little has been documented regarding the numerous fine instruments that he employed through out his recordings, concert tours and television appearances.
Welcome to The John Denver Guitar Research Site. Dedicated to the memory of John Denver, JDGRS is the only resource of it's kind in the world. This is a web site by fans, for fans. JDGRS's objective is to archive and preserve another fascinating aspect of the career of one of the most celebrated and unique artists of our time...
