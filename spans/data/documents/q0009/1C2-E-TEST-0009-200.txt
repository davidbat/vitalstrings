his music and spirit has been woven into the fabric of thoes who seek a gentler more honest life. I love you John, now that im older I see what you were singing about. I wish others would too. The world could only be happier if they did.

We love John Denver's music was very inspring and soul filling, we listen to him often as possible & watch his videos at least once a week to lift our spirits. We too believe he's with God now because he had be a God send to to have touched our lifes as well as others. He is not given enough credit.
