"FAIR GAME" - Cassie's 1986 Film (VHS - US/Canada Format)
John Denver met Cassandra Delaney while performing concerts in Australia in 1986.  Soon after, JD brought her home to Aspen, but before they were married, Cassie returned to her homeland to make this film - "Fair Game."  While she was away, John wrote the incredibly beautiful song "For You" which as we all know is one of the best love songs ever written.
Although Cassie's acting career never really took off, it will probably surprise a lot of people that she was really a pretty good  actress - and this is a very well done and very exciting film!  It gets you interested from the beginning and holds your undivided attention to the very end.
Cassie plays Jessica, a feisty woman who runs a wildlife sanctuary in Australia.  While driving on a lonely road one day, she encounters three men who decide to start an escalating "game" of terrorizing her - first on the road, and later inside and outside of her home, which is located in a very isolated area w she lives with her beloved animals.  The movie takes us through one thrilling encounter after another as Jessica does everything in her power to outwit and defeat her tormenters.  Along the way t is some nudity, but it's not overly done.  An exciting action film with very good performances that left us wishing Cassie had made more movies!
PERSONALLY AUTOGRAPHED "GIVE IT UP TO LOVE" - Cassie's 2003 CD of 15 Songs
As with Cassie's film, it might also surprise people that this debut CD is also quite good.  Cassie wrote many of the songs herself, and her style is very lovely and meaningful.  And although her decision to sing John's last song "Yellowstone - Coming Home" met with a degree of controversy (some thought it was a wonderful tribute to John, while others didn't quite see it the same way), it is nevertheless interesting to hear Cassie's version of John's amazing song.  We all remember Cassie singing with JD on many of his songs - most notably "Alaska and Me," "High Wide and Handsome," and "Bread and Roses" - so it's really nice to hear her solo effort , which is very impressive.
