God willing I will be at the same Mass as my Mom and Dad (but I'll be singing in the choir, while they will be in the congregation).  I hope to buy a special cake at the bakery.  Mom is making dinner--salmon, I think, is what Dad answered w...hen Mom & I asked what he's like.  Mom and I already bought him some new pajamas, so he received his gift ahead of time.  But I will give him 2 cards on Sunday.  God willing, Mom, Dad and I will spend most of Sunday together, as we usually do.  (My parents live about a 5-10 minute drive from me.) See More
