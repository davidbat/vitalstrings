Fluid Duality: Bamboo sculptures by Kenichi Nagakura
May 12 - August 5
Gates Garden Court
Nagakura expands the Japanese tradition of bamboo baskets, moving beyond the functional into the realm of abstract sculptural forms. Using splitting and plaiting techniques learned from his grandfather, the artist creates forms that are bold and expressionistic.
