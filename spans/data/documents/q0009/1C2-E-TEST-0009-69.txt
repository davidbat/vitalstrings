Blue Tulip Music, LLC proudly presents the John Adams Band for the first time ever at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. John Adams, together with his 12-piece band, will bring back the music of the Rocky Mountain legend, John Denver, while backed by the Colorado Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Richard Niezen.
John Adams performed a duet with John Denver in Europe of "Whispering Jesse." Not even a "far out" could express the experience they shared, followed by Denver saying "He sounds just like me." Both Johns shared stories with each other of their time in Beijing and the many other parts of the world music took them. The two agreed on recording plans, before Colorado lost her adopted son. The band each has their own connection to John Denver and as a musical family they evoke polar opposite of emotions from the audience through the music and stories that are shared from stage.
Come join the colorful state as they celebrate the 15th death anniversary of John Denver, the 20th anniversary of Denver Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, and John Adams’ 40th anniversary of dedicating his life to what is now considered the best John Denver Tribute in the World!
This extravagant and poignant celebration will feature a memorable opening to the show to kick off the evening in the highest of fashion and excitement. Following in John Denver’s footsteps, the concert is a benefit for the Denver Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure®.
John Adams is the only John Denver tribute artist who travels with his own band as they perform the songs the way John Denver wrote and performed them and the way you remember them-- no cuts, no changes, and no tacky arrangements. Be sure to bring your friends, family, humor, and tissues as you engage in this magical, musical journey with Colorado's own, John Adams Band.
All ages are welcome.
