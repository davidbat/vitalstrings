To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living
In search of the answers to questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand
Aye, Calypso, the places youâ€™ve been to
The things that youâ€™ve shown us
The stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you
So long and so well
Like the dolphin who guides you
You bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide
And free as the wind-swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be
Aye, Calypso, the places youâ€™ve been to
The things that youâ€™ve shown us
The stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you
So long and so well
Aye, Calypso, the places youâ€™ve been to
The things that youâ€™ve shown us
The stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you
So long and so well
