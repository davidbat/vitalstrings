A Trane Tribute and a Carnegie Afternoon
This week's new releases include four sets recorded in 1976: Elvin Jones honoring his old bandmate John Coltrane with A Love Supreme, the George Coleman Septet moving from calm to mayhem and back again, Anthony Braxton stretching the limits of jazz, and the Ted Curson bopping the day away.
