 
JOHN'S VISION    FOR MENIFEE
Menifee was recently incorporated (October 2008).  As with other new cities, it has growing pains.  We had to find the right city manager.  We have gone through two city manager, but, with the third, we seem to have found one who is the "right fit". 
The new council is still working out its role within the city.  Most of the citizens of Menifee want more and better commercial and upscale retail.  But there are some who, honestly, don't.  They moved here for the hills and open spaces, and really do not want change.  There is an inevitable conflict in those two views.
Menifee needs more and better infrastructure.  We have freeway overpasses that need to be widened, and streets that need repair and lenghthening.  We have found out, the hard way, that the money for these projects will come from new development in Menifee, both housing and commercial, which some community members don't want.  Again, a conflict with communitiy views. 
We have a great staff.  We did well on that score.  The city staff serves the Menifee population with care and efficiency.  The problem is that, in general, we need more staff.  There is much work for a few people to handle.  We don't have the money to hire more staff, so it's the 'chicken and egg' problem.  Should we hire more staff and spend more money?  Or should we be more conservative and deal with the lines in the office to see staff and phone calls on hold. 
In spite of these difficult situations that need answers, the future for Menifee is bright.  Any errors made in decisions simply slow things down and aggravate people.  But we will grow.  We will get better and become the place where we all want to live.
John Denver shares our values!
