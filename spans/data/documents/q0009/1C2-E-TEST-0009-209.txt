“There has never been a time on Earth like we see today. What we need
are more ways to experience our interconnectedness - it is a precursor
to deep love. So in this quickening light, with the dawn of each new
day, let us look for love. Let us no longer struggle. Let us ever become
who we most want to be. As we begin to be who we truly are, the world
will be a better place.”
