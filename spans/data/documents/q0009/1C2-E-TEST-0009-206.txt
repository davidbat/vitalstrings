Prosthetics and Orthotics
Prosthetics and orthotics specialties involve the evaluation, fabrication and custom fitting of artificial limbs and orthopedic braces. Healthcare practitioners in this field allow patients new possibilities for movement and independence.
A prosthetic technician, also known as a prosthetist, is a healthcare practitioner who has been certified to measure, design, fabricate, fit and service prostheses that are prescribed by a licensed physician. Prosthetics are devices that replace external parts of the body lost due to amputation or congenital deformities. Devices include artificial limbs (arm, forearm, hand, fingers, leg, foot, toes); robotic prostheses that integrate into the body’s functions using biosensors that process signals from the patients nervous or muscular systems; and cosmesis or life-like limbs that mimic the appearance of a real limb.
An orthotic technician, also known as a orthotist, is a healthcare practitioner who has been certified to measure, design, fabricate, fit and service orthotics that are prescribed by a licensed physician. Orthotics are devices that support or correct musculoskeletal deformities or abnormalities. They can be as simple as a foot-supporting device or insole, or as complex as a device to support the spine. Conditions treated with orthotics include: foot fatigue and discomfort, scoliosis, fracture, stroke, spinal cord injury, or congenital abnormality such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy.
