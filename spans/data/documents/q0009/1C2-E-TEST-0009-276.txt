Welcome to Our Denver Plastic Surgery Practice
We would like to welcome you to our clinic for plastic reconstructive and  aesthetic surgery, the Plastic Surgery Group. We appreciate your having  considered us for your care. The purpose of this website is to familiarize you  with our clinic and with Plastic Surgery.
The word plastic comes from the Greek word plastikos, which means "to  mold". Plastic surgery is a means by which form, function, and appearance  can be restored or improved. Aesthetic (cosmetic) plastic surgery reshapes  facial or body features in order to enhance appearance. Reconstructive plastic  surgery helps restore loss of function, as well as improving oneâ€™s appearance.
Body By Design is dedicated to provide you with the finest plastic surgery care.  Your comfort and privacy are our main priorities. Providing you with knowledge,  experience, and aesthetic judgment are utmost in our minds. We are good  listeners and encourage you to ask questions and make suggestions. It is our  desire that your experience with us is as pleasant and beneficial as possible.
