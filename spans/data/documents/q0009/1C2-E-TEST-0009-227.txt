Like a golden ray of mountain sunshine breaking through the chill February air, Jim Curry comes to our own Schuster Center with a remarkable tribute to the great American singer/songwriter John Denver. Jim is not the usual “Vegas style” impersonator. In fact, he is not an impersonator at all. Jim sings, in his own natural voice, a tribute to Denver's music in a way that has to be seen and heard in order to understand the pure honesty of his performance. The music of John Denver is like an old friend outlasting trends and standing the test of time. So come join acclaimed performer Jim Curry, and your own Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, for this tribute to the music of one of the most beloved singer/songwriters ever to grace the stage.
