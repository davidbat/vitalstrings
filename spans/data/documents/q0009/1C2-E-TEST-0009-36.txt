Henry John Deutschendorf first came to public notice as Chad Mitchell's replacement in the Chad Mitchell Trio. Unfortunately, the Hootenanny-era folk boom was already in its death throes. Based on the strength of Peter, Paul and Mary's #1 hit with his song "Leaving On a Jet Plane," the rechristened John Denver was offered a deal at RCA in 1969. His solo career started off unremarkably, but with 1971's Aerie he found his audience. With the following album (Poems, Prayers, and Promises, and its #2 hit, "Take Me Home, Country Roads"), he exploded, another overnight sensation a decade in the making. He had a massive international following through the '70s, though it later tapered off. John Denver was killed in an experimental-plane crash in 1997.
