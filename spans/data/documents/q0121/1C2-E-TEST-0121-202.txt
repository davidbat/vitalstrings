The majestic Sears Tower is the tallest building in North America, and the third tallest building in the world. This regal building offers more than 3.8 million square feet of office and retail space.  It seems only fitting that a building such as this should exist in the "Windy City,"  the ever-bustling 3rd largest city in the United States. Not just a "towering" and influential business site, tourists flock here because the shopping, dining, museums, and entertainment is unrivaled, and its strategic location is convenient for all: It is accessible by both major commuter rail stations, three major highways, and all forms of public transportation, including 24 CTA bus routes, and the elevated transit system.
