In Short â€“ Founded in 1893 by Richard Sears, this well-known brand has come to symbolize consumer trust and value. In addition to selling appliances and electronics, Sears repairs major brands (no matter where purchased) in-home or in-store. Do-it-yourselfers can purchase parts or stock up on the exclusive Craftsman tool line. The auto department offers tire, brake, oil change and shock services. A wide range of clothing, jewelry, gifts, housewares, computers, toys and sporting goods is also available.

Save Money:
Find a lower price elsewhere? Sears will match the competitor's price, plus refund 10 percent of the difference; simply tell a sales associate at the time of, or within 30 days of, the purchase.
