  As a Chicago resident, I went to the top of the Sears Tower twice. My son loved it, however it was very expensive and he found the movie to be boring. We were inside, there is no outer deck, and the view was not spectacular.  I would take someone as a visitor, but there are so many more spectacular tourist attractions.

  Have been up there before and am going to for my birthday! Breathtaking and amazing. My personal Favorite building of all time. Still can't believe they changed the name. But people will always call it the Sears Tower!!

   I  grew up in Chicago since I was 1 year old, and every time I saw the Sears tower, it never ceased to amaze me. In spite of the coompetition from foreign countries, its greatness and structural integrity will never be surpassed by no one. It  will always lead the way for the rest.

  I am not from this great city, but I was lucky to visit Chicago last month, and I love it.

  Wow. A marvelous building. When I look up at it it seems that I have to flip over.

  It makes the Chicago Skyline awesome! I don't mind going back for another tour and another photo ;)

  The things I like the least are the color (black), it's efficiency, and the somewhat clumsy look about it.  An awesome powerhouse, nonetheless though.

  Sears Tower is an awesome piece of construction by mans engineering. I have always been terrified by heights,but now I plan toGO ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP!

  I delivered rented equip. to some of the contractors that built the tower, and got as high as the 97th floor before the walls were put in; an experience  I'll never forget.

  This building still is a masterpiece. There is no other skyscraper in the world with a similar look. The two antennas are great eye-catchers too.

  As an Architecture Buff of Chicago, I think it is very wrong for Willis to try and think about putting permanent signs on this building. The Sears Tower always has been a public icon, and putting a sign on the building will make it less of a Landmark on the Chicago Skyline.

  It will always be the Sears Tower to me. I remember it being built.
Linda Kamp - Sunday, March 22nd, 2009 @ 8:46pm

  Visited Chicago many years ago for business. Took the opertunity to visit the Sears Tower. Awsome views. I was so impressed with the building and Chicago, I visited again with my wife. We took the opertunity to visit the building again, this time during the day. It has to be the most awe inspiring structure I have ever seen.

  Excellent symbol of the American Psyche of the 20th/21st century. The building emboddies our "bigger is better" mentality.  But aesthetically, a finesse is missing.  Again, this is very American..big, form n function.   That is what we Americans are about. This building shouts America! Feb 2, 2009

  This is building is awesome! It just looks "Proud". Very beautiful gothic feel to it. Love Chicago.

  I saw this building again, but this time, I was on the 8th Floor of Macy's State Street, where you can view the Christmas Tree in the Walnut Room, but  looking down at the rest of the tree. Which I did, but then I went to the part of Macy's where you can look SW upward from the window, and view Sears Tower. The antennas were beautifully lit Green on the East Antenna, and Red on the West Antenna, so I got a picture of it, and hope it turns out with the rest of my pictures.
Brent Kampert - Monday, December 15th, 2008 @ 7:12pm  
  Personally, I think this building is great. You doubters might think it is bad until you go to the skydeck and view the entire city. It is breathtaking.
Kyle McLure - Monday, November 3rd, 2008 @ 1:14pm  
  wow amazing building, have to see it, looks into the heveans. proud to share the name.
Tony Sears - Monday, October 27th, 2008 @ 9:49pm  
  Is amazing what men could do, with a few dollars and imagination. Im architect and this building represents a lot for me, I really love it as hancock and windy city too.Iwas in the skyline and the view from there is espectacular, you people of chicago must be proud of it
Leonard trimarco - Tuesday, October 7th, 2008 @ 8:08pm  
  Every time and angle I see this building, I think wow, how beautiful it is. I really like seeing it when I'm at the NE corner of Ohio and Dearborn, and 1/2 a mile east near the NE corner of Grand and St. Clair, it's just so tall, and cool.
Brent Kampert - Wednesday, June 25th, 2008 @ 8:13pm  
  This building is really interesting for me,and I wish Iran could build one of these buildings,I hope to visit it.

  It just takes your breath away !    The view from the observation deck will leave you with lots of info on Chicago as a whole.   Chicago would not be Chicago without the Sears Tower !   Karen
Karen VZ - Thursday, February 21st, 2008 @ 8:21pm  
  Was,is,and will always be the Mighty Giant of Chicago.A landmark that will stand the test of time.A Giant among Giants.I rest my case...

  IMHO, the sears is still one of the greatest towering superhighs in the world. Think about it, Burj Dubai, inspite of its wasteful towering height still will not compare to the Sears in Square footage. The Sears Tower was there for created for effeciency and economy. Seems to me that Burj was created to just say hey we have the tallest building in the world. We have yet to see if there is a market for all the ridiculous building going on over there. Here in America we build up because the demand for it becomes evident.
Victor Gonzalez - Thursday, January 24th, 2008 @ 1:22pm  
  I love how it looks different from almost every angle
jack mobley - Friday, August 24th, 2007 @ 11:16am  
  i have been inside Sears Tower, loved it, still looks modern and awesome. im sad its no longer worlds tallest building, but it sure has a place in my heart!

  Magnificent. Efficient. Broad-shouldered. The lobby renovation of the mid-1990s moved the tourists out of the main lobbies to the Jackson Street (south) side of the building, and it was a welcome change. I worked on the 74th floor of the tower for six years and it was a very pleasant building to work in.
richbh - Thursday, August 9th, 2007 @ 2:19am  
  SOM - what can I say. This building just screams masculinity in it's architecture! I love the simplicity of its looks and disign. The building looks like a city skyline within itself  . Beautiful building! I give the Sears Tower six stars.
Digital Junkie - Monday, July 23rd, 2007 @ 1:02am  
  Growing up in Chicago in the 1970s, I fell in love with the Sears Tower.  It came to symbolize everything that was Chicago.  It still does, and I still love it.  Now that I live away from the city, whenever I come to visit and see the Sears Tower again, it's like seeing an old friend.
David Shmuel - Sunday, July 22nd, 2007 @ 6:02pm  
  Ahhhh the Sears Tower one of the greatest towers ever built!!!! Bold and handsome this building makes chicago what it is!!! The building is a tube design of nine different segments (tubes) put together that gives the building its superior strength and sturdiness!!! The sears tower held the worlds tallest building title for nearly 30 years. thats, impressive besides its good looks and advanced arcitectual design of course.
Walter- CHI town - Wednesday, June 27th, 2007 @ 9:23pm  
  What a skyscraper should be. Strong, assymetrical, square-shouldered, and powerful. A brilliant and understated design.
Ben Miller - Wednesday, June 20th, 2007 @ 1:53pm  
  the design is minimal but stands out to the rest of the structure that surrounds it
dennis bosano - Saturday, February 3rd, 2007 @ 9:52am  
  This building is the best in the world. USA is the country that started it all and all of a sudden, foriegn countries decide to start building skyscrapers by cheating with un occcupyable (sp)spires. that is fony.
John - Monday, January 1st, 2007 @ 6:11pm  
  There is no art in it, It is just like a box of flip top cigars put on top of the other.....
shugo - Monday, November 27th, 2006 @ 12:35am  
  the building is nice. i live in iraq indarbnd city in kurdstan

  The grand daddy of them all.  Sears tower still reigns in Skyscraper history.
dave - Monday, October 23rd, 2006 @ 12:08pm  
  Sears Tower was the last supertall building constructed during the International architecture period, and SOM's interpretation of the style is remarkably bold and awe-inspiring. Sears Tower, alongside John Hancock Center and the Standard Oil Building, were the epitome of the Chicago skyscraper craze during the latter half of the 20th century -- a time when the Chicago economy was booming and tall buildings were a sign of commercial strength and success. Engineers sought different ways of emphasizing the city of "broad shoulders", and the desire for Chicagoans (esp. their businesses) to always be bigger, bolder, and better. Sears Tower is perfectly reminiscient of a thriving, innovative period in Chicago architectural history.
Randall Krause - Saturday, October 14th, 2006 @ 1:55am  
  Ahh the Sears Tower is amazing. One cant really get to know how HUGE this building is until they take a helicopter ride around it. not from the base oe even from the observation deck can one realize how huge and titanic this builing is!!
Kirby - Wednesday, July 5th, 2006 @ 11:31pm  
  Sears Tower is the greatest building ever built.  It is the world's tallest building, no questions asked. Taipei cheated their way to the top, and as far as I am concerned, Sears is the tallest. This building is my absolute favorite, and always will be. No one can ever beat its strength and beauty.
apollo - Saturday, April 1st, 2006 @ 10:16pm  
  Greatiest Building Ever
Casey - Wednesday, March 15th, 2006 @ 9:53pm  
  The Sears Tower is what Chicago is all about.  A strong building with bold shoulders.  People from outside Chicago do not understand.
Tony Contreras - Saturday, March 11th, 2006 @ 8:59am  
  breathtakingly tall. but it lacks originality. then again, it was way ahead of its time.
james jacob - Monday, March 6th, 2006 @ 12:04am  
  The building is iconic.  Muscular and no-nonsense -- perfect for this city.
Kevin - Tuesday, January 24th, 2006 @ 5:20pm  
  It looks like someone glued several buildings together. I think there is too much function and not enough form
kenneth Coleman - Saturday, October 8th, 2005 @ 11:48am  
  well first off us Illinoisans are proud that we have the tallest buiding in the US here...this is a very beautiful structure...and it stands out in the skyline all by itself... If you get the chance take the elevator ride to the top and see the fantastic view ...you have no idea of what youre missing until you do!!!
Linda Wines - Monday, August 29th, 2005 @ 2:25pm  
  its design is bulky but still it was a inovative design for its time, with the "tube construction" as already explained, one thing for sure the sears tower has been always the tallest building until taipei 101 surpassed it (in hieght of last occupational floor)if it was for total hieght with spire or antenna the late North Tower(World Trade Center) would have been the tallest building in the world at 1,701' Sears tower extended to   1,705' I rest my case.
Wilbert  NYC - Sunday, August 7th, 2005 @ 1:33am  
  Sure, it is tall, but i do feel its slightly misshapen, or put together wrong
GH - Monday, April 18th, 2005 @ 11:32pm  
  Makes a strong statement. Bulky, strong, a structure that does not seem to "put on airs."
