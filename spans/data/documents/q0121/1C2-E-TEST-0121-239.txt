Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower)
Chicago, Illinois
The design of the Willis Tower, formerly Sears Tower, was a major step towards exemplifying and defining the SOM way in which a building’s structure naturally informs its exterior profile and appearance. This axiom helps explain why SOM tower designs have continued to possess their distinctive feel and maintain the firm’s dominating presence in urban skylines around the world.
