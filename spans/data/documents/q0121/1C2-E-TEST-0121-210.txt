About Sears Homes: Between 1908-1940, Sears customers ordered about 75,000 houses out of the Sears Roebuck and Company mail-order catalogs. The houses were shipped by rail to city lots and farms all over the country.
Each "kit home" contained 30,000 pieces, including 750 pounds of nails and 27 gallons of paint and varnish. A 75-page instruction book showed home buyers, step by step, how to assemble those 30,000 pieces of house.
Only 10% (approximately) of the Sears homes in the country have been discovered.
Because of this, our communities best architectural treasures  our grand collection of Sears homes  are being damaged by remuddling and worse, demolished.
There is tremendous interest in this topic and hopefully, The Houses That Sears Built will spur that interest even further.
When you have finished reading The Houses That Sears Built you will be your communitys expert on Sears homes. Youll learn how to identify Sears homes from the inside, outside and from courthouse documents. Youll learn the interesting details of Sears homes construction. One chapter is devoted to the $1 million order of Sears homes that was shipped to Carlinville, Schoper and Wood River (Illinois).
Another chapter is devoted to "The Lost Sears Homes." These are Sears homes which appeared only once in obscure Sears Modern Homes catalogs and were not included in "Houses by Mail: A Guide To Houses from Sears, Roebuck and Company," by Katherine Cole Stevenson and H. Ward Jandl.
