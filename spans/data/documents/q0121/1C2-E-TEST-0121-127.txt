Sears Reports Out-Of-State Move Consideration for the Company
Long-time Chicago suburb resident, Sears Holdings Corporation, is reportedly considering relocation outside the state of Illinois. While your movers in Chicago here would be thrilled to provide any relocation services necessary for Sears to make the move, the state –and especially the local area of Chicago– stand to suffer negative effects should Sears’ decision to move out of Illinois become actual. Sears representative, Chris Brathwaite, has announced that discussions regarding the possible move have begun in Hoffman Estates, and that studies on possible impact the move would have on Chicago should Sears go forward have also begun. 
Sears Holdings Corporation has been a staple to the Chicago as well as the state of Illinois for a long time, and expresses gratitude for its shareholders and associates. All possible options are intended to be explored by Sears, the representatives of which have stated that no decisions have been made as of yet. The company intends to do right by its valued associates by exploring all options and outcomes to ensure the final decision is in the best interest of everybody involved. Furthermore; mayor William McLeod of Hoffman Estates has stated that he will do everything within his power to keep the multiple thousands of Sears jobs in his community should the move be made a reality.
