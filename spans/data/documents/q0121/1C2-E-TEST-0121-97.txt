Being the mother of three beautiful girls and having to work full time it was very difficult for me to even think about putting them into someone else's care. My first choice was not the right for my family, however choosing Mary Sears in Orland Park was. From the first time my husband and I took a walk through their school and met those whom made the place such a warm, yet outstanding child education and care center, we knew this was the place for us. Although somewhat reluctant due to our previous experience, Mary Sears, Orland Park proved to us we made the right decision this time around. Even though we drive from a distance to attend this center versus the one closer to our home, we could not imagine having been anywhere else. I am sure that any of the Mary Sears locations are just as great, but our family is VERY sad to say good bye at the end of next year to a great staff and childcare center. Trust me when I say, THEY ARE THE BEST and will be truly missed, yet remembered by our family! Thank you for all that you do everyday to make a difference in a child's life!

Mary Sears is a wonderfully caring, safe and nurturing facility that has definitely been an important part of the lives of my children. My 5 year old has been at Mary Sears for almost 3 years and has made friends of both staff and other students. My 2 year old has been there almost 1 year and has flourished into a wonderfully inquisitive little toddler. Both my husband and I have to work full time and it is comforting to know that I have left my girls in the loving and capable hands of Mary Sears and with so many other things in their lives to worry about   I m glad that childcare is not one of my concerns. I would recommend the facility to anyone asks and further appreciate all the support and empathy they facility provides my family

If you plan on putting your kids in a daycare, you can't nitpick. Overall, the school has lots of positive qualities. The facility is always clean and neat. The kindergarten teacher is highly qualified with an experienced background. My 5 year old child simply loves it there. He comes home everyday and tells me about all of the wonderful things that he learned and did. Sure, there are things that I think could be better (like the kids MUST eat oatmeal with their breakfast or that I MUST cut a check every week because that is the only payment option), but no place is perfect. My child is happy and I so I'm happy.

A staff meeting is mandotory about the correct way of speaking to parents during conference time this week.  What about the director's correct way of speaking to their staff?  Yelling and such is unprofessional and doesn't have to be tolerated.  Maybe staff should approach this matter to the director in a professional manner so it doesn't feel like that we are walking on egg shells all day.

Disagree with the posters...My son was very young when he went there, thus, day care wasn't a great option. But at the time, he was given lots of attention, a nickname (Super Baby) and often encouraged and always held when he needed it..  Don't put your kids in day care if you are going to nitpick, Mr. John and all the staff downtown were always great!

It is sad that parents do not know what a great program entails. Children have to do papers exactly the same. Creativity is not promoted or encouraged. The same songs are sung from ages 2-4 and for years. Every day is the same there are no new experiences. This is all very TRUE! there program needs some updating! Sad that parents are deceived!!
