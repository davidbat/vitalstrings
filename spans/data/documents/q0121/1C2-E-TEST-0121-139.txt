None of the 79 Sears and Kmart stores that Sears Holdings Corp. announced would close are in Illinois.
The Hoffman Estates-based retailer announced specific stores it would close on Thursday. Sears said earlier this week that it would close up to 120 stores nationally after poor holiday sales. Sears said Thursday's list may be updated.
The retailer had reached an agreement with Illinois officials to keep its headquarters in the state. Gov. Pat Quinn had said the store closings don't affect that agreement.
Quinn signed legislation guaranteeing the company $15 million in tax breaks. The company threatened to move its headquarters from Illinois before securing the tax incentives.
The tax breaks depend on the company's ability to maintain 4,250 jobs at the Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates.
