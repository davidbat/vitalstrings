Good Experience. I went there at the end of June, expecting only to have new tires put on.  They were having a competitive price sale and they were the cheapest around.  I knew there was a rattle going on in the front end area, and my car would shake sometimes, so I knew there was probably something else going on with it.  At any rate, I was trying to get the car set up for a trip to Michigan and back.  The guy was really helpful.  They inspected the car and found that the tie rod was so bad that it would break at any moment and he showed me how bad the rotors were worn down, as well.  He told me that it was so dangerous to drive the car even back to my house, because the tie rod could break so easily.  When we got back to the counter, he quoted me the price and I told him that it was too much.  I told him that I could handle about $100-150 less than what he was quoting me.  He made a phone call and somehow got the price down for me, to where I could handle it.  Honestly, I started off in a foul mood, because I didn't like the way the guy was looking at me, and I stayed pretty bitchy throughout the situation, nevertheless, he was super nice to me the entire time.  I will definitely take my car there again.â€¦
