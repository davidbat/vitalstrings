Here Today, Gone Tomorrow
Through my enduring investigation of the catalog homes in Park Ridge, Illinois, I have made a new friend, Gus Zahareas, who takes photographs of houses throughout the community before they are torn down. How neat!! Thank you for sharing Gus!
I am infinitely grateful for these vestiges that reveal only a few of the many long lost treasures of Park Ridge:
1028 Vine Ave.
1028 Vine Ave. (Harris Brother Co. Catalog Home)
