John Sears and wife Hannah [Johnson] Sears both died August 11, 1864. They were shot down in their home and killed  by the same bullet. The tombstone says they were killed by soldiers of the 111th regt, 111 vols. They were buried  on the farm - son Joseph in the same plot. Decendents say that the soldiers demanded horses, and some say that  they demanded money, and when John Sears refused, he was shot. When his wife tried to intervene she was behind  him and was killed by the same bullet. Francis Landers, a young girl who later married John Sears jr., was in the  house at the same time. After the incident, it is said that the soldiers sat down at the table and ate the food  that was being prepared for the Sears to eat. John Sears was also a southern sympathizer which might have contributed  to his death.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE :
"The soldiers of the 41st regiment who went into the disaffected vicinity last week, succeded in arresting  three of the parties implicated. They called upon the citizens for horses and saddles, as they came without these,  they came to the house of old Mr. Sears, father of the notorious "Tom Sears" in Fayette County, and requested  the use of a saddle, the old man replied by discharging his gun. In returning the fire, the old man was killed,  as also unfortunately was his wife who was at the house at the time. Although a sad affair, the conduct of the  soldiers in this matter according to the best accounts was not to be condemmed. Some excesses are reported to have  been committed by them in other respects, if so they should be dealt with promptly."
