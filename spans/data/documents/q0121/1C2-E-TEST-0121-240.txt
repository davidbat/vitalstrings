Statement of Significance (as of designation - June 2, 1978):
Constructed in 1905-06, this complex has been symbolic of the company's dominance of the mail order industry.  Founded in 1893, Sears, Roebuck and Company was the country's largest mail order concern by 1900.  The complex contains the printing plant that for many years produced the Sears Catalog, the company's principal selling instrument.
Condition:
Recent new construction at the landmark brings into question the historic integrity of the resource.
No new information has been received for 2006.
Recommendation/Change since last report:
Because of new construction, the complex should be reevaluated to determine if the remaining resource retains enough integrity to remain an NHL.
