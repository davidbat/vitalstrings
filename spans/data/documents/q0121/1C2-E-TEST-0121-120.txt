(Crain's) â€” Sears Holdings Corp. has identified more than half of the Kmart and Sears stores it plans to close in an effort to cut costs.
None of the 79 stores are in Illinois. Closing dates for the stores in 25 states, listed on Sears' website , have yet to be determined. Florida has the most, with 11 sites to go dark.
The Hoffman Estates-based retail chain announced Tuesday it plans to shutter up to 120 underperforming Sears and Kmart locations as it warned investors about weak fourth-quarter financial results. The company said earnings for the last three months of the year, typically the most profitable in the retail industry, would be less than half the profits of last year's fourth quarter due to lower sales and a non-cash charge of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, due to deferred tax assets.
Standard & Poor's placed Sears Holdings on a watch list for possible downgrade . The ratings agency believes that the store closings will not help improve the retailer's financial health.
